Junior,5,"I am sitting here typing in my pajamas with plenty of time left over for school work. what more would you ask for?

i also work full time, you can do this, i can do this."
Junior,5,Counselors are very easy and quick to respond. they actually offer guidance outside of TESU and inside.
Junior,5,"I am taking all of my classes online, and I highly recommend TESU for someone who wants to go the online route. They are quite flexible with degree planning, something was was every important to my life. Because their courses are spread out over three months, you can also balance how you many/few credits you want to take at a time. Also, the feedback from the professors are quite helpful!"
Alum,5,Online learning was much more rewarding than expected. There is a great deal of discipline required as well.
Alum,5,Thomas Edison State University is a great option if you are a working student. There is a great deal of flexibility regarding the course load and the professors are always very willing to help.
Alum,5,I enjoyed the online classes and felt that they were set up well. Blackboard was utilized efficiently and access to materials was easy.
Alum,5,"Great option if you need to get a degree online. Very pricey, though, and not always the easiest technology to work with."
Alum,5,"I was able to finish my degree online here, appreciated their flexibility and the way I was able to incorporate all of my previous learning, interests, and experience in my Capstone project."
Senior,5,"I really enjoyed the multitude of classes offered and the cheap tuition. The Moodle platform was very convenient and easy to use. I found the myEdison portal difficult to understand, though. I also appreciated the thoughtful comments of my teachers on my online class assignments. 
It was an excellent way to get a degree online. 
Thomas Edison was very flexible and helped me work through my international locations. They were helpful regarding timings and  due dates for assignments. Everything was always communicated clearly via e-mail or the portal. 
All requests and questions I had were promptly answered via Email. I also had a very good experience with their contact phone line. The policies were clear and fair. 
I feel that Thomas Edison gave me an excellent value for money for my degree and was helpful to me as an international student."
Senior,5,I like that this school is online based allowing time for people to deal with personal lives and have the ability to work full time. The professors for the nursing program are amazing and prepare students adequately for graduation.
Graduate Student,5,"Versatile programs. Most of their courses, even those that have laboratory, are online. Great for flexibility and people with other commitments such as a full-time job and family. It can be pricey though as extra costs such as laboratory and books are not readily disclosed."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love this university. It has allowed me to go back to school as an adult around a busy schedule. Also, the portal is easy to use and the instructors are very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"Great online program! Accommodates well for Active Duty Military!! Highly recommend anyone thinking about online classes, and/ or self paced study to attend this school. Counselors are very helpful making sure you make the best choices  possible when choosing your degree plan."
Senior,5,"I have deeply appreciated the very professional and business-minded instructing I have received at TESU. Without my degree I would not be able to have the understanding that I need to work in the communications field. The basic skills that I entered with have greatly multiplied and I have a longing to finally put those into use once I complete my schooling.

My aim is to impact the world in a great way and help others to scale to even greater heights than I will. Good communication skills can break many of the disconnects we have in American society, and help us understand each other better. I hope through my ability to communicate; others will be inspired to be open and transparent in their search for understanding those around them. My gratitude to those who will help me reach that ultimate goal cannot be expressed in words. Thomas Edison State University has helped me to fully commit and strive to reach my objective of bettering our world and helping other people."
Graduate Student,5,"The advisory staff at Thomas Edison is amazing.  Great student service.  They clearly operate with integrity, care and careful attention.  I felt at home immediately."
Alum,5,They were very flexible. I transferred in with outside credit hours and was distance learner student and I had no problems with either of these situations.
Senior,5,"I take all my courses online, so I cant truly tell how the campus is or the classes are.  With all my courses being online, I can say that everyone has been very helpful."
Senior,5,Everyone helps you along the way and tells you exactly what classes you need! Great transfer policy and amazing online platform.
Sophomore,5,"The staff is understanding, patient and kind and the program is excellent. The online student services are clear and helpful and easy to work with. Great College!"
Graduate Student,5,The staff at easy to work with. The classes s are very complex and the learning experiences in valuable. The blackboard is very user-friendly and easy to correspond
Niche User,5,Everyone has been very helpful as I begin my college studies at this university.  I am an adult student returning to college and I am doing this online/remotely.
Alum,5,"I really liked this school because they are flexible and allow a great number of transfer credits. Going from an Associates program to a Bachelor's, I found it hard to find a school that had options to fit all of the courses I already took into a specific degree plan. TESU did that!"
Niche User,5,They have been great to work with and are extremely understanding about being a full time employee while trying to earn a degree.
Alum,5,"I finished my B.S.B.A. and M.S.M. at Thomas Edison State University. Although, like other schools, occasionally you feel like a professor is phoning it in, this is NOT the case in general. I have had many professors who pushed hard and who were incredibly supportive of my goals and schedule..  My degree got me a job in the field and industry I was aiming for within 2 months of graduating. Everything I learned there I put to use every day in my profession. This is not a degree mill, this is a school that understands the needs of adult learners and is flexible enough to make it possible to succeed. (Even with a full time job and 3 kids)"
Sophomore,5,It's so nice to have a University that understands time constraints. I have the ability to take classes or study by myself on my own time and test out. I've contacted the help desk regarding several questions and they get back to you right away. I can't wait until I finally have a completed degree later this year!
Freshman,5,The staff are always willing to help in anyway possible. They always provide help as fast as they can and they are also very helpful with military students.
Graduate Student,5,TESU provided a great opportunity for me to work and receive life-changing credit that enabled me to complete my degree!!
Senior,5,"Semesters begin every month, so there is no wait to begin taking courses. The mentors I've encountered have been very pleasant to work with and are very considerate of the the fact that we are all adults and have lives and responsibilities outside of school. The classes are challenging and I feel I am getting every bit the amount of education as I would in a traditional university."
Alum,5,"Thomas Edison State University gave me the flexibility to customize my degree to exactly what I needed for grad school (I'm now enrolled in a MS program at UC Santa Cruz). What's more, their policy on CLEP, DSST,  and transfer credits allowed me to finish my BA in only two years. The courses I did take through TESU were only, fast-paced, and challenging, with an excellent comraderie among the other online students and a richness of depth in the topic taught by informative and friendly course mentors."
Alum,5,Thomas Edison State University helped me get my degree online in a timely manner and with low costs. I would highly recommend this University for people who are looking for an out of the box approach to getting a high quality education.
Sophomore,5,Supportive staff are available to assist you with any concerns you may have. They are truly invested in you successfully completing your degree. I highly recommend this university to anyone who is serious about higher education.
Alum,5,"I loved that I was able to complete all my coursework and requirements through distance correspondence. Additionally, as Thomas Edison doesn't have a limit on how many transfer credits they accept, I was able to complete all of my Gen Eds through CLEP and DSST testing. The lack of limit on transfer credits also allowed me to take a few courses through other colleges that were more specific to my interests and goals."
College Freshman,5,They give you numbers and websites that you can report to if you are having a problem on campus
College Freshman,5,"Its a great school, very productive! I would recommend a lot of students to attend!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"This college was a perfect fit for me, and it really put my mind at ease regarding a lot of the more messy college-related stressors. Thanks to TESC (now TESU), I was able to finish my degree without going into massive debt. As a NJ resident, I was also able to take classes in person either at Trenton or at the community colleges they partner with. This really gave a lot of flexibility as I was able to choose between online and in-person classes. Overall, I really think that this school is worth considering for anyone that's looking to save a few bucks while furthering their education."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors were the best!!! Most of the professors were full time teachers at other universities. My calculus teacher taught at Princeton, physics professor was from MIT. I had the wives of ambassadors and a dean from Rutgers. Their teachers were amazing! I felt privileged to learn from these professors."
College Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time at TESC and look forward to more classes.
College Junior,5,Already have a job right out of the gate.
College Junior,5,Thomas Edison State College is one of the best.
College Junior,5,I love my school. I love the flexibility and price.
College Senior,5,The school offers a non traditional route which is best for military students.
College Freshman,5,Ever class I have taken so far has been interesting and challenging. I have enjoyed every single one of my teachers.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Fantastic experience all around!  They truly understand the challenges of being an adult student, and I also feel like I received a great education!"
College Junior,5,"My School has been an awesome choice for my personality. It has been amazing to watch a staff who truly cares, and a group of people that earnestly want you to succeed!"
College Junior,5,If it wasn't for the convenience of the college offering online courses I would not have been able to fit college into my busy schedule.
College Sophomore,5,Very helpful in addressing my needs
College Sophomore,5,"Registration was easy, curriculum is easy to follow but requires a time investment, workload is average if you commit yourself and most of the professors are great, very helpful."
College Sophomore,5,Love the curriculum and professors
College Junior,5,Most students who meet the admissions requirements are admitted regardless of diversity orientation.
College Sophomore,5,So far I am very pleased with this institution.
College Junior,5,It's a great environment and the people are wonderful.
Recent Alumnus,5,Availability to work with students to provide varied opportunities for adults to complete their degree
Recent Alumnus,5,TESC is flexible and helpful in their ability to hep adults finish their degree.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Flexible, helpful. Dedicated to helping individuals realize their own potential"
College Senior,5,People of all back grounds
College Junior,5,What's better then no commute?
College Junior,5,Diversity in a college doesn't matter to me. I'm happy not having to deal with other people.
College Junior,5,I haven't had any problems with the school. Every potential problem I had was fixed immediately.
College Junior,5,I simply sent my tax information to the school and was accepted for Army Tuition Assistance and financial aid.
College Junior,5,I had no problem getting into my degree. The Army backed up my admission.
Junior,4,All of my classes were online. The online platform is very user friendly and the online support was always available for any issues.
Junior,4,The online learning environment fit into my busy schedule. The professors and advisors were always available for any questions or concerns and responded in a timely manner.
Junior,4,"I've enjoyed the feedback I receive from my professors. I think the classes they offer are excellent, as well as flexibility with their online program."
Senior,4,"Thomas Edison State University is great alternative way to get an education. Many people seek a university of college for the in person interaction with professors and other classmates. TESU is an online school that is also very affordable. Even though it is an online school, the school in general really cares about their students and making sure that graduate."
Senior,4,Working on my Bachelor's through online learning. The online courses are easy to navigate and teachers provide great feedback.
Junior,4,I love how flexible Thomas Edison is. All of the professors I have encountered have been responsive and knowledgeable. The staff at TESU has also been knowledgeable and informative and able to answer most of my questions.
Niche User,4,"TESU is extremely accommodating. They will take credits from many different organizations which is extraordinarily helpful when it comes to minimizing the necessary time for degree completion. They are easy to reach and talk to as well. I have found that the academic counselors are sometimes not fully informed and one must be very clear when asking their question. However, they will try their best to find the information you need. A degree through them can be done completely online - another plus when it comes to versatility."
Junior,4,"Very convenient  online classes, but speed of semester can catch up to you fast if you dont pace yourself. It can aslo be very hard to self teach yourself, which is what you end up doing."
Alum,4,"For busy adult students, TESU is the perfect fit. Adapting to an entirely-online education does take some getting used to, but the mentors and staff are all incredibly helpful--they WANT you to succeed. And the results speak for themselves! I transferred into TESU with a dismal GPA (<2.0, yikes) and graduated with a 3.5 and straight A's. No, TESU was not my first choice for my undergrad education, but I am so thrilled with my experience at this underrated little uni."
Senior,4,"TESU provides online classes that include an extensive writing component.  Each class that I have taken provides excellent resources to complete research papers in an APA format which properly prepares to write well thought out, research papers and essays.  The options to your CAPSTONE projects are helpful in order to put your best effort forward.  Communication from the University is excellent and updated frequently."
Senior,4,"You get decent return on investment from this college. If you are willing to work, it will work out for you. This college especially caters to non-traditional students and military members. The college has 12 week online semesters for undergraduate problems and offer new semesters for enrollment every month. Thomas Edison State University will accept virtually 100% of transferred credit, which makes it really easy for students that have past credits from CLEPS,DSST's, prior learning credit, military credits, past college credits, or the like. I highly recommend this college if you are serious about getting a regionally accredited college degree and have serious life/work obligations."
Junior,4,"The ability to set your own pace and study online has been a godsend while I've been working full time. The mentors convey that they're really there to help you succeed and many of them go beyond in order to make that happen. For an online college, everything feels very accessible."
Junior,4,"I've found the courses through TESU so far to be interesting and challenging, but not too stressful. The professors are positive and willing to work with you. The price of classes is high though, and there's an extra fee for paying with a credit/debit card. I wish there were more majors than what there are, and I wish they'd expand their classes to that there are more options."
Graduate Student,4,"I love the convenience of online schooling. It has been great for my busy life. As an online university, the school is a bit less involved in checking in on students to make sure they are taking the right courses and doing well with the technology and material."
Alum,4,Professors were friendly and accommodating. Could be more clear on assignment descriptions though. Overall great experience!
Freshman,4,"-The customer service and admissions office have been very helpful. They've responded quickly and clearly to all my questions and aided my transition into Thomas Edison. I am very pleased with the student support.
-The course materials and instructions have been good. 
-The main area of improvement that I would recommend would be the student website. Compared to previous course/student websites I have used this one is a little confusing and not designed as well. It's nothing that can't be learned with a little time, just not five star quality. 
-Overall, I am extremely pleased with Thomas Edison and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking into this type of college."
College Freshman,4,The degree is accepted worldwide and really gives me a strong basis so I feel confident going out to teach.
College Freshman,4,I really feel it's an amazing fit for me.
College Freshman,4,"They really make sure we're happy, healthy and safe."
College Freshman,4,I really feel the small town atmosphere and friendly and approachable staff really add to the experience. Whenever I have questions they are there to answer. I feel I''m really getting a comprehensive understanding of my topic.
College Senior,4,So far I really like my school. They've been very helpful.
College Senior,4,I am happy with my school.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The professors I had were amazing, coming from around the world and many Ivy League schools."
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small and the courses are on target with the objectives.  Professors here have been great!
College Sophomore,4,I don't visit the campus often but when I have safety had never been an issue.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at TESC is great!!! The mentors are very in tune with the students learning and success. I feel they are making every effort possible for us to be successful In the courses and gain useful knowledge."
College Senior,4,I do not live on campus so I  do not know. Thank you for awarding me this scholarship ;)
College Senior,4,I Have been very pleased. They provide me with a way to finish my education.
Recent Alumnus,4,"most students are already employees, but a higher degree always helps"
Recent Alumnus,4,solid school choice for busy adults
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the flexibility that TESC has to offer - both in terms of choices as well as correspondence courses.
College Freshman,4,They offer so many online degrees
College Junior,4,"I love it! It's really flexible with lots of options for extra courses outside the major. On the other hand, this may be a setback as the large number of general education courses could mean less development in one's specified field of study. There isn't any opportunity for internship credits (as far as I know). Workload varies depending on where one sources external credits from."
College Junior,4,"It wasn't difficult at all. I just needed to declare my major, get the academic advisor to list it in my degree plan, and soon I'll be working with an academic advisor to get all needed courses planned into the degree plan. In my opinion, the most important criteria was supplying a TOEFL score (for international students). Even then, I was accepted on special grounds before submitting my TOEFL results."
College Junior,4,I love it so much...
College Senior,4,It's a distance learning program!
College Junior,4,I didn't have a problem with financial aid at all. I got a hold of the office when I contacted them.
College Junior,4,Online courses tend to be demanding and I find that all of my professors that  i have encountered have been helpful and professional. Some have different expectations of the students than others but that comes with each persons different personality.
College Junior,4,Being an online student at TESC I have met people from all over the United States and with many different ethnical backgrounds and experiences.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Process was fairly smooth, but contacting Financial Aid at the school was a little difficult."
College Senior,2,they only offer it twice a year based on my observations
College Junior,2,"As far as I know, Thomas Edison does not require or even offer internships."
College Junior,2,There Is No Interraction – This is online school. I went down to the building once and had to park on a scary street and be buzzed in.
College Junior,2,"Too Much Computer and Not Enough Face – TESC is online academia. While the people you can speak to by phone are very nice, there is a heavy dependency on everything being online. However, seeing everything on their website is a full-time job unto itself. I find it overwhelming and a little indifferent to my face time needs."
Junior,1,It's primarily an online school for working adults. Some Professors are teaching as much as 8 classes meaning interaction with your Professors can be borderline impossible. I reached out to my Professor and called her over a week ago and I still haven't heard back from her let alone update my assignment for last week. I plan on transferring to a better school at the conclusion of this semester.

Junior,1,"Only plan on going here if you plan on clepping everything. The teachers are terrible. They do not read your homework and only mark it based on if they like you. I once got a semi good grade, when i should have gotten a zero.

They also make up bogus fees to keep you from graduating."
Junior,1,"The staff here was very rude and not helpful. I was cut off from everything immediately.  As of that day it was in the system that I had a ""past due"" balance of 2700.00 and had no access to my online student account, no access to advisors and no access to any guidance.    I understand that universities are out here just to take your money but if a student is actively seeking help, then help.  Don't turn them away and then state that you have an ""outstanding"" bill that just generated the same day.  Thomas Edison University is NOT geared toward the adult student and does NOT value their students. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"People don't know the school. I like most graduated with a liberal studies degree. Their career help consists of search engine similar to monster. I love the process of getting the education, however the guidance counsellors were horrific in advising. They constantly ask for money for grants, however I had to drop out one class short and re-register years later costing $3500 just so I could graduate. I took the last class I needed the an online testing center."
College Junior,1,I have tried for so many scholarships online and I'm just winning any.
College Senior,1,I am not happy at all but I want to just finish school and get my degree. 
College Senior,1,"Trenton has one of the highest murder rates in America, alongside Camden, Newark, Detroit and Miami. There is no atmosphere, everyone is afraid to go into Trenton at night. I have tried to start get togethers and clubs , but it is impossible since the students are from all over the country . There are no sports, so no opportunity for sports scholarships. I asked if the college could start internships, but was told that majority of the students are already working. Maybe what I am saying is that I regret wasting my money at this college."
Recent Alumnus,1,I went to the school to take an exam once and there was absolutely no place to park except on the street. Even then you can't be expected to pay the meter every 15minutes.
College Student,1,Lack of Sports – As far as I am aware there is not an athletis program affiliated with TESC

Sophomore,5,"In my one year at CalArts so far, I have been pushed in so many ways as an artist. I wanted to find a place where I would not only be encouraged to create art, but to use my voice as well. I came to CalArts to collaborate, and to use my art making as a vessel of change. I am a dance major, and I have been in such awe of the dance faculty. While it is a primarily westernized institution, I feel there is a level of diversity, and my education has included many conversations around this western education style, and where areas in my major specifically have been influenced by other cultures."
Niche User,5,It seems greats. I like art and art is pretty and i appreciate everyone who wants a career path in art.
Sophomore,5,"I would like to see a little bit better of improvements on student living conditions, some of the rooms aren't the prettiest and are quite uncomfortable. And maybe better food. But other than that this campus has been fantastic on everything else."
Freshman,5,The experience at CALARTS is the best experience I have been through and that it such a qualify way of telling everyone that this is the perfect spot for someone who loves video and to film stuff like how Tim Burton attended this college as well. Such a way of telling how this school was and can't wait to join it soon.
Niche User,5,Great place to achieve your goals and pursue your dreams! The professors are great and atmosphere overall is very friendly.
Niche User,5,"My strong attraction to CalArts came when I first visited the campus. Every aspect of the environment captivated me, especially the accepting and encouraging energy that every member of the community, staff and student alike, radiates. The focus on diversity and the versatility of their programs is very inspiring."
Freshman,5,"it is known for the best animations in television today. it has also inspired me to start animating at a young age. ive been drawing since I was 5 years old and ive always wanted for others than just myself, and that is what I think will happen with this school"
Freshman,5,So far I love it. The people are really nice here. The professors are exceptional and the facilities are well-kept and well-equipt to make art. The one thing I'd like to see change is maybe facilitating a tuition cap.
Graduate Student,5,Great artistic place. Full of art and culture. Very diverse. Great artistic place. Full of art and culture. Very diverse. Great artistic place. Full of art and culture.

Sophomore,5,"The whole atmosphere at this school is so encouraging and creative. I get inspired all the time by the fellows and teachers here. Tons of opportunities to show my artworks are offered. I can surely say that this is the most open place about races, gender identities, sexual orientations, and any other stuff in the world."
Freshman,5,"It is an amazing school for art students. As a musician, it has been an amazing experience so far and it proves every day to have the most amazing teachers and experience. The food could improve, though!"
Freshman,5,This college is a great outlet for young artists to grow and explore beyond their boundaries. With a credible faculty and a liberal environment each student is given the opportunity to express through art.
Freshman,5,"For my fist year, I really enjoyed the diversity of students from each department in collaborating works of art together."
College Sophomore,5,The professors that I spend the most time with are dance teachers being as though it is my major. I am so satisfied with the dance faculty at my school. They show a genuine interest in each student's artistic and emotional well-being. They are willing to answer any questions we have regarding dance and life and do all they can to help us grow.
College Sophomore,5,We have frequent meetings and discussions about different paths we can take regarding our career. The career services that we have on campus are extremely informative and take time to help us feel secure in our career choices.
College Sophomore,5,"As an artist, it can be difficult to find a place where you are completely accepted and understood. My school is just this. Each student is encouraged to explore their artistry while also being challenged intellectually.  Attending this school has  not only allowed me to grow as artist but also a critical thinker."
College Junior,5,I love my school. Elements of CalArts may be bumped and bruised but as a whole the community stands strong to together in supporting and fighting for each other.
College Junior,5,"My school provides an experience that is like no other, it feels like an escape from reality. Re-entering the common world is always an adjustment. My school is made up of unique individuals, who have immense respect for each other."
College Freshman,5,Our teachers are practicing artists in the fields we want to go into. There's no better way to learn than from someone themselves.
College Freshman,5,I am so happy I transferred. This is the place for me.
College Freshman,5,Amazing faculty. They're all very involved in their fields and well networked as well. Approachable and helpful.
College Freshman,5,Very helpful career services with resume/cover letters and with lining you up with potential employers.
College Freshman,5,"I could not imagine studying film elsewhere-- being surrounded by unique, likeminded, motivated individuals informs some of my best art work."
College Freshman,5,The administration here is great!
College Sophomore,5,"Dancing at CalArts is literally the best decision I have ever made. Yes, I have been dancing my entire life, but the faculty have so much to offer. In the past year I have learned so incredibly much, I can't complain."
College Sophomore,5,"CalArts is a perfect match for me! It is everything I imagined and more. The passion and drive all of the students have is amazing. Unlike high school, I want to get up and go to class every morning. I love being able to do what I love 24/7. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else!"
College Sophomore,5,"One of the best things that I like about my school, is the fact that almost all of my classes are centered around my major, making me actually want to learn and grow about what I am learning."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is really really well accepted. People care about their work too much, its all about the work so acceptance is not an issue. Just work hard and you will be accepted."
College Sophomore,5,We don;t have sorority's or frat houses!!!
College Sophomore,5,"I love my program. Lots of super talented people in the Acting program. It's unique because we use the Modular theatre and collaborate with other majors.. ie: Directing, Scenic design, lighting and Costumes. Workload is heavy but it's an MFA so it is to be accepted, just make sure you continue to do your work daily you won't fall behind. They have an awesome CAP program that allows you to teach at schools.. pretty awesome."
College Sophomore,5,"It's so artistic, there is art everywhere!!! Has an Incredible  theatre (modular theatre; only 3 in the world),  the wild beast, incredible concerts,amazing animation department and awesome free dance classes. Teachers are wonderful and so is financial aid. The campus is also so beautiful and everyone is pretty supportive."
College Junior,5,"My program is great. One of the best in the world. I wouldn't do it again, but only because I'm focused on my career- outside of school. I have no concerns about finding a job, I've been working on break and everyone seems eager to work with graduates (and current students) of CalARTS. We have the skills and confidence to deliver, and groom ideas the industry respects."
College Freshman,5,"The academics are really interesting, they relate topics to  the real world. Always somehow connected to air."
College Freshman,5,Always nice and sunny outside!
College Freshman,5,the animation program is amazing
College Freshman,5,It's a small school so there is almost always parking on campus. 
College Freshman,5,The sun gives me so much energy and I love being able to dress how I want. The gorgeous weather makes my college experience so much more beautiful. 
College Sophomore,5,Lots of variety in the Critical Studies programs.
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a Costume Design student- our program is phenomenal! Our instructors are some of the best in the nation and we have an enormous studio work space, all the tools we need! Great contacts and job opportunities being so close to LA."
College Sophomore,5,Best decision I've ever make. It's superb.
College Sophomore,5,CalARTS is super supportive and help as much as possible.
College Sophomore,5,It's a small school so creative relationships are much easier to form. And the talent here is amazing!!
College Junior,5,Best school ever! Transferred here from another school and it is the best decision I ever made. Some come back here for their MFA
College Junior,5,Right next to Six Flags!
College Junior,5,Internships are easy to get because of the school's name in the outside world. Very easy to find a job that you love doing.
College Junior,5,I love it. It allows me to practice my skills every day and collaborate with other artists to create amazing work.
College Junior,5,"Sunny almost every day! A beautiful place to be, sometimes hot."
College Junior,5,A lot of parking on campus and it's free! 
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone has a view point here! Everyone is an artist, so their styles reflect that! Guitars on campus, dancers in workout styles, costume designers... with flair, and the list goes on. Great colors and animation on this campus, which is super inspiring!!"
College Freshman,5,"CalArts faculty pushes their students to think freely and express themselves no matter what their beliefs are. Therefore, this school deserves an A+, because they do not attempt to censor or restrict their students minds and allow them to create meaningful art that comes from their soul."
College Freshman,5,"The overall local atmosphere is fairly suburban, however there are plenty of great shops around campus. Plenty of fast food/sit in restaurants are within walking distance so no huge need for a car. Six Flags is about two miles from campus! Some great food markets are open near campus during summer. CalArts is lodged on a hill so there are some great views when looking down the hill on campus. Very serene."
College Freshman,5,"I feel so lucky and happy here as a Character Animation Student. I want to be an animator and you start this instantly here! I have I honestly do not have many concerns with finding a job especially in the animation field, the only thing is it becomes super competitive with so many talented students here at the same time at the same school. But it's so inspiring to be working around such talented people and definitely a motivator. Many animation Studios respect animation students applying for jobs and coming from CalArts cause they know how emotionally laborious and rigorous the Character Animation Program is. Especially when most of the people hiring are CalArts alumni."
College Freshman,5,"As an art school, not many students interests scream sports, which is fine. Although we do not have a leading mascot or sports teams at CalArts, students have willingly created sports clubs for people with interest of playing just for good fun on the sides of their studies as we do get fairly busy here cause we're here to learn. I find this more enjoyable that people can concentrate on studies, rather than get caught up in sports teams and creating rivalries with other schools."
College Sophomore,5,"Parking is free, and even during peak times, you can always find a spot, though you might have to walk a bit."
College Freshman,5,"My major is Graphic Design. The teachers here are all very talented and have a name in the design industry. They are very encouraging and helpful too. The class size is a little bit large for a design class (we have 18 students in our class), so we did have to extend another hour of class. Each of us get to have our own studio/workspace that we can decorate and do what ever we want with it. We have access to it 24/7. The workload is heavy. Time management is extremely important. I haven't heard too much about internship/job opportunities because you have to find them yourself. This school really requires you to be independent."
College Freshman,5,"I'm in the Graphic Design program at CalArts. It's pretty amazing so far. All the classes I took this first semester have taught me so much about design. The teachers are really helpful and really try to encourage you as a designer. The critiques are crazy long, but they help you improve talking to other people about your design and other people's designs. The workload is extremely big, but it's all worth it in the end."
College Freshman,5,"We love our diversity at CalArts! You meet many people of different ethnicities and cultural/economic backgrounds. As an art school, everyone is very accepting of all beliefs."
College Freshman,5,"If you want to do drugs, they're available. I give this category an A+ because while recreational drug use is common on campus, there is absolutely no peer pressure whatsoever. You're free to join in or just sit and talk. No pressure."
College Sophomore,5,"Valencia California deserves an A+ for their weather because it is sunny mostly all the time. There is an occasional rainy spell however, I can count the rainy days on one hand. The skies are mostly clear, and even on the most gray of days, the sun always manages to shine through."
College Sophomore,5,"Nowhere Better Than Southern California – Sunny and warm 75% of the time. When it rains, it's a pretty change and sweater weather is unavoidable during the winter months, but lounging by the pool is definitely an added perk to coming here."
Sophomore,4,"In the last months of school, we had to take to learning online via zoom. My faculty at CalArts did a wonderful job executing this process, making online learning as accessible, and maintainable as possible."
Sophomore,4,"I loved how collaboration between different art forms was cultivated, as well as the fantastic faculty members who have taught me a lot. However, the administration can be a little disoriented sometimes, which causes problems when dealing with a school full of artists."
Sophomore,4,"The school is not a technical school but rather work on the ideas or message you are trying to deliver. Another major issue my peers and I have specifically in the photo program is they do not supply students with any material such as digital or photo paper, film, hard drives,  or chemicals so the student would have to buy these for themselves which would be a recurring issue throughout the school. You will be continuously be expected to pay or buy services although the tuition is expensive none of it seems to be for the students but rather for the pay of the faculty as you would have to pay $50 each year to access certain areas in the school which could total up to an additional $200. The one absolute positive about this school is the faculty and certain students as they are vibrant, helpful, kind, and smart as I am inspired by each person and drive me to improve myself."
Sophomore,4,"Some of the best faculty, and talent in the world. The opportunities are endless, as every teacher is currently a working artist in the industry giving us intense, and rigorous training of our craft. I am forever grateful for their dedication and hard work. However, the tuition price is absolutely ridiculous. Nobody has $50,000 a year. This in itself should be an outrage. I should not have to pay this much for a strong education in order to succeed. They need to financially offer more to their students. California Institute of the Arts is nothing without their students."
Sophomore,4,"The school is excellent! My major is involved in the Herb Albert School of Music which in itself is very open to any style of music, has several performance opportunities, and teaches valuable information that the modern-day musician needs to be able to take on a number of careers and music degree can give. The school as a whole has an incredible, stress- free environment that is constantly inspiring students to step outside of the box and be as creative as possible. The school even has it's own cute coffee shop and a huge cafeteria full of gourmet food and options for every kind of diet. The dorms are on campus making it super easy to get to class and it also has it's own little cafe/game room, spacious rooms, a pool, a gym, and even a sauna. The only issue with the school is the handicap accessibility and the tuition in which there is funding help from the school, but no full ride options."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at CalArts has been pleasant. I love the small campus, you really get to know your classmates. the class sizes are also smaller so the teachers are able to take a more personal interest in your development. The class that I find the hardest is ""Skills."""
Niche User,4,It is a college I would like to attend to. I would want to become a graphic designer and photographer and study the fashion of both majors.
Sophomore,4,"Film/Video is the best school and has the sanest people. I only recommend going for School of F/V. People from dance, music, and theater are scary and on drugs. The administration and distrubution of funds has a lot to improve on. Dorm facilities are outdated. The dorm plumbing is terrible and unsanitary. The campus is unsafe and has had multiple shooting threats. It really is the students keeping the school alive and functioning. The community is great, aside from the heavy drug and drinking culture."
Freshman,4,"The best part of being a student at California Institute of the Arts is that you are free to express anything you want, including going to class naked. You have the right for almost anything, the school is full of creativity. There are rarely any wrong answers. Mainly of the people are open minded, free to be who you truly are. Very accepting people all around. The professors are kind, you could speak to them about anything and will be helpful. It doesn't feel anything like High School, to me attending Calarts has given me a lot of freedom to do what I wish with my personal life and my practice. You may take any class you are interested in even if it is not your major. The only thing wrong about this school is that, it is not a diverse school. Thursday nights, which is gallery night is typically party time."
Junior,4,CalArts has been a great place to develop my artistic skills. I like that this school encompasses all major areas of art under one roof giving you the opportunity to cross-pollinate with and take classes in other disciplines.
Freshman,4,I would like to see more effort put in from the academic teachers. Most of the teachers here are artists themselves and they don't know how to approach a topic to a group of students.
Sophomore,4,"CalArts is a welcoming and empowering environment for aspiring artists. They make sure that the students have the tools that they need to create and collaborate with other artists. They have students coming from all over the world---a great way to connect with people coming from different backgrounds and culture. Furthermore, CalArts provides the students with the knowledge that they need to succeed in their chosen metier. However, they do lack in traditional academic classes so the option to have an academic minor is quite limited. Other than that, I think CalArts is a wonderful place for artists like me to grow and learn."
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes are small, meaning a more intimate connection is brought inside the class. The teachers are engaging and the teaching styles vary, but all the material is learned."
College Freshman,4,"There are many job offerings on campus, whether it is or is not for work study."
College Freshman,4,There have not been any major issues that campus security has had to deal with.
College Freshman,4,"Every student that I have met is insanely talented in their metier.The energy is always positive because everyone is loving and accepting. It seems as if time moves slower here, maybe because there's always so much going on."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone here is passionate, liberal and open-minded. Sometimes you'll come across snobs but that goes for basically anywhere in the world. This school is all about challenging the norm and it's awesome, but you won't get the typical college experience here."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus has been a convenience. Having my dorm room not far from my classes is so helpful. With my busy schedule, it is nice that getting to class from the dorms only takes a few minutes."
College Junior,4,"Our security isn't overbearing on us as students, however, they take our safety as a community very seriously against outside influences."
College Freshman,4,"It's improved since people have stepped forward as victims of assault. As well, there are always security on campus that are reachable at all hours."
College Freshman,4,"Alumni always offer students opportunities. As well, LA has plenty of opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"It's great because of how much space the dorms allow. It could be updated and a bit cleaner, but overall it's nice."
College Freshman,4,"People from all over the world, a variety of sexual orientations, genders, religions, economic backgrounds. It's a melting pot."
College Freshman,4,"Mainly Marijuana, not very strictly enforced. Nobody pressures you to do anything you're not comfortable with"
College Freshman,4,"Very spacious rooms, friendly and helpful RAs"
College Senior,4,The school itself is great. I've grown and expanded my creative abilities BUT the cost of tuition is a bit ridiculous for the lack of certain classes it doesn't offer artists.
College Sophomore,4,They're fairly lenient but not in a way that is problematic.
College Freshman,4,Its fun to experience art is a party related a atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,I have no complaints about the off-campus dining. There are a number of restaurants around CalArts. Each one just as good as the rest.
College Sophomore,4,"All of the academics at CalArts are pretty much down right amazing. All of the professors have been working in their area of expertise for quite some time. They are all passionate about being there and teaching what they love. The workload is enough and can be extensive, but it's never enough to set me over the edge."
College Sophomore,4,"The security on campus is pretty good. Sometimes I would like to have an emergency phone on the way back to the dorms or something in case something were to happen, but other than that I feel pretty safe!"
College Sophomore,4,"Off-campus housing is a big part of CalArts. Many of the students live off campus. Going into my sophomore year, I will be leaving off-campus in an apartment complex right across the street. Apartments vary in price and size, but almost all of them have a fair amount of parking, space, and reliable security."
College Sophomore,4,"One of the things that definitely sets this school apart from others in the uniqueness and diversity of the campus. It almost seems that everyone when all together enjoy everyone else. I have had very few problems with people over the past year. Another unique thing about CalArts' campus life would be the huge parties that they throw. Since it is an art school, they have the best of the best on set up and crew leaving the rest of the campus in awe."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus has a really great atmosphere that not only is very welcoming, but it strict as well. As far as classes go, we are only allowed to miss 3-4 of each class per semester. Being a dancer that is hard because of all of the intense technique classes, but it is totally worth it because CalArts is making sure we get the best of the best."
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, if you tell them what you need they will do their best and usually come through. I got a pretty sweet scholarship and grant this year."
College Sophomore,4,It's very liberal. They are really good and lenient but only if it is safe and won't hurt anyone!
College Sophomore,4,"I cant really afford to eat at school, but let me tell you.. the food is awesome. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options so it makes me really happy, and its really good too. There is one cafeteria and a cafe. So lots to chose from!"
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is so unique. Many people don't party because everyone is pretty focused. Everyone dresses pretty well and has a unique style, not necessarily name brands but interesting and cool outfits which is better! I have been in a relationship for a while, so i am not sure about dating.. but I have made many friends!"
College Sophomore,4,"I didn't encounter any issues getting in. I had auditioned for 3 other schools and got a callback for one and got accepted right away into calarts. The reason i think i got accepted here was because they made me feel super comfortable in the audition room. I felt very intimidated when I auditioned at the other schools, but CalArts made me feel like a student already. it was awesome!"
College Sophomore,4,The nurse is very sweet from what i hear!
College Junior,4,"You have to have some talent, you're up against some of the most impressionable artists in the world. There's a lot of i's to dot and t's to cross but you're going to get that anywhere there is a through process for talented applicants."
College Junior,4,"Our campus is super diverse. Also sort of like the land of misfits, but everyone fits."
College Junior,4,We have campus security that's always around on campus. It's safe to walk around by yourself. I always feel safe and comfortable.
College Junior,4,You don't have to pay to park your car.
College Freshman,4,"To get the financial aid you need, be vocal with your adviser and the financial aid office. If they know your name/face and your need, they're more likely to help. I was a 4.0 student with a good SAT score, so I got a big academic scholarship. In addition, I got a talent-based scholarship for my music major, because I fought for it and spoke up that I needed it. When I lost my California state awarded scholarship (because I no longer qualified), the financial aid office was able to award me another grant to cover that loss. As long as you speak up about your need, people will help you."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone uses it safely , no pressure"
College Freshman,4,Wild beast outdoor concert venue is great. Dance studios are  open and spacious with natural light
College Freshman,4,Its great  when talking about beliefs
College Freshman,4,Daily technique classes are great. The teachers actually really  care about students. Lots of opportunity to perform and create your own work .
College Sophomore,4,Lots of shopping centers. Campus is also beside Six Flags!
College Sophomore,4,"Most people live off-campus. I do, but not in Valencia- though I've considered moving closer. I live in LA and the commute is only 30 mins and I love my neighborhood so it works for me!"
College Sophomore,4,"I use my own computer- but if I needed one, I can use one in the Library or my Costume Design Lab, or a few other computer labs on campus. So they are available if needed. "
College Sophomore,4,I don't do drugs- anymore- so I don't know what goes on.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't really experienced being told I couldn't do something- But then again most people seem pretty honorable at the school- and its an Art school so we are encouraged to 'find our own path'.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is small but there are fun places to hang- and if you're outside the view is stunning!
College Freshman,4,"It's nice being an acting major, although you can't audition your first year. There are many opportunities and you can create your own curriculum."
College Freshman,4,Different gen ed classes and many teachers who are still working in the business.
College Freshman,4,Campus Safety is super helpful
College Freshman,4,"Lots of parties (Halloween party, drag ball, etc), groups, events."
College Freshman,4,"The building is a little old, but facilities are pretty good."
Sophomore,2,"A lot of classes didn't translate well, and even those that did were still a little more exhausting than usual. Classes in lighting design, for example, resorted to looking up pictures of lighting angles for homework, rather than creating these angles in a project-based setting."
Alum,2,"I can't recommend the graduate program in Art. Unbelievably shabby and out of date facilities, lacking in the most basic of requirements for a contemporary practice. No surprise that the 'post-studio' approach is what's being pushed, then. The Broad studios ARE sexy in that down-at-the-mouth clearance-rack modernism kind of way, if a bit prone to being water-logged in the winter and working solar ovens in the summer.If you're in Photo/Media you have aluminum cow sheds plopped on a parking lot to look forward to.Faculty in the Art school are mostly checked-out; there is little community feeling besides the transactional niceties and scratch-my-back groupie-formations. Lots of old white dudes too, if you're into that sort of thing.The program hasn't produced anyone or thing of interest for about a decade. This might be because there is no structure, or even a guiding idea,& an apparently constant crisis in performing even the most basic of administrative procedures to operate it."
College Sophomore,2,"It's just really bland. Mostly chains and nothing within a mile, so you basically need a car."
College Sophomore,2,"There simply isn't enough scholarship for the students. Besides that, the tuition goes up considerably every year."
College Sophomore,2,"I have food sensitivities, and the food doesn't just taste bad, but makes me sick no matter what I get. The staff isn't helpful in finding things that are safe for me, and this is why I live off campus, and I bring food with me everyday. I buy one or two packaged things at Tatum, but they are often out of the foods I can eat. The labeling of ingredients is incredibly poor."
College Freshman,2,It really complicated to receive financial aid in my experience I think the process needs to be simplified.
College Freshman,2,Valencia is a very small suburban town and only has chain restaurants
College Senior,2,There aren't really athletics here...most of the extracurriculars are artsy.
College Senior,2,Calarts is in the middle of nowhere. You don't go here for the food and fun of Valencia!
College Senior,2,"There are too few scholarships available - I desperately wish I could apply for more merit based ones at least. Even the financial aid just doesn't cut it. I suppose it's not necessarily the school's fault; maybe people just aren't interested in funding the arts as much as I wish they were. If I've just been missing out on a gold mine of scholarships, I would greatly welcome a response. I hope I'm wrong."
College Junior,2,"If you want it, you can probably find it. I suggest focusing on your studies."
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a city atmosphere in high school, for me, personally. Valencia California is actually one of the most boring places I have ever been to, however, it isn't a place that deserves the lowest grade because it is also a beautiful area for hiking, and small town activities. From the Calarts campus there is a beautiful view of some mountains that are always covered with fog and it always reminds me to take a breath of fresh air.  Taking walks around the Calarts campus is probably the only excitement I get occasionally. With ones busy schedule that any student is pushed into at Calarts there really isn't time to go out and explore recreational activities."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Best, Not the Worst – The dorms set up weekly shuttles to go to supermarkets and during holiday time they have airport shuttles. There is a train station 5 miles away and with some connections you could make it to LA using that."
College Senior,2,"Not Much to Offer – The school has a main cafeteria with some good options, and then a coffee house. It seems most students eat off campus."
College Senior,2,"Scrumptious Conundrums – While CalArts dining makes an effort to utilize local and organic ingredients to create yummy dishes, the variety, quality and nutritional value of the food are questionable.  But most questionable is how the dining actually works.  The Caf has completely inflexible hours, and the employees will not negotiate or even speak with the students for fear or losing their jobs.  The financial value of the meal plans make no sense at all."
College Senior,2,"Our financial aid department tries to be helpful, but when your college uses its budget irresponsibly in an already volatile economy, it's difficult to get any real results.  However, CalArts really cares about its students, and does what it can to grant us the aid that we need.  It makes a dent!"
College Freshman,2,Marijuana is very popular and so is alcohol. But in my experience it doesn't seem to be overly excessive on either end. I haven't been to any crazy parties where people got alcohol poisoning from doing too many shots of hard alcohol or seen much hard drug use. People openly drink beer and wine and smoke marijuana but not to an excessive or dangerous state.

People openly drink beer and wine and smoke marijuana but not to an excessive or dangerous state.
College Student,2,On Campus – why cost more if you just wanna live really close? its already crazy how much you go to the college for.
College Junior,2,"most nightlife establishments are in the los angeles areas (hollywood, downtown LA, etc.) being that our school is in valencia we are easily at LEAST 25 minutes from any nightlife activities. best bets are house parties and or school thrown events."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't even have a mascot. If you're super into athletics this is not the school for you. We have one tiny soccer club that less than twenty people are probably in and that's about it for sports, unless you count Yoga and Tai Chi classes."
College Freshman,1,"It's an arts college. Therefore, sports are not a priority."
College Freshman,1,It is seriously so horrible. Sometimes my dinner will not even be cooked properly. Everything at the grill is greasy and sometimes I just need to get off campus to eat some real food.
College Freshman,1,"Horrible food, cafe closes very early and you need to purchase a meal plan your first year"
College Junior,1,Limited sports on campus. Most are student groups for fun. 
College Freshman,1,"There are no public scholarships. Each department has money set aside from private donations that they dole out to deserving students, but there isn't a whole lot. You really have to bug them for money."
College Junior,1,"Unfortunately the academic classes at Cal Arts are, without a doubt, a huge waste of time and money. Sure, there are fun classes  and certainly some interesting ones (Want to study comic book writing in depth? How about writing for pornography?

Sophomore,5,"Campus is being upgraded a large amount so I think D- is a little harsh. They are building a completely new athletic facility, building new learning buildings, and potentially building a brand new dorm They just also had a merger with another college in Manchester. The food is ok but its what you would expect from a college overall. The cafes on campus are very good and not too pricy especially if you get the $300 flex cash plan. Athletics are very average in my opinion but then again they are building a new facility so i wouldn't be so worried about it. Campus safety isn't too strict but I do feel very safe on campus even when it is dark out. The acceptance rate isn't right either ive had a few friends in certain circumstances get denied but it also isn't very hard to get accepted. Professors are very good and actually act like they care about the students. Party scene is  ok you just gotta know the right people but if you dont then dont expect too much."

Sophomore,5,The classes are small making it easy to have deep conversations. It is also a very welcoming environment.
Junior,5,The teachers were helpful and understanding especially with those who didn’t have any sort of technology. They made it work with those who didn’t have much and were very lenient especially during this pandemic
Sophomore,5,"New england college is a small private school loctated in Henniker new hampshine, and have one on one help for all students and great sport programs. New England college is a Division three school and their women and men basketball team has won two times in a row for state championship."
Freshman,5,"I am currently enrolled in New England College online. They offer a BA in Criminal Justice, of which i considered on taking. This is a great opportunity for me to study in this field fully online and at my own pace throughout the week. As technology advances, there are now new ways to learn and earn degrees. I personally think who ever invented online school is a smart person and would be of great benefit towards busy students."
Senior,5,"Great Distant Learning Experience!  I left another school because the Professors were using other templated classes to 'teach'.  At New England College, each Professor acts as a teacher and teachers and provides assistance almost immediately (usually within 24 hours), and they GENUINELY care about your success, not just making it to the end of 7 weeks and a paycheck.  Love the school -- GO PILGRIMS!!"
Sophomore,5,My experience at New England college was really life changing.  The professor really care to work with each and every student and help us strive for greater.
Sophomore,5,"NEC is school with no outside distractions. You can really focus on your academics, sports, clubs, even yourself. It may be in the middle of nowhere but the beauty of it."
Niche User,5,"There are over four thousand colleges in the United States and how do students define which colleges suit them the best? Students are facing one of the most significant decisions in their student career, choosing which college to attend, has impact to students' future life after college. For most people, considering in society realistic, the reason of attending college is to get good paying jobs, since employers are looking for useful employees with strong abilitiy and high intelligent, the easiest and most efficient way to find the employees they need, is looking which college applicants attend. In order to be the ideal college that catches employers' attention, what are the element that structure the ideal college? Ideal colleges should comprise four major factors, strong networking, good reputation, quality learning resource and affordability. That's why I choose the New England Cllege,"
Niche User,5,I am having an excellent learning experience with New England College. I attend their online courses and I am very pleased. The instructors are very professional and the courses are designed to help you understand your field of study. The cost is inexpensive and the learning environment is very rewarding. The participants are helpful and it brings a traditional learning environment to the online classes. Diverse and enrichening.
Freshman,5,My school is very diverse and has a lot of campus activities that make people at me away from home feel like I am at home. New England College provides its students with the perfect kind of guidance every students needs.
Senior,5,I am an online learner and the experience has been great. The advisors are very knowledgeable and helpful. They stay with you during your entire educational journey. The professors are also knowledgeable and available to answer questions.
Freshman,5,The mentoring program provides additional support for students. This program is great for incoming freshmans transitioning from HS to college! Stay tune for suggested changes. Don’t have any at the moment.
Senior,5,My experience at New England has been wonderful. The Professor's are very helpful and so is the student advisors. I would recommend this school to anyone.The advisors stay in constant contact to make sure your learning experience is going the way you want. If you call and they don't answer they return all phone calls in a timely manner.
Sophomore,5,"What do I like about New England College? I like how the tutors are willing to help students out with their homework. There are tutors for every subject so you won't have to worry about that. What would I like to see New England College change? Acceptance Rate. I like how this school believes in giving people a second chance but some students do not deserve to be here? What do I mean about that? Most students are only here for the party scene with that being said, those students will not care about tjeir grades and the list goes on. There are 32 people in my psychology class and I remember only 10 people showed up. It got so bad to the point where my professor would just stop taking attendance, that is pretty sad if you think about it so I would definitely change the acceptance rate at New England College but other than that the work is pretty easy and I am doing just fine here!!!!"
Freshman,5,its a really small community based school that offers amazing opourtunities for the students and the surrounding community.
Freshman,5,New England College is great school for lots of help for resources and other activities. Everyone around helps you with everything you need. There’s no where you look and you can’t get help from anyone
Freshman,5,I would recommend this college to someone who is looking for an education but want a personable atmosphere and small college life. It is 245 for our drive. Close enough but yet far enough to get that college experience. Their athletic department is fabulous coaches work with the students to maintain what they need to stay on track and be apart of a great team as well. I am glad I picked this college gives me a sense of independence as well.
Freshman,5,"New England College is a wonderful school. The staff and Professors are all amazing. They are very nice and super helpful in giving insight to the students. The local area is beautiful. It's right in northern New Hampshire so every season is a sight to see. The only con is that tuition is super high here, not really sure why for such a small school with not many majors to offer."
Senior,5,This college has been a wonderful experience. I have been in other schools that didn't care about the students just the money. If your looking for a great school this is one of the best ones.
Freshman,5,So far so good! I am taking online courses and I really enjoy the curriculums that nec offers. The advisors are helpful and teachers are great! They use bisk which is a great online source.
Senior,5,"There is a small hill in Henniker, NH that posesses a house full of 5 men who throw the best parties ever. These parties express all sorts of races and deny no one. They welcome everyone with open arms and really show people what a good time is."
Sophomore,5,"New  England College  is  a very good  college to  attend , the   teachers and  staff  are very helpful  and  the students  are  friendly  , everyone gets along . I  like the school  because  the course  I was looking  for  was offered  here ,  it's  not  a  big  school   and  everything  is  within   walking  distance  ."
College Senior,5,"This school is the best online experience and I have had three with bad experiences. New England College has good customer service, there is no long wait on the phone for any problem or service that is needed. There is 24 hour tech support that is available for support and there is no wait for a return call. Overall a great school."
College Senior,5,"I take classes online for an MBA. So far, the experience has been great and very manageable."
Recent Alumnus,5,I haven't been in class yet
College Freshman,5,there needs to be rennovations
College Junior,5,"Like I said earlier, academics is the best part of NEC"
College Junior,5,Campus Safety gets it. They don't try to ruin people's live for having normal experiences. They are concerned about people's safety and welfare.
College Junior,5,Professors are tough but fair. They will work with you. The best part about NEC is its faculty.
College Junior,5,"I'm a political science major and came to NEC because they have an active polisci department. The professors care about their students and mix real world experiences and activities together in the classroom. They are also very active professionally often being quoted in the media. Also, we have he opportunity to host candidates for President, Governor, Senate and Congress."
College Sophomore,5,"New England College is a really good college to attend. Its small which makes things, in my opinion, a bit more easier because its an easy way to find where all of the classes are and also, it makes building relationships easier."
College Sophomore,5,"I work at an elementary school nearby for Work Study. They are really flexible with my schedule and I can also just show up whenever to say hi. It's really easy to find an internship, and Eugene Durkhee is easy to work with and will find you the perfect one. I'm sure local businesses/organizations are looking for internships for credit too. I make $8.25 for my work study job. I think most on-campus positions are $7.25 so highly recommend co-ordinating an off-campus one that will give you experience in your subject area. I have had good experiences with student teaching/practicums. I came in with no experience and now have plenty, and many contacts in the area."
College Sophomore,5,"Education department is awesome. So much field-experience, interesting classes, service learning projects. The professors are great (e.g. Huckins, Meredith Bird-Miller, Bill Preble). The graduate lecturers have a ton of experience and are keen to have us visit their classrooms. We have so many opportunities to gain experience working with kids. The student teaching program is very extensive (I hate the lesson plans though and wish we had more freedom to select our schools). Job opportunities in the area are good. If you're an education major, APPLY TO BE A SUB!! in one of the surrounding school districts to increase your employability, experiences to share with class, and earn money."
College Sophomore,5,"The buildings are pretty nice, the campus is large and has plenty of spots hang out (green spaces, work areas). The library is awesome! There are computers and printers everywhere, and the staff are very helpful. The scenery nearby is lovely too."
College Sophomore,5,"Very good. Internships are easy to find at a variety of companies. Work study jobs relevant to your field of study are easily co-ordinated; I have worked at a local elementary school and it's been a great experience and very easy to set-up (I tell people to look into off-campus FWS positions that are better paid and actually interesting and meaningful!!) Career outlooks are good for education majors, particularly if you want to work in New Hampshire (NEC's teacher preparation program is well-ranked by principals). I have heard of several people getting hired by the places they do their internships/student teaching at (e.g. Hopkinton, Hillsboro, Kearsarge School Districts) The career center with Eugene Durkhee is a great resource, and there are often opportunities to meet potential employers. I am confident in my chances of getting a job teaching wherever I desire to end up."
College Sophomore,5,"I think there's a lot of good options, especially for such a small town. There's JinJins, a nice little Chinese restaurant which is very well priced two minutes from campus (they offer takeout too). There's a small cafe where you can get good breakfast sandwiches and coffee (open till 1?) right in town too. Also, Sonny's has pizza, subs, and ice cream. Overall, these three places are pretty well priced and convenient. Much better than most of the similar sized towns in the area."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel safe on campus and there's a nice environment. There's not much crime, and people will turn in your lost items."
College Junior,5,The wellness center and campus safety are available to deal with cases like sexual assault and safety.
Sophomore,4,I took online classes due to the virus and schools being moved to online. The classes were easy to keep up with and to understand. The teachers did a great job transferring online.
Junior,4,"The professors and students are welcoming, the only issue is there isn’t much to do and the majority of the money is given to the athletic department which I don’t think is fair because a lot of the students there deal with mental health and the wellness center is not given the money that should be getting."
Freshman,4,"I think that’s England’s college isn’t a great place just wish it had more diversity, in its students and staff along with bigger classes"
Freshman,4,"When I first visited, I felt as if I was home. Something about the proximity of the small town and the campus made everything so easy. I am very excited to be attending there in the Fall"
Junior,4,Many students tend to transfer after their first year but I am currently a junior at NEC and i really like it here. many kids that come here are from city areas so when they come here they aren't used to how rural the area is. I have come to find that if you find a good connect to the school with academies such as the major you have or a staff/factualy member then you are more likely to stay at the school till you graduate where as students who dont find these connects their first semester or second semester here they tend to leave.
Sophomore,4,New England College is a very close community of people that are always there to help throughout your college experience.
Freshman,4,"I had a great time with my soccer team this season. I obtained new interests being in the North, that I would've never thought I'd end up liking. I liked the community. It's smaller compared to other colleges and everyone is welcoming."
Freshman,4,"The campus is great. Its in down town Henniker in the heart of New Hampshire. The faculty and staff are very sweet and help you with anything you need. Work study only pays minimum wage but there are other jobs available  around town. The school offers free services such as tutoring, printing, counseling, and health care professionals. The school offers so much at reasonable cost for both in state and out of state attendees."
Senior,4,"While attending NEC I experience meeting student from all walks of life, diversity and ethnicity. The classes and professors was very flexible with my busy schedule of being a full time mother of three. The professors are very knowledgeable and willing to work with the students. If you looking for a good education I would refer NEC it's regionally accredited. Very cost efficient as far getting a A+ education that will last a life time."
Niche User,4,"The classes and Professors were great, very easy to get along with. Everything you needed was very accessible."
Freshman,4,What I like about New England College is the student to faculty ratio and the connection between students.
Freshman,4,The staff appear to be interested in my well-fair.  I believe that their interest will help any student to do better.
Alum,4,"Honestly this school was great for me. It was a perfect fit for me and really helped excel my learning. If you put the effort in and show up to class and show you care you will get good grades! The professors took extra time to help me with essay writing, to go over exams and talk one on one when I needed help with anything academically! The town is small but it’s great, it became home."
Sophomore,4,"Open minded people, very diverse group, challenging professors. Overall education helps to prepare you for the future."
Niche User,4,New England College is a small school with a great atmosphere. You really get that small school feel. You get really close with your professors and they are all awesome.
Sophomore,4,I really feel like choosing New England College was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The faculty and student body are amazing. I am receiving a great education there.
Senior,4,Over all New England College is a good school. The professor here are amazing. They try to help their students out as much as they can.  The professor care about their students and want them to succeed in life. The people who work at New England College helps their students out. They want them to do good in school and graduate. 
Niche User,4,"I am an online student with New England College and am half way through my first course. My initial experience has been a good one. The admissions counselors and student success advisors were/are extremely helpful. The online classroom is very user friendly and easy to navigate. Student academic resources are on point. I feel like I have made the right decision, one that I am truly happy about."
College Sophomore,4,"The number of students in each class is reduced, meaning each student can get the attention. And the professors are very helpful"
College Sophomore,4,"In the small college that I attend, the athletic department is one of the best traits of the facitity"
College Freshman,4,"If you are looking for something small where professors do not just know you from an ID number, then NEC is the college for you."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus communication is not always the most effective. I appreciate the options available to all students, though."
College Sophomore,4,they take the time to listen to students.
College Sophomore,4,It helps alumni get future jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great, the people, professors are nice, big campus, good quality of living. I fell in love with this school from the moment I visited."
College Freshman,4,we really have the school spirit
College Freshman,4,It is not so big and there less than 30 in a class
College Junior,4,Faculty and career services make time with students to help them find jobs and internships. It's great!
College Junior,4,"Athletes are everywhere. We have a lot of sports, good teams, and good people who lay on them."
College Freshman,4,"At first I thought it was a mistake to attend my school, but I realized that it is a very good school and they offer many opportunities for success. I couldn't have picked a better school than New England College"
College Sophomore,4,"Very diverse racially, especially compared with the surrounding area. There are lots of black male students, although many racial groups keep within their race for a lot of the time. 

There are a good mixture of religious affiliations: lots of Catholics, a fair amount of liberal Christians, and many who don't care. People are very accepting of your religious beliefs, I'm an atheist and it has no effect on my life in school. 

There is a pretty diverse mix of political affiliations in my experience; a lot of the students in my writing class were supportive of capital punishment which was interesting. You will have no problem voicing your opinions. There's also a club for each political party, and politicians regularly come to NEC and you can have the opportunity to grill them!

LGBT diversity is not great, and it's hard to meet other LGBT young adults in the area. I am a gay male and have not had a boyfriend or even a hook-up during my time at NEC! This is one of the main reasons I may transfer to another school. have had no problems being openly gay though (I came out at the beginning of my sophomore year)."
College Sophomore,4,"Had an interview, which was good practice. I've heard it's not too hard to get in (education). You do have to take two classes to build a portfolio which I thought was kind of silly. Try and get field experience as much as possible. Also, write down everything you do (e.g. challenges, situations you could have handled better) that you could be asked about. I didn't do this at first and regret it now."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are great. Registering's easy and if you find a good advisor (preferably department head etc.), it's easy to plan your way through NEC. Workload is manageable and there are great resources like tutoring. I'd recommend the library as a study area with a great environment to work in and computers/printing access."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a good school but not for everyone. I find the surrounding area to have not many people our age and there's no other colleges nearby. A little small for my liking and quite a few students are lazy and don't care about college. I would come again at least for my freshman year. I would recommend it for those who don't get into more prestigious colleges as a stepping stone for sure. The professors are great and classes interesting. Overall, I'd come again but potentially transfer out after two years. Definitely worth trying it though; if you want a small friendly school, NEC's a good bet."
College Sophomore,4,"NEC has been pretty good to me. I love the professors who are really knowledgeable and care. My major (education) has one of the best departments and it's really comprehensive with plenty of field experiences. I've been able to schedule classes around busy work life (I substitute teach 4 days a week with an above average class-load; crazy; this has probably been the best part about NEC). 

Class sizes are small and instructors are experienced. Professors are pretty lenient about deadlines but I'd say you should definitely get into the habit of passing things on time so it doesn't build up. Courses are fairly challenging, but by contributing to discussions, completing all the work and asking to redo parts of it, I have been able to maintain a high GPA with a high course load. There aren't that many courses to choose from for General Education, but they are quite comprehensive and well-taught and give you a new perspective. I took some online courses over J-Term and the summer, a great way to meet requirements but I feel I missed out on debates and meeting new people.

Overall, I'd recommend NEC for prospective teachers!"
College Sophomore,4,Campus Safety are pretty lenient. I've heard of dorms getting busted occasionally. Campus Safety have always been professional and friendly in my experience. I had a parking ticket the first week back in September and they were very kind and waived the fee.
College Sophomore,4,Scholarships are pretty good if you have okay grades. I would not come here if it weren't for the $20k annual Presidential Scholarship (you need a 3.5? high school GPA and to maintain a 3.0 or above at NEC) which covers most of my tuition. I had problems getting a Pell Grant (didn't send them my tax return and was never told I was meant to). I would recommend attending if you have good high school grades as the need-based grants aren't the best. They are quite flexible about late payments and have always gotten back to me fast. It would be nice to be alerted/informed about other scholarships that are available (i.e. dependent on major).
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of athletics and athletes at our school. Personally, I've never been to any games but I'm sure they're a great way to meet people. Personally, I think there's too much focus and money spent on athletics but that may be what you want. There are a ton of sports like rugby, field hocked, soccer, basketball if you play sports. We also have an excellent ice rink that's open in the winter. You don't have to be sporty to fit in though!"
College Sophomore,4,"I don't eat at the main cafeteria often but I've found the choices to be excellent and the food good quality. There's usually pizza, Italian, Chinese or Indian food, plenty of desserts to choose from, a great selection of beverages. At the Simon Cafe, there are great choices of burgers, fries, subs, wraps etc. I've found the food there to be very reasonably priced (cheaper than most fast-food places) and tasty. The staff at the cafeterias are very friendly."
College Freshman,4,"When Simon and Gilmore are closed, there's Sonny's pizza, the Chinese food spot, and about two other places to eat at."
College Freshman,4,The policies are pretty strict and the administration expects everyone to follow the rules or else face dire consequences.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are an okay size and you get nice furniture.
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty good, lots of students live off campus (About half). Added freedom and usually not too far to walk"
College Sophomore,4,The education department is very good. There are lots of classes to prepare you well. There are great internships and field work opportunities and choices for that.
College Freshman,4,It is good but since it is a private college it is still very hard to pay for.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe. It is a small campus. Everyone knows each other.
College Freshman,4,The liberal art education covers a wide variety of courses.
College Freshman,4,Administration is moderately strict. They look out for the well bring of all students.
College Freshman,4,Many good quality facilities for athletes and non-athletes.
College Senior,4,Easy to find and cost friendly
College Junior,4,I really enjoy learning from the professors in the psychology department because they all have something great to offer academically as well as other things.
College Junior,4,"I have never been the type of student who likes to party, so the fact that the administration is craking down on disturbances on campus takes a load off my shoulders."
College Sophomore,4,the staff is not really diverse but the students are.
College Sophomore,4,everyone participates and support all sport related events even the professors
College Sophomore,4,Being a student at New England College forces you to step outside of your normal self and pushes you to interact with others and be apart of the school community and being as though it is a liberal arts college there is no limit as to what you can do to be a successful student.
College Freshman,4,i know where to find one and yes i will have one next year
College Junior,4,Good so far. Good online classes
College Senior,4,I attended New England College because of their Forensic Accounting Program.
College Freshman,4,i like the sports teams and facilities 
College Sophomore,4,Health Care is always there have hours ever week day. Campo is always around when you need them!
Alum,2,This college is more so a rest stop than a school. Too much commercialism and unjustified expenses occurred as well as a leader who was insensitive and crass when dealing with students. There are staff who truly care about students at this college but are often stifled by the dean or some other superior who shows little to no compassion for differing opinions or ideas.
Freshman,2,"New England College is more of a high school experience rather than a college experience. The biggest problems about this school are its campus and location. A lot of the buildings are outdated, the roads throughout the school are unpaved, and there isn't much to do on campus. Not only that but the school is in the middle of nowhere. If you would ever want to shop, go to a restaurant, or go to the movies you would have to drive over twenty minutes. The only reason you should attend this college is if you wanted to focus on academics. If you are looking for a real college experience don't come here!"
Sophomore,2,Financial aid assistance is terrible. Made realize the reality that college is a business and New England College will not hesitate to capitalize from their students education. This is true regardless of whether that allows the student to further their education or not.
Graduate Student,2,I’m a graduate with an accounting degree from NEC. Don’t bother coming here. The accounting program is useless. At least the online version.  I succeeded because I was a transfer student and took all my major course in another school. If you are serious about your career go to PENN. I regret it and don’t want you to feel the same. Diploma looks fake too. Cheap.
College Sophomore,2,"Not much crime happens here, campus safety likes giving out parking tickets to make money."
College Sophomore,2,"Students smoke outside of dorms, and rarely are approached about it or questioned or given consequences."
College Junior,2,"the tuition is incredibly expensive at this college for the experience you are getting. the only reason I went here was because a family member works here so I got free tuition. The dorm rooms get VERY hot in the summer and even in the winter unless you get a nicer dorm but they are very expensive. There is not much to do on campus. the food is really horrible. The only positive things I can think of are the small classroom environment and your professor can really get to know you. Also, if you plan on commuting, plan on parking very very far away from your classrooms, there are only a few parking lots on campus and they fill up very quickly. Although my tuition was free I almost wish I paid to go to a different college as I do not feel that I learnt everything that I should have in my degree."
College Freshman,2,Need more things that are 24/7 and the cost is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,"The food in Gilmore usually makes me sick and there isn't much to offer. At Simon the older people that work there are slow, usually over charge, and its really expensive so the flex cash goes out fast."
College Freshman,2,The Food is always the same. Undercooked and no taste at all
College Freshman,2,The school is not located in a city so there isn't much to do outside campus events.
College Sophomore,2,"Not much to do in town, some okay restaurants. Too far from the city and not many people to meet from outside of school."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not big at all not even talked about should be broadcast and should be better and are very small organizations
College Freshman,2,i really have had to struggle and ask around for rides
College Sophomore,2,It's not the best around. The dining hall has horrible hours and the food isnt that great. 
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the campus is decent, though some of the older buildings are a little run down. The newly renovated dorms and the simon center are the nicest buildings on campus. None of the other buildings are particularly nice, though perfectly usable."
College Sophomore,2,Most people who are into the drug scene drink or smoke pot. There isn't really any pressure to join in. Everybody's pretty respectful of what people decide for themselves. There can sometimes be trouble with the drinking scene. Occasionally someone will have to be brought to the hospital because they've made themselves sick.
College Sophomore,2,"First off: the WiFi is HORRIBLE. If you don't have an ethernet cable, the chances of getting it in your room is slim to none. Do not rely on WiFi. It's somewhat better in the campus buildings, but not by much, and it is constantly going down. A nice thing, however, is the computer labs. There are two (one in the building where the writing professor's offices are, and another in the top floor of the Simon center), and they're open 24/7. So if you need to print or need a place to work on your papers, you can go at any time. The computers themselves are alright. They're run of the mill and average speed -- nothing special, but nothing too bad. There are almost one or two computers that are down, however, so watch out for that."
College Sophomore,2,"The people at NEC are alright. I think that it depends on what group you hang out with. Honestly, it's a lot like high school all over again. The campus is small and word travels really quickly. Most of the people I've met are fairly immature, but that may be typical for a college setting -- being a freshman, I'm unsure as to whether or not that's the norm. Even those in higher grades, even up to senior year, seem to be lacking in maturity, however, and everyone is more interested in partying than studying and getting their work done. This does mean that people are willing to party and hang out, but the maturity level brings it down a bit. People have all sorts of different manners of dress, but for the most part it's fairly preppy and middle class. For relationships, I've only known one successful one. Generally there are a lot of hook ups instead."
College Sophomore,2,"There's very little to do at New England College, very small student body, which leads to a small campus. Mostly fun little activities set up for middle-schoolers every other night for us to take part in if we're too stir crazy in our dorms. Athletics however are a different story, the soccer field is amazing and probably one of the nicest on the east-coast (yes i'm a soccer player so this is a big deal), but yet again sadly the soccer field is probably the highlight of our small campus."
Sophomore,1,"If you’re looking for the real college experience, don’t come here. It’s in the middle of no where , the small amount of stores that is close by, close really early and the dining room closes early also. If you are looking to do anything fun or try new things there , you have to travel far. If you want to just focus on school and not get the college experience with it then this is the school for you. The area has some prejudice people who are prejudice against people of color so keep that in mind. Do your research if you don’t believe me. Also the school is small so everyone has annoying clicks. It’s like high school in a way. Deans and dorm room R/As are not strict enough and sometimes I witnessed bullying. Sometimes people would get so drunk in their dorms and make so much noise not caring about anyone else and wouldn’t get in trouble. Please keep this in mind when making a decision."
Alum,1,"If I could give it a -20 I would, this place will screw you over any chance they get whether it be financially or academically. I graduated with two degrees in my four year there and if I had listened to the advice the advisors gave I would not have graduated. They will tell you what classes to take then you’ll come to find out you wasted your time and money because they don’t count as classes. They’ll charge you twice for classes that you took once etc. Think twice before coming here, most people transfer after a year because that’s how bad it is. This is a great college if you want to regret ever going to college once you’re done paying 100,000."
Sophomore,1,"Campus is extremely small, school and transportation isn’t convenient. Food options aren’t good either! Rather be at another college, not worth the money. My plans are to transfer"
Junior,1,"Yo, straight up this place is awful. The townies are looking for any chance they get to complain about college students and get them in trouble with the law. Henniker PD are a nuisance as well, looking to profiteer anyway they can off the college students, by handing out fines for petty things. The party scene is awful, and gives a sense of power to the people who are hosting, who in turn think they can pick and chose who they berate and kick out because there are no other parties. And it’s funny because the people who are confident enough to throw people out of parties, wouldn’t be as confident if you were to just meet them on the street by themselves. Academics are average, but the majority of people in my class rarely attend the class in person. Dorms suck, ecspevislly the older ones, which lack basic necessities. You will be sick of the food within 3 days because there are no options. Can’t wait to get out lmao."
Graduate Student,1,According to the students here.. This is one of the worst colleges in US..And nobody should join this college ..And people will still join this college just​because they have to get passed..And get their degree..There won't be any value for such type of degrees..
Senior,1,"Every class has the same structure, one post to a short discussion question and a response to two classmates.  This is the most mindless exercise ever because you can post anything and get credit.  Unless the post is the introduction, where the adjunct professor says, ""welcome to the course"" their is absolutely no feedback to engage students and promote learning.  Each course is seven weeks, that means seven discussion questions.  I literally had the same discussion question for three straight courses.  The insane part is, without professor feedback the students in the three courses never critically answered the question.  As long as an assignment is uploaded a 100% score will be assigned and the feedback is very canned.  This is a degree mill, if that concept is attractive to you this college and online platform is for you."
College Sophomore,1,We only have one sorority and it does not host any events that are public to the campus.
College Freshman,1,"There's nothing to do here. Town is very small and boring, you have to drive to Concord or somewhere further to find something to do."
College Freshman,1,"Living facilities are bad. The only nice dorm on campus is East other than that all the other dorms are in very poor condition. Dorms are pretty dirty and are cheaply maintained and cleaned. Bathrooms are disgusting, I actually leave campus or go to a public bathroom as the dorms are so bad."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at NEC.
Recent Alumnus,1,If you don't share the view of the professor then he'll make a mockery of you
Recent Alumnus,1,It's a joke the school hates it you get zero support
Recent Alumnus,1,Just a bad place it's a dump
Recent Alumnus,1,"If this is your only option for college Id take it for one semester and get out. It's horrible, if you have contacts and come from a family that's got connections watch out they will use you and turn on you quick."
College Senior,1,A lot of students at this school are drug addicts.
College Senior,1,There is not a lot of LGBT people on this campus.
College Senior,1,The professors for the most part are nice and approachable but some of them are very cocky and think they are always right and are intolerant of people who have more conservative political beliefs.
College Senior,1,"So much trouble goes in dorms, people constantly get charged."
College Senior,1,Most of the dorms are ugly except for Charter and East.
College Senior,1,Most of the Greek life students think they are gods gift.

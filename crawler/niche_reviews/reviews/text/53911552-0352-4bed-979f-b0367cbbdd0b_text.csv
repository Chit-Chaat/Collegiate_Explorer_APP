Alum,5,"This section doesn't apply to me as I have never taken any online courses from Pepperdine University however, for friends that currently are, say it's more rigorous than the in person classes."
Alum,5,"Such a beautiful university all around. From location to campus culture and  students and professors...Pepperdine somehow managed to have the both the nicest and kindest people attending this school from faculty to students. Everyone is super cordial and nice when you strike up a conversation with them even if you don't share the same views. The Pepperdine culture consists of living a life of service that is embedded in the academics and culture with traditions of annual volunteering around September 11th in addition to the push to study abroad to experience life in another country and have a well-rounded view of the world and our country.  

Note, Pepperdine is not known for being a party school since it is a dry campus so while it was perfect for my personality/comfort zone, many people who might be looking for that might be disappointed but easily connect with/make friends with students of other campuses to go there and ""party""."
Graduate Student,5,"I think all of the staff in this school are so kind and have a strong responsibility in their work affairs. Whenever I asked a lot of questions, I could get the responses as soon as possible they could. I extremely felt and touched that they had a great service spirit and system of expedited the process."
Graduate Student,5,"I find it is the perfect school to provide the best environment to study through online. As I know, this school have operated hybrid way of classes for a long time. That means that it is fully equipped that students are able to get a great quality of online classes."
Freshman,5,"There were many virtual presentations and orientations designed for students to learn what Pepperdine has to offer, as well as ease our transition into college. Also, the school immediately organized online classes when they knew students would not be able to return on campus."
Freshman,5,"Pepperdine is a beautiful campus in a beautiful town with a gorgeous view. The students and staff are kind and welcoming. The classes are small, but challenging, which allows for professors to actually get to know students and allow them to reach their full potential. There is not much to do in Malibu and nothing walking distance from campus, however LA is only about 30 minutes away. The food options are great and there is always something to do on campus on the weekends."
Alum,5,"Amazing! The faculty are excellent, you can't beat the location, the people are wonderful...even the food is great!"
Graduate Student,5,"This is my first quarter as a grad student and at this school. I'm doing to the online program in behavioral psychology and I couldn't be more pleased with the curriculum. The professors are seemingly, always available, and willing to offer feedback on assignments and the response rate is quick as well.  
The student advisors are super helpful in helping you orient yourself to the online platform and making sure you have access to all the resources available.

I would recommend this school to anyone, undergraduate or graduate student, for a superb online experience."
Graduate Student,5,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from an online program, but even with no expectations, the classes are superb. You are responsible for both asynchronous and live session classwork and the amount of reading can be easy to underestimate. As a student returning to school after a decade and a half from undergrad, it's been a little more stressful than I bargained for. The best part of the online program is the availability of the resources. From emailing your professor, research, and online campus help resources, they are all just a keystroke away. The professors respond in a timely manner to avoid a time crunch for you and your classmates (cohorts) are just as invested in the program as you are, so peer to peer relationships form quickly, right around the first day, lol."
Senior,5,"Adjustment to online learning because of COVID-19 was difficult, but the professors took it in stride."
Senior,5,Best years of my life! Formative and fun. I truly believe the education I received is unmatched elsewhere.
Freshman,5,The faculty is awesome! They care about their students and are always available to answer any questions.
Graduate Student,5,This is a great school with amazing values and a beautiful campus. I highly recommend going for undergraduate or grad school!
Graduate Student,5,"The program is well organized.  Advisors are helpful and knowledgable.
Online program is well organized, the online program is easy to navigated through."
Niche User,5,"The campus was absolutely beautiful. The people on campus seemed extremely nice. There was a lot of diversity and a lot of people from different backgrounds. The academics are also very strong. The Christian aspect of the school is also attractive, with its services and many events."
Junior,5,I love the academic focused environment in such a beautiful setting. It makes it feel like I can learn while on vacation!
Graduate Student,5,"Pepperdine is an an amazing university, They have a great hands on experience.  The advisors keep in great communication with their students and make sure you are on the path to succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"The most advanced level of education combined with Christain values and integrity.  The spectacular views of the campus in Malibu is just the icing on the cake. I love this university and am proud to be a wave.

It is challenging and rewarding at the same time and the people in the body of this great educational institution and wonderful.

After finishing my MBA, I am planning to study for my doctorate at this amazing university.

I am happy every day that I arrive at the campus.

Also, we have a fabulous athletic department and our water polo team is in top ten across our great nation. So proud to call myself a Wave."
Graduate Student,5,I believe Pepperdine University is an excellent institution. I would highly reccommed it for a variety of majors. I am in the Master of Legal Studies and will be working toward a Master's of Dispute Resolution as well. The Professor's in this department are top notch and I have enjoyed reading their research.
Niche User,5,"its a great college!!!!!!!!Its very clean, and well kept. All students are very intelligent, and diverse. It has many nice professors and is always involved in helping students succeed."
Freshman,5,"Pepperdine cultivates an environment of challenge, love, and faith. The faculty truly wants to see you succeed and pushes you to your full potential."
Niche User,5,I have not yet visited Pepperdine but I do have a lot of knowledge about it. It’s a Christian school but only 3 Christian classes are required. It is a beautiful campus right by the ocean and I’m looking forward to the Graziadio Business School.
Junior,5,Pepperdine is a university designed to help you become your best self. The community support system is unlike any school that I have ever had the privilege to attend. Pepperdine feels like home.
Alum,5,I loved Pepperdine because it was the perfect school fit for me! SO many awesome people and the campus is absolutely beautiful!!
Graduate Student,5,Starting pepperdine in Fall and they have been nothing but helpful with the process and informing me with the program
Sophomore,5,"Mostly to prospective freshmen, it's a great school. They really pressure you into going abroad though and you have to make that decision within the first month. It's a suitcase college which means that the weekends are all but empty when half of the people there go back to their families in SoCal because on campus parking/vehicle registration is free. The campus is fairly isolated and with it being Malibu, everything is expensive, even McDonalds. The cafeteria food is nothing to write home about but everything else is great. The faculty are so kind and accommodating, you really feel important and valued by the administration, the Christian mission isn't very obtrusive, and the suite style living is extremely nice. Academics are, from what I understand, comporable to the most elite schools in the country. Overall, would not have chosen any other school over this one, but there are some problems that the administration can't fix."
Graduate Student,5,Pepperdine goes above and beyond the college experience to give its students the most oppurtunities in the workforce.
Freshman,5,"Pepperdine University encourages students to pursue a Christian way of life and gives students the tools to do so, which sets students up for a successful career and life."
Junior,5,"Although the campus is very isolated, there are plenty of ways to sit back and relax from stressful classes and exams. A diverse amount of clubs and greek life are available here and overall has a laid back vibe. Classes are definitely rigorous and challenging but overall a great learning experience."
Graduate Student,5,The teachers are amazing and you learn practical material. I wish they had more community activities and resources.
Graduate Student,5,"I love Pepperdine University! All the professors  and staff are very involved in your academic learning. Every professor is very knowledgeable in their field and is always willing to help you if you have any questions. 
 It has been a wonderful experience. All of the classes get you engaged in the material. I’ve learned so much this past few semesters. Once you attend a few classes you become such a close knit community with your peers. Everyone is helping each other succeed. It is an opportunity for personal and academic growth.  The campuses all around Malibu, Encino and  West LA are all beautiful. The Malibu campus  has an exceptional view! You can study or eat and look out for the breathtaking view of the ocean and sunlight. 
You’re overall  you’re academic experience is wonderful. Pepperdine upholds really great Christian values that coincides with my religious beliefs."
Niche User,5,"Overall, good experience. The professors get to know you and work with you well. Small class sizes offer more assistance from professors and peers."
Niche User,5,"LOVE everything about it. The students the faculty, everyone is so kind and welcoming. The campus is absolutely breathtaking and it feels more like a vacation than an education. Overall would love to attend this school or the environment, atmosphere, and academics."
Sophomore,5,"Pepperdine is a small school that has created a safe environment for me to grow and mature, in my own unique way, at the speed I want."
Graduate Student,5,"Pepperdine is truly a community that is closely knitted like a family. Once an individual is a part of the Pepperdine family, any member will take the time to invest that individual. This includes coaching, developing, and any help that any member of Pepperdine might need.  There is an impactful community effect that encompasses the professors, working professionals, and students. The experience is cultivated in ethical values that are supported by the principles and core values of Pepperdine, which is purposeful learning. If one is looking for a true community that will enable a successful future, this is that community."
Senior,5,"I loved my time at Pepperdine. It's a campus that has a beautiful dichotomy of being filled with people who are both laid back and over-achievers. People at Pepperdine are, for the most part, incredibly kind and sincere. The faculty is always available to help and will always find time to meet with you outside of class or take you to lunch. The only down side is that, because of the location, there aren't many cheap options for food off campus. You generally have to drive approx. 20 minutes to find good, inexpensive food."
Graduate Student,5,"Pepperdine is a amazing university that is prestigious, with a good reputation. The campus is beautiful and safe. The admissions process is expeditious and the counselors are supportive.  The faculty and staff are helpful and courteous."
Sophomore,5,"The community at Pepperdine is incredible. The people here are unlike anyone I've ever met and it really feels like I made the right choice for me. The way we have come together after the tragic events that happened in the later months of 2018 really opened my eyes up to how special it is here. I am a Theatre and Music major and have found the professors that I work closest with really care about the students which is especially made possible through small class sizes. Even though GEs can sometimes make you roll your eyes, I do feel like I am receiving a very well-rounded education."
Graduate Student,5,I like the small community that this school offers. You can tell that the staff and faculty care about the students and the view is beautiful.
Graduate Student,5,I love my educational experience at Pepperdine University. I have grown personally and the information received has also helped me professionally.
Niche User,5,"I love the environment that Pepperdine is immersed in. It has a beautiful view of my favorite city in the country, Malibu. Its amazing chapel sits upon a hill and overlooks the pacific. The travel abroad programs are amazing and the people create such a welcoming space."
Alum,5,Great school. Very supportive and excellent educational program. Beautiful campus and caring professors.
Junior,5,Great!! I spent many great time here. Students and professors are friendly and nice. Environment is awesome!!!
Junior,5,"I am so glad I chose Pepperdine. The people you meet are truly incredible. There is a great community at Pepperdine, people truly care and there are so many fun things to do in the area. Malibu is the dream, in every sense of the word. Then 2/3's of the sophomore class goes abroad, which will be the best year of your life! Pepperdine's abroad program is the best in the country. You live/travel in a country for a semester/year with your best friends. Pepperdine is making a big effort to create healthy dialogue about racial, sexual, and religious diversity, and gender equality. Pepperdine will really equip you well for the real world because you'll learn so much about yourself, how to be well-rounded, and how to make great connections post-grad."
Sophomore,5,Pepperdine is a really great school for the right person. It has a very relaxed atmosphere but people still care about academics. Some programs are challenging while others are really easy. Your experience will really depend on your personality and how you fit in with the Malibu culture.
Alum,5,"Pepperdine had always been my dream school, so I'm probably a little biased. Academics are definitely rigorous but professors are incredibly invested in their students (personally and academically). Very expensive degree, but lots of financial aid is awarded, which can make it affordable. The campus is beautiful and very well maintained. Athletic teams are pretty good but not many students regularly attend games. Dry campus = not a lot of party scene. Malibu is a great, quiet little town, but you do have to drive 15+ minutes to get anywhere ""exciting."""
Junior,5,"I was a transfer student. I love it here!!! Small-class size, people are so nice, professors are willing to help instead of just doing their research in state school. The only complain would be the transfer credits may be tricky and you have to take 3 religion classes and 3 humanities classes. But still I love it here, there is international program that you can go abroad and the tuition is the same. Also there is a lot of scholarships available"
Senior,5,I have absolutely loved my time at Pepperdine. My favorite things to participate in have been Songfest and the Great Books Colloquium. I also loved residence life as a Resident Advisor. I would strongly recommend Pepperdine to any student looking for a small Christian school in a beautiful place!
Sophomore,5,Pepperdine University has been a great experience. I love the small classroom setting and the availability of my professors. They are all caring and genuine and all want to see their students succeed. I am currently on my year abroad where I did a semester in Shanghai and another in Buenos Aires and my experience has been incredible. I would never have been able to experience any of this if it weren't for Pepperdine University.
Freshman,5,"I really like the school's dedication on students' success. They are really helpful in helping the students get through issues to become successful in the future. However, I would like to see tuition decrease in the near future so that the school is more affordable to students."
Alum,5,"It is a well established university with a lot of options, great professors, diverse students and good facilities. I majored in Art Psychology and found it to be one of the best programs."
Graduate Student,5,Pepperdine is an exceptional University! The professors are very knowledgeable in their respected fields! They are encouraging and always helpful! The professors challenge students to  think critically and push students to go beyond their capacities.
Freshman,5,"The community at Pepperdine is so strong and inclusive, literally anyone that comes here can find their own unique group of friends or people to hang out with. The teachers are amazing and the campus is beautiful, with a great view of the Pacific Ocean wherever you go on campus."
Freshman,5,"As an international student from South Africa,  Pepperdine University seems like a loving school who welcomes every student despite their background. With its medium sized population of undergraduates, I know I will feel comfortable to be educated in that environment."
Graduate Student,5,This is an excellent University with a solid reputation nationwide.  Having a degree from Pepperdine will open doors of opportunity that you would not otherwise have opened because of the reputation at this school.
Alum,5,"Campus- One of the best campuses I've ever seen. Being able to have the beach and mountains as study views gave me the best of both worlds.
Professors- The professors are very involved. Very understanding and super available. 
Financial Aid- The counselors were very understanding and helped me apply for scholarships.
Culture- One of the best factors about this school is its culture. Although I went to business school, rather than feeling that competitive pressure, it felt more like a family oriented culture that pushed you and every other student to your limit to get the best potential out of you."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful professors who want to see their students succeed. Not very much diversity socioeconomically wise, but altogether beautiful campus and friendly environment. Dorms are very outdated and overpriced, its a dry campus so not much of a party scene, but has lots of events and clubs."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a Freshman at Pepperdine University! I have really enjoyed my experience so far. The professors are very involved, and the academics are quite challenging. The weather is always nice, and the beach is a short drive down PCH!"
Graduate Student,5,"My experience with Pepperdine University has been fantastic! I am currently a Doctoral Student in the Graduate School of Education and Psychology and feel I am receiving a world class education.  My course work is compelling and impactful, and my professors are brilliant and approachable.  I believe I fit into the diverse cultural environment.  I value the holistic approach to the curriculum and the charge to cultivate the future leaders who can impact the world."
Alum,5,"Pepperdine University not only offers a prestigious view from its Malibu campus, but it also provides students with a high-end education as well. Although the grading and work is often rigorous at this university, the learning derived from top-rated doctoral professors is well worth it. Overall, Pepperdine fosters a culture based on good-will, hard work, and appreciation."
Freshman,4,"Pepperdine is an amazing place. The school is on the small size, but that means that the staff is much more hands on. If I ever have any school troubles I know that the faculty will do whatever they can to help me. Also the campus is beautiful which is a nice plus."
Alum,4,"Pepperdine has an amazing small community that makes anyone feel at home. It is really easy to make friends and to create connections with your professors. The classes have a good size. There are a lot of general education requirements and most of them are really useful for a good well rounded knowledge, however there are a lot of Religion requirements which may be a lot for non Catholics."
Niche User,4,I loved the community. It is smaller and has a very family feel to it. Also it is diverse in that I met people from all over the world.
Sophomore,4,"Pepperdine University's campus is absolutely stunning. From the cafeteria and some parts of the campus, you can see the ocean stretched across the horizon. Pepperdine seeks to create an environment of close-knit community, however, that can backfire as cliques begin to form. The professors are not forced to do much research, so they can spend the majority of their time helping their students. The STEM departments at Pepperdine are extremely hard for no reason, as they seem to overcompensate for being a liberal arts school. If you are not in a sorority or fraternity, be prepared to not have access to any party life unless you drive south to UCLA or USC."
Graduate Student,4,"Pepperdine Graduate school has high-quality professors, good food, and a beautiful campus in the hills of Malibu with stunning views of the ocean.  It is a dry campus, so don't plan to party there."
Senior,4,"Pepperdine is probably not the average college experience. I have had a good academic experience, but campus community, athletics, and party scene are definitely below average. The abroad programs make up for those shortcomings. Most people go abroad at least once, and Pepperdine makes it super easy to do so."
Freshman,4,I liked the sense of community in addition to the presence of God and religion on campus. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help.
Junior,4,"Pepperdine is almost a perfect school--the only thing I would change would be the mindset of the general student body. We are all overachievers and overworkers, and it can breed a stressful academic environment. However, Pepperdine has some of the kindest people I've ever met in my entire life, and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
Niche User,4,It is a very beautiful campus just a bit expensive but worth it. I love all the people and shops are the university. Everything is safe and very lively.
Sophomore,4,"Don't let the Malibu lifestyle or beautiful beaches deceive you. Pepperdine is academically respectable and offers a variety of opportunities for spiritual, mental, and physical growth. As a sophomore, I have already had three classes with less than 10 people, and some of my favorite experiences were from those courses. There's no partying or alcohol, but there is Church, community service, and clubs for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of Pepperdine is very relaxed because of its location, it’s located in Malibu, California. Pepperdine truly puts all students through amazing 4 years of learning how to build connections, honing our skills within our professions, and stimulating young minds  by asking questions that are yet to be asked in the professional  world all while building a stronger relationship with God."
Junior,4,"Overall a pretty decent school, however tuition is way too overpriced. Starting next year it will over $80k a year to attend. Which makes no sense at all as Harvard is about $50-60k."
Sophomore,4,"Pepperdine is a beautiful school. The staff and students are some of the nicest people I have ever met and it is rare to meet rude people at this Christian university. The housing is very nice especially for freshman. The professors can range from the best to the worst teachers, but for the most part they definitely know what they are teaching, some just do not know how to get others to understand. It is very safe. The only unsafe things that happened my first year were the fires (but Pepperdine was the safest place to be in Malibu in this situation) and the mountain lions (of which I have only seen once, but have been emailed about other reports). Pepperdine is great at keeping its students updated on everything going on in the community and treats its students very nicely, with lots of free In-N-Out and Chick-Fil-A! It is an amazing community to be a part of at Pepperdine and a place where you can feel truly loved and cared about by everyone."
Senior,4,Pepperdine is a great school but your experience is highly dependent on your major. There has been a lack of school body diversity but in the last two years I have seen an increase. Pepperdine's social life revolves around the frats and sororities but not completely.
Graduate Student,4,Great classes . Learning a lot about business. Very flexible class schedules. Convenient class locations.
Freshman,4,"Pepperdine provides such a unique college experience. The community is incredible and there are so many opportunities to grow in your faith on and around campus. In addition, the academics are challenging and the teachers are truly amazing. Some areas that Pepperdine lacks, however, are in its food services and advising department. The food options for students living on campus are not sufficient, inconsistent in quality, and we have no availability to kitchens on campus. The advising department is difficult to work with and often unhelpful. In addition, although the small size of Pepperdine is often comforting, it can sometimes feel cliquey. Overall, I would not choose to go anywhere else, but I can recognize the areas where Pepperdine is failing."
Graduate Student,4,My experience with Pepperdine has been great so far. The admissions and financial aid office have been very helpful.
Freshman,4,"Pepperdine University is a beautiful campus to study at, with some of the best people you'll ever meet!"
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Pepperdine and I wish it was more diverse. It is a great school, but I don't see as many people that look like me compared to other races. They give you an education that is great even though it can be challenging sometimes."
Junior,4,"Pros: Beautiful campus, strong academics, networking opportunities, respected school
Cons: Very expensive"
Junior,4,I've had the most amazing experience at Pepperdine. From the relationships made with students and professors to my amazing year abroad... I love this school. One thing that is a little off-putting is how expensive it is to take summer classes on campus and how inflexible they are at allowing classes from other schools to count.
Senior,4,"I love that although the school has its clear religious beliefs and requirements, nobody imposes their thoughts on you and everyone (including staff) is accepting of all students."
Junior,4,"Pepperdine is definitely not a party school. The location is amazing however, about 20 min from party scene of Beverly Hills and the rest of West LA if you'd like. The professors, academic rigor, spiritual community and alumni network are all great. I am currently a junior pursuing a BA Natural Science and BS Mechanical Engineering. Pepperdine's 3-2 Engineering program is very rigorous and competitive. Pepperdine has the best study abroad program in the nation- about 80% of students study abroad."
Niche User,4,Pepperdine is a very nice college and since it is near the beach it feels very Californian. The people that work there are nice and the classes are challenging.
Junior,4,"I have loved all of my professors and experiences, however, sometimes it is hard to find answers to questions through the university’s One Stop system."
Sophomore,4,"need many more food options; loved the safety and scenery; needs air conditioners; need more teachers, its difficult to get specific classes"
Freshman,4,"Overall, Pepperdine is a great school. There are certainly issues with the school such as petty professors, lack of funding/attendance to athletic events, corrupt and stupid parking rules, over-strictness and others."
Graduate Student,4,"Pepperdine University is a unique faith-based institution dedicated to academic excellence and Christian values. Located in the heart of Malibu, California, the campus is breathtakingly beautiful and spiritual. The on campus and online  faculty are very supportive and experts in their fields. The faculty and university as a whole aims to strengthen students ""for a life of purpose, service, and leadership."""
Junior,4,"I have really been enjoying my time at Pepperdine!
The campus is the most beautiful I have ever seen. That being said, it is built into the side of the Santa Monica mountains, so getting around campus can be annoying and tiring, but free shuttles do circle the campus.
I love the classes and professors! It is a smaller school, which is perfect for me. My largest class right now has about 30 students and my smallest has 4. The professors are very professional and personable. 
There are a lot of international students, but besides that, not much racial/ethnic diversity. 
Although the school is affiliated with the Church of Christ, there is some religious diversity. However, of you are atheist or find it difficult to coexist with Christians, I don't recommend it."
Freshman,4,"I am only in my first semester at Pepperdine as a freshman and so far I love it. I love the campus, the diversity of people, the atmosphere and the location. I also love the idea of small class sizes. As a new student, I don't think there's much I would change at this time."
Junior,4,Pepperdine is a great school full of opportunity and a vast wealth of knowledge. Tuition can be pricey but the education is worth it.
Niche User,4,"when I was in 8th grade I remember going to Pepperdine  it was  the most beautiful collage I've ever seen .The school was huge and it had everything, even a beach near it. They had curiosities the campus was never dirty, they even had there own church."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy mostly the community at Pepperdine. The majority of people here are very genuine and kind. I would like to see the diversity continue to grow and expand. Pepperdine is a big advocate for diversity and inclusion yet, the campus and community could definitely improve in this area. The professors here are mostly very professional and encourage students to come to their own conclusions about things. The greek life at Pepperdine is much more relaxed and enjoyable here than at other schools that may take it more seriously. Rushing is very chill and not everyone does it, so it's not a big deal for those who decide not to do it."
Sophomore,4,"I think that Pepperdine has offered me opportunities in life that I would never be able to do otherwise. This campus is beautiful, the people are kind. I have been able to meet people from all over the world. Even though this is a majority white campus I am happy to see how this campus brings people from different walks of life together. Amazing abroad program."
Freshman,4,"Pepperdine's got a great view, which makes studying there awesome (if you can focus). The campus life is ok, they've got events going on almost every weekend which is nice. The location is both positive and negative. Positive: 5-15 minutes away from the beach, close to Santa Monica! However if you want to go into LA that'll take at least 45min to an hour. Not possible to get around without a car/friend who has a car. From my experience as a science major, the school offers challenging but interesting courses."
Junior,4,"One of the biggest reasons why I chose to attend Pepperdine is because of the International Programs they offer. And let me tell you, studying abroad was probably one of the best decisions i've ever made. Living in Europe has broadened my horizons in so many ways and I've made friendships that will last a life time."
Freshman,4,"I love the community of Pepperdine. As a freshman, upperclassmen are more than willing to give you advice and share their experiences with you. The drawback is that each class only gets one year together since Pepperdine sends most of their sophomores abroad. Each year there is an entirely new Pepperdine, which is sad because that awesome community can't grow together."
Freshman,4,I have love experience thus far. Class is great and the community is even better. They really care about you and your well being.
Senior,4,"Pepperdine has given me the best four years I could have ever asked for. With small class sizes (avg 15-30), attentive professors and cozy campus, it's the perfect institution for students that prefer a tight-knit community. Most people you meet at Pepperdine are genuine, kind and want to create positive impact in the world. 

Academically, it is at times not challenging enough for high-caliber students, but that really depends on the major you choose. Many professors were industry professionals before Professors are usually flexible with due dates and very understanding of students' needs. 

The best part of my Pepperdine education was being able to study abroad in Argentina for one academic year. The special thing about Pepperdine's study abroad program is that they have their own campuses instead of placing students in local universities, which has its pros and cons. 

Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Pepperdine and am really sad to be graduating soon!"
Alum,4,"I had a great time at Pepperdine University. You meet great people, engage in great classes and really discover your most-inner self. It is a true vocational institution. My only problem with the university is the price. It is really expensive, but thankfully they do give out a lot of scholarship money."
Freshman,4,"My time at Pepperdine University has been very interesting. I am currently a freshmen completing my second semester. Needless to say, I learned a lot from my first semester about not only myself, but how to be successful here at Pepperdine. It is important to build relationships with professors and learn from them. They are great resources and almost always willing to help. I rated safety a 5 because the safety precautions here at Pepperdine are amazing. Not once during my time here have I felt unsafe or threatened even with a mountain lion roaming campus. Safety officers on campus provide transportation if needed and are constantly strolling the campus. All in all, I'm enjoying my time here and would definitely recommend it for prospective students seeking to be actively involved in campus life and who love beaches. #Malibu #blessed"
Freshman,4,I love how small some of the classes are because we have more of an opportunity to go into depth in our discussions. The professors provide a variety of office hours to talk to them if we have any questions or need help with any of the material. The weather here is really great since we're are right next to the Pacific Ocean. There isn't much to do on campus or in Malibu during the weekend except for maybe some sports games. There isn't a whole lot of diversity if I'm being totally honest.
Freshman,4,"I have been at Pepperdine for three months now and it has been a great experience so far. It is somewhat difficult to get used to the unique environment on campus. However, once that is done, one can find a great, caring, involved, community of students and faculty. The only negative is that is difficult to get off campus. But that can be solved by finding rides or using ride apps. The academics are fantastic. Every Professor engages students well. They all care deeply about their students as well. I would recommend to anyone looking to further their education in a Liberal Arts Environment. Plus it is beautiful here. "
College Freshman,4,"If you want space, get the double but it's an extra grand more - $5,000. Triples are less but you get an ocean view and an extra roommate is always a cool idea! Each suite has 4 rooms - 2 triples and 2 doubles. One bathroom with 2 showers, 2 sinks, and 2 toilets and a living room as well. Housekeeping comes twice a week so it's really clean here."
College Freshman,4,The school spirit here is indescribable.  Everyone is proud to be a wave and the games are so exciting!
College Freshman,4,"So far it has been great! All of the professors seem very passionate and educated, but some are overly strict. Sometimes the rules make me feel like I'm back in high school again."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are great! Mine was far more spacious than I thought it was going to be plus my closet is pretty big. It only takes me five minutes to walk to class from my room, which is awesome. The rules are strict compared to most college campuses, but I think it makes the dorms much quieter and safer for all."
College Freshman,4,"The school's mission and commitment to education is great! However the rules, especially regarding absences and the use of technology in class, can be a little excessive."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus, and I feel that I have numerous people supporting me if for any reason I become concerned."
College Junior,4,"Although Pepperdine is not known for its athletic, the teams work extremely hard day in and day out to compete with the best, and the awards the acknowledgements they have received prove the school's dedication to excellence."
College Freshman,4,I have many friends who have already gotten all the preparation needed for an internship. Pepperdine hires student empolyees so that they may gain the real life work experience needed for internships or jobs outside of the campus. There is also a Business sorority/frat that will help an individual in finding excellent internships.
College Freshman,4,The professors on campus ensure that each student leaves their class each day feeling confident about their homework or test the nest day.
College Freshman,4,"There have not been serious crimes on campus that I have heard of. I have only heard of more of the minor crimes that do not violate ones personal safety. Overall, I believe the safety services on campus are excellent."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Pepperdine are the primary reasons that bring the students together. Every game I have attended, there is a sea of students wearing the school's colors, chanting for their Pepperdine peers. I have personally met several close friends through attending these sporting events."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience is one that many students do not have a chance to experience. Pepperdine Univeristy's class sizes are fairly small and the professors ensure that each student leaves class each day feeling confident that he or she has gained a full understanding of the material discussed. My favorite memories have happened at the chapel, where the church leaders work hard to build a relationship with the students. I am confident that Pepperdine will keep me on the track to success when it comes to internships and a career. I would choose to attend Pepperdine University over again if I were given the option."
College Sophomore,4,It happens no matter where you are at. Some people are better at hiding it than others.
College Sophomore,4,"Pepperdine has a lot of connections to businesses and corporations that are near by in Los Angeles, which is helpful to any students majoring in these fields. Their alumni association works hard to connect students."
College Sophomore,4,"It's been great and challenging, but the professors are very intelligent and certainly make an effor tot push students to their best."
College Sophomore,4,Our DPS responds really quickly to most emergency calls.
College Sophomore,4,The Greek life on campus is very inclusive in all their events that are often open to the rest of the student body.
Sophomore,2,Pepperdine sounds great on paper but if you're not filthy rich it's a terrible environment to be in and it's not a great investment for the price.
Sophomore,2,"It was alright, I am transferring now after 2 years there. Their abroad program isn't as good as it's put up to be, and also with a lot of very republican upper class pseudo christians it becomes an uncomfortable and fake environment to be in. Im sure if you fit the stereotype you will have a great time here, but as an international student or just average individual you probably wouldn't enjoy it or get very much out of this rigid average education."
College Sophomore,2,I personally did not enjoy the housing options. They were not clean and not updated at all.
College Junior,2,"More housing is needed on campus. Also, HRL should be basing housing priority on need first; I know too many people who need on campus housing because they don't have a car, can't afford anything off campus, their scholarship requires it, etc. and they did not acquire on campus housing. I have been really disappointed in HRL, more so because of their attitude towards me and other students. Most of the time I end up speaking with HRL staff members who are quite condescending towards me."
College Junior,2,"No one at Pepperdine cares much about sports. We have a pretty good men's volleyball team, baseball team, and men's basketball team, but everyone on campus wishes we had a football team to garner school spirit. The crowds at sports games are usually sparse, but our university does invest a lot of time and money into helping our sports teams succeed."
College Freshman,2,"Very diverse ethnically, I did not see any discrimination based on race/ethnicity. Oddly enough Christian students are ridiculed by non-Christian at this ""Christian"" School. Conservative students are also bullied and demeaned for their beliefs, primarily by other students outside the classroom. Many professors strive to have respectful discussions in the classroom and are supportive of diverse beliefs."
College Freshman,2,"Many people on campus say that the Greek Life at Pepperdine is not as bad as it is at other schools, and this is slightly true. Since there is no drinking allowed on campus, Greek Life participants find ways to go off campus and party or drink. The members of sororities and fraternities are very cliquey and they will have no time for anything but school and their Greek family."
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the students are unable to understand the value of a dollar, are very pretentious, and have a way of making anyone who is different feel as if they're alone. It's a lonely place to attend if you don't mindlessly follow the crowd of cookie-cutter people that attend there. It's very fake - a fake happiness and care for others."
College Sophomore,2,"There?s not many different places to live, you absolutely need a car, and be ready to pay a lot of money. It?s Malibu"
College Sophomore,2,The school turns away a huge amount of prospective students because of its very strict policies. In addition a large amount of students end up transferring to different schools because of administration.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing and Residence Life really needs to get their act together. Fortunately, I was able to get on-campus housing for 2015-16; however, I know a lot of people who weren't able to because of the housing selection process. Maybe they should give priority to students who don't have cars on campus and/or can't afford off-campus housing. I heard that they plan to break ground in five years to add more housing on campus. Great. That really doesn't help the current situation, now does it?"
College Student,2,"If you have money to drop on Nobu, Geoffreys or Mr. Chow then by all means it is great.  If not, you are limited to Chipotle, KFC and McDonald's."
College Student,2,Malibu is more of a day time location.  Not much of a party scene at all as the campus is dry.
College Student,2,Too many unhealthy options.  The food quality is the equivalent to hospital food.
College Student,2,"There really is no party scene at pepperdine, but it's only about a 15 minute drive from one"
College Senior,2,"There really is no party scene, unless you travel off campus."
College Sophomore,2,I am in need of Financial Aid but don't know how to go about it and it took months to schedule a meeting to discuss it
College Sophomore,2,"As I did not attend many parties, but judging from the few that I did, the party scene is poor at Pepperdine. Pepperdine is a dry campus; therefore, all parties are off campus and sometimes as far as Beverly Hills. Many students go to other universities, such as USC or UCLA, or unofficial fraternity houses around the Malibu area."
College Sophomore,2,"were okay at some sports and not at others, but the gym personally, sucks. athletes have a separate gym that is amazing and big, while we are stuck in the basement with really small room and minimal equipment."
College Sophomore,2,"no housing, very cliquey and exclusive, and just plain thinking that they are better than everyone else."
College Sophomore,2,how can we all afford to live in malibu as college students? we honestly have plenty of land on pepperdine and i think we should create more upperclassmen dorms.
College Sophomore,2,parties are off campus because alcohol or drugs aren't allowed so it is usually really bad in a crowded house somewhere.
College Junior,2,Not very many people respect or care for our campus safety department and we treat them the same way they treat us. They are very strict with parking which is bad because at Pepperdine there is hardly anywhere to park.
College Freshman,2,Transportation is not good. If you don't have a car you feel stranded. Public transportation is slow.
College Freshman,2,"No school spirit at all. Can get a decent crowd if we are playing a big game against one of our rivals, but other than that... none at all. They do offer free stuff at basically every game to get people to go, but no one really stays the whole time. The athletic facilities are decent for the school we are and the level of our athletic teams."
College Freshman,2,"Pepperdine lacks a strong fan base, even from its students.  Basketball is about the only sport anyone really cares about and even then the only good turnouts are the ones for rival games or games against competitive schools.  A lot of this has to do with Firestone Fieldhouse being so small and outdated so hopefully when the new stadium is built this will give the students and athletes something to rally around."
College Freshman,2,Pepperdine is very isolated.  While it's in fairly close proximity to LA it's pretty impractical to get there without a car.  There are shuttles which leave every half hour into Malibu but from there you would have to walk to your destination or find a taxi/bus to get to Santa Monica or LA. If you don't have a car you just better buddy up with someone who does if you're trying to get off campus a lot.
College Sophomore,2,What did you expect from a Christian school in Malibu?
College Sophomore,2,We're pretty isolated and none of the parties are on campus.
College Sophomore,2,To be honest we don't really go to any of the games.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you're in Greek life, there isn't much nightlife outside of a peaceful evening eating ice cream with your friends at the HAWC. Which I'm perfectly OK with, personally."
College Junior,2,We do not have very good school spirit even though our teams are great!
College Sophomore,2,"They really need a shuttle or something, especially on the weekends"
College Freshman,2,There aren't that many places to choose from here that a college student on a budget can afford.
College Freshman,2,"Because Malibu is so isolated, those looking for a vibrant nightlife are forced to go into Los Angeles or crash other universities' parties."
College Sophomore,2,It's very difficult to get a large amount of financial aid at my school even for low-income families. It's my second year and they have mostly offered me loans and the financial aid I do receive is from the government
College Freshman,2,"If you do not have a car, it's almost impossible to get anywhere. There are some shuttles that run to certain venues if there is an event, but they run around $20 per person. Most parties are held by the water polo team almost every weekend. Aside from that, there is nothing to do at night near the school. People do drink at these parties but Pepperdine has a very strict no-alcohol rule, so you absolutely CANNOT come back even the slightest bit inebriated. "
College Sophomore,2,"Pepperdine is a strict campus.  It is a dry campus which means alcohol is not allowed on campus at all, even if you are over 21.  There are also strict visitation policies, like the opposite gender cannot be in the dorms past 2am.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Malibu is an extremely expensive area to live.  All the housing is extremely expensive and there are not many options.  To find affordable housing you must look in the Calabasas area which is very far from the campus, especially with traffic.  The on campus housing is also terrible at the moment because there is over crowding and the school is having difficulty finding housing for the freshman and sophomores that are required to live on campus.  "
College Junior,2,"There isn't Greek Housing on campus and though there is approx. 30% of Greeks on campus, there isn't a huge affect on the social atmosphere of on-campus living. Greeks and non-Greeks blend well, and the biggest plus is houses for different frats and sororities off campus in regards to parties. It's cool to pledge, but not necessary for making friends and having a good social life."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities are decent, but small like most of the school.  The weight room is smaller than my high school's, and school spirit is not that strong.  Plus, they don't have a football team."
College Senior,2,"Pepperdine does not offer many places for students to hangout on campus. The only after hour places that students hangout in are at the Hawk center, the cafeteria and of course the dorms. The library is pretty average. When it gets crowded you may have a hard time finding a spot that is completely quiet. Payson Library, is known as the place to socialize and be seen."
College Senior,2,"The Greek life at Pepperdine is not what you would expect. There are several good sororities and fraternities on campus, however, there are no Greek houses and all meetings and chapters are held on campus, in classrooms. The good thing about Greek life at Pepperdine is that it is popular and its an absolutely great way to meet new people and become involved on campus"
College Senior,2,Pepperdine isn't that big on sports. I can't remember the last time people I knew really went to athletic events to support a team rather than to get the free stuff that they have as incentives for students to come out.
College Senior,2,"In graduate school you can get loans and at pepperdine for psychology you can get a $2,500 grant but thats about it."
College Senior,2,Permits are very expensive. Hard find parking spots.
College Freshman,2,"Most people leave on weekends, which makes for a really quiet campus. There are definitely parties that you can find, but they're all off campus because there is a strict dry campus policy."
College Freshman,2,"There is generally the same beliefs held by many of the students at Pepperdine. Also, many of the students that are of a different ethnicity, like the Chinese, will hang out together. Although we may see this more with the Asian culture because many of them are international students and find comfort in those that speak the same native language as them. The student body is not very diverse in most aspects."
College Junior,2,"The food is not that great, plus it is very expensive. I'm lactose so it is very hair to find something I can eat. They have tried to put in new items such as a gluten free section, but it's mainly snacks, no food. The food that is served is always the same. We do have an international bar, but the food there is not that great. On occasions the food is good. It is not the fault of the cooks and workers why the food is not the best, it is the fault of the main people who are in charge. If we are spending a lot of money to come to the school, the food here should at least be delicious."
College Junior,2,"Not many around... Malibu fairly quiet,... but also you could get in serious trouble with Pepperdine for drinking, etc."
College Senior,2,"The drug scene is so minimal, I only heard about it this semester after going there for 3 years. I have heard of drinking off-campus, since Pepperdine is a dry campus. Some people have talked about weed, but I have only heard them talking about it, not who or how many people are doing it. If people are going to do drugs, they will find a way and it has nothing to do with how good enforcement is. Pepperdine is really strict so any drugs or alcohol scene is off campus."
College Freshman,2,"Parking is free, if you can find it. On weekdays from 12 till 5, parking is almost impossible to find"
College Sophomore,2,"It's nice that freshmen can have a car on campus, but there aren't enough spaces because of that. During the week it's very difficult to find a place to park and it often makes students arrive late to class."
College Senior,2,"Can Be Nightmare – For such an expensive school, I've received quite a lot of financial aid, but the financial aid office is just awful. The best tip is not to call the office, but physically walk in there and request to see anyone other than a student worker."
College Sophomore,2,Nightlife on campus are none existent. Stick to the occasional house parties or find bars/lounges on Main Street in Santa Monica.
College Junior,2,"No Football Team – No school spirit whatsoever. We have some great water polo, tennis and volleyball teams, but no one cares. It's sad, I wish people cared and there was this exciting energy about it."
College Sophomore,2,"Confusing and Expensive – This is Malibu....everything is really expensive, and if I get something through the canyon, I run the risk of not making it to class.
I'm actually in the process of trying to get an apartment...hope it works, cause the housing deadline passed."
College Freshman,2,"Bring a Car. Bring a car. Or make friends with people who own cars. Thankfully, it is free to have a car on campus. Malibu is lovely, but you will want to venture into LA or Santa Monica on a regular basis."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at Pepperdine is bad. They need to find a way to more accesible parking for those that live off campus. The permits are free if you live on campus, DPS will ticket you if you are parked in the wrong place. You definitely need a car on campus."
College Senior,2,Get a Car – All there is is a shuttle to take you to the local Ralphs. If you don't have a car you're pretty much stranded.
Junior,1,Don't plan on ever sleeping in if you come here. There is construction being done almost every morning here which includes loud drilling. It starts around 7-8am. They say quiet hours are until 10a.m everyday and ask students to respect that rule when Pepperdine clearly does not follow it. I am not sure how anyone can sleep or focus with this going on. Even in a room across campus with my windows shut this still wakes me up every morning.
Sophomore,1,LA is roughly 2 hours away from campus. In reality Malibu is a tiny town that completely shuts down after 9:00pm and has absolutely nothing to do and very few places to eat and even fewer that are reasonably priced. There is absolutely zero interaction between non Greek students and Greek students. The don’t cross. At all. If you’re not in a group like that or don’t already have friends here then be ready to be alone. Almost all the kids who aren’t in Greek or an athlete either go home on the weekend or watch Netflix in their dorm. There is absolutely no activity on the weekend. If you asked out a pretty girl and got rejected the whole school is going to know within 24 hours. Everything you hated in high school is here too.
College Freshman,1,Students go to LA to party. Malibu is really quiet. Parties that occur on campus are primarily students who rebel against the campus rules (and State law) and disrespect those who attend the school because of the rules. It creates a really negative atmosphere. There is nothing positive about the party scene
College Freshman,1,"Old dorms with no air or heat. Very noisy. Not good value for money. Next to impossible to change roommate. Not enough housing for sophomores, juniors or seniors. Required to purchase excessive meal plan."
College Freshman,1,"Greeks break the rules with no consequences. Very snobbish, it's all about money."
College Freshman,1,Intramural are regularly cancelled due to lack of participation. Varsity sports rules not consistently applied and favoritism is rampant.
College Junior,1,Parties really don't happen on campus. People go off campus to parties.
College Sophomore,1,The administration will do whatever they can to suppress opposing opinions. If you approach them trying to propose change they will point to the small group of people who agree with them and make unfounded arguments for their policies. They enforce the white christian bubble and try to hide disparities. While it may seem melodramatic some of the actions of the administration are Orwellian in nature. The administration is the single factor that is driving me to consider transferring out of this place.
College Junior,1,"I dislike the cafeteria for a variety of reasons. 

1) It's extremely expensive. Unlike many college campuses, you pay per item of food, rather than a buffet style

2) While the food costs the equivalent to local restaurants, it is terrible quality

3) They are not sensitive to allergy needs (ie: gluten, dairy, etc)

4) Management is very impolite (however, the workers are lovely)"
College Freshman,1,"You need a car. Period. They say don't bring a car, but you need one. You can have friends that have cars, but it's nice to have your own so you don't have to always wait for them or ask them constantly to go anywhere. There is Hertz rent a car on campus, but they are never working or always booked. Parking is free, which is nice, but finding a spot if you're not a freshman can be annoying."
College Freshman,1,Not a lot of school spirit
College Senior,1,The parking at Pepperdine University is horrible. There are not enough parking spaces for commuter students and many students get parking tickets. If you are a commuter student you need to get to campus at least 20 minutes before your class because you will be driving around a while until you find a spot near your class. Carpooling also helps a lot!
College Freshman,1,"Awful... absolutely terrible. You'll stay away from this school if you know what's good for you. Education is mediocre,  Malibu is an isolated town and there's nothing to do, and the people make me sick. It's small and gossipy and everything you do is monitored by EVERYONE. If you like privacy, and self respect, DO NOT go here."
College Freshman,1,have to park far away if you live on campus hard to find parking if you live off
College Freshman,1,"Campus security at Pepperdine is stricter than strict. There are only two entry/exit ways onto campus, and you have to stop for the security checkpoint after dusk. This isn't to say they search your car, they typically look for a parking sticker. If you have a car permitted to park on campus, they'll just wave you through. There is no drinking on campus. No alcohol paraphernalia etc. If you are caught drinking off campus, you will be punished. If you are of drinking age and are found to be intoxicated on campus, you will be punished. Also, keep in mind this is a Christian institution. Pre-marital sex is strongly discouraged. I know of a kid who was expelled for playing a prank with a condom. All in all, pretty strict."
College Freshman,1,"Most RAs are strict. No co-ed freshman housing, opposite sex cannot be in your room past 10 pm, common area past 1am, and dorm past 3 am. Pepperdine is a dry campus, so public safety patrols often, and will act if they see anyone even tipsy."
College Freshman,1,"You always see the same people at every party, its worse than high school. If you want to have fun you have to go clubbing in LA which can get expensive. I feel like I'm going a bit crazy here with the lack of any sort of social/party scene."
College Junior,1,"Always a Challenge – You can bring your car on campus as a Freshman and parking permits are free.  The tour guides will tell you that you don't need a car on campus because of shuttle service to the local shops, but you really do need one if you want to get anywhere.  parking on campus is horrible.  There never seem to be enough places in main lots, so you better get really good at parallel parking on a curve on a hill and be prepared to hike to class if you miss the shuttle."
College Senior,1,"The Campus should be smoke free.  INdivisduals smoking outside the building should not be allowed but there are no currentr measures in place to prevent, or enforce such policies."
College Freshman,1,"Dear Potheads: It Will Take Some Effort Here. If you're into it, you will always find it and especially if you live in California. However, the school takes very serious measures when it comes to drugs and alcohol...they don't even allow for Hookahs or Shisha's. The only thing you can actually smoke is cigarettes and ONLY in designated areas. Drinking is not very common in campus, you can get into tons of trouble if you get caught drunk or with ANY alcoholic beverages on campus. However, Greek Life always seems to manage to throw their good parties (at their own houses off campus, of course)."

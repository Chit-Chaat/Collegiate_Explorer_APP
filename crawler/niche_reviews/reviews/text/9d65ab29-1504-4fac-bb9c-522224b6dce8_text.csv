Freshman,5,"New Hope Christian College is a hidden gem. It is a very small school that sits on a hill in Eugene Oregon. Though the number of enrolled students just reaches 100, the small size is one of it's many strengths.  I feel that the staff and professors care about me as an individual and my current (& future) success. Not only are they concerned for my academic accomplishments, but equally my success in the areas of leadership, character & spirituality.  In addition, The diverse & quality friendships I have built there in a short amount of time, would be difficult to replicate at a large university. One area that could use some attention on campus is the security and dorm upgrades. The school was founded in 1926, and the campus has seen many updates and additions over the years; however, it has been a while since the last renovation, and it shows in the dorms interior and security. Being at this school has certainly helping me reach my goals. Overall my experience at NHCC has been amazing!"
Junior,5,At New Hope Christian College all of the faculty and staff care about each and everyone of their students. New Hope is genuine and caring and continues to helps their students in their spiritual journey each day.
Junior,5,"I love the community at New Hope Christian College, professors and students alike, it's a wonderful place to be!"
College Senior,5,Our campus is extremely safe. There's 24 hr security. There are no assaults or attacks or rapes.
College Senior,5,"I love it! My college has been lifted up and Jesus resides on campus, in the teachers and staff and transforms all the students as well."
College Junior,5,"You get fed good. The food might not be the greatest and you might not have as much as you would like, but remember that you are getting fed."
College Junior,5,"Two main dining places that are very popular in the New Hope world: Taco Bell and Starbucks. On occasions, if you have a little bit of money, the school goes to apple bees and packs it out."
College Junior,5,"There is hardly any diversity besides of you're common interests. If you love cats and another person hates cats, you guys probably won't be best friends. The academic programs are awesome because whatever degree you go into, you will get the best education by amazing teachers."
College Junior,5,"The student life on campus is phenomenal. It's like one huge family. People are caring and encouraging and so loving. If you are doing something wrong, you will be called out, as you rightly should. The ITL's are there to invest in you and they do a very good job of that. The professors truly care about you more than just a student. There is only one hang out spot and that is the student center.  Really, every where besides the dorms are hang out spots if you make it. Going to school here is honestly what you make it to be. If you come here with a bad attitude and complain about everything, you're king to have a bad time. But if you come with a positive attitude, you're time here will be great. God knows what is going to happen and what will happen. So worrying and getting frustrated does no good to the body, rather take joy in the hard times and glad times in Christ during you're time here at New Hope Christian College."
College Junior,5,We don't have a Greek-life here on campus.
College Junior,5,The admissions team did a wonderful job of making me feel at home and that I wasn't just another kid forking out money so I could fill their pockets. They called me and invested in me.
College Junior,5,"The athletic department is a huge thing on campus because its improving every year. The fan club isn't as big as I've seen in the past. If you aren't into varsity sports, we have a intramural soccer team or flag football team which is fun to watch."
College Junior,5,"Some students are from Hawaii and they have such a different culture than the mainlands. There are some religious denomination background, but if you focus on Jesus, nothing should be a problem."
College Junior,5,"If you are underage and drinking and going to a christian school, ask for help, there is no shame in it. Be upfront and honest. The staff want the best for you and your relationship with Christ. That's the important thing. There has been some issue, but staff was unaware of it and when they found out, they took action in a graceful manner. There is always time for visitors with friends and family. Parking is awesome because not much people have cars. And if you're not attending you're classes, waste your money on other things that you could enjoy. Go to class, its not hard. Classes are fun."
College Sophomore,5,"There is always easy access to wireless internet, a computer, and printing when needed."
College Sophomore,5,"Feels Like Family – New Hope is such an amazing school! It's like everyone is part of a big family. People genuinely care for one another, and are very willing to pitch in and help out. The teachers are incredible."
Freshman,4,"Very good school to grow spiritually, great people to connect with on a personal level, and very Christian and faith-based school."
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my experience at New Hope. The professors and staff really invest in their students every day. The class sizes are really nice and the campus life is great - because of how small the school is, everyone knows each other and is like a family.
I would like to see the faculty hold students more accountable when it comes to their integrity and morality, especially those in leadership positions, and for the campus to more passionately pursue worship and prayer."
College Sophomore,4,"I love classes and the school in general because the staff and faculty are focused on pursuing the will of God in the way they do things. There's a heavy emphasis on Bible teaching especially in my major, but I enjoy that. For those not interested in ministry there are few options as far as classes go."
College Sophomore,4,Social strictness is appropriate. Drug and alcohol usage are not permitted on campus following Biblical standards.
College Sophomore,4,I am completely satisfied with my college's forming system. I have been impressed since I started living here.
College Senior,4,I do not live on campus but all the students seem very happy. Everyone has different chores to keep the dorms clean and everyone shares with each other.
College Senior,4,"In addition to the application, you need a referral filled out by your pastor, a referral filled out by a personal contact and a video submission."
College Senior,4,"Safe, beautiful, great for bikers, walkers, busers and drivers."
College Junior,4,"I have never experienced a LGTB dating relationship on campus, but I would imagine that it won't be accepted because it does not correlate withe the gospel."
College Junior,4,"There's always something to do in Eugene, you just gotta go out there and find it. The mall is 20 min. away, the night life usually consists of apple bees or bowling but its fun. Their is a lot of interesting sightings in Eugene."
College Junior,4,"I've never lived off-campus, but I hear the process goes smoothly if their is availability. And its pretty cheap. The malls are about 20 min away."
College Junior,4,"My time living in the dorms was amazing. I love that it is segregated because it keeps guys and girls accountable in honoring and glorifying God. I mean its a Christian school, what are you gonna think. Living with a bunch of guys definitely grows you because you learn so much about each other even if you never talk to them. The bond I've had with some of my bros have been great and I've built life long friendships. The worst thing about it is that some people are messy, noisy, and if you live on the top floor, its a work out. We have spacious bathrooms, its cost efficient and there are some with microwaves and stoves. If you don't have them, there is a guys lounge with one and guys who have them are generous to allow you to use them."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone on campus is pretty strong in their beliefs, but are also willing to hear someone else's view and for the most part are gracious."
College Sophomore,4,We have security in place and run safety drills. I feel safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. I feel like I'm being nannied, but I still love the atmosphere and culture."
College Freshman,4,"I love Eugene. It's my home. I was raised here and if I had the option, I'd never move."
College Freshman,4,I am proud of my fellow students' desire to not cause their friends to stumble in areas that could destroy their lives.
College Junior,4,Solid Major choices. They will train you to become exactly what you to become.
College Junior,4,The housing is basically on campus and they are so cost effective since you won't have to be on the room & board plan.
College Junior,4,There is virtually no drug or alcohol use on our campus
College Freshman,2,"There is about one or two scholarships, which I understand for a small school, but it still makes it difficult (especially when I have to shell out ~$20,000 yearly)"
College Freshman,2,We are basically segregated from the opposite sex while on campus. There are two buildings that are open up until curfew that are co-ed... This is silly. Please make the dorms co-ed (if only up to a certain time like 9 or 10 pm).
College Freshman,2,"Curfew? Really? I never had curfew in high school and a campus full of, at most, 100 people is not going to make Night Watch's job any more difficult than it is in the two hours prior to curfew that they're on shift."
College Junior,2,One Lab – There is only one computer Lab at NHCC. Which is located in the Lib
Alum,1,"The administration is terribly run and consistently is scheming behind the scenes. There's very few qualified staff-members (newbies running financial aid, recruitment, accounts payable, etc.). This school thrives on disposable workers and if you have a problem with that, then you're ""bad for the culture"" and shunned. The New Hope corporate culture is cult-ish where Wayne Cordeiro is the visionary servant of God. Leadership is also deeply unqualified (e.g. starting a church on campus in order to pay the college bills) and seem unsure whether they want to run a pastor training school, a creative arts school, and/or a college (this seems to change per year). 

Be wary of attending for academics, because degrees are currently only nationally accredited and not regionally accredited (a distinction that's well-earned by the quality of education). They will not be accepted by most graduate level programs.

I know only 1 student from our graduating class that got a job in their field."
Niche User,1,"If you care about integrity you will choose a different college.

I filled out a pastors review in the Spring of 2017 for a student applying for New Hope and recommended the student be accepted. 

The student was living a lie (morally) and so lied to me and on their application to New Hope. The student was accepted to attend.

When the truth came out late Spring the administration WOULD NOT remove my recommendation from the students file or remove their acceptance of them. Their reason why? ""The student might sue us if we did.""

So, New Hope CHRISTIAN college fears man MORE than they FEAR God.

Also, to be accepted you have to have a 2.75 GPA from high school.  This student barely graduated from high school and DID NOT meet this requirement.

DO NOT even consider this college if you are looking for a school that holds the name and honor of God high."
College Freshman,1,"Curfew... 'Nuff said. Seriously, let us live our lives. If we have to be at devos and we miss them, give the specific student who misses a curfew, not the whole campus."

All of this is done while still focusing on preparing the students for a future outside of Wartburg."

The students here treat each other so nicely and it's honestly just an amazing community of people.

The campus overall of very clean and tidy, the staff are all friendly, and the academics are absolutely wonderful."
Junior,5,"Really great school with an awesome art program. Very friendly people and awesome professors. As I said, I love the art and design program, which are very enriching and based on the experience of learning beyond the lectures. Also, the community is very small which makes it easier to connect with other people at the school. The number of students per class is very small, making it very interactive and less intimidating."
Sophomore,5,"Wartburg College is a place with unending opportunities. They offer a wide range of classes and majors, and are always willing to talk through what is best for the students."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the sense of community and the commitment to learn and grow as a student and a person. I am excited and motivated to continue my time here and make new friends and relationships throughout my time here.  The campus is tucked in the town of Waverly; the town supports the college.  There are events that allow the students to engage with the town and the town to be involved with the college.

The facilities were very clean and well kept. I was provided with many opportunities to experience student life on campus. I felt very secure and safe on campus and didn't worry about anything. There was never a dull moment during my visit, and I enjoyed every second I was on campus. I'd definitely advise people who have even the slightest interest in what Wartburg has to offer to visit campus and see what it is like."

College Junior,5,"I love Wartburg, it feels like my second home. My professor care about my progress and success."
College Sophomore,5,"Wartburg College is a great school to attend for any major.  The small campus makes it easy to build close relationships with other students and faculty members.  Because of its small size, Wartburg encourages involvement in a variety of different activities. Our athletes are top of the line and our teams are among the best in our division.  For me Wartburg is important because it is one of only two schools in the US that offer my double major of Music Education and Music Therapy.  I love the music department and all the faculty.  They are all so supportive and have your best interest at heart. There are always events on campus and the diversity is great!  Wartburg and the city of Waverly just recently hosted a music festival the brought around 30,000 people.  Even though Wartburg is a small school the social side of it is great! I love Wartburg College and can't imagine myself going anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,"I always have a fun time wherever I go. There are always positive attitudes at the parties, and it helps me meet a lot of new people."
College Junior,5,The school puts a lot of money into athletics but it is D3
College Freshman,5,"I am Pre-Medicine with a focus in Biochemistry. The courses are not easy, but perfect for preparing me for my future!"
College Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at Wartburg so far! I've met a lot of great people and have gained a lot of knowledge from my classes. Wartburg is also awesome because they have Outfly in the fall, which is a random day when classes get cancelled and there are a lot of fun things to do around campus."
College Junior,5,"I really enjoy the academic aspect of Wartburg College. Almost every student here is willing and eager to learn, and the professors are all very accommodating and want to help students succeed in any way that they can. There are also a lot of opportunities to study abroad for any major."
College Freshman,5,"Love the teachers. Love the advisors. Lots of options, double majoring is a common thing. Some people even triple major"
College Sophomore,5,"There are obviously flaws with every school out there, but I'm proud of the choice I made when I decided to go to Wartburg. I've made friends I'll keep for a lifetime and experiences I'll never forget. Just this year I studied abroad for a month in England. It was an amazing experience and though it did break the bank for my family, Wartburg has offered more financial aid for upcoming years to balance it out. If I could do it all over again, I would still choose Wartburg. I have family who graduated from Wartburg and it's such a close-knit campus. I love it and tell all my high school friends to at least consider attending college with me."
College Sophomore,5,"From what I've noticed the past couple of years, Wartburg hasn't shown any safety concerns other than the occasional rowdiness between freshman boys. The campus is small enough that I feel comfortable walking from one end of campus to the other on my own. The only issue I've noticed is some students taking drinking a little too far but as a student who doesn't go out too often, I feel more concerned for my party-ready friends than myself."
College Sophomore,5,"I have friends who are going to be juniors and seniors and have yet to attend more than one school sporting event, but I have more friends at the same grade level who have attended nearly every sporting event possible. Our football and wrestling teams do pretty well and receive a lot of attention, but the soccer teams deserve more notice. At the homecoming game, the crowd tends to have really intense school spirit, but other games kind of lack. The W is a great facility available for the students and public to use."
College Sophomore,5,"Waverly is a small town, so not a whole lot of violence and crime goes on. The same goes for Wartburg's small campus. Wartburg also has a really good honor code that is strictly enforced, so anything that does happen in terms of crime or breaking policy is dealt with fairly swiftly."
College Freshman,5,The classes are challenging and fun to participate
College Freshman,5,Very safe town and never any problems or disturbances.
College Freshman,5,They are the best around and very well known throughout the nation.
College Freshman,5,They are always there if you are injured. Very small campus.
College Freshman,5,"The double major in music therapy and music education is a popular major at Wartburg College. However, there is extremely rigorous coursework. One has to be extremely dedicated with a hard work ethic to major in both music education and music therapy. In order to become a music therapist you must intern. You can intern anywhere across the U.S. which is really nice. All of the music faculty are extremely nice. They will go out of their way to make sure that you understand everything."
Freshman,4,"Everyone welcomed me, even when I was just touring. When I applied, they were quick to get me back my results and I was accepted. They are willing to help out each student and are very kind to all. All genders, race, and everything else you can think of is allowed and welcomed here on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Some of the professors were very understanding of our circumstances we were trying to study under. Other professors were making it harder to learn, and the level of difficulty was higher as well."
Sophomore,4,I love how Wartburg is small and everyone knows each other. I like having small class sizes and being able to meet with my professors when I am struggling. I dislike our lack of diversity on campus and some professors are not friendly.
Sophomore,4,"Since Covid-19 hit, classes were switched online. All my professors were patient and understanding. They also worked to make sure everything was running as smoothly as it could've been."
Freshman,4,"I took this last semester online and it made me appreciate life and learning on campus. Although I really appreciated all the efforts the professors and staff were made to accommodate us, it just wasn't the same!"
Junior,4,Small school where you can make new friends easily.   Good relationship building with college professors and the smaller class size helps facilitate that.
Junior,4,Only during the Covid 19 were online classes required.  Good experience and you don't lose much from the in class experience.
Sophomore,4,The professors adapted fairly well to the online switch and have been understanding  as the times are currently difficult.The coursework was still completed properly and I didn’t find it hard to navigate.
Niche User,4,"I’ve visited the school twice and loved it so much. The staff and faculty were all very welcoming and incredibly helpful with making my visits smooth, and I just love the environment there. So excited to start in the fall!"
Sophomore,4,"I love that Wartburg College gives me the opportunity to be a part of so many different organizations/ groups on campus. I get to be involved with things such as service trips, athletics, leadership societies, and on-campus ministry, and I am still able to excel in my academics."
Freshman,4,I love how helpful and kind everyone is but the price and how I'm going to pay for my education causes me a lot of anxiety.
Junior,4,"I have had an amazing experience so far at Wartburg. I have found students and faculty who truly care about my success. One thing I would change, if possible, is the price of this school. Many times, I have had to think about pursuing my degree elsewhere because I cannot afford the school."
Sophomore,4,Student involvement is a big priority. Professors are adaptive and the students are ready to learn. Wartburg upholds its mission statement well.
Freshman,4,"As a freshmen at Wartburg, I have felt very welcomed into the Wartburg family and also Waverly as a community. Coming from a small town, Wartburg has provided me with many opportunities to meet new people and try new things. As a Elementary Education major, Wartburg offers the opportunity to work inside a classroom your first semester to discover if teaching is for you. Wartburg also offers a variety of career pathway services to help students discover life after Wartburg. As a member of the track team, the coaches and other athletes have helped me to adjust to college life and provided new friends to hang with."
Senior,4,"Wartburg College is a great 4-year liberal arts college located in Waverly, Iowa. A smaller town feel, which is very welcoming to others and to the students that attend in the town. Professors care about their students and are happy to see their students achieve in the professional world. Many alumni are connected to one another which allows for a great social network of people. Opportunities that the college provides is wonderful."
Alum,4,"Wartburg is a very well rounded arts, sports, and academic school! The only thing that seemed to be lacking was the consideration of the students in some college decisions."
Sophomore,4,Wartburg was a great choice for me as I struggled with the transition form high school to college. I truly am grateful for the wonderful people and community Wartburg has offered me.
Freshman,4,Small campus and very helpful faculty make it a personal experience. All of the athletic programs are very successful and provide many opportunities to maximize potential while on campus.
Sophomore,4,Wartburg has given me numerous opportunities to grow as a student and as a leader. Much of the staff here is invested in learning and helping students find their vocation. I have joined numerous groups on campus and have enjoyed my time here.
Alum,4,Wartburg was an amazing experience.  The liberal arts teaches you more than what a technical degree will.  There is a lot of pride that comes out of the college.  Anyone who went there is always wearing Wartburg clothes and says they had a great experience.
Sophomore,4,"There are small class sizes, so you actually get to know your professors well. Everyone on campus is super friendly and there is always something going on."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the campus, the area, the programs academic or otherwise and the opportunity provided to be apart of a community in whatever way suits any individual. However I would like to see a little more involvement and direction given to students when it comes to the logistics of things. Advising in almost all areas could use major improvement, just telling someone to go figure it out for themselves isn't necessarily the best course of action, especially when it comes to the amount of money being spent to attend a school such as this. Whether it be advising on the academic front, or advising students on the financial front, I feel that some work could be done."
Sophomore,4,Wartburg is a very small school; anonymity is impossible. The small class sizes and contained campus make it easy to build relationships with your professors and peers.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere at Wartburg College is beyond wonderful. From the moment that I stepped onto campus, I knew that Wartburg was going to be my future home away from home. Everyone is so bright and inviting. Many people come to a smaller college thinking that students must get bored being on campus all the time, but this is far from the truth. There are always events that are happening on campus. There are also many ways to get involved on campus including the many organizations that exist, the amazing music program, the all-around stellar sports program, work, and the list goes on and on. As far as academics goes, we have some very top-level programs on our campus. We have employers that will specifically seek out Wartburg graduates because they know that their education will have them prepared to do an outstanding job in the workforce. The professors know the name of every student in class and are advocates for the students' educations."
Sophomore,4,"Wartburg is defiantly worth it! I've met the best friends and people along the way. Everybody makes it feel like home and are so welcoming. There are tons of diversity people on campus and we are all involved in helping them fit in and having the best experience in the states as possible. The teachers are all understanding and want to be a parent influence when you're there since our parents aren't there to help us when it's needed.  Overall the education programs are amazing and I can't wait for my Nursing program to start. The food is really good and they have different variety's of food. For example, I am vegetarian so they have vegetarian dishes available everyday 3 times a day. I love Wartburg and I'm glad I chose this school to help me with my education."
Alum,4,This school prepared me well for applying to graduate school.  I had a good college experience.  This is a very expensive school though.
Freshman,4,"As a journalism major, Wartburg has encouraged me to explore any and all of my interests. While I entered with interests in only print, I've expanded to radio and will be exploring news packages next year. I will also be graduating a semester early with a double major and double minor. There's a reason they're #WorthIt."
Niche User,4,"The students and staff are very friendly and will not hesitate to help you in any area that you are struggling with. There are hundreds of majors to chose from, and they offer plenty of options to study abroad. They have a 99.9% job placement rate and even when people graduate, the alumni always are eager to lend a helping hand, or words of wisdom to those trying to complete a program."
Senior,4,"They were very nice and friendly. I felt very welcomed and at home when I was there. Even though they didn't have everything I wanted they still said I could work with other colleges, to get what I want."
Sophomore,4,"I love the professors and atmosphere of Wartburg, I would like to see washing machines and dryers that are more dependable and higher quality"
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, and the people are incredibly friendly. I love the atmosphere. The classes are challenging, but very fun and engaging. It's an amazing place to get an education if you can afford it."
Freshman,4,"I really feel safe on the Wartburg College campus, which makes my experience better. The professors vary, but I would say most of them are of good quality. Dorms also very greatly."
Alum,4,"I went to Wartburg for my undergrad. It is located in a small  and safe town just for school. They offer students so many opportunities to get involved on campus, studying abroad and services trips which can all enhance one's college experience and resume. There is different events on campus so one cannot be bored. The campus is diverse so there is a lot of opportunities to meet and learn from different people."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at Wartburg College are very kind and helpful; they truly want you to succeed. We have an office called Pathways which I have found to be very helpful. The people in Pathways have offered to talk to other faculty or offices for me when I need financial advice and their counseling services are great. This college can put you through hell in terms of paying for it and the financial aid office doesn't do much to help, but there are other members of the college who will do everything to help you succeed."
Freshman,4,Right when I stepped on campus the faculty and students were extremely nice. It is very easy finding my way around campus being a first year student. I have met some incredible people in my classes and in my work study job.
Freshman,4,"I am a biology major which is one of the most difficult majors on campus. It has been difficult and frustrating however, they do well with being their and willing to help you. I love the smaller class sizes so you really get to know your professor well which makes asking questions easier. I would love to see some dorms renovated. Not a lot of downfalls so far."
Freshman,4,"Wartburg College offers many opportunities for academic growth, and the employees - both academic and staff - are very helpful and welcoming. It's a small college in a small town, so it doesn't have the big-city vibe that other schools might have. This offers a fairly peaceful environment - some might call it slow - but if you want a more active atmosphere, you can go to neighboring city of Cedar Falls."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a first year at Wartburg College with a Music Education intended Major. I love living on campus because there is something every week or two that the campus does or with your floor. It gives you a chance to relax from class and socialize. Personally, my classes were about average level of difficulty. The only thing I want to see changed is their Christmas with Wartburg presentation to include all of the musical groups instead of excluding the one or two they did this last year."
College Freshman,4,The W is really nice and offers lots of accommodations for both athletes and non-athletes.
College Freshman,4,"So far, school here at Wartburg has been good. Everyone is super helpful and welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,School spirit is a must for anyone attending. The teachers actively encourage students to participate in athletics through fan support or through playing the sport.
College Freshman,4,"Although I've heard of a couple sexual assault cases, I have never had an issue and I have never felt like I was in danger."
College Freshman,4,A lot of people know about Wartburg and say it's a great school. They have a lot of internship opportunities and good placement rates.
College Freshman,4,"All of our teams are really good. We also have the W, which has a lot of equipment to use for athletes and non-athletes. Actually, there are two separate ""rooms"" for them. There are also really cool classes to take (I love my kickboxing class). You can definitely tell that that is where our money is going."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is pretty small but it's beautiful. All of the professors are super approachable, but my advisor is usually missing and doesn't take suggestions/criticism very well. Pathways is amazing."
College Freshman,4,I feel like people can find a way to better their health easily on campus as well as feel safe on this campus.
College Freshman,4,I know that this college likes to hire people who have previously gone to school here.
College Freshman,4,The facilities and the school support for athletics are very strong.
College Freshman,4,There is a clinic on campus
College Freshman,4,There is a 99% placement in my degree
College Freshman,4,The facility is a great place
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. I have never felt threatened or heard of anyone who has experienced sexual assault here.
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities for internships and it is very easy to make connections here. A degree from Wartburg is a good thing to have.
College Freshman,4,Professors want their students to succeed. They are always around to help with questions students may have.
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities to get involved at Wartburg and there is something for everyone. I like the class sizes and it is easy to communicate with and get close to professors and make other connections. I would choose this school again because I like the environment and I have made really good friends here. I wouldn't choose this school again because it can be very boring at times.
College Sophomore,4,I feel like it is rather safe here.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small class sizes and the atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,"It's rather expensive, but I feel that the experience gain will make my time here worth it."
College Sophomore,4,The overall experience has been with great with my professors and class mates. The work load is always keeping me busy but I really enjoy my classes.
College Freshman,4,"I have had to adjust my schedule a bit and have had a lot of help from my advisor.  It is easy to talk to him and meet for office hours.  Class size is much smaller than my large high school, but I enjoy the class size.  Each instructor has been easy to get to know."
Sophomore,2,"I like that the staff supported the students and made an effort to help them to figure out a way to time manage and have someone to lean on. There were some other issues but if you are not a very social person, then you may have more trouble than others."
College Sophomore,2,There tend to be problems with the buildings.
College Sophomore,2,"We do not have the stereotypical Greek Life. Our greek life are academic clubs for different majors, no houses or bid days."
College Sophomore,2,Its expensive and the college wants to keep you forever
College Sophomore,2,Nothing really unless you want to drive some place
College Sophomore,2,Its so difficult to talk to the financial aid office
College Sophomore,2,I do not like how unseasoned the food is and bland it is.
College Junior,2,Everyone either goes off campus to party (out of town) or goes to Joes
College Junior,2,Small town with very limited options in terms of food
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough options to choose from
College Sophomore,2,"The wifi here is unreliable sometimes and it goes out on my laptop at random times, and a lot of the time it's when I'm trying to turn in homework online. There are computer labs on campus in the Science center and a few other places,and the library has quite a few as well. Those computers are usually reliable for internet connection, but they take forever to log in, and not all of the computers on campus are the same. The labs in the science building have chemistry, math and computer science related programs on them, but they are the only ones that do."
College Freshman,2,"There are not too many options for dining in Waverly. A few places in town cater to the dorms which is extremely convenient. Most places have reasonable prices as well. The only real negative option I can think of is that there is not a restaurant that specifically caters to vegetarians or vegans. Being a vegetarian myself, I find it hard to go out to eat when the only option I have is eating a salad."
College Junior,2,"I have always had problems with financial aid.  The college does work with me well to try to find things for me, but I wish there was a little more they could do."
College Junior,2,"It is very expensive and if you get stuck with the cheapest lot, it is very far away and is made of gravel and gets you and your car extremely dirty.  I also think that you should be able to park on the street if you are in a rush from doing something off campus and having to make it to class in time.  Parking tickets are ridiculous here."
College Freshman,2,If you don't own a car you are in for it.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm currently in the German program, and it's ridiculously small. There's usually only one 300 level course per semester, which makes it extremely limited when it comes to trying to make a cohesive schedule. There are often very few people in these classes, so they sometimes get canceled."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is okay here. Every lot is within walking distance. However, the freshman lot (D lot) is a gravel lot and is the farthest away. The nicer dorms have more convenient parking lots right next to the buildings. As for visitor parking, those are pretty limited around the main part of campus."
College Junior,2,The Waverly Police really do the most. They're always lurking around on campus and in the parking lots. It's really weird.
College Sophomore,2,I believe that Wartburg deserves a C- because they are lenient on most things such as visiting hours but are extremely strict on noise. There are plenty of times where noise is not significantly loud and can go unnoticed but students are written up anyway. Other than this Wartburg is fine on strictness and everything else they enforce is needed for safety.
College Sophomore,2,I've applied to many scholarships and have yet to win anything it's very discouraging
Alum,1,"Save your money and go to a state school.  Your education will be as good or better.  They cannot attract talented professors or administration because they are in the middle of nowhere.  If you are not from Iowa or if you are a bit different in anyway, you will be considered an outcast.  If you need any special education help, they promise it but they really don't have the adequate means or support."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have Greek Lie on our campus, therefore this question is irrelevant for me."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life. I enjoy it that way.
College Senior,1,"The training campus has for sexual assaults is a joke. Security is slow. But, campus is safe aside from a few incidences."
College Sophomore,1,All they have is pizza places and bars. sucks!
College Junior,1,"This winter has been absolutely terrible.  It has been so cold and snowy, and Wartburg never closes because of the weather.  Walking to class can be very difficult sometimes."
College Sophomore,1,"Wartburg makes it nearly impossible to get off-campus housing, and the city of Waverly is trying to pass new restrictions on how many people can rent a house or apartment together."
College Sophomore,1,"Waverly is an extremely small town, and most of the people have a negative attitude towards Wartburg students in general."
College Sophomore,1,"Overall, I would say that Wartburg College is great... if you want to go back to high school. There are cliques everywhere, and campus is so small that it's impossible to keep a secret for very long. Most students are stuck-up and rude if you don't fall within their general clique, and it's just hard to branch out in general. If I had known what I was in for, I never would have even applied to this school."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is basically non-existent, and there's no chance for it in the future."
College Sophomore,1,"The program is so small that I'm pretty sure I'm the only person with this major on campus. There's no variety in classes, and they aren't offered frequently or at varying times."
College Sophomore,1,"I have had multiple trips to the Financial Aid Office, and have had to beg for the aid that I'm supposed to be getting. Overall, they aren't very helpful and don't give you a lot of options."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only a handful of places to go: Joe's, the Goat, or maybe a bar if you can find one. Overall, there aren't many options, and the ones that are out there are pretty seedy and not too clean."
College Junior,1,"All there is in WAVERLY, IOWA are Pizza joints, McDonalds, Burger King, struggling Chinese and Mexican Restaurants, Taco Johns, and a Bremer Diner. It gets really old really fast.

The only places I enjoy are Pizza Ranch and Subway. Pricing isn't all that bad. The most expensive places might be Dominoes, Pizza Hut, and Bremer Diner."
College Junior,1,"Okay, so there are a good amount of good looking people at this campus, but looks only get them so far. A lot of the kids here are superficial, cliques are just everywhere, and they can be really stuck on themselves. Basing the school on looks, it's a nice little candy shop. But diving deeper you realize it's more like a house infested with roaches."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life isn't big at all at Wartburg there was only one social event it headlined.
College Sophomore,1,"Here the winter is winter and summer is very summer at Wartburg. In winter it snows a lot and thanks for our sky-walks we do not need to walk outside. In summer it is very sunny, hot and humid. However, it is the best time take a shot of beautiful and colorful trees of unique campus."
College Sophomore,1,The computers here have horrible internet connections.
College Freshman,1,"Since this school is a residential campus, students are not allowed to live off campus. So, it is harder to find off campus housing, but if you find it is much more cheaper to live off campus than on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Students who do not have cars are out of luck. There is no public transportation available in Waverly. The college does have two cars available for rent, but are often checked out. Bring your car."

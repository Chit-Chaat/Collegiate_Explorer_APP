Sophomore,5,I had an online class and it was great. You have to always remember that the work have to get done and turned in. It's different from person to person class but the same rules apply. The professor made the class accessible and if you didn't understand you could reach out and get the help needed.
Sophomore,5,"My experience was different from being at home, I realized that i was on the road to adulthood. Making decisions for myself in which I choose the positive Road. I met new people and learnt a whole lot of knowledge. Once you set a goal strive to reach it and work hard at making the right decision because in the long run it will either be beneficial. The only thing I'd choose is some of the cafe food ðŸ˜Š"
Niche User,5,"Was invited to orientation by Coach B.  My checklist consist of a few things but the main items are cost, # of students and how far is it from home in case something happens. This place meets all 3 and on top of that it's a HBCU which was on the list as well but #4. Everyone was welcoming and felt like family. My mind was made up at that point."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Allen has been great. I would recommend Allen to high school graduates. It's not a very large school but it is rewarding. The professorsxare down to earth. They give you one on one attention if need be. Grateful for the opportunity to attend this great school in the Palnetto state of South Carolina

Senior,5,"Allen University is a great school. The teachers push you to do great and they help you with anything. Athletics are pretty good, especially basketball. We are adding a football team this year as well. The food in the cafe could be better and better WiFi throughout the campus."
Freshman,5,"Allen University is named after Richard Allen, the founder of the AME Church. Allen University, recognized as the first university in South Carolina founded by African Americans for the education of African Americans, is also the first university named after an African American."

College Senior,5,There's no drug scene at Allen University

College Freshman,5,Greek students host many community service events at the school for non-Greeks to be involved. They do not treat anyone different if they are not a part of their Greek or any Greek. They make sure education is placed first before they host any parties.

College Senior,4,I had feel very safe on campus
College Senior,4,"Off campus housing is great because you have a lot more freedom and get to experience living on your own. Downside is that you will not be eating in the cafe, really experience campus life and possibly get stuck in traffic."
College Senior,4,Its plenty of space for parking at the cafe and across from the dorms. The parking permit are $15
College Senior,4,Allen University is very accepting to the diversity of their students.
College Senior,4,Students background is diverse at Allen University.

Recent Alumnus,4,"I am proud of the young men and women who I have talked to at Allen.  They are exceptionally bright and have something to say. I am old enough to be the parent of any one of them.  But we are able to have a dialogue, we are able to come to an understanding on just about any subject matter."
Recent Alumnus,4,Basketball is largely the sport of choice with well supported men's and Women's teams. The facilities are nice and the faculty and staff are also supportive.
College Senior,4,Parking on Campus is not a nightmare. There are plenty of places on the campus you can park. There are few parking spaces that are different to get. For example In front of the dorm that is located just off the street. Also behind the Freshman Dormns.
College Sophomore,4,Drugs are not very big on campus. The school is extremely strict about it. I havent seen any drinking on campus either. So the school in my opinion is doing a great job with control on both.
College Sophomore,4,"dinning halls are always nice but its a little small and not a lot of variety sometimes but its great though, for a meal."
College Freshman,4,My program and the professors are great and very helpful!
College Freshman,4,This is a very diverse campus and everyone gets along.  Haven't seen or heard of any issues that would state otherwise.

College Sophomore,4,It is great to be a social science major. Professors are helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"They have a great variety of options, but if you transfer your credits may not."
College Senior,4,"The food is 100% meaning that all the choices are healthy and contribute to strong minds and bodies. The policies ,however, stink to high heaven. How do you deny a diner who may be a dollar short on his/her meal entrance to cafeteria only because he/she wants to ask a fellow student for the balance to get a chance to eat.  Their is no ""Christian Ethic"" in volved here.  If a person had no money, I feel that he/she should be able to eat.  That is part of the Christian Culture, however, policy gets in the way and some goes away hungry. Just look at all the food that is being thrown away each night that someone could have eaten."
College Senior,4,"The professors at Allen are of a broad spectrum of cultures , races, and Religious denominations. Just because Allen is an A.M.E. school, you could never tell just by attending this institution of higher education.  And when I say higher education, I mean just that...Its goals are centered around creating the ideal character of a fully self-actualized individual.  Although many of us will never reach ""The Total Self-actualized"" individual, as dictated by Abraham Maslow's model in Psychology, but we will ALL benefit in one way or another by having attended AIIen University.

There are any number of study options presented to the students from individual attention to mass Study Halls offered by the fraternal organizations on campus.  Also Allen's library has any number of leaflets and pamphlets to help a student in his/her research endeavors. These options are available outside the classroom and Instructors encourage the student population to use them.  The Joseph S. Flipper is the one place on campus that you will always find buzzing with activity from the future movers and shapers of the community that Allen University is apart of as well as the future policy makers and theologians and educators of this country."
College Senior,4,"I can only speak for my department which is diverse in its character, subject matter, mannerisms, personality, and thought processes."
Sophomore,2,"Very unorganized with every single thing they do, they move very slow, they are sometimes very rude and snappy. The dorms are TERRIBLE !"
College Junior,2,"I returned a few semesters ago and my financial aid did not get completed until that following semester and they are still working on my financial aid for Fall 2015, because they could find some of my paper work in the archives."
College Freshman,2,The safety of the campus would not be so safe. Someone that robs a student on campus would a 90% chance of them getting away. 
College Freshman,2,"The community that Allen University is with in, is more of a rural area. There is a shopping center that has Family Dollar, Chinese restaurant and the Allen University campus mall. Across the street from the shopping center, there is Benedict College campus and KFC, which is a fast food restaurant. The school has only one activity and that's on Wednesday.  "
College Sophomore,2,Since Allen University is a small school there wasn't many Greeks around campus but they did little things per semester.
College Sophomore,2,We are basically in the downtown area. There are a lot of homeless people that live not too far from the school
College Freshman,2,I'm not a member of a fraternity and therefore cannot give an accurate evaluation of the greek life at Allen University.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid process here at Allen is a little messy and unorganized. However, if one keeps in contact with the office and handles their business very seriously it will eventually be straightened out. Cost of attendance is only about 16,124 a year."
College Freshman,2,"Since I have been here I have had major difficulties and tried to make the best of things, but still something always ordinary happens."
College Junior,2,"Life at Allen â€“ Life at Allen University , is rather basic.! I mean yes new dorms were built & they are nice, but I just feel were paying for a good education & thats it! The staff is very friendly, The president is nice & well so are the students, but everything else isn't so good.! We have student activities from time to time & well they go good sometimes but other times it gets cancelled & that leaves the studenst with nothing to do! I will admite our campus is veru clean & the students do help keep it that way & our campus is but it gets the job done! I do like our gym & our library because they are both very spacious & seem to always have alot of activity going on in them! Overall Allen University is a nice school but some things can be improved !"
College Sophomore,2,"Allen University is a small privately owned A.M.E. religiously based school.  It is one of the smallest H.B.C.U.'s in the United States.  I came to this school to study in the field of social science.  The teachers are fairly nice but seem less dedicated to their jobs.  The financial aid and registration process can be a big mess.  There seems to always be things wrong on everyone's financial student accounts and the some of the staff can be very rude and semi-helpful in the process.  Two new dorms were built recently and they are beautiful and for the most part organized.  The cafeteria is nice but the food could be better.  They ofter serve food that isn't always cooked thoroughly which is why i don't eat there too often.  One of the great things about the school is the one on one learning that you get from the teachers.  They are always willing to help and give you that extra push you need.  If you make failing grades, there is no one to blame but yourself because the teachers are always there for help.  They also have many events during the school year to keep things interesting which are always a blast.  Overall, the school is okay but needs work."
Niche User,1,"Allen University has not diversity of inclusion.  Not a single person in the athletic department is non-Black.  No Whites, Hispanics and especially no Asian or American Indian.  Very racially single in its approach.  If this were a white school or an Asian school the there would be protest for its practice of exclusion?"
College Senior,1,I see a lot of students doing drugs at my school everyday.
College Student,1,Nothing to Do on Campus â€“ there is really nothing to do on campus besides Frats/Soros but I cant do it because im a freshman
College Sophomore,1,There are many religions and eithnic/racial diveristy.
College Sophomore,1,Life on Allen University campus is very usual. it seems like we are prisoniers. we dont have many sport or event to keep us entertained. They have polices riding round every 5 mins.This is not the college life i expext to have.They don't even have teacher showing up for sum of the classes.This is what the college life feels like at allenn university.
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus can be a mess a times. One has to make sure that he/she must be on campus atleast 45min early, because of the limited parking spaces."
College Junior,1,"Why Oh Why ? Allen University should rethinking the fact that they cancelled the drug raids we used to have! I mean drugs are always visable,but they are always there & if you need them they are at your convience! I have noticed that alot of people smoke, and to me thats just terrible. Ive noticed people going to class drunk & its just so unacceptable to me!"
College Sophomore,1,"There are almost no sports at all at this school.  We have a basketball team which is pretty decent and a cheerleading squad that needs a certified coach.  Other than these two sports, there are none"
College Freshman,1,"Not So Good â€“ At Allen their is only one place that you are able to eat, the cafe. The cafe has 3 different stations. One has pizza, one with your ""homemade food"", and one with things like burgers, chicken tenders, fries. You have no option on the meal plan, its included with room and bored."

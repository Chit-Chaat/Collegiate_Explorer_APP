Freshman,5,"I'm attending SMCM during the COVID pandemic, and while other schools are shutting down because their students don't take it seriously, ours is still opened and all students wear masks. This says a lot about our administration and community as a whole - we're dedicated to each other's safety and wellbeing. You can vibe with pretty much anyone - very low stress environment, and all the professors I've had are knowledgeable and understanding. I'm excited for the next 4 years!"
Alum,5,St. Mary’s is a small school on the river that will easily become your home. It’s isolated but you can easily access town if you have a car. The community is tight knit and welcoming. There is a diverse student population. The faculty cares deeply about their students and wants them to succeed.
Sophomore,5,St. Mary's has a beautiful campus. The small class sizes have really helped me thrive and it is really easy to form close connections with professors.
Senior,5,I will never regret my decision to choose SMCM for my college experience. The community here is exactly what I expected and the professors here are top notch. The food is incredible and if you love the outdoors then you will love this campus! I've made friends I will have for life here. I'm incredibly grateful for all the opportunities I've had both academic and extracurricular by being a student here and will miss this place when I have to leave.
Junior,5,I love St Mary's College of Maryland. It is a public honors college. The academics are great and help me to achieve my goals in life. The campus is beautiful and the students are very friendly and always willing to help. The professors are wonderful. They go out of their way helping students and are great mentors. We all strive to be our very best every day. The docks are the best. The sunsets are beautiful and I love it there.
Junior,5,"I love St. Mary's. The campus fosters such a positive, inclusive environment, and it's location along the St. Mary's River surrounded by nature makes it the most beautiful campus I've ever seen."
Works Here,5,The SMCM community is wonderful. The campus is beautiful and the food is delicious. There are so many activities for students to participate in. They live up to the honors college promise. Basically you’ll be ready for life after graduation!
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved the campus tour when i visited during my college search. I was eager to see all of the different possibilities at a public honors college. The people who greeted me were fantastic and welcoming. I had a great experience while visiting, and now it is one of my top schools. There is one thing that i think could be better, i know you cannot really change this, but the all girls dorm is kind of a long walk away. But, that is my only complaint!"
Freshman,5,"Only from the group of people I met and made friends with, everyone are so nice and there is always someone there to help you. I was glad that I came here."
Junior,5,"Classes are academically challenging and engaging. Professors are invested in student success and achievement. Campus is very secluded, but beautiful, and conducive to a balance of the student's study and social life."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community, everyone is so nice and ready to help if you need it. The size of the school allow for students and staff to become very close and that is very helpful when it comes to choosing classes and thinking about the future."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus. Close enough to city life for good resources and lifestyle fun, but not to busy or crowded."
Alum,5,"The academic experience here cannot be matched. With small class sizes and incredibly intelligent, unpretentious, and approachable faculty, I walked away with a fantastic education. The setting of the school could not be more beautiful, and the river provides both amazing photo ops and free entertainment during the school year. The students are very socially engaged and active, which can lead to some polarization of the student body, but for the right reasons. The campus community is small and closely knit. One of my favorite things to note is that athletic events were never really sold out, but plays and shows always were."
Junior,5,"This is a smaller campus with fewer students than larger universities, but this campus is packed with history and surrounded by amazing views. Because of its placement on the St. Mary's River, students have access to swimming and many water sports such as paddleboarding, kayaking, and even sailing."
Alum,5,"St. Mary's is the best school in Maryland for anyone looking for a nature-situated collegiate experience. For this reason, St. Mary's was perfect for me. The singular defining feature of the school, in my opinion, is that it is right on the bank of an exquisitely beautiful river, offering countless hours of exploration, sailing, windsurfing, and swimming with my friends. There are also phenomenal wooded trails surrounding the campus to the north and south. If you love spending time outdoors and are looking for a school in MD, this is the place. There was no other school for me. Other things that set this college apart: the campus farm, the vegetarian co-cop, SAILING, hilarious and fun traditions. (Also, Southern MD is a quirky and charming place, especially if you're into history, boats, or fresh seafood!)"
Senior,5,"St. Mary's has a very tight knit community, a lot of options for clubs and activities, and most of the professors are very down-to-earth and helpful if you're struggling in their class"
Sophomore,5,"Love this school! Love the friends I've made and the education I'm getting. The school is beautiful, the river sunsets are amazing, the professors are the best, and I'm making wonderful memories with the nicest people.  So glad to be at St. Mary's."
Sophomore,5,"I've only been there for one semester, but so far it seems like it is a nice community. It is small and everyone, including the staff and teachers, are friendly and I feel like they genuinely care for the students, health-wise and educationally."
Junior,5,"I've loved attending St. Mary's! It's such a wonderful environment to learn and succeed in. Every faculty member I've interacted with has been a friend, mentor, and supportive team to all their students. There's plenty of diversity, things to do, and interesting classes to take."
Freshman,5,"i haven't gone their yet but i will in the fall. but, from what i've seen during college tours is that it's a very beautiful campus. the people are nice, the food is really good, and everyone loves to learn there. i can't wait to be a seahawk this year and experience why everyone is in love with this small college in southern maryland."
Niche User,5,St Mary's was a beautiful school it was by the water the people that i was around were all so kind and were helpful I cannot wait to go to school here. It is a great environment for learning and was peaceful and the professors seemed great and very helpful and many people told me that they loved the school
Sophomore,5,"An awesome college with great teachers, who are always willing to help you out. The athletics are great; they are competitive, but there is still a focus on school. Your coaches realize that you are there for school first, and that is the main priority."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my time at St. Mary's and wouldn't trade it for the world. Attending a small liberal arts school afforded me unique opportunities, like working as a TA my freshman year. The professors are enthusiastic and accessible. The students are quirky and the campus has a family feel. Because of that, rumors spread quickly and the latest campus incident can quickly dampen the mood. However, to me, the benefits outweigh the cons. There is not much to do in the greater community, but campus is so beautiful that sometimes it's hard to leave anyway. The career center was really helpful when I was searching for opportunities both during and after college."
Freshman,5,Professors really care about the success of their students. They are always willing to go the extra mile. The small feel makes you feel at home. The students attending are very judgemental free. It is a great environment. Food is AMAZING
Alum,5,"Hidden gem of a school! Rigorous academics that challenge you in the best of ways. Students are special and there is a really unique sense of community here where everyone is essentially a big family. It is in a rural area though, so if bonfires, a beautiful river, and gorgeous nature are up your alley then this is the school for you!"
Senior,5,"I love the small feel of the campus.  There is a lack of an overwhelming feeling when I step into my classes due to their smaller class sizes, which is a bonus for me.  The professors are incredibly helpful and understanding, and I have found all of my classes thus far to be incredibly helpful.  It also helps that the campus is quite beautiful, especially the sunsets over the St. Mary's River!"
Alum,5,"I made more contacts at St. Mary's than many of my peers and friends at other much larger institutions because of St. Mary's small size.  You will see every student on the walking path to class, in the Great Hall for meals, at the waterfront for recreation and relaxation.  I enjoyed the academic rigor and variety of my courses and left college feeling more capable of learning things for myself and exploring the world around me.  St. Mary's cherishes and encourages the individual while promoting community and preserving the natural environment."
Alum,5,"I chose St. Mary's primarily because of the impression I got from both the students and the professors when I visited the campus.  My inclination was right, as those interactions remain the most important factor to me to this day.  In addition, I can critically think about the world around me due to the quality of my education.  I do not take this skill for granted.  Thank you SMCM, my home away from home."
Alum,5,"Best school experience one could have. Great campus, great river, great staff! This school set me up for success. The food is first class! Coming around the bend and seeing my beautiful campus put a smile on my face every time."
Alum,5,"Amazing school! Great, challenging academic program and wonderful social and extracurricular life. SMCM prepared me for grad school and beyond and the river will always feel like home."
Alum,5,"St. Mary's offers an unparalleled experience in higher education. As a professional in an area of law that requires a deeper understanding of scientific and other cross-disciplinary subjects, I know that the well-rounded liberal arts structure of St. Mary's laid the foundation for my success.  The professors are devoted to teaching and challenging their students, which is generally unheard of these days.  The small size and beautiful semi-rural campus setting mean that you will forge relationships that will last a lifetime while developing personally and academically."
Alum,5,"I look back on my time on The River with such affection. St. Mary's helped make me who I am today, and I'm grateful for the things I learned and the people I met."
Alum,5,"SMCM was an amazing experience.  The campus is beautiful, the faculty are caring, the students are fascinating.  It is a private liberal arts experience for a public price -- truly an undiscovered gem."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 2014 with a degree in Computer Science. Since graduation I have worked at 2 Fortune 10 companies and have a great network of other SMCM alumni to connect with. My time at SMCM was great; the small class size, diversity of students, and dedication of the faculty to the success of their students provided a great culture that cultivated learning. I could not be more happy that I made the decision to attend St. Mary's. 

They offer a wide range of on campus housing (dorms, suites, apartments, and town homes) and most students live on campus for all 4 years."
Alum,5,"An excellent school on the water with top notch academics, professors deeply invested in each students future. I was given experiences in the lab and classroom that rivaled master's level work, and far exceeded my peers at other large schools."
Alum,5,St Mary's offers an intimate experience that prioritized building relationships and meeting personally-defined goals.
Alum,5,"The 4 years I spent at SMCM were without exaggeration the best years of my life. I made lifelong friends and challenged myself intellectually, all while enjoying the beauty and serenity of living by the river. Even now, driving around the bend still feels like coming home"
Alum,5,"My experience at St. Mary's College of Maryland was exceptional.
The community of students, staff & professors are all focused on making St. Mary's a special place. The professors are engaging, challenging and present. As a liberal arts institution, the professors focus on developing the students' ability for critical analysis and thinking globally. As a public state college, I was able to get the quality of a private institution but at much more affordable rate. The location on the river is absolutely beautiful and creates a relaxed atmosphere where students can really be themselves. You walk around campus and everyone says hello. The campus community is very well connected and it would not be unusual to go sailing or have lunch with a professor. St Mary's College is truly a special place and even many years later I always feel as if I belong."
Alum,5,"Attended SMCM from 2009-2012. Absolutely loved my time there. I feel that my experience at St. Mary's absolutely shaped me into the person I am today. I learned kindness, compassion, humility, and diversity. Wonderful school."
Alum,5,"St. Mary's will give you the skill sets you need to navigate an increasingly complex and diverse world. The academics are rigorous and class sizes are small - your professors will know your name. You can even design your own major based on your interests, drawing from multiple disciplines. The campus is beautiful, with many aspects of campus life revolving around the St. Mary's River that runs through the campus. Pay the College a visit - there's a good chance you'll get hooked when you round the bend on Route 5 and the River comes into focus on your right. While the campus setting is rural, Washington DC is about 90 minutes away and finding a ride up the road is not hard. There are many clubs and organizations on campus, and there is programming on the weekend. The alumni have a strong affinity to the college community, with many returning each year for Alumni Weekend and also for other events. St. Mary's offers an excellent value and will prepare you well for life."
Alum,5,An excellent and well-regarded college. Beautiful campus. Great prospects for grads looking for higher paying jobs.
Junior,5,"I Transferred to St. Mary's from Salisbury University, and it was quite possibly one of the best decisions I've made in regards to my college career so far. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, the teachers dedicated to the students, and the community has been nothing but accepting toward me, as a student of color. One can find a place for themselves within the many student run organizations or athletic offerings, both inter and intramural. The food options are limited, as the school is pretty small, but everything offered at the dining hall is healthy and diverse. All my professors so far have been passionate about there subjects and more than ready to assist any students struggling or interested learning more about a given subject."
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman at St. Mary's College of Maryland. When I visited St. Mary's for the fist time It felt like home. I knew my parents could leave me here and I'd be fine. I absolutely love it! The only thing that is really annoying are the 2 girls in the next dorm over. They stay up till 2 am and I am a varsity athlete - that makes me cranky.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at St. Mary's. I can't imagine having spent my four years anywhere else.

Tons of student employment opportunities. I didnt get financial aid but I had three part time, on campus jobs which helped a lot.

Professors were always incredibly helpful. Some of the courses are definitely tough academically, but its the honors college of Maryland. Thats what you signed up for. You'll never be taught by a TA or graduate student, always the professor.

Almost everyone lives on campus because housing is really great. All the dorms have WiFi and AC now. Upperclassman housing is super nice. 

Campus is BEAUTIFUL!!! Crime is non existent and people feel comfortable reporting sexual assault when it does happen. Never once felt unwelcome. People throw parties in their houses and just open the doors for anyone to come in. 

TL;DR Best decision I ever made. Never regretted it for a second."
Freshman,5,"I love St. Mary's College of Maryland. Since this is an honors school, the academics are very tough and require a lot of involvement. I would like to see changes in the entry level Principals of Biology courses. I as well as other students believe this course is way too intense for a college freshman to handle. It is very common for many students to have to retake this course."
Alum,5,"I graduated from SMC in 2014 and couldn't be happier with how the curriculum and professors prepared me to be a professional. The college puts a huge emphasis on critical thinking, public speaking, and information literacy that has set me apart in job interviews and selection for office projects. After talking to friends who attended other colleges, I definitely was challenged to achieve more as an undergraduate student. Now as a graduate student pursuing a master's in International Relations, I was much less intimidated by the transition to graduate level work than my classmates. Additionally, the community is very welcoming and the campus is beautiful. "
College Sophomore,5,"The school does everything in its power to assure student's safety. We have blue light boxes all around campus that will call security and most parts of campus are well lit. When large parties are held and people from the surrounding area come to the school, public safety officers and police are very present everywhere around campus. There have been some issues with vandalism from people that come from the town to the surrounding area, but an increase in public safety officers has seemed to help that. I feel very safe on campus at all times no matter how many people I'm with. Because it's so secluded, I dont worry about strangers from the town being on campus very often, and I trust my fellow students not to do anything dangerous or inappropriate."
College Sophomore,5,"After one year at St. Mary's, I cannot wait to return. I love how close knit the community is and how open minded students and staff are to diversity and new ideas. St. Mary's is a place where everyone feels welcome and included. Unlike bigger schools, students at St. Mary's and incredibly friendly and you can't go anywhere without seeing someone you know that will say ""hi"" and ask how your day is going. The professors at the school are equally as friendly as the students. They will not hesitate to get to know you and make sure you're doing well. The staff will definitely challenge the students, but they do it in a way that builds confidence and leaves you feeling proud of your accomplishments. Some of my favorite experiences so far have been having class on the floating docks in the river or in the woods behind the academic buildings. I've been able to experience unique things from building oyster communities to designing and making my own biodiesel. I would, without a doubt, choose St. Mary's over again."
College Junior,5,I don't want to be anywhere else.
College Junior,5,A degree from SMCM means something in the real world
College Junior,5,My time at SMCM has shown me my potential
College Freshman,5,I have enjoyed all my classes so far at this college and have become very close with my professors. The professors get to know you and make sure you always know that you can go to them for help. They make sure that they challenge you
College Freshman,5,Students highly value a degree. The career center is a very accessible resource that many students use to help find internships and post-graduate jobs. Many students continue their education after graduation and attend a grad-school.
College Freshman,5,Our campus is very safe both during the day and night. Our campus is very secluded .
College Freshman,5,Sports are important at our school. Everyone gets involved and goes to games to cheer on their friends.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. From the minute I got there, I realized I made the best decision. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. Everyday you meet someone new and grow closer as a community. The small school atmosphere and our environmental awareness makes us unique. Keep St. Mary's weird."
Recent Alumnus,5,"We're small and rural so there aren't many strangers on campus, and you know who should be around so if anything seems ~suspicious~ it's easy to identify the who/where. As a woman, I felt fine walking home drunk through the woods at 3am, and at all other times. Although, I was scared by a raccoon once."
Recent Alumnus,5,"We're a rural school, so there's not much off-campus stuff. The on-campus housing is where the fun is and where you can hang out for hours with your friends. RA's are involved and care about their hall students, but they're not overly nosy."
College Freshman,5,I feel that the campus and the area around campus is very safe.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the atmosphere and the people at the school, my classes are all engaging and the professors are helpful, it's all around an amazing school."
Freshman,4,"I'm on campus but 4/5 of my classes are online. Surprisingly, it's been great, all things considered - professors really make an effort to reach out and connect with students."
Sophomore,4,"The school is engaging and the community is great. Classes can be challenging, but the small class sizes help a lot. There are many clubs and activities that help make you fit at home."
Alum,4,"St. Mary's is the promise of an amazing community in an amazing place. It can feel like the best place in the world or the worst. It's a very small school very far away from anything, so students tend to become very close or very isolated, and that's why the top two descriptions on here are ""Amazing"" and ""A huge disappointment"".

That said, if you can find your people and your friends, SMCM can be an amazing place. The waterfront location is unrivaled, and the community is wonderful. Students are diverse, 'quirky', and extremely academically focused. I still have many close friendships with professors years after, and though my memories of my time there are conflicted, I can't imagine going to any other school in the US."
Junior,4,"I am in love with SMCM. There are so many amazing people, staff and students alike. It's absolutely gorgeous, has fantastic professors and incredible classes."
Senior,4,"My experience with St. Mary's in regards to their anthropology department is pretty top notch. The teachers are all really experienced and are there to help you learn and work with you to ensure you can apply the skills you have learned for assignments and for real life. The housing is also fairly good, but only if you get a townhouse, suite, or apartment. The food is very diverse with lots of options, but may not be of great quality from time to time."
Freshman,4,"A home away from home! Unfortunately, everything is about twenty minutes out in the closet town. Professors are well educated in their field of study but are not necessarily equipped to teach students."
Sophomore,4,Everyone is really helpful and kind. Anthropology majors are focused mostly toward cultural and archeology than any other field though they offer classes.
Senior,4,"The academics at this college are wonderful.  However, the campus and administration had room to improve.  The school is very much in the middle of nowhere, so if you don't have a car expect to stay on campus almost all the time.  There have also been accusations of wrongful firings and misappropriation of funds against members of the administration recently."
Junior,4,"The best school for academics! Small classes allow me to work closely with my professors. Plus, all the faculty are extremely skilled in their fields and are more than willing to share their knowledge with students. They are attentive and encouraging. The arts programs are also fantastic, especially music and theater. And because the school is small, there are more opportunities to participate in various arts productions. The only downfalls would be the cost and the location. St. Mary's is more expensive than other public Maryland schools, and although the St. Mary's River is beautiful - there is really nothing to do in this rural spot."
Freshman,4,I love St. Marys. The campus life is great. I am a student athlete and participate in multiple clubs on campus. I love the waterfront and the beautiful nature across campus. Despite the student population being “small” I am always meeting new people and making new friends. I’m a biology major and love the science department.
Niche User,4,"First and foremost, I was amazed by the scenes the St. Mary's campus had to offer. The different bodies of water nearby resonated an environmentally conscious community. St. Mary's was small in size but the architecture around made me feel like they maintain most of their surroundings. The campus was very diverse and filled with students who were passionate and energetic about their school. I also favored the idea of the compact class sizes. The classroom size ranged from 10-15 students, with the largest being the seminars which can be up to 25 students. St. Mary's student to teacher ratio is crucial to me because this creates personal connections. These connections can spark ideas, thoughts, and opinions that will eventually boost the student's ability to understand a variety of topics."
Freshman,4,"Wish I didn't drop out, had a really good time and hopefully will be attending again sometime in the future."
Junior,4,"St. Mary's is a beautiful campus. Like all colleges, it has it's issues. The campus works hard to make sure that when there is an issue it gets fixed in a timely manner. The professors are all fantastic and the students (for the most part) are kind and outgoing."
Sophomore,4,I got involved in Athletics however I found it difficult to communicate with the school about billing. I love the atmosphere and it is a very welcoming community.
Niche User,4,"The campus is amazing. Nothing beats a close-knit community right on the water! Every school I visited, I continuously thought to myself ""this is great... but it's not St. Mary's."" Everything is perfect about St. Mary's. The small class sizes, the dedicated teachers, and it's the most affordable waterfront place you can find! The only red flag I see from St. Mary's is the limited majors. Lucky for me, I am studying to be a teacher in the St. Mary's five year teaching program. However, not everyone can be so lucky. The educational side to St. Mary's may not be for everyone, but the campus is to die for!"
Freshman,4,My experience at St. Mary's College of Maryland has been wonderful so far. My professors are great and invested in our education. Everyone here is friendly along with the beautiful landscape of our campus that gives off a pleasant calm needed during the day to day of a college student.
Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus.  Classes are  academically challenging.  Campus is very safe.  Food on campus is very good.   There are a lot of activities and clubs to join.
Niche User,4,"After visiting St. Mary's College of Maryland, I found that it was a quaint campus with a diverse student experience. It offers a wide range of programs for its size and has a great student graduation rate."
College Sophomore,4,They all love minorities but I'm white.
College Sophomore,4,"Courses at this school are tough and you will really have to work for your grade, but you will be extremely well prepared for the work force or graduate school. The professors are very intelligent, but not all are very committed to teaching. For the most part, the teachers are extremely inviting and helpful and want their students to do well. Class sizes are small (usually around 20 or less) which allows the teachers to be on a first name basis with all of their students. There are so many courses offered in areas that you wouldn't expect. Because it's a liberal arts college, you are required to take at least one class in each of 6 topics which lets you experience new things. You'd be surprised at how many peopple change their majors after discovering a new passion that they never would have persued otherwise."
College Freshman,4,"All is well thus far. The teachers and most of the students care, the classes are challenging but not unbearable, and life is grand."
College Freshman,4,"Honestly, I think I'm more likely to be attacked by a wild animal than a person. Student safety took a bit of a blow after the series of arsons last year, but I think stuff like that is a very rare thing."
College Freshman,4,"I don't follow the other sports very much, but crew team(rowing, my sport) is pretty awesome. I joined on a whim and have had fun ever since. The 5:30 am practice times aren't for everyone, but I find the cameraderie more than makes up for it."
College Freshman,4,Infinitely better than high-school. Having people around who actually care about learning makes a big difference.
College Junior,4,Out Title IX coordinator is very effective
College Senior,4,Professors are open and engaging and helpful to students
College Senior,4,I feel generally safe here on campus
College Senior,4,It has a lot to improve on but i still love it
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great. Because it's such a small campus, it's easy to leave your room and walk to class in under 10 minutes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"You have to make an effort to find internships and jobs, because this is real life and you have to put something in to get something out. There are really helpful and dedicated Career Center staff to help you every step of the way, and they continue to help once you've graduated. You get some handholding early on in your first visit to the Career Center, but they're there to help you grow, not write your resume for you."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Break out the blue and gold, SMCM is a small and interconnected community, so you definitely will have a friend who's on a varsity team. And since you're their friend, you have to attend, but you end up having a really good time with everyone."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's small but mighty. A strong community, with rigorous academics."
College Freshman,4,"This campus is one of the safest ones I know about. The only real problem is the fact that people will steal bikes or throw them in the pond (if they are locked). This is a problem that is not unique to our campus, as many other campuses suffer from this, but it is not really one that is out of hand. I often walk around campus late at night (going home from sports games/practices or club meetings) and have never felt threatened. If you do feel unsafe, however, there are plenty of emergency phones that you can use which call Public Safety directly."
College Freshman,4,"I don't really know a lot about this area of the school, but from my understanding it is pretty decent. This schools excels in its biology and anthropology departments."
College Freshman,4,"I've loved my first year at SMCM. The students and faculty have been friendly and I've made lots of friends. Although being a Christian Republican at this school is sometimes hard to do, they are mostly very welcoming. I've connected with my professors and have been made to feel like I am valued and noticed for my efforts. The classes range from 7-30 students. The general size is pretty small, probably around 10-15, but there are a few exceptions. There are many avenues of receiving help if you ever need it: talking to your professor, study groups with other students, meetings with the TA, or even talking to your advisor."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is pretty much divided down the middle when it comes to sports. Half of the school is pretty much regularly involved in sports, the other half isn't. This makes it easy for those who love sports to watch the games, as well as being easy for those who do not wish to participate. The facilities are pretty great and I have taken up rock climbing, which is super fun and very welcoming."
College Freshman,4,"As a rising sophomore, my first year at SMCM has been great. The class were fairly easy to manage and the students and faculty are awesome. As with every institution there will be downsides but for the most part, it is a terrific school that really allows one to grow and is surrounded by the most gorgeous views and activities. If you're not sold by the academics, then the college's waterfront will definitely solidify your choice. Your experience here will mainly depend on how you conduct yourself, if you choose to be negative then you will not enjoy your time here; however, if you get involved an put yourself into new experiences it will be so much fun, I promise you."
College Freshman,4,"The school promotes scholarship and creativity by challenging us to achieve academic excellence through classroom activities, experiential learning, and close relationships with faculty."
College Sophomore,4,"The school as a whole is great. The campus is beautiful, the people are lovely, the academics are nice and challenging, but the one downfall is it is quite expensive."
College Freshman,4,"I like the parties at our school.  If you are looking to go out and find a party, you will find one.  They are most popular in LQ, WC and the Greens.   I would say it has a positive impact on student life.  You are not pressured into drinking anything or doing any drugs, it's a great way to meet people and have a good time!"
College Sophomore,4,Its nice to be off campus sometimes with no rules.
College Sophomore,4,The Public Safety officers are easy to get along with.
College Sophomore,4,Intramural sports are far more competitive than I would have imagined.
College Sophomore,4,"The housing on campus is initially very bland, but once customized, the experience is greatly enhanced."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the campus is beautiful. The athletic facilities are great as well."
College Sophomore,4,The classes are fun and just the right amount of challenging. The professors and fun and engaging.
College Sophomore,4,"People that know about the school know it's a good school. There are a lot of services to help one choose a major and classes, plan an internship, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"It's all beautiful, of course, and the academic buildings are pretty modern. Some of the dorms need work, although I do think that the ones that don't have a/c are actually getting that by the 2014-15 year."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not big into sports, but I am glad that sports aren't the most important thing here."
College Sophomore,4,"I know there are a lot of parties, but I'm not a partier."
College Sophomore,4,"Computer science is hard, and the teaching could be better, but it's alright."
College Sophomore,4,There's lots of work to do for any class you're taking.
College Sophomore,4,"It's pretty isolated, but it's still ballin."
College Sophomore,4,"There are lots of degrees, most of them natural science related."
College Sophomore,4,"If you can make the trip to town, there is food everywhere."
College Sophomore,4,"Stuff happens at night, people party. Personally I don't, but there's always something going on."
College Sophomore,4,The scholarships are alright if you live in maryland.
College Sophomore,4,"There are people from all types of backgrounds, but most people are white."
College Sophomore,4,"Well I'm in my program, so I'd say it's pretty easy"
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at my school are great. Our students are very supportive of our teams, but especially of our mens basketball team who have won championships before. We also have one of the best sailing teams in the country. Many students are involved in sports, weather it is a varsity sport or just intramural or a club team. We have nice athletic facilities."
Alum,2,"There are very good professors on campus and some run very academically rigorous and beneficial courses. Also, the support staff such as the grounds staff and the food service workers are very friendly. If you lived on campus and dealt with the college administration, you know the issues."
Niche User,2,"Avoid this college. Maryland offers much better schools at UMBC, UMD, and Towson. Poor campus environment, inexperienced and possibly incompetent residential life staff, no support from administration, inaccessible instructors - they live out of town and commute to St Marys only to teach their class - then they leave, run-down, cockroach-infested dormitories."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't big focus on sports, varsity or intramural, at my school."
College Student,2,really what you make of it
College Junior,2,There's nothing to do here.
College Junior,2,"Everything is pretty far away, you need to drive for at least 10 minutes to get in to ""town""."
College Junior,2,"If you want to see the school's counseling services; good luck. There's a two week waiting period, and the main psychologist only comes in on Wednesdays."
College Junior,2,"They talk big but nothing really gets done. Keep in mind this is a VERY small school, so anything that happens (that's out of norm) gets blown out of proportion."
College Junior,2,"It's expensive and most of the time will either be broken or dirty. It takes weeks, sometimes even months for them to come fix anything. The heating and cooling system for the buildings is ridiculous; sometimes they turn the heat up so high it feels like a steep room and then a couple of days later they turn it down to a freezer and this is independent of the weather."
College Freshman,2,It makes much more sense to live on campus with all of the options.
College Sophomore,2,I wish I could get more financial aid from the school. It seems like I only get money from the state of Maryland for attending an in state school and my scholarship for being a biology major.
College Sophomore,2,Nightlife is virtually nonexistent for underage students
College Sophomore,2,"There's one dining hall, but the food quality is pretty good. It's very difficult to eat healthy food, though, especially if you're a vegetarian/vegan who doesn't want everything fried/covered in sauce."
College Sophomore,2,"PS does a good job of keeping us safe and usually react pretty well to things going wrong. However, the health center will usually send you off with saline spray or tylenol or a salt gargle as your treatment. More blue lights on campus would be a huge plus, too."
College Sophomore,2,"It's so cold and windy. When it's nice, it's very nice, but usually weather is awful."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want drugs, they're easy to get and PS won't bother you, it seems. If you want to get away from drugs, they are really hard to escape."
College Senior,2,"The best place to go is the bar, the door. On campus is lame"
College Sophomore,2,"Computers are slow and outdated, and printers SUCK unless you are in the library. Pay to print is fair."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a great variety of chain restaurants off campus (Olive Garden, Panera, Burger King, etc.) but they are all at least 15-20 minutes away from campus by car. Very inconvenient, as we are a rural campus."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid office is not very informed, and need based aid cap's out at 6,000."
College Freshman,2,"Workload is absurd and the teachers are horrible at teaching and it bit snobby. This college likes to pretend their Stanford and assigns absurd amounts of work, when really no one outside of Maryland knows about them (it's not like the have a reputation to maintain). Their a bit misguided in terms of their status as a college."
College Freshman,2,"For a little over three thousand a semester you get horrible heating and cooling systems, rats in the bathroom and other bugs, floors that have stains on them, and odd smell coming from different places and pipes that brake often."
College Junior,2,There is not a lot of off-campus housing
College Freshman,2,It's pretty lame. same parties every week and they all end by 1am
College Freshman,2,They aren't very intelligent in the financial aid office and everyone in the office tells you a different thing or to call back later
College Freshman,2,No one cares unless you have to go to the hospital
College Freshman,2,We aren't very good and no one cares much
College Freshman,2,Many of the dorms have cockroach and other bug problems. We lose hot water for days at a time every month or so. The dorms are small and dirty but this usually leads to a close bond with those in your hall.
College Sophomore,2,"They are there but you need to drive, some what far to get to them, which is not always convenient. "
College Freshman,2,"You need a car on this campus. We're pretty isolated, and public transportation doesn't exist. If you don't have a car, you will soon be friends with someone that does. "
College Junior,2,Nope. Nope nope nope. Southern Maryland is not a place I could see myself living. The campus is very accepting but outside it is mainly white and unsettling. There is no museums or buses or shopping places (except Target and places like that). I'd rather live in the city. 
College Junior,2,"Ahhh, campus nightlife. I remember a time when the campus' nightlife was sprawling with fun and joy. Music. Drinks. Good dance parties. It twas so long ago. (2 years ago). Now campus life sucks. For drinks you're gonna have to pay for your own (or have very generous friends. Or be on a sports team). People drink on the weekends but there is always only one dance party to go to. And it probably is either not populated and bad, or too populated and creepy. "
College Junior,2,"You need a car on campus or a friend with one if you're looking to go into town or go home for the weekend. If no friends have cars on campus, though, it's pretty easy to get a ride there and back using the Ride Board on Facebook. The school also provides large vans to pick people up from the airport, which is about 1-2 hours away from campus by car. "
College Sophomore,2,"The closest place with the most variety of food is a 15 minute drive from campus, but there are a lot of restaurants, from food chains to special restaurants."
College Sophomore,2,"The next big place to buy anything is at least a 15 minute drive, where there are many shops and restaurants. There are a few close ones, and a few close places that students go to hang out, but there aren't many."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know too much about the sports. While they are there and important to some, they aren't that big in terms of the whole school. "
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the academic buildings have their own computer labs, and the library has an ample amount of computers. There is wireless in the center of campus as well as in the academic buildings. In order to get internet access in the residence buildings you need either an Ethernet cable or a wireless router. The speed and reliability are good for a college, and the school provides $20 for printing each semester, which is more than enough. You don't necessarily need a computer, but it definitely helps if things are busy or just for convenience."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are too many girls. With the sheer amount you are going to find attractive ones. However guys are a lot harder to come by. So if he's attractive you can bet he's either taken or gay, and half of the time *both*."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's like, if you want it, ask for it. If you don't just go about your business, and if you go to parties just say no. There is no real external pressure to do it, you do it because you are bored and like killing brain cells on your spare time from doing the crap tons of work they assign you."
College Sophomore,2,"There's no usable bus system and I don't even think we have a taxi service near St. Mary's. If you go to St. Mary's, you either need to have a car or know somebody who does. Luckily, there are a lot of drivers at this school."
Niche User,1,"Nothin, Selfish Administration, that don't care about the academic progress and what is good for students.  makes decisions for themselves without asking students opinions."
Alum,1,"Going to this college was by far the worse decision that I have ever made in my life, and because I was stupid enough to fall for their fake artificially infused nice charm. Moreover, I am still being personally hurt by my decision to attend this college, years later. The college is full of elitist, non-minority students, with loaded parents. Because of this, the college seems to actively ignore its public origins and morale obligations, and they try to disassociate themselves from State of Maryland while still actively taking the states money. It is truthfully, a morale disgrace what they are doing. Because you essentially, on a per capita basis, have tons of money being spent on creating an environment for well off students, while completely under-funding all support services for students with disabilities and low incomes students."
Alum,1,"Going to SMCM was one of the greatest mistakes of my life.  The academics are markedly inferior. “Core” requirement classes are a joke. I learned more actual biology in the 10th  grade. The requirements for English majors are abysmally low. The majority of class time is wasted in endless, circular discussions. (A class discussion can be a good teaching method only if it is effectively led and these were not. The same handful of students just rambled on for an  hr or more.I eventually stopped going)
The administration is completely inflexible, especially for the absurd amount of money that you’re paying. They are completely inconsistent in applying any and all rules. They make it difficult to transfer and they do not accept many transfer credits.

There are zero real  job or internship opportunities on campus.
In short, save your money and go to community college or a state school.

As a caveat, I attended over a decade ago and maybe things have improved."
Alum,1,"This is was one of the , if not worst experience of my life. If you're a minority this school is going to steal your soul. I'm suffering from PTSD after only two years spent on that campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most of the students have titles like Barista, Dishwasher, Stocker, Bus boy, and Janitor after getting a degree at this college. I know so many student still working low end manual labor jobs after graduating. A friend of mine has been a dishwasher three years after graduating still, and I just took a job as a busboy after months of no job offers (no one wants people with a Liberal Arts degree). Yet the student loans will still want their money from your min wage pay."
Recent Alumnus,1,Worst college housing in the state. Most of the dorms have roaches.
College Senior,1,"In response to the recent review post that say ""St Mary's is and accepting, challenging, and wonderful school.

1. The core curriculum is a complete joke that prepares you for nothing, and the degrees are good for one thing (knowing how to file for unemployment).

2. Your clearly from admissions, because you sound just like the school brochure (and use the talking points that the tour guides use). 

3. The school is falling apart (except for where the administrative offices are....)

4. Also, your right St, Mary's is an academic challenge in busy work, not things you really need to know. 

5. The school costs ways to much for what you get.

6. There are mice are everywhere in library. 

7. It's full of uptight teachers and students who pretend it a good college, which is almost laughable when you compare it to other state college.

8. All the extra work students do is worthless, because most people don't even know the SMCM even exists in the state. And no future employer cares about the ""Liberal Arts"".  

9. Going to SMCM is probably one of the worst experiences on my entire life. 

10. There is a total lack of services, such as tutoring, on campus to assist students."
College Junior,1,"I'm saying its the worst because recently I realized how bad the sexual assault and rape issue is at SMCM. The OCR has started an investigation and already they found out that the sailing team had some sort of hazing going on that involved sexual assault. I don't feel safe here and none of my friends do. The school administration is really trying to push students who are trying to bring this issue into the open down. Recently some girls were assaulted and this guy had a ton of complaints about him but I heard his family paid a huge amount to the school to let him off. Honestly a lot of girls here are scared because the administration is not doing anything and doesn't want to do anything. They keep shoving us away and are trying to expel/get rid of girls who are complaining. We're scared and don't know what to do anymore without getting in trouble. That's why I came here to speak out, so seriously think twice before you come here."
College Sophomore,1,We dont have Greek Life
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"Some students are trying to get a shuttle service to stores in town because the ""ghost bus"" is so awful. Also, I've heard that PS will drive you to a doctor's office if the health center is closed."
College Senior,1,Public safety has changed. Not what it used to be about just keeping us safe
College Freshman,1,"The majors are totally nonspecific, completely research based with very little hands on work and they all require grad school to ever make a career"
College Freshman,1,"There is one bar and coaches, professors, TA's, RA's and students alike all go there so things get awkward."
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,There isn't any. Bring your own car or be stuck on campus endlessly
College Freshman,1,"The campus is located in the middle of nowhere, and hardly any transportation is provided.  All that there is is a shuttle to BWI airport at the beginning and end of breaks and a van that shuttles students back to campus from the local bar if they're too drunk to drive."
College Freshman,1,"There is pretty much no off-campus housing, unless of course you are willing to drive quite a ways. Some students commute, but its a 30-45 minute drive every day"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The dorms/common rooms/furniture look like they haven't been refurbished in over 20 years. Some bathrooms are horrendous, and determined by which dorm and floor you live pests, such as cockroaches and mice may make a temporary appearance before you complain enough for them to bring in the exterminators (maids with pest killing/trapping supplies). Last year, cold air was blowing out from air vents during the winter and heat in the summer. Yeah, housing is certainly a reason people decide to enroll elsewhere, that and the insanely low population rates of boys compared to the claustrophobic sea of girls."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid is rough. Being out-of-state, I barely get anything. There are two main scholarship programs, Nitze scholars and DeSousa Brent scholars. From what I can tell, they are great programs, but are very selective. If you aren't selected freshman year, you can apply for Nitze for sophomore year. If you don't make it then, you're SOL. I'm sure financial aid is much better for in-state, but out-of-state is really a stretch if you don't have better than average finances."

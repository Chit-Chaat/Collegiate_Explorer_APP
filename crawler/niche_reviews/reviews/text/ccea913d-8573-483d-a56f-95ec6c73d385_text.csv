Freshman,5,"The staff is so incredibly friendly and the teachers are down to earth, at least in the Medical Assistant classes. The process to getting enrolled was so easy. I am returning back to school after 6 years and 3 kids so I had no idea where to start. They walked me through it and made everything easy to understand and do. Totally recommend this school to anybody wanting to get back in after a long period of time off."
Freshman,5,Clover park technical college is a very well structured school with high success rates. Everybody is friendly and determined to do well. This school takes pride in your education and allows people to grow. I would like to see more programs implemented because I believe everybody should experience this atmosphere.
Freshman,5,"Clover park is highly recommended among a large amount of alumni and students. The campus is easy to navigate. The curriculum is very  great, and they also offer the option to receive an associate's degree in cosmetology! Most schools do not offer that for the particular program. The party life is close to nonexistent. There are mainly older people that attend this school because they offer a wide variety of skilled trades."
Freshman,5,The experience at Clover Park Technical College is more than rewarding. One thing that I find very useful is the tutoring center since they often have tutors that understand how to help you. I would like to see more food in the cafeteria though.
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled at Clover Park Technical College and have been going for three quarters and I really enjoy it. It has a beautiful campus with amenities that will help you be a successful college student.

Freshman,5,"The staff is so helpful, being there makes me feel welcomed. I myself tried attending two different colleges and none of them were able to help me as much as Clover Park Technical College, because of the staff, the scenery and the environment i now have a college i can call my own."
Freshman,5,Clover Park is awesome!! They have an amazing VA office and everyone is very friendly and helpful. I am going through the Professional Pilot program and it is top notch.
Sophomore,5,"The experience has been astounding, the staff are quite respectful and responsible, the students are quite dependable and really intelligent on aspects on things i was confused on at first, and everything else is a fun experience overall i love this school and everything in it!"

Alum,5,Really friendly environment. The teachers actually care and know what they are teaching. They have a great student life as far as getting everyone together for meet and greats.
Sophomore,5,"Out of all the colleges I have attended I really like clover park over all of them for so many reasons, one being the staff is really committed to the success of each student. Secondly most of the instructors are either in college themselves or were once students there which really give them and edge and making them able to relate to us as students. Thirdly they have free tutoring centers with current students and instructors which makes its really nice to get that extra help you need but cant afford to get help outside of school."
Freshman,5,"its a very large campus, i wouldn't change anything important i do wish it was in a better neighborhood but most of the riff raff stays off campus"
Freshman,5,Clover Park is a friendly and supportive environment that offers hands-on programs that teach real skills to students so they are ready and qualified to enter the workforce and embark on rewarding careers. It's affordable and has many helpful student services.

College Senior,5,There is a very diverse amount of students to meet and talk to.
College Senior,5,The career center is a huge help. Some students coming into the school didn't even know how to make a resume before they went there. Even some of the teachers can give you information on job openings in your subject.
College Senior,5,The schools courses are hands on so your able to understand what your doing a little better. the class sizes are reasonable and there are plenty of different courses to take depending on what your interest is.
College Senior,5,The teachers for graphic technology are amazing. They will literally teach you everything to know with graphic design starting from the very begging on how to use certain computers and art aspects.
Recent Alumnus,5,Les Sessoms has been a great navigator for my educational future.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Really, every teacher I have had was fantastic.  Every one of them cared deeply aabout bringing the best out in their student.  The school is diversified beautifully.   I love it!"
Recent Alumnus,5,I have nothing bad to say about Clover Park Technical College.  I hope God blesses it more and more.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Real life training and information from my PH.d who was extremely well versed. Work load was fullfilling and relevant to applying to my future work.  Plenty of variety in attaining internships or jobs.

What I loved best is that my Professor had a PH.d from learning from the best teachers in the field and he shared as much as he could with his cohort."
Recent Alumnus,5,"All the teachers I have experienced have been exceptionally dedicated especially ABE and ESL teachers. I've never known such dedicated people, except my gradeschool teachers when I was a child."
College Junior,5,One of the better schools I have been too. The student body is very easy to get along with. Very diverse campus as well.
College Senior,5,The classes are good size with a lot of real world experience. Many of the staff have worked in the industry so they know what they are talking about.
College Senior,5,"This school is geared to get people trained in a new career and get them back into the working world as quickly as possibly, yet still giving plenty of time to truly learn the skill."
College Senior,5,"There are jobs in my field EVERYWHERE! I have already done a few side ""jobs"" from outside people and the staff were great resources to help me complete them."
College Senior,5,"Most of the staff and faculty are there to help you and support you, come what may."
College Junior,5,"This school has great programs, but once you're in the program you have to stick to its schechudlw. And there is not enough of evening classes."
College Junior,5,"We use canvas and it is well organized, online help is provided at all times teacher are quick on their replies to any q."

College Sophomore,5,The school has started a new bachelors program in operations management.  This program has been designed around the program i am currently in.  This will make for an easy transition
College Sophomore,5,The professors for the aviation program are very helpful and willing to teach the subject.  It is clear their passion lies within this industry and it makes for a fun learning environment
College Sophomore,5,Being in the aviation program is very different from the rest of the school.  We have our own campus located on an airport which gives us lots of opportunity for hands on/real world learning.
College Sophomore,5,The instructors are great and are always willing to work with you.  The hands on learning greatly benefitted me.  And the school offer s a career portal where you can search for jobs in your field.
College Junior,5,It's great. So helpful and totally worth every penny.
College Junior,5,Honestly this school is the best. Everyone is so helpful and I would recommend this school to everyone interested in hands on learning.
College Junior,5,There are so many courses that it makes it very easy to work around my work schedule.
College Junior,5,The courses were great but I myself don't excel well in online courses.
College Junior,5,Everyone holds you to a standard to finish your degree but it's nice to have that motivation.
College Junior,5,I honestly haven't had any issues with these. The class sizes are the perfect size and the teachers make sure they have individual time for each student.
College Senior,5,Most students from my program easily find employment.
College Senior,5,I already have a job & internship lined up because of my program's reputation!
College Senior,5,The Histotechnology program is absolutely amazing & I couldn't recommend it more highly.
College Senior,5,"I love, love, love the teachers at CPTC, they are hands-on and they are well versed in their subject area. The class sizes are also very functional, not too crowded. In my case they are perfect,  allowing for the right amount of interaction between teachers and students. CPTC has one of the best cosmetology program around. The teachers are very knowledgeable and caring. They care about seeing each student excel and perform to the best of their ability. The courses are diverse and offer indebt knowledge and training in the field of cosmetology."
College Junior,5,They take their time to teach you a variety of different approaches.
College Senior,5,"I love my program. The teachers in this program are amazing. They are so hands on and supportive, but also let us make our own mistakes so that we learn and can take our skills out into the real world. It's fun, and exciting, and I love every second of it. There is not a lot of book work which is a plus. It is probably 90% hands on which is definitely my kind of place. And at the end of the program the teachers help you find places to work which is definitely so helpful. Love it!"
College Senior,5,"I love the Clover Park cosmetology department with all my heart. Ms. Klug, Ms. Trish, and Ms. Carine are some of the most excellent teachers I have ever experienced. They are hands on but not in a way that is overwhelming or intrusive. I had heard that is had the best cosmetology department in Washington and they were right. I love this program and would definitely choose this again."
College Junior,5,Staff and faculty are very welcoming and they make sure we know what to do as far as becoming a student. They were such a big help when it came to paper work and I'm glad they could help me figure out the registration process.
College Senior,5,"The staff, students, and teachers are all amazing . Very helpful and always know just what we need to get by and graduate."
Junior,4,"The school its self is nice. I can not speak for other programs, but the nursing program has been a bit unorganized. Some of the teachers have acted crazy, never to be seen again."
Freshman,4,Great school for students who would like to go to college but not one of the bigger university . The professors are truly wonderful and work well with all of the students on campus
Sophomore,4,"I am a current student at Clover park technical college, and I have actually been going to this school since 2010. I am currently in the medical assisting program, It is an AA degree, and I cant wait to get in the field, and finish. In the past years, I was in school for massage therapy, I came back 3-4 years later to start this medical assisting program. I had taken a break from school, due to work, and I am back to finish what I started 4/5 years ago. I love this school. I couldn't see me going to another technical college. It just feels ""like home""."
Freshman,4,"As a Clover Park Technical College student, my experience here has been enlightening,  as a Chicago native, I have been opened to a whole new diversified culture at this college. The teachers are engaging and seem to really enjoy what they do which as a college student is an important part of the learning experience. The curriculum that I am taking will no doubt help me achieve the goals I have set forth to myself."
Freshman,4,clover park is a great school. Can be a bit crazy at times to find buildings and such but he people are very nice.
Niche User,4,"I'm currently applying for Clover Park and will soon be registering for my classes. From what I've seen and heard, the professors are great, and the academics are some of the nation's best. I live near the area of the campus, and I know that there is good food and activities nearby as well. This college would be a good investment."
Junior,4,"Clover Park Technical College is a very good school to go to for any programs! I’m in the Automotive Program, and it’s been an amazing 1 and half year. The teachers were sooo helpful and you can learn from them easily. I got a part time job going into my second quarter of the program."
Freshman,4,I love the variety of courses CPTC offers. It's the only school in the area that had the program I was looking for and the professors teaching it are passionate about their industry. The hours are consistent and the staff wants you to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Clover Park is a good school. Like anything, there are bad sides and good sides. Most of the teachers seem genuinely engaged with their students, and love working to improve lives. The campus is clean, well lit, patrolled by security, lots of parking, has on site daycare for parents, and lots of student involvement events happening every week. Really, the only negative I've personally dealt with is the Financial Aid office. You have to be able to navigate it mostly on your own, unless you get one of the few helpful people in that department. You have to ask the questions, and make the appointments. You will not be notified if you are missing paperwork, so you have to watch the portal like a hawk, every day."
College Senior,4,just hassles with financial aid
College Senior,4,all my credits transferred over from another college
College Senior,4,Workload is massive but I will have a life long career afterwards.
College Senior,4,My classes are from 9 in the morning til about some where in the afternoon. Its flexible enough for me to balance my school work and stuff I have to do at home.
College Senior,4,There's a lot going into the school when it comes to help. There are job opportunities at the school and financial aid and counseling. All the staff are pretty helpful but it can get kind of busy in the financial aid and counseling building.
College Senior,4,The teachers here are some the best. If you need help their there for you. And if your more for hands on learning go here. You will leave this school knowing more then what you started with.
College Senior,4,Many people tend to not know how great a school and its members can be. Clover park is a great campus with lots of different backgrounds and educational goals. Many students are willing to engage a ton with professors and have the drive to complete course study
College Senior,4,"So far, friends have said its really great. Very informative and information isn't overkill"
College Senior,4,Faculty members are great! Very helpful and friendly. Willing to work 1 on 1
College Junior,4,The convenience at Clover Park is really good. The library has plenty of textbooks and books in general that you can access. I love how flexible you can be with your schedule. You can either have morning classes or evening classes. Great variety.
College Junior,4,"I have so far used 2 online courses. A math program Called Hawkes Learning and an English program called Learning Curve. I have used Canvas before. And so far, the online programs I actually like. They are very clear with what to do and is very easy to understand in my honest opinion."
College Junior,4,"The alumni, student government, and financial people help make sure that students have the tools needed to make it in the so called, Real World."
College Junior,4,There are plenty of job opportunities for students and for jobs.
College Junior,4,"I have only been going here for 2 ongoing 3 quarters. But the experience has been great. Staff, students and the office people are very easy to approach. There are plenty of things to study, so you have plenty of options. Overall, great school."
College Senior,4,"The program instructors are wonderful. Some of the academic teachers (english, speech) are not so helpful."
College Senior,4,They work hard with all the students to help them find work.
College Junior,4,School offers places for great internships programs and are helping you to find a good place for your career
College Junior,4,"Programs are organized very well. It is easy to find out what class you have to take and which time. However,  the suplies needed are not available until quarter starts which could make things difficult."
College Sophomore,4,"my experience at this school has been nothing but wonderful.  I had heard great things about the school before attending, and i am so happy i chose this over the other two schools i was looking at"
College Sophomore,4,There is a career portal on the clover park website that allows students to search for jobs in their career feild.  it is updated almost daily.
College Senior,4,"My program is outstanding, but I was less impressed with my prerequesites & those instructors."
College Senior,4,clover park technical college is really i my opinion the best technical college in washinton state. I join the automotive club last year in spring with no real knowledge what so ever on engine or transmissions. since my enrollment into the program i have rebuild my own engine and transmission on my personal vehicles with the help of the ASE Master Technicians instructors clover park has to teach the program sections.
College Senior,4,"It was easy to transfer credits from my old school, I thought it would be a hassle and a headache, the staff were very helpful which made for a smooth transition. The curriculum is great and well thought out, functional and practical on relation to majors. The one frustration I had was not being informed that I would be short hours for financial aid if I started summer semester. I still would have started, but I would have made better preparation had I known."
College Senior,4,I have done online courses at other colleges and I must say CPTC is anoung the best. It was easy to navigate the online system. Canvas was easy to submit assignments and interact with students as well as teachers.
College Senior,4,"The opportunity to work in our field arise mainly in the prospect of charity. Alot of charity organizations partner with CPTC cosmetology department, this offers an opportunity to practice and hone our craft in real world situations. Alot of industry professionals also come to CPTC to teach classes, seminars and offer insite in the beauty industry to prepare us for our transition into the workforce. CPTC is geared on it's students being work ready right after graduation. The huge difference between CPTC and other beauty colleges is that they help you prepare not just for the workforce but for the state board as well. It just proves how vested they are in the all rounded success of their students."
College Senior,4,"The Cosmetology program at Clover Park is awesome. Being able to work hands-on while learning affords you a unique ability to live what you're learning. The work load prepares you for the real world. The Cosmetology facilities here at Clover Park are amoung the best, everything you need to prepare you for the workforce is available, including products and equipments. The kits that are required is another great aspect as it too serves to transition you into the workforce."
College Senior,4,"The teachers, at least in my program are very hands-on. I tried other colleges before, but the programs here are geared towards making you workforce ready. There are lots of resources both on campus and online to help you. Overall it has been a great, fulfilling experience attending Clover Park."
College Sophomore,4,Not frustrating at all right now.
College Sophomore,4,I have no idea right now since I'm just starting school.
College Sophomore,4,So far the school is great and the facility is great in helping everyone.
College Junior,4,They have been extremely helpful.
College Senior,4,"My cosmetology classes have been amazing with the exception of second quarter with Ms. Michelle. I honestly don't feel like I learned a single thing in that quarter. She was incredibly unhelpful and was never around. Also Bill Herring was a questionable teacher. He decided not to show up to the last day of class and I received a ""D"" in his class because he didn't come to class and I was unable to complete my test. So that sucked."
College Junior,4,I love this school and the program I am in. The instructor's are very knowledgeable and they make it a great place to go to school at...
College Senior,4,"I have attended Clover Park TC for two quarters already, and i'm enrolled for another two quarters. In my time here, the teachers have been helpful, and the counselors have always been above and beyond"
College Senior,4,"The financial aid department/personnel need a course in dealing with people.  I realize they hear the same questions all day, but not from me.  They tend to talk down to people.  The financial aid paperwork is a bit daunting and the folks who review it, take their time about it, leaving students wondering what is going on for way too long.  Even when they get the paperwork needed, if they lose it, they take it out on the student as if the student did not turn it in on time.

Although I am disabled and of low income, I did not receive full financial aid, which is unbelievable.  Even with assistance from the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation there was still a portion I had to come up with.  It is hard to understand while one student gets everything covered and the next does not.  There does not seem to be any rhythm or reason to the acceptance of financial aid."
College Sophomore,4,The value of a degree from this school is very important to me and I want to learn more and have a great education and degree and that's what I know I will have when I am done.
College Sophomore,4,"There is such a wide range of diversity at the school and it is accepted and people mostly accept people for who they are now days, I don't notice any challenges really."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of classes and programs to choose from that are offered at that school so students have a good variety. It seems like the same instructors stick around and teach the same classes/programs so you know what to expect if you have already had a specific instructor before which is nice. Most of the curriculum format is similar but still varies from instructor to instructor. The class registration process is very easy; I really like how they have it set up so that it is simple and hassle free! The workload is generally pretty heavy in all of the classes, but if you show up to class and take notes it's okay. Sometimes the instructors will let us study in the labs so that you can have the ""hands on studying"" which is helpful!"
College Junior,4,"The professors are friendly and helpful, we have manageable class sizes, and overall it's a great experience."
College Junior,4,You have lots of options and people are willing to work with you.
College Junior,4,We have a great ASG (Associated Student Government) that throws lots of on and off campus activities
College Senior,4,"I like the flexibility that online classes provide, but do miss the in class discussions and input/questions from other students."
College Senior,4,"The teachers I work with are incredible people.  They are so enthusiastic about their subjects and are always going the extra mile to help students in class, as well as connect them with outside resources if they would like to delve into other avenues of study."
College Senior,4,"From what I can see so far, its pretty good!  Graduated students stop by often and talk to us about the jobs they started upon graduating.  New job openings are posted in class, and companies often call and ask if there are students available to come work for them."
College Senior,4,"We are working with the most up to date versions of the computer programs we are learning, and get to use industry standard high tech computers.  We are learning on what the industry expects us to be able to use which is very helpful."
College Senior,4,"My college offers a nice selection of core classes for general education requirements, and offers a wide variety of specialized technical courses.  I am lucky in that I know the area I want to study, but am still exposed to a variety of other fields.  If another subject inspired me I feel like it would be easy to study different areas of academia."
College Senior,4,"Our teachers are in contact with several businesses in our area of study and constantly post job opportunities for graduating students.  As far as what the school administration provides for graduates, I'm not aware yet of the help they offer for job placement assistance."
College Senior,4,"Overall it has been pretty easy getting into my college, and the staff in my area of study are phenomenal.  They are very accommodating to life circumstances, are very encouraging, helpful, and really care about their students.  They actually practice what they preach which is incredibly refreshing and reassuring.  It makes me feel very secure in continuing my education at this school because I feel like the staff will help me out if life starts to run me over.  There are rules and deadlines of course, but they make it very easy to deal with life on top of classes."
College Junior,4,i went to clover park before to get my cna. im returning because it was a great experience
College Junior,4,The scheduling is easy and user friendly
College Junior,4,"I do not currently have a personal computer, so I have been utilizing the computer lab or computer classroom almost daily. The computer lab is a spacious room with comfortable chairs and proper lighting. It always has available computers and the staff is very helpful. I have not had any difficulty with network reliability or speed, and printing is available for 5 cents a page."
College Junior,2,Tuition is expensive and I couldnt get any financial help because my parents take home income is too high but their expenses are too high to help me
College Junior,2,I wish they would treat all the programs fairly and make sure students have the tools to succeed
College Junior,2,Nobody has talked to me or anyone I know about after we graduate
College Junior,2,I havent taken online courses but from what ive heard they can be difficult to navigate and are not always working for students to do their work
College Junior,2,We dont have many computers we have to share 1 among about 60 students in our building
College Junior,2,"I do not like how the financial aid office is ran here.  They only let me get 4 quarters of financial aid,  of which I had to take out loans and pay tuition that way and would not let me use my pell grant that was awarded to me.  I do not think that was fair at all.  I am not in 8,000 of debt from student loans to pay tuition when I could have used my award."
College Senior,2,I would prefer that an actual supervisor is available to assist you instead of working students. I do not like the fact that we have to tell them detailed information in order for them to go to their supervisor to gain the answer.
College Junior,2,Minimal Resources – The school had minimal resources it was mainly focused on the program you take there isn't much other stuff to do. No sports and minimal extra curricular activity
College Junior,2,"Its a Technical College – Its a technical college so they didnt have sports, clubs were minimal, they had a student center, library, and cafe."
College Sophomore,2,"Like Other Campuses – clover park is simliar to other campuses, its has a library, activities, and student center."
Senior,1,teacher wont order books bookstore wont get books but they will hold onto the 500 dollars in my account...teacher really just gave a test and no book i payed tuition out of pocket and now im waiting on financial aid they gave me 72 bucks for the whole quarter. and payed my tuition not realizing i payed for it so i could get help with books and gas... signed up for a class didnt get a grade for it got a grade for a class i never took.  the teacher never ordered books and gave us tests... open book tests...what heck are there two ... two teachers teaching the same thing in the same class...how to build steps im trying not to get angry ... the state messed up on my FAFSA. I had no gas no food and no help in the fall quarter ...oh and get this the teacher wont know what hes teaching you have to figure it out for yourself then let him know... i told him and two students and the staff told him order books at library ...lybrary aint ordering nothing IM ANGRY INRAGED
College Senior,1,"With cosmetology being so intensive and having to pile on core math classes I have had to quit my job and am basically in financial dire straights. It has been incredibly stressful and I wish I could just get my certificate without having to get my AAT. Also transferring AP credits from high school has been impossible, but not because of CPTC. Clover park just isnt listed on the college board website."
College Junior,1,I do not like the way the determine financial aid here at all. 
College Junior,1,"Although my college focuses on academics, we lack any athletic department. I wish there was a gym or sport team that I or other students can get involve in. Then again it can cause our tuition rate to go skyrocket."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The financial aid office is a pain (but I think it is at any school, I've attended a couple different ones and had a set of issues with each). MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERY SLIP OF PAPER THEY REQUIRE TURNED IN SUPER EARLY, they are slow. Also, if you have concerns or questions, the people that sit at the front desk are rude and don't follow their own rules (they post a sign that says if you are not polite, then you won't be helped). I have tried to talk to them with respect, but it's so hard when they are rude, cut off your questions, and the answer is always to wait that you'll find out when it's processed but they don't know when it's going to be processed. I have had to wait several months. The actual paper work is not hard to fill out, it's just ridiculous that they ask the same thing multiple times. I've also had friends that was trying to take out a personal school loan from their bank, and the financial aid office said that she could not take out a student loan from her bank, and refused to accept the money from the bank. The nice thing is (not that this has to do with financial aid necessarily) but if you don't want the hassle of dealing with the financial aid office and are willing to pay out of pocket, the school has now set up a program for making payments to pay for school."

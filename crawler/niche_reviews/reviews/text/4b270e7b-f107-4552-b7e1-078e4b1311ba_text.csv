Freshman,5,My online experience has not been difficult at all. It's been pretty much a smooth ride altogether. no complaints here at all.
Freshman,5,"There are not too many online courses.  Most are hybrid courses where one day is in person and the next is online, but when it is online the teachers do an amazing job."
Freshman,5,I love JU so far.  The teachers are extremely helpful and I am so happy with the choice I made to come here.
Sophomore,5,The staff has made it very easy to transition to the campus. They have made it easy to understand that is going on with my account and they have kept us informed with safety measures on campus.
Freshman,5,I love JU.  The professors are always on your side and do everything they can to help you succeed.  The school is in an amazing area with tons of things to do.  Campus is gorgeous - always clean and the school does everything they can to provide new and exciting amenities for their students and athletes.
Graduate Student,5,Our instructors are making sure they keep up with emails daily and grades during this difficult time. They give feedback when necessary. Online learning is new to us because of COVID but everyone has made the best of it. We are constantly being updated on future plans to return.
Graduate Student,5,I loved this school from the moment I applied.  Everyone was very helpful through the application process answering my questions or giving me extra time to find certain documents I needed. All the teachers have been very approachable and willing to find answers to questions they do not know. The campus is beautiful and well maintained.
Senior,5,The online experience has been impressive and help is easy to access. Professors are easy to communicate with and want their students to succeed.
Senior,5,"I am enrolled in their online program and his has been fantastic. Lots of resources available, and good communication."
Senior,5,"I rather enjoy being at Jacksonville University. The staff are very helpful and willing to work with you, they've even helped me to fit a second major into my schedule while finishing on time. Being a small school, the experience with the teachers and other students is excellent and you are able to develop a relationship with the staff rather than being just another face in the crowd. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus, as well as for students to take the lead in making decisions and planning events."
Alum,5,"Definitely provides opportunities you wouldn't have at bigger schools. With smaller class sizes, students also have overall stronger relationships with professors."
Alum,5,"The opportunities I received while at JU has helped shape the employee and person I am today. JU offered me a scholarship so that I could afford to go to this small private school. No more than 15-20 students were in a class so it really improved my education. I was able to get comfortable with my professors, improving the connections I was able to build prior to graduating. I double majored in dance and kinesiology and I would not change this decision. The only change I would like to see at this university is ensuring that all the arts students get the opportunity to perform. I noticed while I was in attendance at this school, the same students were selected to perform in every dance piece so not everyone had equal learning opportunities."
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville University is a very beautiful campus. The campus is inhabited by a variety of huge, green trees.  As soon as you walk on campus you get a happy and relaxing vibe. The staff at JU is also very friendly and welcoming. They can answer any questions you have and they make sure they get to know each of their potential student's personally."
Freshman,5,what I like about Jacksonville is that the university has many different ways to get involved with the community and the school.
Sophomore,5,I love Jacksonville University because it accepts all religions and races of people from all over the world and this is really important as it creates a condusive comfortable environment for students to pursue there careers.
Niche User,5,The teacher to student ratio is extremely low which makes learning and such a lot easier since there’s more one on one time available
Freshman,5,Its a big school with a lot of different things to do. They have very nice professors who are very helpful in making sure that you pass the class. They have different resources available for their students.
Junior,5,A degree from Jacksonville University is regarded highly in your professional work place. I can't wait to complete my MSN in education.
Niche User,5,I would like to see the athletics improve and the student life to have more school spirit and get more involved. Maybe have the football games later in the day so more people would come.
Graduate Student,5,"Jacksonville University is an excellent academic school.  Upon graduating, I felt I was prepared for the future of my profession.  The classes were challenging, I and I feel that I received a top of the line education.  The professors were accessible and were available for assistance when the student needed them.  I completed my Bachelor degree and have since been accepted for my Graduate degree.  If you had asked me a few months ago what I would change, I would say the cost per credit, but they have since lowered their tuition.  If you are looking for a top-notch education, I would recommend Jacksonville.  They do offer online classes as well as the traditional educational tract."
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville University has one of the most polite and helpful staff that I have ever met. I came from a high school where a lot of the staff were not helpful when I needed information. But my choice to attend Jacksonville University was a great choice. Through every step of the admissions process, I had a staff member call or email me to let me know what the next steps were or to answer any questions I had. I felt at home from day one and I am looking forward to the wonderful education I will be receiving."
Senior,5,"The reason I love JU is because it is such a community based. Everyone knows everyone and I am a very shy student, so being able to get to know people at this school has really been a good experience."
Sophomore,5,"I liked how involved some professors can be with their students to help us succeed. I would like to change the student involvement and become more of a community, because school spirit is lacking."
Senior,5,"Being in the Nursing program at JU, the smaller class sizes they offer make it more achievable in successfully passing their courses geared to become a registered nurse."
Niche User,5,"I haven’t actually started at Jacksonville University yet; I commence on the 26th of August; however, I’ve been researching about it and I’ve read/heard so many wonderful things. I love the programs they have to offer, I love the campus and how it sits on so much land and is near the water (makes it feel like home), and I love that the student body is so diverse, yet so small and intimate."
Graduate Student,5,"I like that Jacksonville University is a smaller university with a smaller student population. It creates a close-knit group of students that work together towards a common goal. A smaller class size also allows for easier communication between professors and students. I am able to contact my professors easier, whether through email or office hours, that make it easier for me to have my questions answered."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Jacksonville University is the spacious, clean, campus that's provided for us students. Also, the diversity level is almost perfect; it's no PWI (predominately white institution) and it's not an HBCU (historically black college/university), it's the perfect combination. The facilities provided to us like a pool, gym, library and little food spots around campus almost feel like you're at home. I enjoy the professors a lot their hard-working understanding and relatable in every way making the college experience a little better every year."
Freshman,5,Jacksonville University is such a diverse community. My favorite aspect of JU is the eagerness of all students and faculty members to help one another to ensure in one's success.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love JU; the campus is gorgeous and the small class sizes really let you connect with your peers and professors.
Graduate Student,5,"Recently, I got accepted to the BSN program, but, before I applied to the university, the adviser was very helpful and gave a lot of information with the interviews, decisions, deadline, etc. Everyone o campus was very friendly and, by touring the campus, I saw that the students are like a big family."
Niche User,5,"I fell in love with Jacksonville University on my very first visit.  I can not wait to attend!  The size, the campus, Professor and Coaches.  It feels like home!"
Sophomore,5,"When I first did a tour here at JU, I was greeted with a friendly and very welcoming group of people.  They brought you in and engaged you in a conversation about why you are here and what you wanted to major in. During the tour of the campus,  you were brought in more by the scenery and how beautiful the school is. It's a small campus and it's perfect for those who want to be more involved with the teachers and the student life. This school keeps you on your toes. Involving you and our parents in different activities around campus. For example, families can come and spend the weekend with you and have fun on family day. To me, this school is all around the best school I could have ever asked for. The only thing I would change about this school is just the food. For example, they need to switch up the menue to accommodate other students from around the world. Besides that, this school is all around excellent."
Senior,5,"JU is an awesome school! The classes are small which is great for Professors to be attentive to their students. In addition, JU's campus is diverse and very inclusive and it's easy to adapt to the campus. One change I would like to see is the expansion of the cafeteria and more dining halls."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Jacksonville University was amazing. The staff are very friendly. The campus is highly regulated so we are always kept safe. The campus is diverse, which I love. But I would like to see a change in the cafeteria options."
Junior,5,"I have been at JU for about a year working towards my BSN degree. They have been nothing shy of excellence. All of my professors have been amazing. The tuition is very expensive, which I think they can cut down on or at least give a discount for students who have parents in the military. I would like closer parking."
Freshman,5,Its a great stress free environment. Upperclassmen are very friendly. Professors are always open to assists students. The food is great and satisfying. The campus has a lot of spots students can hangout after the workday.  Campus security are always on duty and making sure everyone is safe.
Alum,5,"Had a great education and time! Class of 2008 was one to remember. I remember the attention provided to students from the professors. The were plenty of activities to engage in and more places to enjoy on campus over the years. I have recently visited and has seen the big changes they have made to keep up with the times, to keep students engaged and safe."
Sophomore,5,I liked how small the school and how its easy to connect with students and professors. One thing that needs improvement is the cafeteria food because the food leaves a lot to be desired.
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville University is a great university. It's a private school, so it's a safe campus. You get your money worth of service’ like free tutoring, free food at the cafeteria. There's a Chick-fil-a and Starbucks on campus. For the most part, the professors are accommodating, and understanding. The campus is very diverse, due to a sizeable International student program. Greek life is also pretty exciting. Overall a great school."
Niche User,5,so far Jacksonville looks to be an amazing college but i will have to see once i get there in the Fall semester of 2018.
Senior,5,This is a great university that prepares all their students for postgrad work or school. The professors are topnotch and really care about their students success.
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville University has offered a great college experience to me so far. The professors are very responsive to student requests for assistance and will work with you on any issues you may have. There are free tutors in all subjects available on campus so that students can receive extra help where it is needed. There is a family feel to this school that is inclusive and supportive. JU is located close to the Atlantic Ocean, so students have plenty of fun weekend activities in a nearby getaway locale. I am participating in the Aviation program, which is top-notch. I will graduate with a four-year degree that will have me completely prepared for a career as an airline pilot.  At the opening-of-school ceremony, all of the incoming freshmen carried candles signifying we should strive to be a ""light in the world."" I believe I am studying among students who are focusing on their studies, trying to do their best in school, and wanting to make a difference in the world beyond college."
Niche User,5,I liked the feel of the campus and the location. Could have more of a variety when it comes to food.
Graduate Student,5,"Great location, great school. Classes and professors are great. Jacksonville is a big city so there is plenty to do outside of school. The beach is a ten minute drive. Downtown five minute drive. Would highly recommend giving Jacksonville University a thought."
Junior,5,"To start off, I love this campus. There is always something to do, people to get to know, something to always get involved such as fun activities. It is a great environment that gives you the feeling of one big happy family. I would like to see us put more food businesses such as tropical smoothie or subway onto the campus."
Freshman,5,"I love the location of the school. I like that the campus isn't too big, or too small. I like how there are many opportunities available here."
Senior,5,I am doing online nursing course. I love the fact that I can work full time and I can do my classes when I want too. If i don't sign in my dean will contact me. The instructors will work with you.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this school. If you are looking for a school where class sizes are small and would like more one on one time with the professors, this is the school to attend! They also give lots of scholarships for academics! Not to mention the location of JU is gorgeous and is a super pretty campus."
Freshman,5,I was hooked the moment I got there!! It's just an awesome university and beautiful! Everyone made me feel at home and answered any questions I had.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus everything is so green and beautiful. The people at ju are very welcoming. as soon as i arrived i felt like i was at home already. the president gave out his number so you can text him anytime ,if that isn't welcoming i don't know what is."
Sophomore,5,I have only spent a year and a half at Jacksonville University and I already feel part of a family. The faculty and staff are always friendly and reading to help make your time at JU better.
Niche User,5,"My mother attended Jacksonville University and she allowed my brothers and I to experience student life along with her. At a young age we attended seminars, games, and different college events. The campus is beautiful and the staff is friendly. We were always accepted by fellow students and staff."
Sophomore,5,"I am a Sophomore this year at this University and I absolutely love it.   The clubs at the school are all very involved and are wanting to make JU a better place for  everybody.  The teachers are great and helpful and if their office hours dont correlate with your schedule, the tutoring center is free and really a great resource.  The President at the school is the most involved president I've ever been a part of and is always making improvements to the school.  It's a great community to be a part of."
Alum,5,"Jacksonville University is excellent; I miss it every day. 
I remember the green campus, the lush trees & the river like it was yesterday. The professors and doctors are abundant in their presence and are available twenty-four seven, that's hyperbole, but they will answer the phone calls. JU is a place to grown and build channels with people from around the globe; you're networking as much as you're discovering experiences in the world.  I was the first to go to college and didn't know what to expect, but JU was like a family, I'd recommend them to any friend."
Niche User,5,I took tour at the beginning of the month and the tour guides were amazing. The school environment was overall excellent. There has been a ton of changes in the campus for the good of the students. Very Impressed.
Alum,5,"Great experience. The JU education is top notch. There is a reason it is called the ""Harvard of The South"". I would highly recommend JU to anyone that is interested."
Niche User,5,When i visited Jacsonville i had a good experience .That college is made for me and i would really like to attend it.
Freshman,5,"JU is a small school, but that is exactly what I wanted. All of my teachers know me by name, I do not have more than 35 people in my class, and the campus is beautiful. When you look at schools, these minor, but important topics come to mind. I love JU and the atmosphere is so calming. The sporting events are so fun to watch! JU has wonderful faculty that are extremely outgoing. On top of it I have seen the president of our university on many occasions, many people can not say that they have seen their universities president. I hope that many individuals become interested in JU and one day become a part of the dolphin family."
College Junior,5,"I feel quite safe.  Though somewhat spread out, Jacksonville University is a campus with few ""blind spots."""
College Junior,5,I have enjoyed my university.
Freshman,4,My overall experience at Jacksonville university has been very interesting. You meet different people and people they know. Learn new things. Food is alright but i wish they had more of a variety of food on campus.
Graduate Student,4,I have done my MBA there within a year. the School is good for athletes scholarships. Jacksonville is a cheap and calm city.
Sophomore,4,Small class sizes help with getting assistance from professors and small group sizes as well.  Communicated through Blackboard and email has been very effective and has been helpful to returning and living on campus.
Junior,4,"It's a beautiful campus located on the St. John's River.  You feel like a member of a small tight knit community where everyone is friendly and genuinely cares about each other.  The classroom sizes are smaller, allowing for a better learning  atmosphere. 

The campus is less than 30 minutes from JAX Beach and its nightlife, great shopping, and places to eat.  The campus cafeteria food could be better but there is a Starbucks and Chick-fil-a on campus."
Senior,4,"Very good school overall. Small class sizes allow for close relationships with professors as they help you with not only their class, but your college life in general. Campus is very diverse and open, and living on campus allows for a safe and enjoyable experience. Only downside is the lack of communication at times with administrative offices. What is promised is not always done."
Senior,4,"COVID-19 has caused some classes to be online, and the experience was overall enjoyable. When given the time to prepare the professors have gone above and beyond to adapt their classes, and our use of Blackboard allows the class to be explained in detail."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Jacksonville University has so far been very welcoming and comfortable. JU offers many ways to be assisted when it comes to studying or researching any topic available.
Freshman,4,"During the COVID spring where all of our classes were moved online, our professors at JU were extremely flexible and provided us with lots of resources to ensure our success."
Junior,4,"Hello, I'm Ashley Allen I am from Los Angeles California , I stepped out of my comfort zone in 2019 visiting Jacksonville University and decided to go there for the Fall of 2019. I don't regret applying to this amazing school. I've met new people and got help throughout the entire campus from counselors to teachers even the president. Jacksonville University is my very first University I ever attended and let me tell you it's always GO DOLPHINS.  Throughout the tough time experience Covid19 it has been hard for my family too support me for the year of Fall of 2020. I am currently in my Junior year and I am applying for the nursing program at Jacksonville University which I hope that I will be able to attend to this Fall. I made it so far and I don't plan on giving up. This scholarship will help support me get to where I need to be for my future! I have taken the extra mile to do some training and achieve my certifications before I decide to enter the program for spring 2021! Go FIns!"
Junior,4,My experience of taking classes online is a bit more challenging. I’m the type of person that love to be hands on. The teachers are great at what they do at Jacksonville but I quite feel that in class is by far much better for me I would say. For example a patient would rather take an experience nurse that’s been hands on rather than a nurse that just learning and watching online. Our online experience was forced upon me in mid March due to the Corona Virus break out everyone had to shift online by going on zoom and talking to classmates and teachers with the cameras off. Personally I feel like theres no connection with the class so I don’t really like it. But the teachers are still awesome at what they do.
Junior,4,Great small campus everyone knows pretty much everyone. Truly has a family feel to it. They take pride of both students and school spirit
Sophomore,4,Pretty good. Professors we’re engaged and serious about the material. Lots of work and very stressful. Professors emailed back quickly.
Senior,4,"I took one computer science class online and it went very well, though I was told that I could not use an apple computer, which was the only computer I had. There are other courses offered that are hybrid, part in class and part online. These courses go well, though teachers tend to pile on how much work you do at home."
Alum,4,"Jacksonville University has a good but rigourous undergraduate nursing program. I was accepted into the program directly from high school. I had no previous medical experience and I struggled for a couple of semesters. Despite these challenges, I had a very supportive professor and found the student couseling center instrumental to helping me set goals and learn new coping strategies to overcome my obstacles. I returned to JU last year to pursue a graduate degree as a nurse practitioner. 
    Something to be aware of is the significant cost of tuition at JU. They offer scholarships but many students, including myself, have large financial debt because of the decison to attend a private university.
     Overall, the campus is beautiful and peaceful. It hugs the curve of the St. John's River and early in the morning you can see wildlife on its banks. It's a nice change of pace for a school in the confines of a city."
Freshman,4,"I love the small class feel. I am a student and every class and a number in none. The professors do more than is required of them. Instead of only teaching us theory, the professors I have had have taught me how to apply those theories to practical, everyday life."
Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about JU it’s the environment, not only the campus is gorgeous but the people and staff are like family and provide with a very close and personal experience. We really get to know our classmates, professors and even the staff that maintain our campus everyday. Everyone is always eager to help and to give us the best college experience possible."
Freshman,4,"The campus is small to average size, but the campus is beautiful. The faculty really seem like they care and most people that go here are friendly. They have a great nursing and business program and many activities and clubs/organizations to be active in."
Freshman,4,"Jacksonville University is a very good school that gives their students a lot of opportunities for success. The way that their programs are constructed allows students to have many different experiences before going out into the working world. The staff on campus are really helpful when it comes to different living situations and backgrounds. There are activities t for every type of student, and resources with in arms reach. The only thing negative I can say about the school is the affordability. One will have to find a lot of outside scholarships even when having the highest paid scholarships for academics."
Senior,4,The campus is beautiful and I have made amazing friends because of my sorority. I have had some amazing professors in the nursing program. JU needs to improve their housing and the food on campus.
Freshman,4,Istarted attending at jacksonvilleunivestity last semister. I really love the area and the students are there are too friendly.
Graduate Student,4,I came here for undergrad and returned as a graduate student!  I've always been challenged academically yet have made friends through all the diverse clubs and activities campus offers.
Niche User,4,"The faculty and administration is great. They're easy to talk to and very helpful. The campus being on the water is gorgeous! The student Life on campus is vibrant, and fun. The Metro Jacksonville area is a growing and prosperous metropolitan city."
Sophomore,4,"With it being a small private school, the one on one connection with professors and the staff is amazing! Jacksonville University has so much potential, the lack of student involvement discourages many to step out and become a part of the great environment Jacksonville has to offer."
Niche User,4,"Jacksonville University is a great school. I like how the teachers know you by name and your are not just a number. Every classroom size is small, which allows students to have more one on one time with teacher."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Jacksonville University and they do their best accommodate the students needs. My major is film and one of my classes is in the WJCT studio so we can learn which I appreciate. However, I wish they would have provided us a shuttle service because it complicated having to pick people up and go out there everyday. They have many food options for a private school."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy it here. Everyone is friendly, kind, and the professors actually care about you. Financial aid is a little frustrating to deal with but the counselors will talk to you and email you. Tuition is high but it's worth it for a private university."
Sophomore,4,What I like about Jacksonville University is that it is not a very large campus and that the campus life there makes you feel like you are living at home among family. They always have different events to keep the students envolved.
Senior,4,"Other than the price, JU is a very good school. It is small, intimate, and has great accreditation. The only thing I wish I could change would be the price. It is extremely expensive to attend JU."
Freshman,4,JU is a great school and has plenty of tools to help make sure you pass your classes. Politically there should be a change and JU could be better than what it is. That’s only if everyone put in maximum effort to do so. Other than that it is a good school.
Freshman,4,"Overall academic are amazing. The class ratio is very small, but that just makes your relationship with the professors even better. It’s truly a family at JU, and it is a great campus to be studying at."
Niche User,4,"Jacksonville University helped me learned and grow, not only on the academics, but also as a person. The curriculum is well thought out and is always trying to improve themselves; I know since I worked at the Dean's office. Overall is an excellent university and environment."
Sophomore,4,"JU is a ""small"" private university that does care for your post-grad career with all the events and opportunities they hold. I gave JU a 4 out of 5 star rating due to the equipment in the Merrit Penticoff Science Building being outdated while other buildings look better than ours."
Graduate Student,4,Jacksonville University is a great school for those that like a small community. The class sizes are small therefore making it easier to learn difficult material. You see a lot of the same people too which really helps when making friends!
Niche User,4,"Jacksonville University is in the perfect location, being located right on the river, close to the beach, near a major airport, just outside of the United State's biggest city it can't get any better. The professors here really want to help you in every way they can. Everyone on campus is so friendly!"
Senior,4,"Although tuition can be pretty expensive, the overall university experience is nice. Most teachers try to be accommodating to students as well."
Junior,4,"The fall of 2016 was my first year at Jacksonville University. Although some classes have been a lot tougher than others, it is worth it in the end."
College Junior,4,Jacksonville University alumni are looked up to and admired.
College Freshman,4,"It was a great experience when we went to every club at the university. We also got to meet some of the football, basketball, and the soccer players. They were really down to earth."
College Sophomore,4,Great class atmosphere and makes it worth learning
College Sophomore,4,Very understanding and great content and topics to discuss.
College Sophomore,4,"Love the people and teachers,but it is expensive. Great environment and small classrooms assist with understanding the material easier."
College Freshman,4,"Jacksonville University has a million and one scholarship opportunities, federal work study programs and internships to choose from."
College Freshman,4,Professors are very helpful and understanding. They take the time to know you . Class sizes are excellent . 13:1
College Freshman,4,"Our housing quality is one of the best i have ever seen. The students in the dorms are friendly, diverse , respectful and easy to get along with."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics at my school is very student base , we like to be involved in many sports and clubs. Our school spirit is the best   and we love to do the best we can in sports."
College Freshman,4,MY school experience so far has been great. It is a relatively small University so students have a great time connecting with there professors and using resources well.
College Sophomore,4,the degrees are very valuable to everyone
College Sophomore,4,we have security at the gates and inside
College Sophomore,4,Very big rooms with lots of personal space
College Sophomore,4,athletics are a huge focus here at this school
College Senior,4,"Great professors, great school, just costs a lot"
College Senior,4,I have not seen a problem of campus.
College Senior,4,Actually learning stuff in class
College Sophomore,4,The Fraternities and Sororities are great for networking!
College Junior,4,"The alumni network is great- especially with Greek life. Employers are always recruiting on campus during job fairs, and many people find jobs because of these opportunities."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on campus. The area surrounding campus on the outside can be scary, but it is important to always travel in groups. Even on campus."
College Junior,4,Everyone loves attending the events and we value our athletes.
College Junior,4,This university has become my second home away from home.
College Freshman,4,"I had to retake one class but I got a good grade the second time, otherwise as long as you study and put in effort with classes then good grades are in reach."
College Freshman,4,"Its pretty diverse, always a way to meet people from different backgrounds."
Sophomore,2,"I was accepted as an undergraduate pre-nursing student, but there's another application to the nursing major where I was not selected. As a veteran student I was surprised not to get in the program, with good grades. Reason I chose this school is because of their military-friendly advocacy, but I feel like its the opposite. They chose regular students and put a veteran on a waiting list, who gave his life serving the country and freedom."
College Freshman,2,I personally am more focused on passing this semester and I don't focus on sports although I could play not interested
College Junior,2,The cafe sucks the food is sits there all day and if you go during non irregular hours that arnt breakfast lunch and dinner there is nothing to eat but cold pizza if any is left and wilty salad.
College Senior,2,"Often the parking tickets get out of control. If a student parks on a line there's a ticket given, the parking on apartment side can be difficult making it a little scary if you have to walk a distance to get home."
College Junior,2,"For the amount of money you pay to go to school at JU, the internet is very unreliable. Some days the internet will be working great, but then there are days, especially those days where you really need the internet, and it will be terribly slow and will kick you off of the network. I've also had issues with game consoles not wanting to hook up to the internet either."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing is expensive. Housing is usually what people struggle paying for. What you pay for is NOT what you get. The buildings are old and the only new building is Oak. Oak is also $3,000+. There are two to a room and a community bathroom. There are about 30 people on the hall who have to share the bathroom. If you live in Oak then you have suit mates. You get your own bathroom and you share it with 3 other people. When it comes to moving things in it sucks if you live anywhere besides Oak because there are no elevators. There are campus apartments on the opposite side of campus (relative to the dorms) that are nice, but expensive. You can only live there if you're a junior, a certain age, plus some other requirements. To get to class from the dorms you have to take the valley."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not travel much, but things are far away."
College Senior,2,I think Greek life is for snobby rich kids and I have no desire to be initiated into a club as an adult.
College Senior,2,Campus sits right in the middle of one of the oldest and most financially depressed areas in Jacksonville. There is a lot of crime in the surrounding neighborhoods. The campus is like an oasis in the middle of a waste land.
College Freshman,2,The housing for the Greek life is the same rooms as everyone else on campus
College Freshman,2,I'm pretty sure that the health center in non-existent. At least my friends and I have never heard of it. 
College Sophomore,2,Parking lots fill up too quickly because of all the morning classes.  The employee parking lot up front is too big while the commuter lot is too small.  The back parking lot is for everyone and is huge but the road taking you back there is narrow and easily crowded.  One student parking lot is flat out dangerous and trees have been known to drop big limbs on parked cars.  If you get there before 8:30 parking is fine.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are only a few sororities and fraternities on the campus. There are no houses, but two of the buildings on the south side of campus are dedicated to housing Greeks, Johnson. There each sorority has its own hall. Also, on the south side of campus, there is a fraternity building, called Brest Hall."
College Junior,2,No coverings between buildings makes it a very wet spring semester!
College Freshman,2,"Parking is very limited. It has certain color signs that students have to park for certain periods of time. Permits costs $25 and so do fines. If u want to appeal, tickets can be brought to a court hearing that they have on campus. A lot of students are in need of a car..... international students come from a far and do not have cars to drive in."
College Junior,2,"My financial aid eligibility was acceptable but the particular adviser I have been assigned to for the past four years is one of the most frustrating people I've ever worked with. With persistence, the financial aid process can be accomplished effectively but never be afraid to ask help from another adviser in the office, most of them are incredibly helpful."
College Junior,2,"Jacksonville Universities campus life is poor. The student union also known as the commons has a student solutions center with a message chair which is great but a lot of people dont even know about it. There is a game room but its small and has only two pool tables and a few other little things, its not very popular because its not very attractive and fun. There are four places to eat on campus and there is really only one good place to eat out of all of those and thats Einsteins bagel place. There are not many fun places on campus to go to relax or hang out, there arent even any health clinics on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Has some really nice dorms,  but at the same time has some dorms that looks like they should be torn down."
College Sophomore,2,School tries to make the food intersting but there really aren't a lot of options.
College Sophomore,2,Nobody really cares about sports at all. Most students are loyal to other schools besides JU
College Sophomore,1,"Rain accumulates everywhere, and classrooms are far away from everything"
College Freshman,1,"Literally nothing happens on campus. If you know people, you may be able to do experience some hangout at houses across the street."
College Freshman,1,"Unless you're a JR, SR, or commuter student, have fun living uncomfortable for 2 years. "
College Freshman,1,"I've heard that this has been one of the worst years, but there is no football stadium at all. Supposedly there is one being built, but I do not see it happening anytime soon. Intramural sports are not too bad. They are a good way to interact with other people from what I've experienced. "
College Freshman,1,"Probably one of the worst cities and surrounding areas. Not safe to be out at night, not much to do. I do give JU credit for trying at least to better things, but there is only so much you can do"
College Freshman,1,People are very brief and do not seem to care for the students. This is the financial aid and cashier windows/offices specifically. Most of the employees just seem to not care for anything but the next paycheck they will be receiving. My experience with financial aid is one of the many reasons alone I will be transferring ASAP.
College Freshman,1,The food is over cooked and they never refill things if you come there late after they open for dinner. the taste is blah no flavor. The only good food is the breakfast. They need to serve more healthy and fresh food. Nelly is the safe place to eat at.
College Senior,1,"Financial aid is very difficult to deal with in general. However, there are exactly two people who work at the window who are extremely helpful and kind. I rarely meet with me personal adviser, because she is rude and impatient."
College Senior,1,School is located in an area that does not afford the students to safely hang out at parties or clubs. This is just my opinion. Students are better off staying in their dorms or apartments.
Recent Alumnus,1,"No Good – The immediate surrounding area is not the safest place to go for off campus housing. Pricing is reasonable, but safety is a big issue. Lots of problems with drugs, break-ins, and violence."
College Junior,1,No Good – Food is always the same and the quality is very low
College Sophomore,1,"Tram or Trolly, Maybe? There is only one shuttle currently at JU which is nice because it transports students to the St. Johns Town Center and Wal-Mart. Some downfalls to this shuttle is that it only runs on Saturday, I wish they would transport the students to more places because there are many other things to do in the area."
College Freshman,1,To print In the library is an understatement. I go to a private university so my tuition is more than the average tuition to a public university but yet they can't allow us the print free in the school library. We have to print and I believe that isn't fair. We pay a pretty penny to go to school but we still have to worry about all this stuff we have to pay for on top of tuition. It's rediculous.
College Freshman,1,"Well the computers don't all have the same programs installed on them. You have to use certain computers on campus, in certain locations, just to get a specific assignment done. It is super inconvenient, especially when the computer you need is in the tutouring center and the desktops you need are occupied."
College Student,1,"None Existent. There is a international group much like a frat/sorority. The soccer players are all from around the world and the basketball players are mostly African american and same for the football team. It is a school technically in the south, right on the border of Georgia. Jacksonville, Florida's acceptableness toward LGBT community is none existent, and it's a super conservative none liberal environment, and you certainly can feel that when you are there."
College Student,1,"Sports and Liberal Arts – At Jacksonville University, they offer a tremendous amount of sports team, and currently a dance team, there is many fraternities and sorority's as well. The classes are small, sometimes too small. It is pretty easy to obtain scholarship money to get into the school. Many study abroad programs and the workload isn't as heavy as you'd think. Financial aid office is not as effective in assisting with financial help. Advisers are slow to email but eventually get back to you."
College Junior,1,"Needs Major Improvement – Poor. I literally saw two non-students walk onto campus, unhindered yesterday in broad daylight!"
College Freshman,1,No Parties on Campus – I started the second semester in January and I haven't been to one party yet. There are no on campus parties; all the parties are off campus. To get to a party you have to know somebody with a car.

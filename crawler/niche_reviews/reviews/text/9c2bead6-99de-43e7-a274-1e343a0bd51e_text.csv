Freshman,5,"I personally haven't taken classes here online yet, but I intend to. If it's treated at all like in person classes are treated, I expect a great experience!"
Freshman,5,"I love this school! It is very diverse, and the small class size fosters an excellent learning environment."
Freshman,5,this campus has a wonderful campus life with many activities both on and off campus. they also have great classrooms with most classes being hands on experience instead of just book work which can be tiring and boring.
Freshman,5,"I visited over 20 small colleges/universities and by far, UNOH had the best dorm facilities bar none."
Freshman,5,"They have a lot of programs, as they are one of few universities that give higher then associates degrees. they also make it very easy to get a job after finishing your schooling."
Freshman,5,"Great school so far. the teachers are great and really care, and the schedules are easy to work with."
Niche User,5,I have spoken with many whom are going there for the same program I am going for and others whom are doing different programs and the idea of how their campus is set up is amazing.  Faculty and students are just amazing.
Sophomore,5,"The curriculum at UNOH is hand-down the best.  It is a good mix of tech lab and classroom.  I like the fact that classes are every day for six hours - I believe this prepares us for the work place.  The faculty is very knowledgeable - with real world experience.  The only downside, is the college social life is lacking."
Freshman,5,The University of Northwestern Ohio is a great university for anyone to attend. It offers a lot of courses and opportunities to come out and be ready to face the world as a more prepared person. I really love how students have the opportunity to speak with their instructors on a one on one conversation whenever we have a question. I like how every question we have always gets answered by our instructors and how their always there willing to listen and help us out. One thing I like about the campus is how everyone is always willing to help you out no matter who you go to. I really like how someone is always there ready to help or get you to the right person you need to go to. I am really happy with the decision I made of coming to the University of Northwestern Ohio and I wouldn't have done it any differently.
Freshman,5,"My experience at this college is excellent. I like how they run the applied technology side of the school, on this side we go for six weeks and then you have another class. Everyone here from students to teachers are all nice and make you feel welcomed to the area. The area in Lima, Ohio is a big place to explore but you are able to find your way around very easy. The school offers many ways to help you, from finding a job to helping you pay for college."
Niche User,5,"Came down for the open house event in 2017 and was absolutely blown away! The shops and classrooms are very well laid out, expansive, and full of opportunities for those interested in pursuing any sort of automotive future. Everyone seemed to be nice, the campus was incredible, and I'm super excited to be a student very soon!"
Freshman,5,I had gone there last year for the spring college day and it was very cool . it was fun we had gotten food and we had gotten to see the campus and the areas of study.
Freshman,5,I enjoy classes both gen eds and tech class. food is better than high school but not by much. Tech classes are educational and involved.
Sophomore,5,"So far, I am in love with the University of Northwestern Ohio. It is a safe environment to live and learn with one on one teaching and Safety Services is always on their toes to keep the students safe."
Sophomore,5,this is a great place to get an associated degree in automotive all the instructors are limited to 20 students. you spend an average of 20 minuets in class and the rest of time in shop.
Freshman,5,"It is a wonderful school. Very hands on, open, dorms are very nice. People are pretty cool as well. Teachers explain everything as needed, very open campus."

College Junior,5,They have classes that should fit most any schedule.
College Junior,5,The teachers Iv'e had have a unique way of teaching.
College Junior,5,The instructors are very helpful.
College Junior,5,The instructors Iv'e had doing my General Education classes were very helpfll.
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy my time at this school. All the teachers are willing to work with you in any class, Including them staying after classes are done for the day or putting you in contact with another student who is either doing really well in their class or a past student that has also done well in their class. When walking around the campus anyone is ready and willing to hold a conversation with you. The school is filled with student who are ready to learn, willing to try new things, and make new friends.One of my favorite things about this school is bring given the opportunity to continue my softball career with great team players and also a wonderful coaching staff that is well versed in the sport. If i cold do this experience all over again I wouldn't change a thing. The school is absolutely my number one choice if I had to do it over again."
College Sophomore,5,they help you find a job
College Sophomore,5,they showed it the best
College Sophomore,5,"My experience with The University of Northwestern Ohio has been nothing but amazing. The online tour is great. We had Scott Stockdale come into our class and tell us about the school and prices and it sounds amazing, and very worth it. I have been accepted already, and start August 22nd. I am ecstatic to start!"
College Junior,5,Have been told that it is possible to come back at any time to advance my career and to get help looking for a new job.
College Junior,5,I like the fact that it's one course for 6 weeks. We get to know the instructors quickly and vise-versa.
College Junior,5,There are employers looking all the time at the school for graduates.
College Junior,5,I really enjoy the hands on approach to the learn here.
College Junior,5,I am going for automotive technology! It's hard being in this program because I am a female and guys look at me like I have no clue what I am doing. I love what I do because it's different it makes me feel as though I can be and do whatever it is I put my mind to.
College Junior,5,"I love it here, I'm learning things that i like to learn about,"
College Senior,5,This school has some of the best education and they offer many clubs and opportunities in order to enjoy your college experience.
College Junior,5,I like how the school and friendly and will do anything to help you pass the course.
College Junior,5,I love going to the Library to study because I can reserve a room for up to 4 hours and get all my studying done that way and I am alone and its quiet. The campus activities are good and we always get emails about what is going on in campus. The athletic center is amazing and I love going to it because there are so many options to do when you are there.
College Junior,5,There is no out of stat tuition so every one is paying the same price. We have international students who come here and love it because its not so expensive as other colleges they looked at.
College Junior,5,They are willing to help you with lots of stuff. Help you with your work and will explain things more if you dont get it. You can go into the office and get help after or before classes.
College Junior,5,I like the classes that I am taking because they help you with what your going to do in the future and your not wasting your money
College Junior,5,Help you find a job with different companies and help with resume and job interviews

College Sophomore,5,Just a great place overall has basically anything you could ask for.

College Sophomore,5,"Yes, free wifi access anywhere on campus LOVE IT!"

College Sophomore,5,"Everyone's nice, and always willing to help."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE this school, its perfect, reliable, great customer service, easy accessibility, conveniently located, just all around great."
College Freshman,5,I wouldn't switch schools if I didn't have to. I love the staff and academic advisors. My classes run smoothly and I get along great with mostly everyone. The registration process is smooth and you can always adjust your classes and degree without most fees.
College Freshman,5,Our facilities for a small private school are amazing! We have a brand new athletic complex that is better than most private owned gyms in town. The classroom experience allows teachers to work one on one with students. There is always help available when you need it.
College Freshman,5,For a small university we have the best facilities
College Junior,5,For the most part the school tution is cheap compare to other colleges. The good thing is the college is non-porfit which dose help out if your not from this state. Financial aid process is easy once you do it a few times. If your new to it the financial aid office here is willing to help you out. They even have computers so you can do your financial aid.
College Sophomore,5,The professors for each and every class offered on the technical side of my school are the best. They have the experience and can relate to each and every one of the students and vice verse. We are all their for the same reason: because we love to get our hand dirty and want to make a career out of doing it.
College Sophomore,5,State of the art Automotive/High Performance facilities
College Sophomore,5,I get on-hand experience as well as classroom study. Many internships available.
College Sophomore,5,The best classes & teachers
College Sophomore,5,"Modern, clean facilities. The best automotive high performance facility in the USA"
College Sophomore,5,The entire process has been seamless
College Sophomore,5,"Quality facilities. Excellent athletic center, awesome library, tons of campus activities, Club UNOH is awesome!"
College Sophomore,5,The country side of the school and the Tech side is amazing.
Freshman,4,"Easy to apply, easy to get accepted. Instructors are professional yet friendly. Classes are challenging but exciting."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently enrolled at UNOH for an online degree. It's definitely a challenge, but I have many resources to help me out! I'm a single mom who works, and so it makes it easy to be flexible with my classes!"
Freshman,4,Very helpful professors and staff. They help when they are asked and if they do not have an answer for you they will try their absolute best to point you to someone that can and the doors are always open for help.
Freshman,4,Great school amazing campus has a lot to offer doesn’t cost a arm or a leg to go to school here great programs small class size so you get one on one time with instructors food is good as are dorms.
Freshman,4,"The instructors are great! The dorms are awful (old, run down, look and feel like they're in desperate need of updating). The people in the mechanics study programs are happy to have a quality learning environment and great 
job opportunities after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great school for the mechanics education but there is really not much to do in Lima.  Extracurricular activities often require a financial expense which is a burden on a student.  The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful and one can certainly get an excellent education at UNOH.  There is just nothing affordable to do in the area and all the sidewalks must roll up at 10:30pm.  If you are looking for the education, this is the place to be.  If you are looking for a great town, not so much so."
Freshman,4,"UNOH has great programs and teachers who really know their stuff. They help with whatever you need. What I would like to see change, however, is the dorms as they are pretty small in size, and can be cramped with 6 people living in it."
Freshman,4,"I’m a student athlete at UNOH, this is my first year attending. I’ve made really good friends and meet people from all over. This school has a great diversity and the professors show interest in your studies."
Niche User,4,My experience has been a positive one overall. I am looking forward to look further into attending this online college to better myself.
Niche User,4,University of Northwestern Ohio is a very good school for students that want to pursue a career in any automotive field. There is no school that compares to UNOH.
Junior,4,"I like how small the class sizes are, it allows for a very personal education and you feel like the college and professors truly care about you. It's nice to have one-on-one time each class rather than having to schedule office hours.  I like that the advising staff and professors are with you along the way from admissions to scheduling, they have been incredibly helpful.  One thing that could be improved is the diversity, but I think this is mainly the area."
Freshman,4,"One thing I like about University of Northwestern Ohio is that all the teachers are very knowledgeable and helpful to all students. If you ever have a question about what your doing in class or even with life advice, they're more than happy to answer it for you if they can. The students are all very welcoming and helpful to new students trying to find their way around and more than willing to give advice when applicable. Lastly, the only thing I would change about UNOH is the student resources,  these are the people that are supposed to help new students get their schedules organized and be welcoming so that students can be excited about going to school there. In my experience, many of the resource faculty are not very helpful or kind, especially with new students in mind, which to me was very off putting."
Freshman,4,I like the University I like to students and the faculty I just do not like the housing options that they have .
Freshman,4,UNOH has an awesome Diesel & Auto Technology program. All of the classes include hands on training experience. And you are able to take the certification test for each course as you complete. This means you will be highly marketable when you get your degree. The sports & clubs are a definite plus to attending UNOH as well.
Freshman,4,So far am very happy i  chose this university over my other choices. i feel its perfect for me. The professor are great and the faculty is great they try to help with what ever they can. At any time of the day they make time for each student
Freshman,4,"the schooling curriculum is excellent the only complaint I have is the dorms, live off campus and you will love your time here"
Sophomore,4,I love the small class size that UNOH offers. It allows one-on-one interaction between the student and the teacher! One thing that I would like to see change is switching to semesters instead of quarters.
Freshman,4,is a smaller university where your professors know your name and you can build a relationship with them. everyone is friendly and wants you to succeed!
Freshman,4,"As an online student attending UNOH, I absolutely love my online experience overall. The professors are easy to contact and the course material is laid out in an organized method. The overall course load can work with anyone's busy schedules as long as you stay focused. The professors are always around to help answer any questions and they even hold online collaborates to interact with students and assist them with their studies."
Freshman,4,"The advisors are very active in helping with incoming students and they are very kind people. I enjoy being able to walk into the admissions office and see smiling faces. The campus can be confusing at times and I'm god awfully afraid of getting lost, but I do hope for a good experience here, it looks like it's going to be worth every second. "
College Senior,4,Applying to UNOH was fairly easy.
College Senior,4,"All the classes I have taken, have really applied to real world situations."
College Junior,4,The student services building is a wealth of information.
College Junior,4,Everyone has been very helpful in preparing me for my career.
College Senior,4,Most professors will work with you when sick or have family emergencies pop up. All you have to do is talk to them when something happens.
College Senior,4,My associate's degree in digital multimedia allowed me to make advertisements and learn how things are done for marketing teams. For my bachelors degree in marketing i now get to see both sides to advertising and it's great.
College Senior,4,The counselors work hard to make sure you get a job in your field
College Senior,4,There's never any more than 20 students a class and there's crossover lasses between majors
College Senior,4,"Depending on your major, there's plenty of internships and job opportunities"
College Senior,4,There's never any more than 30 students in a class and there's plenty of training aids
College Senior,4,"This school is so great because we have a little bit of everything. We have multiple mechanics programs, business programs and even a nursing program."
College Sophomore,4,"The class times are flexible as you can choose online courses, traditional day classes or even evening classes. Whichever will work for you the best."
College Sophomore,4,They help you find a job which is related to your degree. The career centers are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,Classes for me have been very hands on and active learning. Teachers are very knowledgable with their degree and courses they teach. The small class size allowes for more one on one teaching or question asking.
College Sophomore,4,"This school has a lot of academic and job seeking support.thy offer career fairs frequently and information at the front offices. Also offering tutoring, or help at the student success centers."
College Sophomore,4,"As a student here at UNOH, I'm in their medical assisting program for an associates degree. The teachers a great and help you out tremendously. The work load can be heavy at times but fornthebmost part it's a pretty average amount. Being in this major has advanced my knowledge in several different ways, learning medical techniques during clinicals to being CPR certified. Not only that once you are near the end of your course the program sends you to local or nearby medical facilities for your externship hours, also providing a few pre externship hours earlier in the medical assisting program. Overall my experience throughout my first year here has been very successful and worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is affordable and the teachers I've had so far are great. With the small class size, it gives you a chance to ask questions and be interactive.  Also with the culture variety of several different countries, it makes the school unique. Not only that, the school has two sides, one which is an automotive tech side, ranked one of the best in the country for those who would like to start a career with high performance or something to do with vehicals. Where as the other side is more business majors including a few medical related majors. All in all the school has a good variety in what they offer to students at an affordable price."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very understanding and help you as much as they can for the most part. There are plenty of services offered if you are in need of help. The classes are a decent size so the learning enviornment is more interactive and succesful for me personally.  Having quarters instead of semesters has its pros and cons though.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are small and more interactive. With the school being so diverse it helps the learning experience because you not only learn about your major but you learn about what its like all around the world.
College Sophomore,4,they help you as much as they can
College Sophomore,4,they care about the business side and the tech side the same
College Sophomore,4,they take control of it
College Sophomore,4,"They showed me everything and told me everything, they showed me the life of a student there."
College Sophomore,4,The school is amazing an can't wait to go there already went and checked it out!
College Junior,4,Every time I've had a question career center was always there to help.
College Junior,4,"Unoh have generally smaller classes consisting of 20 people. The professors are very knowledgeable. The professors actually worked in the field that they teach, therefor they can inform you what they had problems with and how they corrected them."
College Junior,4,The best part about the career services is that the school posts at least two to three job positions near campus every day. Also every time I had questions they were more than willing to help.
College Junior,4,Every time I had a question the career center was more than willing to help.
College Junior,4,"My major is Ag/Diesel associates. With this degree i have the knowledge of the diesel side witch covers mostly on highway diesel truck and trailers. Also this degree cover the agriculture side of the diesel world examples : combines, tractors, and hydraulics."
College Junior,4,"So far i am very thankful that I chose to go to University of Northwestern Ohio. I know kids going to other schools and they regret their decision. But I would recommend the University of Northwestern Ohio to anyone with a passion for speed, alt fuels, diesel or agriculture machines."
College Freshman,4,They are strong in my major
College Senior,4,"The work load is a lot but i can get through it with a lot of drive, passion, conviction, and hard work. There is a lot of book work that we have to do, and then we go and work on cars in our shop that the schools provide, we diagnose any problems, and then try to vamp up the engines."
College Senior,4,This school teaches me skills that i will actually use later in life. instead of learning subjects that i will never use we learn how to actually fix problems in cars and make them run better than they ever have before.
College Junior,4,The teachers give you adequate time to complete work and everything is explained thoroughly in my classes.
College Junior,4,After graduation UNOH helps you find a job.
College Junior,4,"My major is Office Management. I like the classes that pertain to my specific major, such as keyboarding and word processing. I feel like I am learning stuff that will be extremely helpful in my career."
College Junior,4,"I am in my second quarter at UNOH, so far it is pretty easy. The teachers are able to work with you one on one because of the small class sizes."
College Junior,4,"I'm glad that I got to get busy on my major right away, it has kept me interested in my major."
College Freshman,4,I have experienced a great first quarter at UNOH.   The staff at this school is the best.   They care about each student.
College Junior,4,We have great people helping all the students look for jobs. And it makes being at this school a lot easier when we have nobody else to turn to.
Freshman,2,"Go elsewhere, there are better options out there. They kicked me out of my dorm for having fish and gave me 3 days to move out. I have a lot more to say but there is not enough room in this box to write what I really want to"
Sophomore,2,"It’s okay but the town you’re in sucks. Yeah people are open and willing to talk, but they’re proud racists making them not the best people to hang with. Only thing to do here is drink but that’s not allowed on campus"
College Senior,2,"From what I understand, it is hard to transfer in and out of UNOH."
College Senior,2,I had already taken english composition I and II but because they were 4 credits in my last college i had to retake and repay Composiiton II for the full 5 credits.
College Freshman,2,"They are not good with international students, which is a shame"
College Junior,2,The buildings are very crowded. Like a small high school
College Junior,2,There are no good internships in Lima to start with
College Sophomore,2,The school has a very diverse population of students and that's ok but what isn't ok is the lack of intelligence that the school allows to come here every year. Some of the kids at this school thing blowing black smoke on people is the funniest thing in the world where everyone else would tend to disagree.
College Freshman,2,"The tuition and financial aid process at UNOH was very confusing to me. Each quarter they dispurse the money you did not use to your account but there is really no summary of what you paid for. You have to total your costs up yourself, or else you could go over the loan you have set up because of book costs and the cost of classes. They will also charge you fees for almost anything. On super bowl sunday, my dorm was fined $200 for having a small party with beer even though everyone was 21 and over. They will also fine you for parking in the wrong spots with the wrong parking sticker, and fine you for not having a clean dorm."
College Junior,2,The workload is not bad at all. But if you do not understand something the professor is not quick to help out or you can take a look at their face like wow we have to keep moving keep up.
College Sophomore,2,im not to good with computers but once i take the couse that involve it ill be alright or pro at computers and theres alot more of classes i need to take.
Junior,1,"Youll learn more working in a shop for a week then what you will learn here, theres a reason a ton of instructors are quitting/getting fired. Talk to current students before joining, recruiters will lie directly to your face to get your signature. Very smart teachers and potential for a very good educational experience, if the school knew how to utilize it. Im an automotive/high performance student, been here for 2 years and wish i have never signed up. The first year was fun-ish but there needs to be some big changes soon. Im honestly about to drop out after wasting 2 years in this town."
College Freshman,1,"The tech side is not very good, the students are usually disrespectful and they're not very kind, It's a different culture I guess. Also at UNOH everybody is admitted, which puts in class very dumb people."
College Freshman,1,"Very bad, sports are great and that's it."
College Sophomore,1,Our school has been so worried about the go green initiative that they have given each individual student a 6 week allowance for each time they print something. They start out giving you a $10.00 limit and its $.10 for each copy you print. Its a good thing but if you're forced to print multiple things on a daily basis it can become a hassle.
College Freshman,1,"If you are from anywhere in the northwestern region, this is possibly the school for you. For me, and anyone else not on a full ride scholarship for sports that is from anywhere other than a small city somewhere near Lima should consider other options. I came from Columbus, OH and when people asked me where I was from, they were always surprised to hear I was from a big city. People would always ask, why did you pick this school? Which I really did not know. This school lacks campus life, activities, depth in class variety. The dorms are disgustingly dirty and not well kept unless you live in racers village I highly recommend living off-campus. I also found the people at this university to be very odd, non-sociable and just different than I was. Maybe it was because I am not a small town kid, but this school was not for me."
College Freshman,1,"This school does have an interesting automotive program, which you get a sense of walking around campus. Other than that, this school is not interesting at all."
College Junior,1,The school keep on adding classes. It is costing me alot of money to finish school. Stop ADDing classes.
College Junior,1,University of Northwestern Ohio is a small school that needs help growing. They do not offer many artistic classes and their facilities are never open late.

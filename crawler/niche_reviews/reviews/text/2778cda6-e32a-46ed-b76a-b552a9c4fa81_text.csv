Freshman,5,My online class as a freshmen are very well and that the professors understand where you are coming from and that everyone has a busy life and is willing to work with you with anything to make sure you succeed.
Freshman,5,My overall experience with Bloomsburg university is that everyone there is to help each other succeed and will help guide you the direction you want to go and everyone is nice and the area is perfect. It is like a small city that is always active.
Freshman,5,I really like this school. I think the community is very safe and the safety precautions are very serious. I would 100% send my daughter/son to this college.  The professors are so passionate about their job and really care about the students. The tuition is fair for the amount of resources given and the students just have to take advantage of the resources. The campus is very pretty and the dorms are nice. They keep updating them and putting the necessary work into them. I am a freshmen and I have been at home for most of the year but I still have had the chance to make friends. All the students at Bloomsburg are very nice and supportive. I feel like I have made life long friends and I could not be happier at this school. I feel like this is my home and I love being a husky and having the chance to be a husky. I really cannot say anything bad about the school and I am very happy with my choice to spend the next 4 years at Bloomsburg university.

Freshman,5,"Although I was looking forward to in-person classes, the way BU is handling the transition to all online classes is very smooth and easy on the students."
Junior,5,I loved coming to Bloomsburg University. I am a nursing major and my professors really helped me at every turn. Everyone I worked with was super kind and considerate.
Alum,5,They made it an easy transition from in person to online. It made the task  of getting assignments done very easy!
Alum,5,"An all around amazing experience, from academics to you personal growth. It offers you anything you could have possibly wanted."
Junior,5,"I really loved the campus when I first visited. My sister graduated from Bloomsburg so that helped my decision to go there because she was always telling me how great it is. Every teacher I have had is very helpful along with my advisor. I have met some of my best friends at Bloomsburg and they are a great education school, which is what I am majoring in. Campus is very safe and the campus police are always there for help. If you feel unsafe walking alone at night, there are buttons all around campus you can press and a police officer will come and walk with you until you reach your destination."
Junior,5,I had to take the rest of my in person courses online because of COVID-19. It was a bit of a struggle because since they weren't online in the first place the professors had to just jump right in to online teaching. It was harder for me because I wasn't prepared to be online and I learn better in person. The professors tried their best to try to help the students as much as possible. Since most colleges are still online the professors had more time over the summer to be prepared to teach online so every student has the best experience possible.
Senior,5,I love my college it is the perfect fit for me. What I like the most is being apart of Greek life. I wish that the campus wasn't under construction so often though.
Senior,5,"Bloomsburg University has allowed me to make connections both related to my career and not. I have met so many wonderful people from living in the dorms, classes, clubs, and work. I have been able to learn valuable information from the Education Department and can use it to succeed in the future,"
Niche User,5,did not use this for my personal education. probably trash just like the in person teaching. i hated bloomsburg
Sophomore,5,"One thing I love about about Bloomsburg is one: every professor is motivated to help students achieve their goals and grades. They will help you on what you need and help on how to study for their tests. Professors care for the students but at the same time they don't baby them either, which is why I love the school itself. I feel like this school doesn't need any change it is perfect the way it is."
Sophomore,5,Doing classes online a bit a difficult but i think the professor and teaching adapted well i personally did not enjoy doing class online because my major was a bit more difficult to do through outline classes.
Sophomore,5,Bloomsburg University has been very good to me the staff is great and you can tell every there loves their job and cares about the students and just overall a great environment
Niche User,5,"I did not take any classes online, I like to be in the classroom. However, I know a few friends that did and they had absolutely no problems at all!"
Niche User,5,I absolutely loved the campus and staff! They were always so welcoming and helpful. I felt as though I was able to form a tight bond with my peers and it was a tight community.
Senior,5,"I have been going to Bloomsburg University for 4 years now and have loved it. The professors have pushed me professionally and personally and have supported me. Two degrees can take a toll on a person, but I haven't given up. Bloomsburg will always be my home away from home."
Freshman,5,Bloomsburg is such an amazing school. not only is the social life great but so is the academics that the university provides.

Freshman,5,Great atmosphere and plenty of staff support. The campus is beautiful and the food is amazing.  All positive vibes!
Freshman,5,Bloomsburg made the shift look effortless. The professors were very excited to assist with anything we were unclear of.
Freshman,5,"super fun school, def recommend getting involved in greek life if you like to party. campus is very hilly, but you get your exercise in. only thing i didn’t like as a freshman was the dining options besides chik fa la, qudoba, and starbucks. overall great people, professors, and school!"
Freshman,5,It's very beautiful. Everyone there is super nice . Its looked like a very safe campus. Nothing seemed to far away.
Freshman,5,The campus is not too overwhelmingly large but still is decent in size. There are a lot of new buildings and great resources. Also the food is good!
Sophomore,5,Bloomsburg University is a great school if you're looking for some good education and some distance from a busy life. The professors here are amazing and make you value education. I recommend Bloomsburg University for anyone who is looking for the college experience. Enjoy it!
Freshman,5,"Bloomsburg taught me more about myself than anything. I have learned how to adapt to any and every situation. I can handle whatever life throws at me.I became a person I never imagined, and I’m so thankful for that. Seeing my shy self in high school versus now I would have never imagined it. There’s a high value on a Bloom degree, and for the person who earned it you're knowledgeable and ready to lead."
Freshman,5,"What I liked about Bloomsburg University is how everyone is welcoming with one another. Also, the staff members always offering  their help and telling us they don't want any of us to fail out. Something that I would like to see a change in is students going to office hours more."
Niche User,5,"I am currently a dual enrollment student at Bloomsburg University. At the University, everything is in one place. You do not have to go very far to find your next class. The University has all sorts of lounge areas and eateries to make yourself comfortable while waiting on your next class or even just to sit and study. The atmosphere is very comforting. Everyone is super helpful and will give you a hand when you need it. They University hosts all sorts of fun and helpful activities that make it easier being away from home. As a future student of Bloomsburg University, I have been able to explore options that suit me best by taking campus tours and taking my dual enrollment classes that have helped me get comfortable with where I will be staying the next four years."
Senior,5,"Fantastic 4 year experience. Absolutely beautiful campus, excellent accredited majors, relatively inexpensive, cool and interesting town, restaurants and bars, Greek life, Lot's of sports teams and club activities. Students/families spend too much to go to college...check out Bloomsburg University...you will be surprised."
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus with a diverse student population and challenging study course. Bloomsburg University has everything an eager student could ask for. Anything a students wants or needs is a short walk or bus ride to the downtown area of Bloomsburg.
Niche User,5,"I have gone there every summer with their TRIO Upward Bound program and their facilities and stuff are spot on! I enjoyed staying the the doors every year, they are very nice and new. I would suggest this college to anyone who asks. Such a nice college and surrounding area due to local fairs and plenty of entertainment."

Freshman,5,"All the professors are interested in really getting to know their students, and very willing to help. The dorms are always kept clean. The campus feels safe."
Sophomore,5,"Bloomsburg has been an amazing college experience so far. The campus is beautiful and the school is the perfect size. You get a large school feel but mostly small class sizes which lets you get to know your professors well. I have had good experiences thus far with every professor I’ve had in lecture, lab, and/or clinical."
Sophomore,5,"I have been at Bloomsburg for 3 semesters now and I have had an amazing experience. There is a lot to love about Bloomsburg, the people, professors, campus and advisors are excellent."
Freshman,5,"The people are really nice, and really are there to help.  The campus is also really pretty.  Food options are diverse.  The universiry has lots of options for help with classes."
Freshman,5,I love Bloomsburg so much. Not only is the campus super beautiful but the faculty and students made moving into college and coming from over two hours away extremely easy. I feel very at home at Bloomsburg and I think its a really good school for different types of people and it isn't hard to fit in and find your people.
Niche User,5,"The campus is one of the most gorgeous places I've ever visited; there is such a comfortable atmosphere and being there is just a pleasure. The courses are enriching and seem spectacular from every major. All staff is extremely kind and helpful to students, current of visiting. The touring staff also consists of the most wonderful people you will meet. Amazing school to visit."
Niche User,5,"when you step onto campus, you feel at home, not that you’re just another person. you feel accepted and feel as though you matter."
Niche User,5,It was very clean and nice. I feel like personally I could really fit in at the school. I also liked how Bloomsburg had many things for the students to do every day on campus. My tour guide was very nice and he gave us a lot of helpful information. Bloomsburg prices were very affordable and considerate.
Niche User,5,My counselors at Bloomsburg have been very fast and effective at helping me get to where I need to be. Their digital forensics program is amazing. The academics are great and the student and faculty relationships provide a great learning experience.
Niche User,5,"I am an exchange student at Bloomsburg. So far I love this place! The town is very small, but the university is very nice. Everyone is very friendly and ready to help. I wouldn't say that all of my profs are excellent, but the majority is very helpful, accessible outside of class and highly professional. I am very happy that I chose to come here for my semester abroad. And how could I forget to mention: Bloomsburg is a big party school haha"
Freshman,5,"Bloomsburg University has given me everything that I need to be successful. The professors are extremely helpful and are always willing to give you extra help outside of class. The campus is beautiful, and everything is super easy to walk to! The town of Bloomsburg has so much to offer and is also a quick walk off of campus. The students here genuinely love their school, and it is easy to see. People don't come here because it's affordable or close to home, they come here because of its beauty, amazing educational programs, and because it simply feels like home."
Sophomore,5,"Couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. Plenty of helpful and wonderful professors in every department I have come across, they care about you and your future just as much as you do."
Sophomore,5,"Bloomsburg university has an amazing campus. It is super pretty. Most of the academic building are all in one area so going from class to class is not that bad. The food is good and common's cookies are bomb. Their are so many hills and stairs, but it is definitely worth it. The parking is a little expensive. The dorms are in good condition and do not look bad. The class sizes are small. The Professors really get into what they are teaching. And want to see the students succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I love Bloomsburg because I was able to create a strong sense of community extremely quickly, whether it be through classes or clubs, or anything really. It honestly feels like a second home, and I am so happy I decided to become a Husky!"
Freshman,5,I only have had a tour and orientation but the campus is beautiful and everyone was very helpful and kind.
Freshman,5,"Bloomsburg University... where do I even begin.  There isn't any other place I would want to spend the next four years getting my education. The relationships I've built with people is incredible, and I haven't stepped on campus as a full time student yet. The professors and the admissions facility have been so helpful and supportive through this whole process. Bloom is like a really large security blanket if you will. The OWLS ( Orientation Workshop Leaders), they are the ones that make campus life and the transition so much easier. They are very wise and they always have answers to our incoming freshman questions. They always have very positive and bubbly attitude and they are more than welcome to do anything to help. Just to atmosphere and people at BU makes everything so much better. That's why I am proud to call myself a husky."
Sophomore,5,BU is amazing. I was super nervous about going away for school but Bloom has such a great atmosphere that within a few weeks I felt comfortable. Everyone is super nice and the staff are fantastic! The campus is compact but not cluttered and the grounds are gorgeous!
Junior,5,"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania is a proud institution that excels at providing a comfortable, close-knit atmosphere, diligent professors, and cookies in the Scranton Commons so good even Gordon Ramsey couldn’t disapprove. Within its hallowed halls, BloomU offers a wealth of outlets and events so that the students may feel at home while also branching out to discover their passions; The Office of Multicultural Affairs, The Women’s Center, Quest Outdoor Adventure, The BloomU Recreation Center, and more all coincide to provide a full college experience. The only addition that could be made to Bloomsburg University is to increase the amount of CCTV coverage for Upper Campus; while Bloomsburg does not often have sexual assaults and swiftly alerts all students when it does, increased coverage could help to decrease danger and perhaps aid law enforcement."
Sophomore,5,I love everything about bloomsburg but I think there should definitely be more buses for the students to get around in.
Junior,5,"Bloomsburg University has allowed me to find who I am. I have met some of my best friends here, and there are so many clubs and activities that I can be apart of. The Education Department has many opportunities for me so I can open new doors. They are preparing me for my own classroom, and giving me a plethora of resources to use."
Sophomore,5,The academics a Bloomsburg University are incredible. I feel I am receiving an excellently education. However I would like to see more quite places to study on campus. The library and lounges can become over saturated often. Aside from that the experience is wonders thus far!
Junior,5,"I was a transfer student coming into Bloomsburg University. I had no idea what to expect, especially since this was my first time away from home. I was nervous and anxious. To my surprise, Bloomsburg welcomed me with open arms. Not many people think the academics here are too difficult due to the reputation of it being a party school, but Bloomsburg has challenged me greatly academically and I have the help of amazing professors to help get me through it. The people on campus are also some of the kindest people I have ever met. Everyone is here, whether its faculty or students are here to lend a hand and make sure you have a great experience."
Sophomore,5,"Great school, everyone is nice, and it has a very welcoming environment on campus. It’s easy to focus on your work if you can control your party urges since there’s not a ton to do around campus but the school tries to make it up by having activities planed for the students."
Freshman,5,It’s an amazing school. The campus is beautiful. The dining hall has amazing food and different events are always happening. It’s a great place to BU.
Freshman,4,Bloomsburg University has been treating the current situation with students very calmly with the safety of the students and faculty in mind. I am very pleased.
Senior,4,Although online learning is hard bloomsburg does a very good job at keeping students in contact with professors
Senior,4,"I have taken summer and winter classes which made the transition into online classes in the spring easier. The professors were understanding and helped me adjust to this new way of learning. Of course, I prefer learning in a classroom with face to face interaction because I get more out of the material."
Sophomore,4,With the classes online the only negative part about it was how quick we had to adapt. I don't blame the school because of the COVID-19 that resulted in the schools online. Either than that every teacher were easy on the students through the difficult time and made learning better. I rated this only a 4 because i prefer face-to-face teaching.
Alum,4,Loved Bloomsburg!! I was very involved with the campus activities and there are many opportunities to join organizations of all kinds.
Alum,4,Loved Bloom! Had the best experience of my life there and would do anything go to back! There are many activities to join in campus and lovely people to surround yourself with.

Alum,4,"Great time at Bloomsburg, good staff and environment to learn in. I loved all my friends I made there and playing on a sports team."
Sophomore,4,Bloomsburg University is a great school and im proud to be a student there. Bloomsburg is a beautiful town and i enjoy my academics and culture!
Sophomore,4,"As a current student at Bloomsburg everything is pretty good. The are plenty of groups on campus for people who are interested in sports, music, table top game, community service and more. Most of the professors a very good at the subjects they teach and are willing to help you in office hours on the things you didn’t understand. The food is okay. On days when potential students and parents are visiting it is very good, near breaks and the end of semesters it is like the hunger games."
Niche User,4,"I recently visited the campus for an overnight visit with the football program. We were given very useful information about the program and what is expected academically as well. We toured the campus, had dinner and were placed with a host. A deciding factor for me to attend this school, is the relatively close distance to my home. I am exciting about the football program and the new head coach. I have a cousin who currently attends this school and I have received nothing but rave reviews from him."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Bloomsburg is everything I could hope for as a first year student. The professors are helpful, there are countless resources, and it is very inclusive. There is always someone that can help."
Freshman,4,Bloomsburg has great academics and the professors are very helpful and are there to help. There's plenty of helpful resources all over campus. All over pretty campus. The food could use some work but it's not always bad. The only real downside is it gets really cold and the town is boring.
Niche User,4,The school is a very pleasant environment with welcoming staff and students. Multiple majors are offered as well as an Honors College to challenge their students.
Freshman,4,"Overall, my studying at Bloomsburg has been relatively done well. The professors have been willing to help and are interested in their students. Some classes can grow quite large."
Freshman,4,The teacher has had for my first semester of college were amazing. Although  Psychology is not my best it was an amazing experience. Many different ways to succeed in college life.
Freshman,4,"I love Bloom U, it’s a great environment there’s a lot of people so there’s a friend group for everyone and the best way to make friends is joining clubs. I joined LC for business and I made friends so quickly. I love that program!! One thing they could change for sure though is there parking it’s not the best since I’m a commuter I have to drive up to campus and take the bus down to campus so it sucks! But other than that it’s a pretty great school."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, deciding to go to Bloomsburg was one of the best decisions I've ever made. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus. The people are super nice and helpful. It's a great academic environment to be in. If you want to succeed and put in the work to do so, then you'll thrive here."
Sophomore,4,"The classes aren’t bad, the campus is beautiful. More food options would be nice. Dorms are nice for the most part. Sports and clubs are plentiful."
Freshman,4,"Bloomsburg University is a perfect size and is very good academically for the tuition. The campus is beautiful, just not at a good location. You get your fair share of terrible professors but for the most part, professors are extremely caring and truly are passionate about what they teach. Especially great for nursing and early education majors. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus and there is a huge social life outside of campus."
Freshman,4,"I love Bloomsburg, being a freshman its a rough start but being able to join a sorority and become an orientation leader has brought me so many friends. If you apply yourself to classes you should do fine. The college is very safe and theres stuff to do if you have a car. Professors want you to well and will help you at all costs. Also, an amazing campus."
Senior,4,"My experience at Bloomsburg University has been very good thus far. As it is all coming to an end and I am reflecting I cannot complain of my experience. I made a lot of friends, connections, mentors, professors and I have learned a lot.  If there was one thing i could change or like for Bloomsburg to have is more diversity."
Freshman,4,"Bloomsburg feels like home away from home. They have so many opportunities to engage yourself, and network with professionals in your field of study. I highly recommend!"
Freshman,4,"In my experience at Bloomsburg University, I have been satisfied with my choice of where I would attend. There are a plethora of food options all across campus as well as nice facilities to use like the library. There is also a shuttle bus that takes you to Wal-Mart and places of this nature which greatly benefits those on campus who do not have a car, myself included in this number."
Freshman,4,Bloomsburg University has provided many ways to help the adjustment to college and living away from home. The dorm buildings and facilities within the buildings are kept clean and the staff is very nice. There are CAs (community assistants) on every floor there for your need. The academic program is very good and the professors are there to help you when you need them. Overall I have really enjoyed my time so far at Bloomsburg University.
Freshman,4,The programs there are great. The campus is very easy to navigate and is beautiful. My experience at this school has been great so far and I plan to stay here for the rest of college.
Freshman,4,"The school has a good curriculum and teachers that care for you. The place is beautiful and I feel safe being there with no worry of any wrongdoing happening near me. The place has a nice, welcoming and diverse crowd. They have great places to eat with no shortages of diverse meal plans. Some dorms do not have air conditioning but the ones that do are nice and have great recreational rooms. There is a free gym for anyone who wants to lose weight. The library is big and can order any book that is not there."
Freshman,4,"Bloomsburg University in general is a great school. The campus is a good size but easy to navigate. Also the professors at this college have been nothing short of great in regards to the education you get, as well as their willingness to help students, and even just the simple fact that for the most part they are easy going which helps to not put too much stress on the students."
Freshman,4,"Bloomsburg University is a great school located in rural Pennsylvania. It is the perfect place for someone who wants the college experience while also feeling at home. The campus is beautiful and keeps the old charm of the historic college while also keeping up with modern upgrades. Despite being labeled as a party school by some locals, it really is so much more. At Bloomsburg you will find a friendly community of students and teachers who really enjoy being there. Each of the colleges within the university offers amazing programs that get students experience in their desired fields early on and have professors who want to see student success. It really is a great school let to continue your education and help you shape your career."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Bloomsburg is a wonderful school. There is much to do on campus and so many outlets that you can reach out to as well as many clubs that you can join to stay active on campus. My only issue with Bloomsburg is mainly a personal issue being as though the school is so far away from where I reside. If you don't have a vehicle or no someone who does you may seem stuck there."
Junior,4,BU has many great programs and places to eat. The people you meet will be your life long friends. Some of the places are far to walk to put you will never lose track of where your heading with BU's support. Its a great place to simply BeU!
Sophomore,4,Bloomsburg is a very good school to attend and I really enjoy all the activities they try to get you to attend. Everyone is very friendly and the professors just want to see you graduate and help you with everything you need
Freshman,4,"I liked how I felt like I belonged and that I wasn’t just another number among the many. Also, I liked how there was sort of a homey feel."
Sophomore,4,It's really hard to explain it but Bloomsburg is the most accepted I've ever felt in an area me and people like myself are not typically welcome and by that frankly speaking I'm referring to people of color. Majority of the people there really do have the biggest hearts and genuinely want their peers to succeed and it's the same for the student teacher relationships as well.
Freshman,4,"The six months I spent at Bloomsburg was a good experience,except for some minor issues.My main issue with this university was the way they chose to help students with their financial problems,also academic difficulties."
Junior,4,"I love the  campus, its not too big but not too small. There are so many opportunities to get involved at Bloomsburg University, with hundreds of clubs and organizations, you can absolutely find something to join that interests you. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Some professors should be a little more involved with the students, but overall I've had a great experience attending Bloomsburg for the past 3 years!"
Sophomore,4,The administration is very cooperative with the students to answer questions and help fix misunderstanding and any issues you may have. It's a bit difficult to find student worker jobs. The academic departments could use some work.
Junior,4,"I enjoy my experience as a Bloomsburg University student. Bloomsburg University has a beautiful campus and everything is just a short walk away. The professors are great and really strive to help the students learn. The town of Bloomsburg is nice, pretty and clean. The class size is a good professor-student ration. You don't feel like just a number in a crowd at Bloomsburg. With a smaller class size, it's easy to pay attention and ask the professor questions. Everyone strives to be an individual and the atmosphere at Bloomsburg really encourages. Overall I have greatly enjoyed my experience at Bloomsburg University and wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a pleasant experience at Bloomsburg University. My academic experience was exceptional and my professors helped me open doors that I would not have opened otherwise. The professors prepare their students very well. After reflecting on my experience at Bloomsburg, I would like to see better communication within the Colleges (i.e. the College of Science and Technology) and within the Departments (e.g. the Department of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology). Improved communication would reduce the uncommon miscommunications between faculty members and students.
 
The student body is very active and welcoming, and reflects unity and strength. The enthusiastic student mindset allows for a fun, healthy, and diverse student life, along with an exciting party scene. Bloomsburg University students, faculty, and staff take pride in their school and allow it to be reflected in their actions."
Niche User,4,"The Bloomsburg University campus is amazing and beautiful. Its very diverse with all the types of people and the atmosphere is amazing. I wouldn't change a thing.  I absolutely love the sports here, I am a swimmer and I love it. They kinda didn't help with my finical aid. I am currently trying to fix that, college is expensive and I wish I worked harder in High school."
Freshman,4,Beautiful campus with a little downtown. You're in the beautiful mountains but its definitely cold. They seem to have a very helpful administration as I have called a numerous amount of times when needing help with filling things out.
Sophomore,4,"Bloomsburg is a beautiful campus! Everyone on Bloomsburg campus is nice. Classes are generally easy, and a lot of the professors are great. It is a great experience up in the mountains."
Freshman,4,What I enjoy about BU is that they have excellent education and every professor I’ve had so far has been really nice and informative. BU has a great atmosphere with a lovely campus and lots a friendly students.
Freshman,4,I am so happy that I picked Bloomsburg. I have made many new friends and everyone here is really nice and are more than happy to help if you need any. What I would like to see changed is that the elevators in some of the buildings break down and you are stuck walking up nine flights of stairs to get to your dorm. Also the elevators are just old and I think it is time that they get them replaced.
Senior,4,"Bloomsburg University is such a beautiful campus and has a wide variety of races. There are many places nearby to hangout with friends during free time such as bowling, skating, movies, etc. freshman year is almost everyone’s  best year here because everything is new such as meeting new life time friends and experiencing your first year as a college student. However, it’s important to remain focus on academics more than activities and fun because falling behind on grades is a bad feeling because once GPA is effected badly it’s hard to bring up."
Freshman,4,My experience at Bloomsburg is amazing I learned how to live on my own the professors are great the students are helpful they look out for each other the campus and the staff won’t let you down.
Freshman,4,My experience at Bloomsburg University of PA has been good thus far. The university has several clubs and resources that I used and can use for next semester.
Sophomore,4,"This is currently my second year at Bloomsburg and I love this school. While being at this institute I can say that you will actually learn things that will help you in life. There is always something going on and so many clubs and activities for students to do. But this is a party school, students find parties to go to almost everyweek. Some just have to find the balance between work and play which becomes a challenge for some."
Senior,4,"Bloomsburg University has a beautiful campus with great professors. The apartment housing is excellent, while dorms are average. The return on investment is high, however there are a number of pointless and expensive fees to be aware of. There are great people to meet here and plenty of things to keep you busy on/off campus."
Freshman,4,my experience at blooms been fantastic. the campus is very beautiful and diverse. I get to meet people from all over the world. the professor are top notch. everyone loves to learn and share.
Sophomore,4,"My personal experience in bloomsburg is actually pretty great. I'm not too far from home but far enough I still miss it. Bloom always has different activities so it's never boring. Professors are great and people are pretty nice as well. What I would like to see change would be the housing buildings some are really old and need some fixing, other than that it's a great school and I'm glad i chosed it."
Junior,4,"There is a lot to do on campus. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. There are less fees than the other state schools, but there are a lot of administrative changes in the works."
Freshman,4,"I like Bloomsburg University because it offers diversity in numerous ways; the people, classes, environment. Bloomsburg is also very military friendly and help me to succeed. The only drawback in my opinion is that it is located a very rural area."
Sophomore,4,As an incoming  freshman I was overtaken by the university. Everyone was so friendly and I immediately fit in. The campus is beautiful and definitely recommend to anyone looking
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Bloomsburg University. My program is very challenging but the professors are always willing to give help to those who ask. The campus is beautiful and is a really great place to make new friends and play games on the ""quad""."
Freshman,4,my experience in Bloomsburg university was great I made a lot of friends and the school offered a lot of clubs for people to be themselves and meet people with similar interest as them. I would not change anything about Bloomsburg university.
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Bloomsburg University. When I first applied to Bloomsburg, I only looked at the cost of the tuition because I did not know what I wanted as a major. Since I was a first generation college student, I was available to join a program that helped me adjust to college life. I was also undecided so I was given an advisor who helped me decide on a major. I finally choose my major which is digital forensics and it is considered one of the best schools in the world for digital forensics."
Niche User,2,"The party culture at Bloomsburg is crazy. If you drink you will be fine, if youre not a drinker this is an awful place."
Junior,2,"Well where do I start off, it's a small nice town, which is great but really it's more of college town if anything. Terrible greek life, high odds of getting sexually assaulted, 3 students have died in one semester this year and we're only 2 months in. Every time some faculty member has the guts to come forward with something about the university or even gets close they mystery disappear. No security on dorming areas so if you want a town where crime rates are high, grades are poor, faculty members that come and go, along with terrible advisors, this is your school."
Freshman,2,A safety school that most people can get into.  Most of the students here are more interested in partying than going to class.  The town is nothing special and the sports are subpar- a lot of people here don't even go to the football games.  The people here are usually nice but it's not the best college experience.
College Sophomore,2,I hear too much about cocaine and alcohol on a regular basis.
College Sophomore,2,"Courses are EXTREMELY difficult to get into at Bloomsburg. Everyone has to basically fight for a spot in classes. However, I enjoy the professors of my major. They are very experienced and knowledgable. They are helpful when I need guidance. Also, class sizes are perfect in Bloomsburg. They aren't too big and they aren't too small. There is a lot of classes that allow one on one communication."
College Sophomore,2,I can honestly say that I have only been to 1 football game and like 3 basketball games in my time at Bloomsburg. Nobody pays an overabundance of time paying attention to sports here.
College Student,2,I don't go to Bloomsburg yet but what my sister has told me the Greek life is really bad up there.
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do.
College Junior,2,"A bunch of hazing, really dumb concept."
College Junior,2,"There isn't much here, and is very unhelpful."
College Freshman,2,They don't do anything for the community in comparison to other groups. All they do is drink.
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive as much help as i needed so I am not struggling with paying for the amount of money I owe. I am really hoping I can get this scholarship to help me pay for my schooling.
College Freshman,2,"I was barely eligible for aid although my parents income would suggest that I would definitely need aid. They do not give out academic scholarships to freshman, only athletic, and the way to apply for scholarships as an upperclassman is a complete headache."
College Freshman,2,It had taken my family and I to even get any type of government to help pay for school. After a while I didn't even receive enough to pay for school.
College Freshman,2,its hard to rate most scholarships are for pa residents.  its hard to get scholarships when an out of state student
College Sophomore,2,"I recently was awarded a Board of Governors tuition scholarship, although with our new Pay-per-credit system it will not cover 18 credits, even though we were promised ""full tuition"" would be waived..."
College Junior,2,There isn't much to do at all. Hiking is about the only activity to do. There are no malls nearby and the only place to really get anything you might need that is relatively close is Walmart.
College Junior,2,"They can be rude and they think they're really important to campus life...they aren't, they only make up 10% of the campus population"
College Sophomore,2,The campus security is very strict when it comes to parking regulations and policies.  The school holds the students to a higher standard when it comes to their academic and living situations. They hold them accountable for their own stuff.
College Freshman,2,The ISIS account is so confusing the way it is set up and it is confusing when you have holds on your account.
College Freshman,2,If you live on campus they have parking lots on campus and is a pain to get your car.
College Freshman,2,There is not much diversity. I have met maybe one or two gay guys. There are only white and black people and very few asians. People are ignorant and closed-minded towards diversity here.
College Freshman,2,"The town is nice, but it's in the middle of nowhere. The town has a few bars, but not much to do. There is no shopping close by."
College Student,2,my school for some reason is not the best with safety
College Sophomore,2,It seems like everyone drinks but the police have really cracked down on partying. 
College Freshman,2,"Blue lot, which is where most of the freshmen are forced to park, is incredibly far away. You have to take the shuttle there, if you park later at night there are never any spots. It is expensive. I never go to get my car unless I need to go home because it is so out of the way. There is another lot, black lot, which is right on campus but that is usually reserved for seniors and juniors but they don't tend to live on campus so it doesn't matter to them anyways. "
College Freshman,2,"Curriculum and workload, coming from a competitive high school, is not difficult nor competitive. The school should probably improve on their academics if they want their graduates to be taken seriously by employers... "
College Freshman,2,"The school is not very diverse, it's either Hick kids from PA or people from right around or in Philadelphia. You very rarely meet kids that are not conservative or Republican in their values and hold some form of Catholicism as their religious belief. Whites are the majority on campus however, economic status varies. "
College Freshman,2,"It is impossible to get financial aid from the school. I applied and my parents are divorced and my mother's primary source of income comes from substitute teaching and the most I received was subsidized loans which didn't even cover a fraction of the price of the school--not that the school is by any means on the more expensive side, especially if you live in state. However, I would have appreciated a work study opportunity at the least which I did not receive."
College Freshman,2,Campus Dining is very limited in their options. I am a vegetarian and they don't accommodate very well in terms of vegan or kosher options. There are few healthy options and a larger amount of unhealthy options. A lot of the food leaves you with tummy troubles but the Husky has very good food. 
College Freshman,2,"There is a downtown area with fun things to do like a Hookah Bar and there are regular bars and juice palces and froyo and such but it gets rather repetitive after a while, especially if you aren't 21. There are few chain eateries around town but there is not much to do outside of downtown except for one crummy movie theatre. The town around the college is super country."
College Senior,2,"Rain, rain, and more rain. The weather changes so frequently that it's usually uncomfortable on campus. In the morning it's freezing so you wear warm clothes and by mid day it's roasting hot out. It's hard to decide what to wear when you need to factor in how long you will be on campus throughout the day 
"
College Senior,2,"I've constantly had issues with the financial aid office every single year.  I did end up receiving a decent amount of aid. However, I was consistently in the office making sure they were following through with my information. I've needed to send them my information two or more times on a regular basis because they lose things or claim they never received them. I've also dealt with people within the office who are not friendly, and do not seem to have the mentality that they are there to be helpful. When I ask for their advice relating to financial aid issues they never have any helpful tips for me. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are many places to grab a bite on campus. However, the dining halls are mainly filled with sugar, sodium, deep fied, gressy and fatty foods. There are a few healthy selections but there could be a larger varitey. The food here is also very blan, dry, and tasteless. There should be a kitchen in every resident hall for those who get tired of eating the same things year around. Whether you like to eat a few times a day or not the flex goes fast !"
College Senior,2,Bloom is something I call a townversity. Its a really small town with a big university in the middle of it. There are a few resturants but none to fancy and eextravagant. Your better off (in my opinion) buying food from the supermarket and cookin at your dirm or apartment.
College Sophomore,2,"In the summer it's good, but in the winter it stays cold for a long time. It also is very windy and rainy."
College Sophomore,2,It is very dreary most of the time. I remember I didn't see the sun for about a week one time. It snows a lot and classes rarely get cancelled.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't know about parking on week days but parking on the weekends isn't too bad.
College Freshman,2,I find myself getting very tired of the food because after a while it lacks variety.
College Freshman,2,It is very cold and rainy/snowy during the winter and the library is far from the dorms so this is inconvienient during the cold season. The warm weather is excellent.
College Freshman,2,"Some of the facilities are very neat and clean. However, I think the bathrooms in certain dorms could use a little work."
College Freshman,2,"There is no public transportation at bloomsburg, but there is a shuttle bus which takes you to walmart, upper campus and to of campus housing. anywhere else you have to go you will need to walk or have a car"
College Freshman,2,The school is made up of mostly white people it is diverse. Although everyone is fairly nice to one another you don't see everyone of  all races hanging together. All together I say everyone I treated fairly.
College Sophomore,2,Bloomsburg University happens to be very diversed. Although the majority are white. racism often occurs toward people off color and many more but not only the campus but the town as well.
College Freshman,2,"I believe that they party too much, but they seem to have good friendships."
College Sophomore,2,"Average, nothing special. This school is mediocre."
College Sophomore,2,"Bloomsburg education is average. Very mediocre. If you like mediocrity, come to this school. But if you want to challenge yourself, my advice would be to seek education elsewhere."
College Freshman,2,"The on campus transportation at Bloomsburg is okay. It kind of gets annoying that the transportation stops running at 12:00am. However, there is the city bus available all the time, and I've heard great things about it."
College Freshman,2,"The police are very understanding if you treat them with respect. However, they can be strict about underage drinking and drug use.  I would recommend to always be smart about what you do, where you go, and how you behave because those are all important factors that are considered when you're dealing with any authority on or off campus. Always be respectful, and always be smart."
College Junior,2,"Police do not seem to enforce the rules I was told applied. My friend's neighbor was busted for weed, but still lives on campus. When they were caught again with it nothing even happened. Students are not really given under ages, and I believe the punishment is not as severe as it should be for some students actions."
College Senior,2,"Parking at Bloomsburg University can be miserable. Within the past few years, they have turned old parking lots into beautiful landscapes. Pretty to the eye but annoying if you like to drive to class. Also, the school police is strict with meters so ticketing can be just as frustrating. The campus and town is small so it very easy to walk around."
College Junior,2,"If your are 21 and over there is a big night life, if under 21 there really is not that much to do."
College Junior,2,The greek life seems to be all about partying and hanging out with friends. If you are not in a greek group you are seen as not as popular.
College Junior,2,Bringing a car to your freshman year is a pain.  You have to take a shuttle up to the lot where you park and it's tricky on weekends.  It gets better as you gain more credits but on-campus parking for people living on lower campus can get annoying.
College Senior,2,Computers located on campus are not always reliable. It would benefit students if they bring their own laptops.
College Senior,2,Could Be Better for Grad Sturdents – Grad students are pretty much left on their own and this is unfortunate especially when you are a returning student after many years and have children getting ready for college as well.
College Junior,2,"The library is usually only completely full around midterm and final time, occassionally at normal times you have to go up a couple floors to get a computer for yourself (if it works) and the wait for it to log you on is horrible.. but once you are on the speed is incredibly fast."
College Sophomore,2,"Annoyingly Strict – The police force are extremely strict when it comes to parking tickets but when it comes to alcohol and drug related crimes they barely do anything. They are more concerned about where cars are illegally parked than parties. Which is nice, but when your car has a ticket, it sucks."
College Junior,2,Disappointed That the Minor I Wanted Was Not Offered – I recently transferred to Bloomsburg.  In doing so I made sure all of mny credits transferred and I knew that they had an excellent art program as I am a Fines Arts major.  I wanted to minor in art education only to find out that it is NOT offered!  :-(
College Junior,2,At Bloomsburg you never know what kind of weather you're going to get. One day could be fantastic and the next could have that cool brisk breeze that is always blowing acrossed campus
Sophomore,1,"I hated going here. I had incidents multiple occasions within school boundaries and no one seemed to care. I went to the police at one point, and they laughed at me. I highly do not recommend. Even the people I did connect with are leaving as did I."
Sophomore,1,this place blows. joined a frat and its still boring. theres somehing fun MAYBE once a month. im trying to transfer
Junior,1,"I’m not going to lie, I came here to party and I ended up transferring second semester sophomore year, because even though there are parties going on, they all suck. They are all boring, lots of standing around and people being too concered of what others think. I transfered to Shippensburg and I like it way better! Parties and people are better. If you go to Bloom now and want out, i highly reccomend leaving."
College Sophomore,1,Not impressed with Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is a disaster. All they do is drink and party. If the Panhellenic Council actually saw some of these sororities they'd drop over dead. The local ones are worse though. Hazing, bullying, drug and alcohol use. It's nothing like those recruitment videos."
College Freshman,1,It always rains and its always freezing.
College Senior,1,"Not much to do as far as attractions go. However, there are some pretty scenic spots hidden around town"
College Junior,1,"I leave my apartment 30 minutes before class starts to at least stand a chance of getting a spot. The parking lot is unpaved and is like the dark side of the moon after a storm. The lines are spray painted onto gravel, which fades away within the first few weeks. The permit cost is incredibly reasonable, but the parking situation is not."
College Junior,1,"If you like a sea of bulky guys wearing wife-beaters, then you're in luck. If you're actually here to learn something, then you'll have to get past the students who are still in party mode while they come to class and hold everyone else up. For people who come to college to party, then you're in luck. Two words: block party."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking on campus can be very hard sometimes. If you don't arrive to campus early enough it can be a nightmare trying to navigate throughout the enter campus to find a spot.
College Freshman,1,"Bloomsburg is a very safe school and I see that laws and rules are strictly enforced everyday. I see police officers everywhere doing their job and they take everything extremely seriously. If you do something wrong, most likely you will not be able to get away with it."
College Sophomore,1,Me personally have not been introduced to notice the difference between the the greeks and the non-greeks. Everybody receive different treatment depends on who is addressing you and so forth.
College Freshman,1,"Bloomsburg is a very small town. Downtown Bloomsburg has a few shops, but almost every shop closes around 5:00pm. There's a mall in Bloomsburg, but you have to drive to get there, and there are hardly any good stores."
College Senior,1,"Housing here at Bloomsburg University can be a hassle. It is difficult to find landlords that have reasonable prices. The pros of living off campus is the amount of freedom that you gain, however, the cons are the cost which could be a problem in the long run."
College Junior,1,NO Where to Park – Unless your really good at parallel parking good luck finding a spot. The campus is surrounded by the town and private resident spots. Cops are everywhere and strict about the rules.
College Freshman,1,Sports Are Okay – The sports teams are okay but their events arent that big except for football.
College Junior,1,"Bloomsburg the Only Town in Pennsylvania – The town people hate Bloomsburg students. If they could blame the recent flood and chemical leak they had in the fall they would. The only chain clothing store the town has is Walmart which I am not even sure if it is actually in the area considered Bloomsburg. The town has a few big chains like McDonald's, Burger King, WEIS Market, and Giants. But good luck getting there because if you want to walk you have to strap on your hiking boots and hike up and down the mountain. The previous administrators thought it was a great idea the University will look so beautiful on top of a mountain. Yes, it is beautiful to look at but to live on not so much. At least we have beautiful grass area we call the ""quad"" that we can walk, tan, and play on all year around."
College Senior,1,"Financial aid is limited, the process is slow and long."
College Senior,1,"Low Security – There have been a few concerns within the last three years that I've been there. Students being robbed on campus, by the hospital and or at the apartments next to the campus. There has also been an incident where a student was threatened with a knife and another with a group of girls threatened with a gun.

There are also incidents where students who had been sexually taken advantage of/harassed and then stalked afterward were ignored and told to deal with it by campus police. One girl even had to leave the school in the end because the man was in her classes and following her around. More classmates were threatened on campus in the apartments.

I know women that would pretend to be on their cellphones when walking anywhere at night. From personal experience, I would say this is a necessity."
College Sophomore,1,"We Have Rules That Are Generally Ignored – There is a No Drinking On-Campus rule, but it's ignored by those who live in apartments on campus.  Many people drink on this campus, but not very many are caught by people on campus.  Usually, the campus police or town police do busts on certain houses in town."

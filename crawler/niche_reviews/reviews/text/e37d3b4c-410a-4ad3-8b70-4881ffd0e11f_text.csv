Niche User,5,It was an interesting time. I got to talk to a student who explained what the university was about and career fields.
College Senior,5,It's one of the premier healthcare universities in the country.  There is nothing more to be said.  The academics are high quality and nothing more could be asked from them
College Freshman,5,Medicine related majors. Pharmacy program has a superb program.
College Junior,5,"Great School â€“ It is a rigorous program, but is the only school in tri-state area to offer a B.A. in my field.  Admission is very limited, due to one on one clinical practice. Job opportunities are higher then average.  The cirriculum is full time Mon.-Fri. 8-4 with no summers off.  I enjoy it because classes are very small and the cirriculum is challenging!"
College Junior,4,"Content is great, organization is a bit lacking - but this seems to be true of all accelerated nursing programs."
College Junior,4,This is a very competitive school. You must have a very good GPA in order to get in to their nursing program. I would recommend having a minimum of a 3.5 GPA when applying. The higher your GPA the better your chances. There is also an interview process when applying.
College Junior,4,Love Thomas Jefferson University.  Only down fall would be the expensive price tag because it is a private school. Jefferson has great and helpful faculty.

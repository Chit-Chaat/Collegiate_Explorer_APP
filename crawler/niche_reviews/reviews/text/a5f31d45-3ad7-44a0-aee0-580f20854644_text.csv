Senior,5,"Most of the Fall 2020 classes are currently online. Aside from the technical issues, online learning at Yeshiva University is great."
Senior,5,Yeshiva University is an excellent place to strengthen your academic knowledge and your social skills.
Alum,5,There was no online learning at Yeshiva University. Online systems were totally fine for accessing learning materials
Alum,5,"Overall, a great experience!  Made great friends and had great academics to improve my job prospects afterwards"
Graduate Student,5,"I took Spring 2020 classes online due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. At first I was concerned. However, my Professors were so encouraging and engaging that I was able to feel very confident about my work and I absorbed all required and more.
In each course we were encouraged to share our experiences prior as a prelude to coursework. Our classes are smaller so there was a real sense of bonding, even though online. I am very excited to continue."
Graduate Student,5,"I love attending Yeshiva University's Wurzweiler School of Social Work. My courses are very interesting and engaging in person and also online. The Professors keep us challenged while providing a wealth of knowledge. General assignments, mid-terms and finals are exciting to work on individually or especially in groups. I am actively learning so much."
Alum,5,Took 1 online course throughout my career there. They make it very easy and affordable to take an online class. Teachers are readily available when you need them.
Senior,5,"I really liked the small class sizes. Obviously it's an entirely Jewish student body, so not much diversity, but at the same time if you are Jewish there's TONS of awesome programming for you. Your time at YU will be a religious growth experience as much as it is an opportunity for a secular education."
Senior,5,"I took some classes online for corona, they went fine. Obviously not ideal, but I thought the faculty did a great job with the transition."
Senior,5,I love Yeshiva University! It is a great private institution that prepares you for any graduate program. Especially in my field of study. I was accepted to my program straight from Yeshiva University.
Freshman,5,"The scores i gave express my high satisfaction!!! 
My name is Yuval Nitzan, 20 years old, from Gan Yavne, Israel. I recently approached YU to become a student for Fall 2019. I'm the oldest in my family. I have another sister at age 18 and little brother at age 13. I have been released from Military service, where I served as an officer's assignment. I have been recognized as an outstanding athlete. 
I have set myself a personal goal to study and play basketball in US college when I was 18. Since then, I have invested lots of efforts to be qualified and to make my dream become true. I took a SAT course & did the exam 3 times, to improve the score. I also had a private class for Mathematics, who helped me to raise my score in the Math matriculation certificate and to improve my GPA."
Sophomore,5,"I love going here and living in New York City! I have everything I need a few minute walk away. I’ve only been here one semester, and I’ve learned so much. I’ve made so many great friends in my classes. Teachers are always so helpful with whatever questions I have. They really care about the student. I love that the classes are small so I can have more individualized attention during classes."
Niche User,5,"Amazing school, great friends, good school for staying religious, single gender campuses, Shabbatons,"
Freshman,5,Amazing staff. Lots of classes offered in every subject for all types of people to learn whatever they want.
Junior,5,"Yeshiva University is a small Jewish liberal arts college located in New York City. Its aim is to provide a strong Jewish and secular education by integrating Jewish and secular classes into one curriculum. While the college emphasizes the importance of academics it also offers an array of extra-curricular activities. Yeshiva University’s size, in terms of its student body and faculty, impacts positively and negatively upon many facets of the college."
Junior,5,"I really enjoy the rigorous Dual-Curriculum, as well as the numerous opportunities to be involved with the greater Jewish community at large. The university definitely fosters an environment that sets you up for success. The classes are stimulating, the professors are world class, and your peers all take their studies seriously. It's great to be among like minded people, and I'm very happy that our campus isn't known for excessive partying or substance abuse. It shows a certain level of maturity that I believe is absent on most other college campuses in the country."
Senior,5,"Yeshiva University has tremendous potential in growth and success. However, the Maada and Torah need to stay separate, and all Maada classes need to be taught 100% according to Jewish Halacha."
Niche User,5,Fantastic. Great teachers and faculty. The level of education is worth it. A little expensive but they help cover the costs.
Junior,5,It is an excellent school. I have gained tremendously from the institution as a whole. The academics are at a high level and the programming is always enjoyable.
Graduate Student,5,"Cool university with experienced teachers, which are always ready to help their students in any situation."
Graduate Student,5,"amazing, I can tell that The University is not what it once was. Unfortunately, the bureaucracy is slowly eating the University's finances away, causing good professors to leave and bringing in adjuncts who couldn't care less about the students. Then again, there are some great professors at YU, but at this rate I'm not sure how much longer they'd be able to stay. What the university needs is a complete reconstruction of their financial prioritization as well as sensible fiscal accountability. Only then will YU be able to keep professors for extended contracts and pay them enough to genuinely care about their students. I personally am a Political Science Major and Economics Minor, and I can attest to this dilemma. This past year (2012) the Political Science department lost all but one professor, making the department I once knew alien to me. There have also been cuts to the Economics department, as well as most all departments in the social and hard sciences. "
College Senior,5,Our security is excellent. The presence is always felt and I have always felt safe.
College Senior,5,The variety of courses are amazing and the professors have honestly changed my life.
College Junior,5,Love the school. Love the atmosphere. Great teachers and really helpful student body.
College Junior,5,"The school is located in Manhattan with lots of dining options, although not always financially friendly."
College Junior,5,"Many opportunities, location and hands on experience."
College Junior,5,The scenery and atmosphere is why I transferred to the NYC area.
College Junior,5,"I chose to transfer to Cardozo because the students, faculty and staff were very welcoming and friendly."
College Sophomore,5,"It is in midtown manhattan so there is access to any food really whenever you want and that is great. A few restaurants we have cafeteria money too so that is the best, although we all wish we had more. You could even take a subway anywhere else if you get tired of the food and you can find whatever type of food in the city."
College Junior,5,"I'm really not aware of any drug use at the school, though I guess it must exist. Seems very small then, though!"
College Sophomore,5,"Restaurants are everywhere in NYC, even across the street"
College Sophomore,5,anyone can join sport teams
Niche User,5,Not hard process. Admissions office is very accessible and very open minded.
Niche User,5,I am not living there yet. In a few months I will be.
Niche User,5,Not a drug scene school. People would be embarassed to do that.
Niche User,5,Yeshiva University is very generous with scholarships.
Niche User,5,I believe Yeshiva University helps students with internships.
Niche User,5,pretty diversified in terms of religous levels.
Niche User,5,I heard it's very good.
Niche User,5,NY transit systems are the best!
College Sophomore,5,There are many printing stations throughout the campus and you can get WiFi in most of the rooms on the campus. They have Fios and it runs fast. One doesn't need a laptop but it helps when one wants to take notes in class. They have computers in the library and there is also a computer lab.
College Sophomore,5,We are in Upper Manhattan and are located close to the A and 1 trains. There is also a shuttle that goes to the campus located in Midtown.
College Junior,5,"Weather doesn't really affect us, as we are located in Manhattan. "
College Junior,5,Free transportation into the city
College Junior,5,Have wifi in every dorm room 
College Junior,5,Athletics are a big part of school. 
College Junior,5,It is in the heart of NYC! There's no better place
College Junior,5,I would 100 % choose YU it puts me exactly where i want to be in life.
College Junior,5,Most are friendly and willing to assist 1st year students and show them around the campus.
College Junior,5,Very cheap convenient housing options around the campus
College Sophomore,5,"I came to Yeshiva University because it has a great pre-med program. Campus life is fun and engaging, there's a different event each night so if you want to fill your calendar it really isn't that difficult! The midtown location provides opportunity in itself to see the city and really see the dozen parades happening regularly! Classes are intriguing and the professors are only wanting to see you take your education far in life!"
College Freshman,5,"I received allot in financial aid, even more then I thought I would have gotten before. I set up a meeting with the person in charge of financial aid and he told me that there were many scholarships that i could apply for. When I applied for them, I got back an answer the very next day."
College Freshman,5,"New York City is a huge city with everything imaginable. It is the center of the world. It has every restaurant you can think of, it has concerts every night, fun bars, broadway, museums. It has it all."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is so nice and helpful.  Students at all grade levels are ready to assist
College Sophomore,5,"The security guards are everywhere, and they are very friendly and helpful."
College Senior,5,"There is a free shuttle between the two campuses, and a free shuttle to the other dorms"
College Sophomore,5,We Have a Lot – There are 2  computer labs on campus. There are many computers and printers all around campus. We have great wifi.
College Sophomore,5,No Problem – There was no problem for me to get into the major of my choice.
College Sophomore,5,"There Are Many – Whatever you want to go into, at YU there is a major for you."
College Junior,5,"Shuttle Is Good – Good location- midtown manhattan with abundant subways and shuttles to uptown campus,"
College Sophomore,4,School is great. It's very comfortable and accommodating. It's easy to sculpt the major you want and to start new clubs and groups. They're very helpful in helping you get the most out of your time there.
College Sophomore,4,Get really good grades in high school and apply to the honors program. They automatically give you a huge scholarship with no hassle.
College Sophomore,4,There is a vast variety of options that can satisfy anyone's needs. They are all conveniently placed a few blocks away from campus and all have rather affordable prices.
College Junior,4,"I am a transfer student at Cardozo Law School and will begin August 2014.  In my limited experience on campus, I feel that Cardozo Law is very safe."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a very safe school, I've never really heard much about campus crime, or really any safety problems unless it was from a homeless person outside, but even then it is fine. There is security."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't really have a program, but a school. I got into Stern College for Women, which is regular liberal arts studies college. It is great for sciences and I love that. Most important criteria for admission I would say is GPA, essay, extracurriculars, and SAT score. There is no abnormal process."
College Sophomore,4,"As of now, I love the academics. I may be taking 9 classes next semester with an 8 hour lab week, not including the research I will be doing, but I love it. Especially for science, it is great. The workload is very hard, because I am taking both secular classes and 3 jewish classes. There are many facilities out there to help you which is great. There is a great career center that can help with job opportunities and internships as well."
College Sophomore,4,"This depends on how one person would like it over another. It is very subjective. I don't mind that almost all the students are really the same. Yes, you find variety, which I have found and I like. But I don't mind that many people are the same. Mostly all are jewish students. People come from different backgrounds and political beliefs, mostly all have same religious views, and sexual orientation is not usually LGBT."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is in midtown manhattan. It is a GREAT area. However, it is VERY expensive so most students do not live in apartments that are off-campus. However, there are different buildings that a student can live in so that is great. There are many apartments available, they are simply too expensive. However, there is great transportations between buses, subways, taxis, and it is close to penn station. You won't have an easy time parking however. It is very safe."
College Junior,4,"The food may be kind of expensive, but you have a caf card loaded with money and I always had enough. There is Chinese, burgers, salads... always something."
College Junior,4,The workload is okay but the biology classes are fairly difficult.
College Junior,4,The biology department is large and extensive. Many classes!
College Junior,4,"It's pretty good, and professors are willing to meet with you and help much of the time. Small classes!"
College Junior,4,"I'm married so I live on the uptown campus so I'm constantly surrounded by people, both men and women because girls come uptown too! SHabbos can be hard though."
College Sophomore,4,I have met people from everywhere
College Sophomore,4,Feel very comfortable. Security guards in every building.
College Sophomore,4,im happy with computers at school
College Sophomore,4,ive never heard of any safety issues
Niche User,4,Every night men and women get together in the library and socialize there. I believe the university has mixers and socials.
Niche User,4,There are many security officers on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"no pressures around, if you want to go out you can if not you dont have too"
College Sophomore,4,"Stern is really great with transportation, they have inter-campus shuttles that take you to the boys campus and alo have local services which take you from dorm to dorm, and also to port authority and penn station at certain times."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are good and its easy to register for classes. The library is great for studying. Curriculum is good although I feel that there are to many cores. There is a lot of work but not so overwhelming.
College Junior,4,"Even though we had to go through a bit of a process, we did get what we needed, thank G-d."
College Junior,4,We have lots of classes and some really great teachers.
College Junior,4,There are restaurants to go to and lots of activities and events going on all the top.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't really have experience with the Health dept. in my school, just that I get emails about health insurance constantly."
College Freshman,4,Students do not commit crimes.  One robbery last semester.  A shooting 20 years ago.  Pretty boring.
College Freshman,4,"You cannot beat getting a quality secular education while living in a yeshiva where people do not use bad language, all the food is kosher, their our constant minyanim, and you are forced to spend four hours a day learning Torah."
College Freshman,4,"Excellent speed, you can print from your laptop to the school's printers, a lot of school computers available."
College Freshman,4,I have never seen alcohol or drugs in the dorms.  I was at a party off-campus with some beer.  Parties do not happen so often.
College Junior,4,"For someone who is really involved in sports, there are definitely options. "
College Junior,4,"It is the best location. The buildings are old, though. "
College Junior,4,"I've only been there once, to get throat lozenges, but the nurse/PA was very nice. "
College Junior,4,It's NYC! There are tons of restaurants to choose from. 
College Junior,4,I think we have this down pat. Our security guards are the nicest!
College Junior,4,"The professors in my major are great, but again, more variety in the classes would be helpful."
College Junior,4,The professors are mostly excellent and easy to talk to. 
College Junior,4,I would have to say there should be more of a variety. 
College Junior,4,Everything I needed they helped me 
Alum,2,"I went to Yeshiva undergrad 10 years ago. and I was one of the foreign students there. They treated me very badly, making fun of my accent and they were truly racist towards me because I was different. I t was the worst time of my life. I went to a none jewish school for graduate school, it was very different. I was accepted the way that I was. To be honest the school is just geared towards specific type of people and if you are different you can NOT fit in."

College Sophomore,2,Midtown is way too expensive for the vast majority of students. Some students live in Washington heights but that is a significant commute and not the safest area.
College Sophomore,2,There are two dining halls with very little variety and since everything is weighed students run out of cafeteria money quickly
College Sophomore,2,There are rarely any men of my liking that attend my school however there are plenty of women. The men to women ratio is very disproportionate.
College Sophomore,2,Guys and girls are on different campuses
College Sophomore,2,Nothing is cooked on campus.
College Sophomore,2,social life is either very party or very against party. very little in between. a lot of people get married young
College Freshman,2,"My school is in New York City, no one should have a car.  That said, I have a friend who has a car.   He has a spot somehow, but he is always afraid of losing it."
College Junior,2,"If someone wants to live near campus, it would be very expensive, as it is Midtown Manhattan. "
College Junior,2,"Athletics at YU are awful. The teams are terrible, and nobody really goes to the events."
College Junior,2,"Parties at YU absolutely suck. The only chances for decent parties are at nearby colleges (of which thankfully there are many), or the club/bar scene throughout New York City."
College Junior,2,"There are not many housing options available to the psychology-majored grad students at the campus on Morris Park, Bronx. They offer housing to med students, but those pursuing a graduate and/or doctorate level degree in Psychology are left to fend for themselves. This is especially difficult for students who are moving from other states to attend the university."
College Senior,2,"No diversity in religion and the majority is white, but there are many students from other countries."
College Junior,2,"Over 90% of the population in YU is Jewish and white, although other minorities are present."
College Sophomore,2,The view book makes it seem a lot more diverse than it really is.
College Sophomore,1,"Basically, there is no party scene. If there is a ""party"" then I've heard that they're not very exciting. Engagement parties are common though"
College Junior,1,Parking around here is terrible - you can circle for half an hour and not find a spot.
College Sophomore,1,so cold  so outside is not fun
College Sophomore,1,new york city so its hard
College Sophomore,1,no off campus just city life
College Sophomore,1,no off campus housing offered
College Sophomore,1,Only have one frat and they are sketch
College Sophomore,1,"I have not gotten one, and I am struggling to pay the 50 grand."
College Sophomore,1,I have to walk through the busy street of Midtown New York to get to the different buildings. The weather certainly does not make this enjoyable. Especially lately with all of the snow and rain.
College Freshman,1,"We have one fraternity, and they just got a house for their first time this year.  I do not know anyone in it.  They probably have parties, but I do not hear about them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It does not make sense to live off campus- you are paying a ton more, and you aren't on the cafeteria's meal plan."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is in midtown Manhattan making it very difficult to park. The school does not have it's own parking lot here, but there are a few parking garages that charge a fee that are close by."
College Junior,1,Campus housing is not offered to psych grad students at this school. Only medical students can obtain housing assistance. This is unfair.
College Sophomore,1,There is not much diversity here. Most people went to private school growing up.

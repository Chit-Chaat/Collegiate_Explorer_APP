Sophomore,5,"My first year at Wenatchee Valley College was awesome. I loved the campus, it wasn't so big but yet not so small. The professors there were always very helpful and always made sure you were doing great in their class. Now that it's online, it has been a little difficult but the professors are always answering very fast to any questions you have about anything. I loved how some put short 20-minute videos to explain a lesson. Overall online has been good, there's just a lot more reading to do."

Freshman,5,"What I enjoyed most about Wentachee Valley College is the community and the teachers. They have made learning very enjoyable and the classrooms are not very big so you are able to have a close relationship with your professors. The community is small and that is something I enjoy very much, I find this college to be a good transition from High School to College."
Sophomore,5,The professors are overall super nice and really care about their students. The classes are small (usually 30 students or less)and make it easier to get all your questions answered during class.
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoyed the courses and professors I received while doing my two years at Wenatchee Valley College.
Alum,5,"Wenatchee Valley College is an outstanding community college. The campus is beautiful, the professors are knowledgable and helpful, and the students are friendly.

College Senior,5,"Wenatchee Valley College is career oriented, with people headed for a transfer degree, business degree, or nursing degree. Everyone is very goal oriented to get their specific degree."

College Junior,5,Lots of housing options close to school

College Senior,5,I absolutely love WVC. It is a great place to earn your AA and get used to the college lifestyle. I have been more than happy with my professors and feel I have learned a tremendous amount in a short amount of time.
College Sophomore,5,"AMAZING, I don't want to go any where else!!!!"
College Junior,5,Wenatchee Valley College is a great school because they offer about 100 clases and lots of minors. It is a great place to start your education.
College Junior,5,"I spoke to the lady in charge, she is kind, very helpful, and patient. She will help decide what sort of job to look for and is very informational. She helped me with my work-study, another lady helped me as well as to how to do a resume and also how to be in an interview which was very helpful."
College Junior,5,"I feel comfortable with my professors, so far I have been able to speak with them all and get along. It's a great school or I just got lucky."
College Junior,5,I never felt alone and everyone provided help.
College Junior,5,I like that I can get an education through financial aid.
College Senior,5,"I have experienced some very good teachers and have heard many great things about others. My favorite teachers were my economics teacher (Jim Cannon) and my math teachers (Sharon Wiest and Angie Russell). The courses I have been well-structured, and I have learned many things. The Associate's degree offered has introduced me to many new areas of study, many of which I have been surprised that I have liked."
College Senior,5,Financial aid basically pays my entire tuition and students are very good about lending out and buying books.
Recent Alumnus,5,If you are ill for a clinical rotation there are simulated clinical credit hours done online. This is helpful in case you have kiddos who become ill with little notice.
Recent Alumnus,5,Having good grades earned me my seat in the nursing program. The pre-nursing classes also provided a well rounded knowledge prior to beginning nursing classes.
Recent Alumnus,5,Instructors are open to student opinion. If there are things we want changed we are able to present well documented information in order of the chain of command. Many changes have been made since I entered the program. We have a voice.
Recent Alumnus,5,When you are in a nursing program you have class with the same individuals for two years. You know everyone's strengths and faults. You become family. Wouldn't change it for the world.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am about to graduate with my ADN from the nursing program. It was a tough 2 years, but the nursing program taught me how to be a professional young adult. Because of the mentorship I already have a job in the hospital of my choice waiting for me upon graduation. Wonderful program."
College Senior,5,"I am taking all online classes this quarter and I love it, for community college setting that is. I have busy work schedule so online just fits my lifestyle better. The online courses are run through 'intructor' by canvas, which is a great set up: easy to use, fluidity between courses, easy communication and navigation."
College Senior,5,The online classes that I have taken are very good at giving you a fair amount of work.  They are very detailed in what you need to do and the Professors are very good about explaining how they want things done.  At Wenatchee I play softball so online classes are good to take because you don't miss class for games and you can manage your time with your other classes better.  It is different from classrooms because you can't ask immediate questions because you have to email professors and wait for them to get back to you but they are usually good at answering your questions as soon as they can.  All of the online classes I have taken have required me to do a biography so that the professor and other classmates can get to know who I am.  This is a great way to get to know other people.  They also set you up with email accounts so you can interact with other classmates if you need help on something.  I really like taking online classes at Wenatchee Valley College.
College Junior,5,"I love how my school has online classes, I can't always make it to campus. I especially hate going out in winter so it is very useful."
College Junior,5,The Network Is Great – the computer network has always been great! i have never had any problems with it. i always used the computer when i was at school it always worked good for me. once in a while it would be slower than usual but its not too bad.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Community Envolvement – This college does so much for the local community. Students are expected to participate, both in class and outside of class, in various events. The college sponsors events for the food bank, donates to Smile Train, etc!"
Senior,4,"The college campus is very motivating. Seeing other students around you trying to achieve the same goals as yourself keeps me going. I also enjoyed going into the library and other resources they had. What I enjoy the most of the campus that it has a variety of resource stations such as the library, writing lab, and even have a math lab."
Senior,4,It was an amazing expirence. I love how I got to experience the college lifestyle. Although it is time to move on to the next environment which is the university. I recommended people to go to Wenatchee Valley College to get your first two years done. It is the closest thing to affordable education
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are effective and allow you to have a more flexible schedule. Sometimes lack of communication can make course a bit difficult but at WVC, professors reply to emails in a timely manner as well."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked the most about WVC apart from feeling at home is that they offered all of the required courses for the dental hygiene program I was interested in. During my 2 years at WVC I had all the support I needed. Being a part of the Trio program was one of the biggest benefits. They helped me understand and fulfill all of the pre-requisites for DH. They also helped me financially by waiving the application fees at the transfer colleges I applied to.
      Another  great resource is the Write Lab. The Wright Lab has outstanding work ethic and English geniuses to help with not only english papers, but any type of essay, speech having to do with any course. They are fast, effective and take time to listen to the areas you need help with the most. I've never been disappointed with my final grades on a paper. 
    Like any other college, there are job opportunities on campus which many students take advantage of. You will see familiar faces on campus even if you're from out of town!"
Sophomore,4,"I like the professors, they truly care about your success. Unfortunately the financial aid department is terrible at getting back to you during this pandemic."
Sophomore,4,Wenatchee Valley college is a great college for students who like a small town kind of feel. The school is small enough that you will know a lot of people but big enough that you will still meet new people each quarter. The faculty is amazing in both online classes and face to face classes.
Alum,4,"While attending, I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity that I saw across campus grounds. Despite it being a community college, there were always events going on and activities that were meant to get the students involved. The campus was very beautiful compared to other schools that I visited, and the local area is very safe. If you love the outdoors, such as hiking, fishing, skiing, or rock climbing then it's a plus! While the dorms could improve and expand, Wenatchee Valley College is very affordable and off-campus housing is as well. The academics were pretty good while I attended there and the college offered many classes, whether it be online, during the morning, or during the night. It was an overall well-rounded community college with a friendly and helpful staff!"
Sophomore,4,"Good experience. I just sometime the main office sometime mixes up some papers, since i was a transfer to this college some of my credits got lost in the paper work."
Freshman,4,"Good so far, the teachers are helpful and understanding, and the classes are challenging yet interesting. I think that this has been a helpful experience for me to attend this college."
Sophomore,4,"My experience in Wenatchee Valley College was good everybody there is really friendly and I felt welcomed. I think it is really great that there is a Rec Center for  everyone to attend who is interested. In the campus it is easy to get around since it's not a big campus. There are some clubs for students to join that are interesting and you can meet new people as well. I also have experience in the dorms, it's convenient since the dorms are in front of the campus so if you don't have a vehicle you can walk there and there are some stores nearby. In the dorms you will have a roommate and the room is a bit small. There is also a kitchen available to the residents and you will meet new people as well."
Freshman,4,"My experience with wenatchee valley college was encouraging, I did a 1 quarter Emt program and to be honest decided towards the end that that wasn't for me.  Although  doing this encouraged me to make the decision to go back and  hopefully get a associates degree in arts and sciences which I plan on starting summer quarter."
Alum,4,Good college in a small town environment.  Housing is not readily available in some cases and may be expensive.  The college itself is very nice and I believe I am receiving a quality education.
Alum,4,"I had a very pleasant experience at WVC. The faculty were very professional and invested in their students. During the two years I attended WVC I was encourage to explore areas of interest to help better determine my major in the future. The counselors there were very helpful with making sure us as students were registered, involved and thriving in our education. If there was one thing I would like to see improved is the student interaction. During my time there were only a couple of events for students telling us how we could be involved but after that it was harder to find. I wanted to be more involved with my school but could not find ways to easily."
Niche User,4,It's a pretty good college with lots of helpful people. They have many subjects you can major in and resources to help you get the help you need to pass your classes and successfully graduate.
Graduate Student,4,"I went to WVC north campus in Omak, WA. The professors were very kind and great teachers, and it was very affordable. Employees are understanding and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I love Wenatchee Valley College. The professors, for the most part, are wonderful. Some of these professors I will remember for the rest of my life. This has been a wonderful place to start a college career."
Sophomore,4,I am a Running Start student at WVC and personally love the opportunity and the college. I really enjoy a lot of the professors that teach there. One thing that I think should change at WVC is there should be more focus on study groups and clubs to help students through their college courses.
Freshman,4,"All advisers are well responsive and kind. They put a lot of effort in advising us their subjects. Campus is very beautiful, especially in spring time. Most what I liked is freshness of weather in Wenatchee area. In winter time you can go to ski and in summer time you can go to swim. About dormitory, It is well constructed and comfortable to live when you study at Wenatchee Valley College. Food is also wonderful with lot of fresh vegetables and fruits. Campus is secured 24/7."
Freshman,4,"I have had a pretty good experience. It can be frustrating to find information sometimes because you have to go to each department for answers. However, i have always been treated fairly. There are the typical choices of programs for a community college in a small town and the campus is well maintained."
Alum,4,"WVC is a great place to get your feet wet before heading off to University. It taught me a lot about the process, study skills and provided me with priceless connections."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of WVC. I found that it really supports learning. I also liked how small the campus is. It helps to get from one class to another, especially if they are right after each other!"
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my time and experience at WVC. I enjoyed the small classes and the affordable price as well. I highly recommend attending Wenatchee valley if you don’t know what you want to do, and you aren’t wasting time either."
Sophomore,4,"There is so much diversity, in the students, professors, and teaching methods. To me, this makes everyday something new and fun!"
Junior,4,"WVC has the amenities of the larger colleges but with the small town attention to detail. The classes are smaller and there is more time to spend with instructors which is helpful when test time rolls around. Everyone knows each others names and uses them, which makes it feel very comfortable and at home while on campus."
Niche User,4,"Great professors, interesting classes, student body is very diverse. Had a good time in running start while I was there. Enjoyed my time with their study groups."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed Wenatchee Valley College, as a first-generation student there was a lot of assistance in my first year. The resources are there to use, such as the Writing lab and Tutor Center."
Sophomore,4,"Being a smaller school the professor are a lot more willing to work with you and are very personable. It's a campus where it is easy to make friends and run into familiar faces so you are never really alone. Here we have a campus ministry called Connect that meet every Thursday at 7 p.m. and it's a great way to find some roots here in the valley. Sports are very popular among the students, during most games the student section is packed with people who are there to have a good time and are very friendly. Another nice thing about this campus is you see the variety in weather: rain, sun, fall colors, and snow so it's a great place to figure out what kind of place you would like to live in the future."
Senior,4,My experience at Wenatchee Valley College was very average. It's exactly what you' expect from a community college. The class sizes are small and there is ample opportunity to meet with your professor if you need help.
Junior,4,I like the small classes that make it easier to reach out to instructors. I like that it feels a bit easier to interact with others and express ideas. I really enjoy the fact that there are a lot of people on my level but not on an overwhelming level.
Alum,4,I liked the personality and willingness that the professors enacted with the students. One thing that I would like changed is the teaching of more engineering classes.
Alum,4,My experience at Wenatchee Valley College was excellent. The professors were helpful and knowledgeable. The small classroom size allowed opportunities to interact on a better level with peers and instructors.
Freshman,4,"I have attending the LPN-RN transition program waiting to go into the 2nd year RN program. All the staf have been very supportive and the instruction meteral have been very easy to understand, I recommend Wenatchee  Vallley college to anyone who is interested in attending"
Freshman,4,"Small class sizes and helpful professors are great! Most I've encountered really want you to succeed. The tuition is not very high and Wenatchee is a nice place to live, if you can find a reasonably priced apartment. I did not play sports for WVC but most athletes I know seem to enjoy their time here."
Freshman,4,Excellent student to teacher ratio. Small campus. Good opportunities for extra help. Small town atmosphere in intellectually stimulating environment.
Niche User,4,"My overall experience at Wenatchee valley college was great. For being a small college it offers big academic advances, and since the school is in the community everybody knows everyone. That's the best part, and the college is centered which means it has easy access to everyone. I'm not exactly sure if I would change anything being a small college it's easy to maneuver.  "
Alum,4,"I liked this school. The academics were pretty good and challenging at times which is what I needed. The professors could have been a little bit more helpful at times, but that's the way it is with schools sometimes. The campus is really nice for a small town, and it was easy to find my way around to all my different classes. They were helpful in getting me the information that I needed to have for running start and made it go a lot smoother for me. My overall experience from this college was good. Coming to this school after going to a high school that was merely adequate may have made it seem that much better, but if anything, it allowed me to really understand what it was like to be more on my own for school. On top of all of this, the staff and other students were nice to me as a whole and made my experience at this school enjoyable. "
College Junior,4,The registration was easy and the professors are really supportive.
College Junior,4,The counselors will always be at your side to help you.
College Junior,4,The courses at Wenatchee valley College are top of the notch.
College Junior,4,Wenatchee Valley College is a one of a kind school. Its amazing opportunities and friendly environment are a key to success.
College Junior,4,"I was scared at first to go to college but, this school really took me in. It has a friendly community and its teachers are very approachable. The student life is also amazing, everyone is very friendly."
College Senior,4,"I have mostly had great teachers so far, but two of them talk 75% about their personal life and 25% of class related stuf."
College Senior,4,I am receiving a transfer degree (an AA available to switch 90 credits to any university) and it is great to have many counselors to show you the best way to do it.
College Sophomore,4,I am currently not in the program but I do know it is just as challenging as the Nursing which is great because they chose student who know what they are doing and show professionalism. There are many opportunities students can be apart of and the greatest part is that they also provide job opportunities and mentorships so that students can participate and know what they would like to do with their career paths.
College Sophomore,4,My experience at WVC is great! All members including student and staff are all welcoming and friendly.
College Junior,4,Max class size is around 35 even in lectures
College Junior,4,Lots of career choice and planning help available
College Junior,4,I havnt had the chance to take any online courses but I've sured heard positive comments about students on campus about online classes.
College Junior,4,"Wenatchee valley college has helpful a lot so far , I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in but I kind of have an idea of what I want to major in. They provided me a really good advisor that helps me choose what courses I should be taking in order to achieve my career goals."
College Junior,4,Wenatchee Valley college provides really great career options. I've met students who have successfully graduated from Wenatchee Vallej College. It's not easy to earn a degree but it's sure worth it.
College Junior,4,My professors so far have been really helpful for me in several ways. They always try to provide the best information they can to help us understand and be ready and prepare to move on to higher courses.
College Sophomore,4,"This is my first quarter of college. The teachers have been supportive, and the entire application process was easy. This is a great first year of college for me."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers make the work tough but reasonable. Homework time is 2 hours for every class. Very do able and you may not always have homework every day. Depending on what you want to do as a career the homework amount changes for every student. There are many opportunities to work on and off campus. They have a whole set of people there to help you get a job because they know college is tough and they want to help.
College Sophomore,4,The school is great for kids right out of High school. It is a small school so the classes or not over flowing. Many opportunities are offered on campus and the professors are very willing to help a student succeed in their life goals. Helps to understand the transition form high school student to college student.
College Junior,4,Wenatchee Valley College is a great school. I have earned my AA degree here and am currently working on my radiology technician degree. I love my school and have learned alot!
College Senior,4,I have really enjoyed almost all my online classes. I am kind of an awkward person and on online courses we discuss our topics through discussions on most topics and I really like that. For some reason I feel more comfortable talking the way and I do learn a lot because we all talk and bounce ideas off each other. I have had some trouble with communication with professors sometimes but most times the professors answer me very quickly when I have questions. I also really like how you can submit assignments whenever you want (within deadline). Most of my assignments have been due at midnight for online courses and that is really nice because I work very often and I don't have to worry about my assignments being due when I'm at work.
College Senior,4,I think the student body of my school is well diverse. We have religious groups and the school seems to be accepting of everyone. I have not encountered any challenges from this school relating to diversity.
College Senior,4,"I really like the professors and classes offered. Each year there seems to be more and more classes available every year. The class registration is very easy, all I had to do was go online and pick my classes."
College Junior,4,"The student Senate tries very hard being active which is great but there could be a bit more emphases in the sport events, WVC has great athletes who need support!"
College Senior,4,Everything is very lively here. Great programs and great people. There are always lots of activities and different clubs to join. All instuctors are willing to help.
College Junior,2,I think in order to do good on an online class you need to have good relationship with the professor.  It's good to be able to ask questions comfortable.
College Junior,2,"Well, I can't complain much but my school can use an upgrade.  It needs more teachers that love their job not just teachers that teach for pay."
College Senior,2,The computers are extremely slow a lot of the time.
College Junior,2,I cannot take any actaul classes for my major
College Sophomore,2,The only campus activities are dances. There is no athletic center for students to work out in. The library is pretty good and the librarians are helpful
College Sophomore,2,There needs to be more class varieties!!! Electives are all the same and there are not a lot of cultural classes
College Sophomore,2,"They are all old, look old, and feel old. They all have lots of problems and could use work. Its just not a very good looking school other than the new arts building that is modern."
College Junior,1,I had to drop my math class on my first quarter because the teacher I had was the worst I've ever had.  I wasn't learning anything.   I didn't even last a week there and I was already lost by the second day of class.
College Sophomore,1,Reason why  i chose Wenachee Valley College in Omak was because i live in oroville. i cant afford to travel all the way Wenachee. I have a baby and i have to work so it helps to have to travel little to college. Its been hard to be a mother and a students so i have not been able to give my best.  i know if i have a chance to go to your college i would do good because iv'e learned to manage my baby work and school.
College Senior,1,"Poor Quality of Education – For the amount of money this school costs, the education is very poor. I was often reminded of my high school classes. The administration is also not very helpful or involved. Overall, this is a college I would recommend only to students living around Wenatchee who want to get General Education requirements out of the way while still living at home."
College Junior,1,Work Source – in my little town of Omak Washington there is little places to look for jobs the only place we would go would be our local work source.mostly the students tranfer and look for careers in bigger cities
College Freshman,1,"Close Minded – The majority of students are rude, superficial, uncooperative and stuck up. 1 out of every 12 students will acknowledge me in a neutral or positive manner."

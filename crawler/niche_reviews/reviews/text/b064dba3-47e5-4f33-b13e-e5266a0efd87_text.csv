Sophomore,5,"Worcester polytechnic institute provides an incredible sense of community. Right off the bat, I was placed in an ""insight group"" that consisted of everyone on my floor of my dorm. This allowed me to become very close with everyone and I still talk to many of them and ended up rooming with two of them this year. Besides this, the many clubs and activities on campus make it incredibly easy to make friends. If you feel you don't have the time or energy to join many clubs then it's still incredibly easy to make friends through classes and major projects such as GPS, IQP, and MQP. The thing I love most about WPI is the terms, because I take 3 new classes every term I am able to progress much quicker in my academics and make new friends extremely quickly!"
Sophomore,5,"WPI is a good school for those who want to be engineers, and that's all. If you want to start a startup, create something, this school is not the best place to get help. Anyway, you will study a lot."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so friendly at WPI. The environment encourages learning, helping others learn, and social interaction. There are many amazing professors, and some not-so-amazing professors. The food is not the best.
Overall, I'm very happy I chose WPI and I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in a career in STEM."
Junior,5,"WPI has amazing academics, athletics, and student life. I have completely enjoyed my 2 years there. However freshman year I did not like the food at all and resorted to eating somewhat unhealthy. But I moved off campus after that as most students do and have had minimal complaints since."
Alum,5,Great Education in a great environment. WPI offers a world class education with some of the best campus resources around as well as a vibrant community life.
Alum,5,WPI had online learning tools as early as my attendance between 2010-2014 iincluding video taped lectures and online updates of lecture notes.
Alum,5,"I graduated with a degree in biochemistry from WPI and I loved every minute of it. Though I was not a traditional engineering student, I felt right at home on campus and had a very enriching experience. The professors I had were very knowledgable and helpful for the most part. In addition, I loved WPI's atmosphere. The students there are very helpful and there is not an overwhelming sense of competition, like there can be in other STEM programs. People were helpful, kind, and hardworking for the most part. Lastly, it is important to mention the outcomes of the school. WPI graduates have amazing success when it comes to finding jobs. I know plenty of people working for big name companies and making great salaries. Companies like to hire from WPI because they trust our education and competence."
Alum,5,Great school for STEM. It has an excellent job network and research opportunities. Highly recommend.
Freshman,5,I love attending WPI. Never in my life have I felt more invited and supported in a community that really supports you. I definitely recommend it to any student considering a major in STEM. Their unique academics and project-based learning is very helpful and rewarding as a student.
Graduate Student,5,I like to campus and atmosphere of the college. My daughter started last year and she is very very happy to be there.
Sophomore,5,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is one of the best engineering schools in New England and offers other great opportunities unique to WPI. From off-campus 7-week programs across the world, hands-on major qualifying projects, to 4 7-week terms instead of 2 15 week semesters, WPI offers a unique approach to technical education."
Freshman,5,"WPI is overall very good. Professors, courses, and opportunities to explore passions and different things are abundant at WPI. Quite different from other schools in terms of grading, schedule, and more. Needs better food in dining halls."
Junior,5,I love this school. The education is great. The people are so friendly I’ve met my best friends and students willing to help each other succeed. The opportunities I’ve been given because of this school are worth it all
Freshman,5,"Great research opportunities even as an undergraduate. Worcester is nothing special, but the campus is great."
Freshman,5,"WPI has a great balance between student life and academics. As a freshman, a great deal of effort was put into activities that allowed students to connect with one another. As an introvert, this was an invaluable experience."
Freshman,5,"My experience at WPI has been excellent. Professors are kind and truly do have your best interest in mind, even in big lecture classes. Students are welcoming and genuinely enjoy life both in and out of the classroom. The food is excellent, and most of the dorms are good. Triples are difficult for first year but it can be avoided if necessary. The environment is positive, though the work is very difficult and classes move at a rapid pace. As long as you keep up with everything in a timely manner, you will succeed and thrive."
Freshman,5,"Even though the food and dorms aren't great, the academics, community, and network available to the students is just incomparable to any other school. The project based learning style makes it actually interesting and engaging. I have yet to meet a single person that wasn't nice on this campus. Almost everyone gets a job after they graduate."
Freshman,5,"There are so many clubs and sports to join, with faculty that are more than happy to help any student who needs it."
Niche User,5,"I went here for a tour and it looked awesome, I'm currently planning on applying because of how welcoming the staff and students are in the institution."
Sophomore,5,"Great school, great academics, great professors! A strong focus on STEM, but still requires some humanities."
Freshman,5,"An amazing school with fantastic programs! I have never heard anything bad, students are pushed to their best and are prepared for the workforce when they are done."
Freshman,5,"WPI is great! Their quarter-based academic year combined with a mix of STEM and humanitarian classes, as well as a project based curriculum, results in well balanced, hard-working and productive students ready for the  world."
Freshman,5,"WPI is pretty fast paced and you can easily get overwhelmed but if you keep up its a breeze. Classes are overall taught well and the material feels very relevant especially if you're an engineer. The student body feels pretty close together as well. Its a small school and you'll find that you recognize everyone at WPI by the second or third term. Campus life is not bad, the food is alright. Parties are mostly found at fraternities and you can definitely find some in apartments in the area. Also the fraternities have such a wide range of ""personalities"" among them. There are 13 and they all are very different. Even though its WPI, some of them are ""fratty"" but in a good way."
Senior,5,"A wonderful erudite experience for those interested in STEM careers. The teachers are truly passionate about their students and take the time to secure a deeper understanding of all the topics. Very safe, beautiful and clean campus and good food."
Niche User,5,Gorgeous campus and very friendly environment. Everyone is very nice and willing to help others. Definitely a collaborative school and will prepare you for a career after college.
Senior,5,WPI has given me every opportunity to accomplish what I set my mind to. The people at WPI truly care about your success. You must take the steps to get yourself on the right path by joining professional societies on campus and taking on leadership opportunities. Explore the options in front of you and talk to other people about what they've done and what they wish they'd done. Learn from them and make the most out of your experience!
Sophomore,5,"I love this college, the people are amazing, i learn so much here. The food is actually pretty good in the dining halls, and the campus is nice and small. I almost always see someone I know on my walk to and from classes every day. The professors really do care about you, and the campus is beautiful."
Niche User,5,I loved wpi it was very nice. i went to the school for mechanical engineering and had an amazing experience.
Niche User,5,Worcester Polytechnic Institute has a beautiful campus and great energy throughout all aspects of the college.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone on campus is welcoming and helpful. WPI became my home away from home. I've met some amazing people from different countries. I've tried different things that I never would of expected. There is so much to do at WPI including events, clubs, and greek life. WPI is a caring and generous community willing to always help out others."
Sophomore,5,WPI gives students a multitude of opportunities.  Students are allowed and encouraged to explore interests outside of their intended major.  There are hundreds of clubs open to all students. There are also amazing opportunities to travel for IQP.
Sophomore,5,"Very good school for those who are technically inclined and/or interested in engineering. I personally enrolled because I want to study computer science. I’ve studied here for one year and my experience has been amazing thus far, and the following years are looking even more promising. Any graduate can tell you that there is an excellent return on investment and that you won’t have any problem finding a job coming out of it. The dining hall is one of the best in the nation and has tons of variety when it comes to food choice. However, it is spotty and sometimes it's good and other times it isn't. The inconsistency is annoying, but most students only deal with it for their first year."
Sophomore,5,"I am an IMGD major, and I love WPI. The professors want you to succeed, and will go out of their way to help you. They all have experience in their fields, and are very knowledgeable, especially in the game design industry. The work is intense, but as you get used to the workflow, you can't help but love it."
Junior,5,"I really like the counseling center here. I wish the tuition wasn't so inflated though, so people could actually afford to go here."
Freshman,5,"I am halfway through my first year and I love it so far. I enjoy the 7-week terms because I am someone who tends to get bored and the quick turnaround helps me stay focused on my classes. I also like that there are three extra classes built into our schedules. They can be used to take more classes you are interested in or they can be used as ""built-in fails"" because if you fail 3 classes you can still be on track to graduate in four years."
Freshman,5,It is a fantastic place to learn and grow. I have enjoyed every moment at WPI. The professors and opportunities are like no other college.
Sophomore,5,"One of the happiest colleges I've seen. great academics but be prepared to buckle down and study or you could easily drown in the swamp of work provided. Don't be fooled about taking only 3 classes at a time, its a LOT of work in a short amount of time. Good for parties but bad campus food/ mediocre housing."
Freshman,5,"WPI is a highly rated technology university. It has up-to-date labs and equipment and some excellent professors who would be willing to help you out.  The institute also has unique grading policies: there are only A, B, C and No Record. The campus is small so it will save you a lot of time walking from place to place.  Students here are very friendly and are happy to help you out every time."
Sophomore,5,I really like the four quarters system of teaching. But Some professors make the course more difficult than they are.
Niche User,5,"The campus is gorgeous and it is a small campus, which is super nice during the Winter and you don't want to walk 20 minutes to get to a class. It is not uncommon to find your dorm mates and peers collaborating on difficult homework or studying in the dorm common rooms or hallways. There is always something to do on campus, whether it is taking part in Greek life or playing a role in Student Government or our Robotics Team. It is nice to walk onto a campus where the atmosphere is kind, welcoming, and although there is a ""nerdy"" stereotype, which is true in a sense, but when you walk onto campus for the first time and you realize that everybody is normal (although you may find some hardcore Trekkies or Larpers here) and that everyone make have their quirk but the important shared qualities are being passionate, curious, and kind."
Sophomore,5,WPI prepared me extremely well for the real-life working world. The projects-based curriculum made me invaluable to employers.
Graduate Student,5,WPI is unlike any other university I considered. The unique curriculum that takes a holistic approach to problem-solving with an engineering and global mindset is second to none.
Sophomore,5,"The program of studies is accommodating for being a polytechnic university. Professors are easily-approachable, as well as incredibly well informed individuals. Each professor wants to see you succeed and it is rare that a teacher is not willing to help a student excel in their courses. The connections available at the school are incredible too, including on-site interviews and career fairs that give students an easy way to apply for jobs with renown companies."
Alum,5,"WPI doesn't have a high national reputation, but this won't prevent it from being a top tier college, especially from an engineering point of view, in this country. I feel that WPI's professors are putting more efforts on teaching real-life applications of skills than theoretical researches. So finding a good job is relatively easy for students studying here."
Senior,5,"I am happy to be part of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).  I am double majoring with a minor.  If you plan your classes well, you can get two majors.  Mine are in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Interactive Media nd Game Development.  My minor is is Spanish.  I love the opportunity to study a session  abroad in Australia, helping a community in Melbourne."
Graduate Student,5,"There is a plethora of opportunities for students here. You can get work in a research lab, an administration position,  or in a club. Every student has to participate in projects, and get good job experience for future jobs."
Niche User,5,WPI has outstanding professors and staff really care about the students in addition to being a top-notch academic and research institution.
Freshman,5,"It's a very good school for those who are looking for a fast-paced and an amazing academic campus. The majors are  designed in a way you get to explore it in any way you want to. You get to go in depth with your major. You are also not forced to take basic classes like English, a Language, History and many others. You can choose to take it. The humanities requirement allows you to explore a different and more relaxing subject of your choosing. Sure, they may require work, but they're fun."
Alum,5,"WPI courses are structured in four terms; they are seven-week long, with a 10-day break between A and B Term, a month of Christmas vacation between B and C, and another 10-day break between C and D Term. While this structure makes courses very intense compared to other colleges, the fact that they last for only 7 weeks is refreshing and improves the students' quick-thinking ability. The courses are heavily based on practical work, research, public speaking, and travelling abroad. The class sizes vary, and while freshmen are often taught in big lecture rooms, they eventually develop stronger interactions with their professors, once their courses become more degree-specific. WPI is expensive, but it tends to be big on scholarships and financial aid, especially towards international students. Most freshmen live in dorms, which makes socializing easy, and then move to off-campus housing. Don't expect much from the Woo nightlife, but there are plenty of student parties throughout the year."
Sophomore,5,"WPI definitely lives up to the name of having top academics and it is clear that learning is a priority. With a project-based curriculum, the school is able to prepare students for the real world. If you're looking for a big football school, go elsewhere. Worcester itself is a little sketchy, but the campus (although open) is still safe and there are plenty of alerts and email updates when applicable."
Freshman,5,"If you are looking to learn through multiple hands-on experiences that apply science and math to real life Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is the place for you. WPI has implemented a very unique approach to education that is very effective at preparing students for life as Engineers in the professional world. Requirements such as the Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP), and the Major Qualifying Project (MQP) are both excellent ways of letting students learn how to solve problems in an environment similar to their future career. Many other schools don’t offer these experiences, and it shows just how much WPI cares about preparing students for a successful life. As a minority it is hard to go by without noticing the obvious diversity problems. However, these problems seem non-existent because of the welcoming nature of the people on campus."
Freshman,5,Its is one of the best Engineering school and projects based curriculum makes it better than any other engineering school. The people on the campus are very helpful and if you need help there is always someone who will help your way out of trouble.  
Sophomore,5,"Everyone at WPI is nice, welcoming and supportive. The academics are great and challenging. Overall a great place."
Junior,5,"I love WPI's project-based curriculum. Hands-on experience is increasingly important in today's day and age. WPI makes an effort to implement project work in many of its courses in addition to the mandatory projects for juniors and seniors. They make sure to emphasize community involvement and impact. Some of the courses have problematic professors, but you will see that at every school. Overall, the atmosphere at the campus is very collaborative and supportive."
Alum,5,"It's a good school and most of the professors are really good. Also there are a lot hands on opportunities, in research labs and completing projects for classes."
College Freshman,5,"I like that the professors are very approachable and friendly and the students as well ,

the swim coaches and swimmers are fantastic and the academics that I going to be learning are in the top of all the best schools in the world"
College Sophomore,5,"The best thing at this school is the professors. They take pride in what the do and look out for the best interests of the students. They genuinely love to help their students succeed.

Classes tend to be hard but there are many tools offered to help students, such as office hours, TAs, tutoring sessions, etc, all of which are great.

Courses required by all students are large but professors are still dedicated to each student in need of assistance. As courses become more field related, class sizes become smaller ranging between 30-50 students"
College Sophomore,5,"The school is an advocate of project-based and group learning which effectively prepares students for working world. This is what puts the school ahead of most others- the requirement of students to work efficiently together, despite their differing views and backgrounds. The project-based learning allows students to better prepared for internships and co-ops.

The school is also a great promoter of Co-ops and internships. The school's career services put a lot of effort into advising students on how to get good internships and also obtaining internships for the students themselves. They set up many career days that have proven very beneficial to students as well as employer companies. There has been much success in getting students jobs for summer as well as after after graduation."
Recent Alumnus,5,"It's been awesome. I was a robotics engineering major and I became very close with the other RBEs. This was mostly because we all lived in the lab, but we all struggled together and we all formed a close community. The older students were also very helpful to the younger students who need help."
Recent Alumnus,5,Engineering is a promising field for job options. I just graduated and most of my friends already have jobs. We have career fairs to help with this. It also helps for internships. I have already had two summers of experience.
Sophomore,4,"I have completed 6 online courses so far, and am currently enrolled in 3 more. Every professor is different with their teaching style, some do a combination of videos and zoom meetings, some just do zoom meetings, and some just post video lectures. I've had 2 professors only post video lectures and I found this teaching style to be very difficult as it felt I couldn't rely on the professor as much and had to do a lot on my own. The video & zoom lectures were good and effective at teaching the material, but it also felt like double the class time, but it allowed the professors for more time to teach the material. My favorite method of teaching is the zoom meetings, because it feels almost like going to the actual class and learning from the professor for the given time period. It feels more natural and personal, where as the videos & zoom meetings feel more like you learn the material from a noninteractive video and any questions are brought up in the zoom meeting."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience at WPI is very good, professors are very helpful and willing to work with the students and try to keep that project based learning.  its for sure different but manageable."
Sophomore,4,"WPI is a great school and has a great environment for its students, it is terms instead of semesters so the learning process goes quick and can be heard for students to pick up. Other then that the campus is lovely, the people are great, and the project based learning is such a helpful  thing to get real hands on experience. The IQP and MQP projects are so unique and really help student get a sense on what its like to be working in their field they desire."
Sophomore,4,"Online experience was good, not excellent, but good. Some of my professors were super excited and some were just dead. SGA is working on to improve our online experience, so it might be better this semester!"
Junior,4,Many professors did a very good job switching to online learning. However I had some negative experiences with professors who seemed to not care about the online learning experience.
Sophomore,4,"WPI is a wonderful school, it is near the top in the nation for a lot of the programs it offers. It's committed to seeing students do well in their studies, including promoting and engaging minority students with their work. 

WPI does have a lot of work to do for engaging and expanding minority representation and treatment. They have only now just started to offer scholarships to international students. They are addressing many of the issues, especially the issues regarding the Black community, but it is something they seem to be making progress on. 

Many of the professors are wonderful and teach very well. Some, especially the math department, fall short in this category which is rough since math is the back bone of the sciences. 

The student life is probably the best part of the experience. There are some wonderful people and clubs on campus that really make the arduous courses and study schedules worth the time."
Sophomore,4,"After attending an overnight program as a high school senior, I knew WPI would be a great choice for me as a student and person."
Freshman,4,"WPI has opened doors to so many new opportunities that I didn't even think of before I arrived on campus. The curriculum is unlike any other school. It is rigorous and rewarding and will leave you feeling satisfied with the work you've put in. There is an atmosphere of community and gratitude, and no one is trying to out-score one another, rather, everyone is collaborating and helping other students every chance they get. Love it at WPI."
Freshman,4,"The seven-week terms are a little challenging, but refreshing. The classes are challenging, but not impossible. Dorm life isn't the greatest."
Sophomore,4,"Overall good school, most professors care about their students and are very approachable, understanding and knowledgable. There are plenty of opportunities on campus to get involved and even though its known as a nerdy school there is someone for everyone."
Senior,4,Very resourceful and opportunistic environment. Many resources available to students to further their goals and classwork. Many opportunities to be involved on campus and for leadership  development.
Niche User,4,"I know a few people that go to WPI and they all seem to enjoy it. I’ve visited the campus a few times. There’s plenty of off campus housing, there’s usually plenty to do around the area,"
Freshman,4,"WPI is a great school. The best part of WPI is easily the people and culture. No matter who you are you will be sure to make friends and find people who have similar interests, but even outside of your friend group people are incredibly nice. The short terms are tough and a little overwhelming but the friends you make and the clubs you join will get you through. Most classes are taught by great professors as well. As a bonus, the campus is gorgeous nd the walk between classes and sports and clubs is actually quite pleasant. My only complaint would be the food but you can still find good eats and there's lots of off-campus options as well."
Sophomore,4,"Worcester Polytech has a small, easy to navigate campus, and professors are always eager to make kids learn the material, not just get good grades. There are many extracurricular activities to take part in, and there is always something to do while here."
Sophomore,4,I love WPI!!! It's a second home to me and everyone there is friendly and welcoming. I love the campus and student life. Academics are stressful at times but lots of ways to de-stress.
Sophomore,4,"It's a good school if you are looking in the fields of science and technology, outside of that, why are you even looking at this school?"
Senior,4,"Very rigorous curriculum, so keep up! Professors vary from understanding, to following everything to the book. A lot of self-teaching, but resources are available. There are tons of resources and opportunities at this school which makes you a desirable candidate for future employers. Take advantage of the different societies that are on campus, and the research opportunities on campus. And scholarships. Because they are there. Also, do not get caught up in the culture of comparison, focus on yourself, goals, and progress (and help others too) and you will succeed. Campus food, tuition, and housing are rising as WPI continue to expand and accepting more students while club funding is decreasing. On campus housing isn't guaranteed so live off campus when possible. College city, easy to get around on foot."
Niche User,4,I am a dual enrolled high school student here and I am taking a full freshman courseload and I love it! The professors really care about their subject and they explain things in a great way. The social life is great too!
Freshman,4,"For my freshman year, WPI has been a very good fit. If you are not interested in engineering, I obviously wouldn't recommend it, but for engineers it is fantastic. There are plenty of opportunities as far as clubs and, and the classes, while a little boring in freshman year, are generally useful, and most of the professors are good. Campus life is for the most part good, it is not located in a bad part of Worcester, so there isn't a ridiculous amount of crime to worry about. The food is not great tbh, but after first year you don't have to be on a meal plan anymore, so it becomes less of an issue, and there are restaurants just off campus you can use. Overall a very good experience, and I am happy with my choice."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love WPI. The people there are great and the teachers are incredibly kind and helpful. The classes aren't too tough, but provide enough of a challenge. They have a wide variety of majors and classes to choose from. If you fail a class it doesn't go on your record, so this helps to encourage students to try things they may not necessarily be good at. There are also a wide variety of clubs to join and they are a great way to meet new people. My one complaint is with the food. It is usually pretty mediocre and they often serve the same things over and over again. There's plenty to do in the surrounding area, but you have to be careful how far from campus you travel because there are some more dangerous parts of Worcester. The dorms are alright, nothing too exciting or different from usual. Most of them don't have air conditioning and are often kinda cramped."
Sophomore,4,"I began my experience at WPI when I was a little girl going to my dad’s work, seeing his lab and wanting to be a scientist there just like him. I now attend school there and work in the psychology lab and study psychological science. WPI is on the smaller side and allows me to navigate, build relationships with my professors and easily recognize people all around campus. The reputation and opportunities the school has to offer are incredible. They really set you up for a career after graduation. One thing I want to see change is the diversity in majors and growing the humanities department. Science and math mixed with cultural studies, english, religion, language and psychology would make an even more well rounded individual and school. Overall I love my experience."
Alum,4,The school is growing rapidly with a brilliant student body. The general student body is also fairly open ad accepting of others. You will be able to learn just as much from your peers as you will from your professors.
Sophomore,4,I love the environment at WPI. I always feel welcomed where ever I go. The professors are really helpful and kind to those who ask for help. I love it here!
Freshman,4,I love the location and atmosphere of WPI. Most students are helpful to each other with school work and very friendly.
Freshman,4,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute has great programs and courses, especially for students majoring in interactive game and media development. I would, however, enjoy more visibility for students of color and LGBTQ+ students."
Sophomore,4,"WPI embodies a small-knit environment in which I feel comfortable approaching and connecting with others. Everyone is very motivated and hard-working yet not very competitive. The university does a good job at providing a unique and exceptional educational experience but I believe it could improve on the resources offered. While a STEM-based school, I believe offering more language and humanity courses would produce more well-rounded graduates."
Sophomore,4,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute is a great school. The academics are excellent and the 7 week terms makes learning more fast-paced. Most professors are excellent and do their best so that students can succeed. Also, there are amazing opportunities to study abroad at various places in the world. The whole school focuses on project-based learning which offers great preparation for our future careers."
Junior,4,I love the intensity and seriousness that the students and faculty have concerning their subjects.  This however also makes a lot of students anti social which is a bad thing when it comes to making friends.
Graduate Student,4,"The school is relatively small but packs a lot of beauty on the campus in terms of history, the buildings, and the foliage. The school has about 400 undergraduates and 2000 graduates and the school is always buzzing. Graduate research is incredible and the global reach that WPI has in regards to projects abroad is astounding and world renown."
Freshman,4,"I love that WPI has multiple resources to study and do my work. The professors, TAs, PLAs, etc are very kind and are very much open to help a student out. They have a passion for teaching as well. Although the pace is very fast, it is something to get used to, but that is why the professors encourage and provide a bunch of resources outside of their class and the text. The college is fairly expensive, but less than some private schools. WPI stands out from the rest because it is a project based school. Your work experience through internships is much more important than your GPA. 
The students at WPi are very friendly and open. It would be very easy to make friends and join clubs to socialize or form study groups."
Sophomore,4,"WPI is an amazing school academically. Campus is small and easy to get around. Facilities are grade A for students and athletes. Some negatives about WPI include, professors who struggle speaking English, poor party scene, and if you are against fraternity and sorties it is not the place for you."
Sophomore,4,"I like that the school is project based, giving me realistic applications of engineering principles. Employers think very highly of WPI graduates. I'm a member of a fraternity and I have made a lot of friends. The teachers are very dedicated. Some don't speak good English and are hard to understand. I wish that the tuition was lower, but if I get a good job after graduation it will be worth it."
Freshman,4,"WPI is a really nice school with a great, friendly community and atmosphere. Students are nice and very willing to help each other. Professors care about students and want you to succeed; they will help you when you ask."
College Freshman,4,They are very community oriented.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Actually on campus is good, but beyond it can get sketchy"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I like the fast paced, 7-week terms. My favorite thing is that it has Robotics Engineering as an actual undergraduate major (this was my major). The hands-on application is awesome for building skills and helps reinforce learning. I would definitely come here if I had to do it again."
College Freshman,4,Drugs and alcohol are only there if you want to be a part of it. It is easy to avoid. There will be alcohol at parties during the weekend. I have never felt pressured into drinking. Campus police understands that this is a part of college so they are only there to make sure everyone is safe.
College Freshman,4,"Definitely look up your professor before you take a class. Most of them are good, but occasionally there will be a professor that isn't so great."
College Freshman,4,Housing is pretty average. You're able to pick your roommates. Sometimes you are in a forced triple but it isn't that bad. Strictness totally depends on your RA. Definitely would recommend finding a roommate on fb or something!
College Freshman,4,I am a varsity athlete and I love the support they provide for athletes. A good amount of people will attend games but it isn't the main focus. There are a lot of athletes on campus so it is fun to see people around who share the same interest as you!
College Student,4,"Wonderful scenery, great people, very engaging faculty, it has so far been a great fit for me."
College Junior,4,Challenging but pushes you to be your best
College Junior,4,the Career Development Center works with you to ensure you have all the options available to you for a successful life after college.
College Junior,4,Great environment with people who care about your well being and your passions in life. I made the right choice for me
College Junior,4,RAs are awesome and the Res. Services staff are always there to help
College Junior,4,Great community and atmosphere that allows you to grow and gain the best college experience.
College Sophomore,4,WPI is located in Worcester Massachusetts which  is one of the largest cities in New England. Most of the danger on campus is not caused by students but rather the surroundings of the campus. It is rare but there are a few reports every year of students being mugged on campus and just outside of it. If you are on the main campus you have nothing to worry about.
College Sophomore,4,"As a freshmen you will be faced with lesser quality dorms with no air conditioning and some of the older dorms are cramped. Generally triples are assigned freshmen year. The upperclassmen housing is significantly better because it includes suite style housing and two fairly new buildings. The cost for housing at WPI averages around $8000 per school year. Most of the buildings have laundry in the basement. The suite style dorms range from 4 to 8 people and they include a kitchen with full size refrigerator, oven, and cabinets. They also include a common room and bathroom."
College Sophomore,4,"WPI has 13 fraternities and 6 sororities. I believe that about 40% of the population is in greek life. There is a fraternity for everybody on campus. No matter your interest, you will be able to find a group that you will fit into. Everybody loves the greek life because they are the main source of parties at WPI and even for the surrounding schools. Most of the greek houses are within a short walking distance of the main campus and the dormitories. Many of the houses are older but are well kept by the brothers of the fraternities."
College Freshman,4,Great internship options with career fairs and co-ops. Degree is highly valued among hiring companies.
College Freshman,4,Very fast pages but is a lot of fun and there is a lot to learn that can be applied to real life.
College Freshman,4,"I am currently a member of one varsity sport that has two seasons, and a club sport that offsets the varsity sport. Despite being a varsity sport, my coach really wants us to succeed in school, because it is just as important."
College Freshman,4,I don't feel that I'm not safe on campus. I think most people at WPI about the big issues on college campuses like alcohol and sexual violence.
College Freshman,4,"For the introduction courses in math and hard sciences, the lectures are pretty big, but the class sizes decrease as you do higher level courses."
College Freshman,4,"Employers love the students from WPI because of the projects they do within their majors, so it won't be too hard to find an internship or job in the future."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy the dorm that I'm currently in. I really got to know the people on my floor. The RA's are really strict the rules though. I sometimes think that they treat us like elementary school students.
College Freshman,4,"It's a small school, the community is really friendly. There is a lot of project there, and it really helps you in the long run."
College Freshman,4,"I think a third of WPI are in Greeks. I have yet to see this part of college yet but look forward to joining one and seeing what comes from it. I wouldn't say Greeks are good or bad, I dont know. But they seem pretty cool and do a lot of cool things in my opinion."
College Junior,4,"Professors want you to succeed, they're very helpful and accommodating."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's a small school so you become very close to people, especially those in your department. Robotics is a fraternity itself! Greatest professors that I have every had the pleasure to encounter. WPI is a project-based school, so the projects are the BEST part of classes."
Sophomore,2,"The WPI faculty was not well prepared for online teaching. Most of the courses I took had multiple technical issues that could have been avoided by the professors testing out their setup beforehand. Also, the online Zoom courses weren't as engaging as in-person classes. Most professors just did lectures as if it were an in-person course. However, I heard from my friend that one professor encouraged student interaction by allowing students to write on his screen. That's a good example of adapting to the new format, and more of the professors should have tried similar things."
Sophomore,2,"WPI released information in small chucks and very last minutes. Some of this is of course understandable given the COVID situations, but it was very frustrating to be apart of. As of right now, they're setting deadlines for new information but have stayed in the dark with minimal direct communication otherwise.

The classes were fine but many professors didn't seem to take in student's new situations. Some international students couldn't access everything, something that seemed to only be addressed when it caused problems. Many teachers seemed to disregard or forget about time zone differences.

There were some resources to adapt to the different style of learning that online classes bring but they didn't often go more in depth than 'find a workspace' and 'keep a routine'.

There were and will not be any tuition reductions for past or future online courses which is the biggest blow given the lack of quality.

The release of information regarding grading was initially confusing as well"
Junior,2,"Much of information/reviews on this site can be misleading, seeing as so many HS seniors rely on sites like this to choose a college I figured I'd try to give some of them the perspective that I wish I had when I was in their shoes.  I want to start off by emphasizing that if money is tight/you are planning on taking out loans to attend WPI, DO NOT GO HERE!  The school is another private institution that forgot what it once was in favor of rapid growth and price hikes.  After 3 years here I can't begin to understand how they justify the price they charge for the education they provide.  Academics are adequate but don't be fooled by the admission packets and marketing material on their website.  State schools that cost 1/4 of the price have comparable curriculum.  There's nothing special about the ""WPI Plan"" and the ""Project based"" curriculum.  The governance of this school is more than willing to let quality of instruction take a backseat as they work on growing their business."
Sophomore,2,"I'm a sophomore who's transferring out of WPI.

I don't regret the time that I spent there, but there are things I wish I'd known before. For one, while some students are great, many are very elitist about being STEM majors. I wasn't majoring in engineering, and often was treated like I wasn't as intelligent because I wasn't pursuing a ""hard science degree"".

In addition, project-based learning is a double-edged sword. A lot of your grade hinges on work that isn't your own. For instance, I was on a team that was rude and didn't do any work for a project that was extremely important for my grade. I was begging my professors for help dealing with this. They told me they would give me no help in dealing with these impossible people, but that MY grade would be docked if the work wasn't evenly spread out. I ended up getting a B on a huge project I spent over seven hours a day on.

TL;DR Expects too much of you, competitive and elitist students. Right for a very specific kind of person."
Sophomore,2,"When I was looking at schools as a senior in HS what was important was getting a job after college. I remember I was so proud to say I was attending WPI, now things are much different. Academics are excellent IF YOU LIKE ENGINEERING. I realized that I didn't want to be an engineer about 5 months in and now I'm very stuck. Also, pick a school that has great academics and a good social scene. It does not have to involve going out, just things to do! WPI lacks that and once you're midway through your sophomore year, you feel like you've met everyone you possibly can."
Junior,2,"I've had a pretty poor experience with the social scene at this school. There are close to no parties or social venues going on - absolutely terrible. Academics are fine, but nothing great. If you're looking to do research as a freshman, it's going to be difficult - another school might better suit your needs."
College Sophomore,2,"Although all rooms are priced the same as it pertains number of occupants, all the rooms are different in spaciousness and so pricing is not fair. Many of the rooms are ridiculously small and uncomfortable. Housemates usually tend to get along though cliques are often formed within. Common rooms and bathrooms are relatively clean. 

It is incredibly hard to get decent housing at the school"
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of opportunities for students, especially international students."
College Freshman,2,The drivers here are absolutely crazy.
College Senior,2,Freshmen housing needs a lot of help
College Freshman,2,on campus transport changed without telling anyone
College Freshman,2,I haven't really eaten off campus much 
College Senior,2,"parking on campus is a nightmare, and there are plenty of side streets to park on off campus, but those fill up quickly. you don't really need a car on campus, but it is nice to have. as a freshman you are not allowed to have your car on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many options for dining. There's only one main dining hall, the other one is only a restaurant-style hall open for dinner. The main dining hall is conveniently located, but has very unhealthy, greasy food. As a vegetarian/vegan it is sometimes hard for me to find options that aren't just salad bar."
College Freshman,2,"Something, not sure what, is weird about the food on campus. I am almost always left with a weird after-taste or feeling slightly sick. However, there are many options available. Students tend to really enjoy the cookies. "
College Freshman,2,This is an engineering school; it is not known for its athletics for a reason. 
College Freshman,2,"Being in New England, it gets cold pretty quickly. Outdoor activities are very limited."
College Freshman,2,"While the wired internet works great, the wifi is very spotty and will drop randomly. "
College Freshman,2,"While there are a fair number of international students, the campus does not feel very diverse. There is a lack of variation in interests. The majority of people are middle-upper class white males. "
College Freshman,2,"Academics move fast due to the quarter system. Professors will often push through, even if students are not keeping up. Grades do not often reflect actual performance - many grades are curved. "
Alum,1,"Wpi as a whole is not that bad. However, if you're there for Imgd it will be the worst mistake of your life. This program is run by children who will make fun of students with disablities and beat you down if you try question them. They let professors teach topics that they know nothing about and prevent you from learning what you want to."
Niche User,1,I originally went here before transferring to RPI after one year. I have to say that I deeply regret going here in the first place. The workload was not at all rigorous and the opportunities were just not there.
Alum,1,"This college is absolutely terrible. I graduated far behind my peers and making $30,000 a year with a very high GPA. I should have gone to a state school for nothing or spent more to go to a better school like RPI or Cornell, since my degree is worth squat."
College Junior,1,Terribly overpriced and the lottery is a disaster.
College Freshman,1,"International students need the most help, and actually they dont get almost any help, so it is really hard for them and their family to take care of all those expenses"
College Freshman,1,"The weather starts getting dreary when November hits. We're in the northeast so lots of rain, snow, and cold."
College Freshman,1,"This is certainly a good school, but it is bad for me. "
College Freshman,1,"The campus police are very helpful. They literally get to you very quickly. They have what is called a SNAP van, where you can call them and they carry you to places at night."
College Senior,1,"Just Walk. I LOVE WPI, but the parking situation is terrible. Students (not freshman) can buy a REALLY expensive parking pass, somewhere in the neighborhood of $350 for a spot that you might even have to take a shuttle to get to. If you are poor or don't think its worth it then you can risk the worcester parking situation. WPI is in a residential area so lots of the streets are reserved for ""resident parking only"" and you can't get (or easily replicate) one of those passes. In the winter, about 1/2 of the streets have a parking ban, and when it snows the remaining streets are closed. You might as well park in canada :)"
College Sophomore,1,"Drug Use and Underaged Drinking Is Not Tolerated – The WPI campus police stroll the small areas of campus watching students and making sure everything is safe, secure, and that students are out of trouble. Even at off-campus parties. Sooner or later, Worcester Police bust them all knowing that there's drinking and drug use involved. If you do get caught, there are consequences within campus and they involve having a letter sent home to your parents. Second time around you receive disciplinary probation, then third time around, there are more severe repercussions."
College Freshman,1,"Cramped Corners – Not many upperclassmen dorm on campus, but the few that are here are nice. However, they are inadequately prepared for freshmen. This year, they have forced quads that two years ago were doubles. The dorms are not nice buildings on the inside either. Outside is pretty, but inside is bleh. If you fill out the forms, try to request Stoddard- they are the only doubles left on campus, and there is no way that they can be turned into triples/quads."
College Senior,1,"Snow Schmow! It snows a lot a lot.  Classes were cancelled once last year (first time in my three years at WPI) and not because they felt it was unsafe for students to attend class but because many faculty members were calling in that they could not leave their driveways.  Usually classes are cancelled individually by professors but this is very rare.  Snow and Ice are rarely cleared off in a way that makes it easy to be a pedestrian.  

Rain is also a problem.  There are a few spots on campus that when it rains form lakes of water which become inpassable without soaking your socks.

Its only nice out for about 2 months in the fall and 1 month at the end of the school year."
College Sophomore,1,"A Lot Easier Than People Say It Is – Two things. 1: I'm a civil engineering major. 2: I gave this section a low grade because I feel like I'm not learning much.

Civil engineering must be one of the easier subjects at this college because I rarely have to do schoolwork. Each week, I do maybe three hours of homework and one hour of studying. With classes taking up an average of three hours a day, there's a ton of free time. The workload is negligible and I honestly don't feel like I'm learning a thing. I doubt I will ever use the Leibniz Integral rule or use the measurements of the gaps inside a FCC atom to solve a problem (outside of college).

The facilities are OK. Classrooms can be crowded to the point where students have to sit on the floor / stand at the beginning of the term, but after the first major test the classrooms become emptier.

The internship opportunities for engineering are really good here because of the high concentration of engineering majors. While you will probably not get an internship freshman or sophomore year, you can expect to get one junior or senior year.

One last thing that I should mention. WPI has things called MQP and IQP projects. They take the place of classes and are used to improve your resume. It's the biggest positive as far as academics are concerned. You have the choice of going abroad for your project, and if you get lucky you can go to the place of your choice. You won't find out what you're doing right away though."
College Sophomore,1,"Really Bad – Currently it is a hassle to get a parking spot on campus. Very few freshman drive, and there aren't a whole lot of parking spaces for everyone else. Thankfully, the need for a car on campus is small because the campus itself is small. On days when potential students arrive, parking spots are closed off for the visitors. The largest parking lots are not exactly convenient. There's one at the bottom of a hill on the edge of the campus by the library, and there's an expensive parking garage behind Institute Hall, even further away from campus."
College Sophomore,1,"If You're Not Lucky, You're in Trouble – Watch out for freshman year. Sure, WPI advertises ""comfortable triples"", but there are just a handful of them in Riley. When entering WPI, the triple that you are most likely going to get is in Morgan Hall. They used to be doubles, but the administration threw in an extra bed into each one and called it a job well done. Needless to say, it's REALLY crowded. You will at least once bang your head on the ceiling when you get up in the morning. It's very likely you'll also hit your head on the bottom of your bedframe when you get up from your desk too, and that hurts a lot. When you find yourself in that position, check to make sure that you aren't being charged for a double. There are other housing options for freshman though, and those tend to be better. Basically the system is a hit or miss- the other students in and around your dorm might be very loud, or they might like computers and keep the door closed. The freshman year dorm experience will test your patience.

Upper class housing is in all ways better. Not only do you get to pick your roommates, but the dorms are a lot nicer. No longer will you have to deal with WPI trying to milk the students for cash as efficiently as possible. Instead, the rooms are larger, more up-to-date, and clean. There's the old luck aspect still involved though. If you can't get a good number in the housing lottery freshman year, you're going to have to find an off-campus apartment. On the bright side, there are a lot of room openings as students decide to leave for elsewhere over the summer and you can still transfer back into on-campus housing.

Warning: if you arrive late, you won't feel welcome."
College Senior,1,Just for Partys – Greek life seems to be all about partying. I find that most Greeks on campus are too cliquey and can be immature and obnoxious.
College Junior,1,"They are going to be buiding a new underground garage, but that wont be underway for another 5-10 years.  Good luck with finding parking on campus.  You are better off finding an apartment off campus then commute if you don't want to live in the dorm life.  Plan on arriving an hour early (if your lucky) to find a spot.  Otherwise, get to campus right before 9 in the morning."
College Junior,1,"A Community of Shut-Ins – This college is populated with nerds, geeks, and near-literal vampires. ""Walking for Fitness"" is actually a class. And because exercise is so unpopular, they had to make it required for graduation. The varsity sports are pretty good, but if you go any lower, you lose a lot of vitality."
College Sophomore,1,Trying to get a ride becomes quite the hassle. The escort service provided by the school is not reliable and the cab drivers are determined to make a short trip as long as possible making students often late to their trains.

Freshman,5,"I would often scoff at the idea of going to college outside of New York. But when I visited Truman, I was amazed. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. It was if the red carpet had been rolled out especially for me."
Senior,5,"Truman is amazing! The campus is well-maintained, and there are always visitors out and about. It is really pretty during the fall because the changing of the leaves make the campus look vibrant. The professors are highly intelligent. They know their textbooks forwards and backwards, and they are truly passionate what they are teaching. You really get a chance to connect with them while on campus. The students are also unique, bright, well-mannered, and easy-going. On-campus parking is a nightmare though."
Senior,5,"Pretty straightforward for the most part. Depending on the class, you can take the tests online from home or you have to travel back to campus to take the tests so they can monitor your screen, but that’s typically with online math classes. It’s easy to get behind in online classes, however, and you just can’t beat the in-person class advantages."
Alum,5,I loved Truman State. I felt challenged and supported. There are so many opporunitities. The academic staff is great and very helpful. Professors were very willing to meet outside of class to help me with things. Thye also often organized optional study sessions during exam weeks.
Junior,5,I loved Truman a lot! I'm really glad I attended this school! It has a beautiful campus and a lot of the student body and staff are very welcoming and kind. I would change the food service they use since the food isn't very good a lot of the times.
Alum,5,Supportive teachers that want the students to succeed. Small class sizes allow you to get to know your classmates and professors. Small campus with easy access to classes and buildings.
Freshman,5,"I have absolutely loved my time at Truman State University so far. The more time I spend at Truman, the more I really appreciate the school and the education I am receiving. The people here are genuinely intelligent people, and the professors truly care about our education. It is almost unbelievable how great of an education you receive for such low tuition. There are so many opportunities to get involved and try new things. You will definitely be challenged and pushed outside of your comfort zone, but you will grow in the process. I am very thankful for my time here and I can't wait to continue it."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful and has really homey energy, and everyone was so kind. The professors I met were very helpful in describing class styles. Also, I got to meet a neat snake."
Alum,5,Excellent small town school.  Top-notch professors who want to see students succeed in their fields.  Fellow classmates also want to succeed and focus on life after college.
Freshman,5,"The community is wonderful. The moment you step on campus, it will feel like home. No matter your major, interests, or experience, there is something here at Truman. There are so many student activities, majors, and just fun events around Kirksville as well."
Niche User,5,The main thing that I like about Truman State is that is very close nit. You will never get lost on campus and it has a homey vibe to it for those who live in a small town. The class sizes are small compared to other colleges.  The ratio between students to teachers is 16 to 1. This allows you to connect with the professors there.  You are not just some name. You matter at Truman State University.
Sophomore,5,"Truman State University is a great college. You earn a quality education at a reasonable price. If you work hard in high school and apply for scholarships, Truman will provide you with the financial support to attend their prestigious college."
Sophomore,5,Truman state is a wonderful university for people interested in obtaining a highly respected degree that does not come easily.  Truman is a school that takes pride in its academics and requires students to put forth effort with their studies in order to maintain good grades.  Definitely not a school for someone looking to take the easy college route.
Senior,5,I love Truman because I have learned more than I ever thought I would. Everyone that works for the university are so nice and helpful which is exactly what I needed!
Junior,5,"Truman is a fantastic school. It feels like home and the professors are knowledgeable and caring. It’s a small campus but with many opportunities. Kirksville is a rural area but the town does have many things to do, mostly in part because of Truman. There is so many events to attend on campus and Greek life is very active. Getting involved on campus makes the experience more enjoyable."
Sophomore,5,"For the price, Truman State is one of the best institutions in the Midwest. This is reflected by the numerous academic lists that it is included on. The academic side of this institution is definitely the bigest upside. The classes are small and the professors, excluding one or two, are genuinely concerned with the wellbeing of the students, and they truy want their students to succeed.
That being said, the city tends to limit the possibility of extracurricular activities. It makes you get more creative with how to spend your time due to how small the town is."
Freshman,5,Truman State University is a great college that will give the best education at a very affordable price. It is not famous for athletics or any famous city close to it but it is the right to place to focus on your studies. Great opportunities to meet people from all over the world. The professors are highly qualified and the ratio of student in each class is very low. After four years in this institution you will have a great knowledge not only in your mayor but also in may other subjects due to the fact that Truman is a liberal arts college. There are many ways to enjoy your time at Truman State University by joining many clubs or even the Greek Life which is really good.
Junior,5,Everything about this university is exactly what I needed for my career! They have a stellar linguistics department with professors that really care about you and your success.
Sophomore,5,"Truman is a great school. It is really designed for people who want to work hard want their money's worth for their degree. It can seem kind of overwhelming, as most students are intelligent and work hard, so you might feel like the dumbest kid in the class. There is a term called ""TTS"" (typical Truman student) which basically is a stereotype of a Truman student -- very dedicated, always kinda stressed, cares A LOT about school, and a bit nerdy. (Most people at Truman are nerdy, so it is honestly something you don't notice after a while). I love the Kirksville community, the academics are demanding, and the people are kind. It's really an amazing school."
Junior,5,I love the people on the campus as well as the campus. You can always see a smiling face when you go out. I also love the academic environment. Everyone pushes each other to be the best they can be and learn as much as they can to increase their ability to provide scholarly work.
Freshman,5,I really love Truman! Class sizes are small and it allows for you to create actual relationships with your professors. The only thing I would change is to be more eco friendly. There are many recycling efforts all over campus but we still use a lot of unnecessary paper.
Freshman,5,"Truman is an Excellent school that is situated in the heartland of Missouri. The professors are helpful, the classes are rigorous and informative, and the atmosphere is very conducive for learning. It is welcoming to every sex, religion, gender, and class. Truman is an excellent decision for anyone wishing to persue an enriching career and future."
Freshman,5,"I love the connection students are able to have with their professors. The academics are stellar and you get to know everyone in a campus this size. Although the local area is lackluster, there are always events on campus to attend."
Sophomore,5,I like the smallness of Truman.  The campus isn’t huge but it isn’t tiny either and nothing is more than a ten minute walk away.  It is easy to get to know more people because we have so many clubs and organisations that we can join.  The community at Truman is very diverse and it is easy to find the people that you really get a long with.  Truman offers a lot of programs and if they do not have the major that you seek they also have and interdisciplinary major that allows a student to create their own.  This is something that I believe Truman does well and more schools should have this option.  Truman is also very affordable and offers a lot of scholarships.  While Truman does a lot of things well they could also improve.  Truman focuses more on improving athletics rather than improving academics.  There has been discussion of cutting some of the smaller academic programs.  The programs they plan on cutting are the programs that make Truman liberal arts.
Junior,5,"Truman State University is a school for individuals who are willing to dedicate themselves to their major and academia. The students are academically motivated and are always able to manage their school with friends and family. It is a University that is small, but can offer so many opportunities for students who are motivated to see what the collegiate experience can offer. Overall, the University provides an ideal situation for those who are not aiming for a large campus or large school. Buildings are no more than 10 minutes away from one another and the chances of bumping into someone you know is very high. Students tend to be interactive when walking to classes and it is just a healthy environment for students who are wanting to get to know others in their major and in the dorms and all over campus. I highly recommend Truman State University and any student can get the most from attending this University!"
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I like the interaction between students and a professors. The campus is a medium size and is very beautiful. The entire atmosphere encourages you to be proactive towards your future goals. On the other hand, I would like to see a change in the sustainability practices on campus. There needs to be a better use of electricity and more efficient building management."
Junior,5,"I really like Truman, especially the small class sizes. They have a great nursing program with a neat opportunity to study abroad in the Philippines."
Sophomore,5,"This school sets students on a path for success with engaging professors and classes. While Kirksville is a small town, the on-campus activities are enough to make up for the lackluster entertainment options."
Freshman,5,I love Truman State University. It is by far the best school I have seen. It is very diverse and accepting.
Sophomore,5,"Truman State is one of the absolute best deals for a college education in the country.  A top-notch liberal arts degree for under $10,000, lots of scholarship opportunities, and class sizes that rarely exceed 30 people.  I couldn't ask for a better place to get a fantastic education."
Niche User,5,"I have yet to attend a class at Truman, from my college visit the buildings are close together and smaller than other campuses. The class sizes are smaller, which means more time to receive help from the teacher. They also help you to find a job in your major after you graduate. I think that it is a great college."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Truman State University has been amazing. When I was a Freshman, everyone was very welcoming. I knew Truman was the right school for me because the campus was beautiful, had a home-like feel to it, was a smaller sized school, and had a well-known nursing program. I also came here for the academic challenge. The academics are challenging, but the professors are very helpful. Every professor wants the best for their students and enjoys getting to know each student. In addition to the academics, I have also become involved in several organizations including a sorority, community service clubs, clubs related to my major, and the Truman State cheer team. Through these I have developed multiple strong friendships.
If you are considering to pursue Truman State University to receive your degree, please think about applying and scheduling a tour."
Sophomore,5,"I love TSU!! Great professors and high quality education! Tons of clubs/activities to join and give back to the community. The dorms are clean and I feel kind of like living in an apartment. Even though college is a stressful time, everyone is supportive. The only thing I would change is the location. Kirksville is not real big, but does have enough stores and restaurants to sustain a college a student."
Alum,5,"I always tell people I never fully grasped all I learned from Truman until I graduated and began working with college age students.  Students at Truman are extremely hardworking, dedicated, and intelligent individuals.  The faculty continually foster learning and growth in their students by relying on critical thinking, application, and research.  Students are encouraged to participate in faculty research and with low faculty-student ratio, students are able to get to know their faculty if research isn't for them.

The faculty and staff at Truman care for the well being of the students and encourage them to thrive.  I know that I would not be the person I am today without the education and life skills I learned and developed while I was there."
Freshman,5,"I am very happy with the school. The dorms are great, the food is pretty good, and the area is good, there are several parks and lakes in the area. Also there are a lot of clubs and opportunities. The campus is relatively small and easy to get around on."
Alum,5,I had a great time at Truman. The campus is great because it is really easy to get involved in organizations and the organizations themselves are very involved with campus. My classes prepped me well for my PhD program and I was able to graduate debt free!
Sophomore,5,"Truman has a community of driven students, concerned staff members, and a myriad of organizations that all work to develop and challenge each other to become our bests. This is a rigorous university that encourages every interest of each student and provides an environment to grow, learn, and serve. Best decision I ever made."
Freshman,5,"Great campus, friendly people, professors eager to help. Dorms are fun and food is pretty good, lots of options. Tons of activities to get involved in, something for everyone."
College Senior,5,The professors are (for the most part) amazing!
College Sophomore,5,"i lived in ryle, best hall on campus hands down."
College Sophomore,5,"As a member of a panhel sorority on campus, although I'm sure I would have still had a great social life without going greek, I couldn't be more happier that I am part of Truman's Greek system. Unlike bigger schools like mizzou, greeks here are not snobby or think they're better than anyone and they truly do a lot to help out the community and the school."
College Sophomore,5,"Truman is a highly respected school, especially around the state.  There are opportunities on campus, including career fairs, for students to network and look for careers after graduation."
College Sophomore,5,I've loved my time at Truman State. The campus feels very safe and the school is small enough that it feels like a community.
College Sophomore,5,Truman is a very safe school and walking alone at night is almost never a cause of alarm.
College Sophomore,5,"The classes here are a very good size, seeing as the largest class I've taken in two years had about 50 people in it. Most classes have around 20. The professors are experts, and have a ton of knowledge they want to give to students. They are generally very nice, approachable and willing to help students succeed. The quality of education here is very high."
College Sophomore,5,"Truman is a fantastic school with a great reputation, quality campus and engaging community. There is a lot of talk, mostly from people that come from very large cities, about how terrible Truman is. But the problem really lies with the students themselves. At Truman, you have to make your own fun, go out of your comfort zone and things do not come to you as they would at a large school/town. The town of Kirksville has a population of about 20,000, with around 6,000 from Truman and a couple thousand from ATSU, the Osteopathic college in town. The town has everything you could need, but not everything you would want. There is a basic selection of fast food, diners and bars. We have a bowling alley/skating rink, a movie theater and a lot of nature to explore. Located just outside of town is Thousand Hills State Park, a massive park that surrounds a small lake. Being just a few miles away, Truman students, ATSU and people from the town seek refuge in this park. You can rent kayaks, canoes, and other boats there. Thousand hills has many hiking trails and a beach that is open in the summer. The main hiking trial is about 12 miles long and is absolutely beautiful. Other than that, all of the action and events are on campus. There are constantly performances of any kind: theatre, choir, orchestra and comedy groups just to name a few. Truman also has their own media conglomerate named TMN, featuring a radio station that broadcasts to the surround area, a television station, magazine and weekly newspaper. The dorms are overall pretty nice and there is a strong feeling of community in them, with three of them featuring dining halls. By far the worst part of Truman is the food, the dining halls are tolerable at best. But there are a couple gas station like stores around campus that students can use their meal plans at. Truman is located only a few blocks away from the square, and everything is in walking distance. 

Overall, I love it here at Truman and would recommend it"
College Sophomore,5,"Just saying ""I went to Truman State"" can get you an interview, and it's well earned.  Truman makes sure that we are well prepared for the work force and have a broad education to prepare us for anything that might come our way."
College Sophomore,5,"I just joined ASG and it's amazing!  We don't haze or do initiation nights.  Most of the Greek life at Truman is the same way and super awesome.  We have honors frats (mixed gender), service sororities and frats, as well as social ones.  Everyone is pretty polite and we all have great risk management plans in place.  I feel really safe in Greek life, so I encourage people to join."
College Junior,5,"Whenever we get a sexual assault email from the campus safety department, there is always information how to go about reporting sexual assault. In my three years at Truman I have only received a handful of sexual assault emails. Two were last week and one resulted in an arrest of the offender. All around campus we have these big red emergency stations that have a button and will alarm the police to your spot, and I am pretty sure they make loud noises too. I feel safe walking on campus because I know I can run to one of those stations."
College Junior,5,"I have already as an undergrad been able to substitute teach and I know friends who graduated and got jobs within the next year to start teaching. There is job opportunities always available on this campus, with the career fair, alumni networking, and the networking that classes set up for you. My education classes have in observing in La Plata and I have made great network connections out there from the secretary, the SPED teacher, the principal, and teachers throughout the building. Truman offers many opportunities for their students and want them to succeed."
College Junior,5,"Truman has great degree programs, a great reputation, the faculty are always willing to work with their students, and it's easy to get involved. As being part of the swim team I have made a friendships that will last a life time. Everyone cares about each other and work to be the best we can be inside the pool and out. I would choose Truman all over again because I know this is where I belong."
College Student,5,"You have to work for it, but Truman is recognized as the Harvard of the Midwest for a reason. Employers and graduate schools recognize the prestige of a Truman degree, and job offers follow suit."
College Student,5,"I've never heard of drug problems or alcohol busts on campus, or any problems stemming from the use of drugs or alcohol on campus. All such activities usually occur and stay off campus, but even then are very minor and infrequent, and more prevalent amongst the town's residents than among students."
College Freshman,5,The nursing program thus far and what I hear is great. I love the campus. I also love that I am being pushed to take classes outside of my field and comfort zone. I love being on the Ultimate Frisbee Team.
College Junior,5,Graduates from this University all get jobs. The career center is very effective and it is a great resource to learn about careers and to get mentoring on the professional world.
College Junior,5,Generally a very safe campus at any time of day.
College Student,5,Police boxes and street lights abound! This is the only place I've ever felt safe walking alone at night.
College Student,5,"Not a degree factory. An elite universty, and recognized as that by employers and grad schools."
College Student,5,"I've only been here for a year, but already I can discover the strength of the programs, the intuitions of the professors, and the bond of the community. A++ for this school!"
College Junior,5,"The campus is extremely safe and secure. I would advise against walking around alone at night, but I do it all the time and have never been scared for my safety. However, there have been incidents of sexual assault on campus, and these issues need to be addressed in a better manner by campus police."
Freshman,4,"Classes are good online, usually self-paced. After I learned how to use Blackboard, it became more manageable. The only problem I have is the math program online. The system is set up nicely, but the way they want you to put in problems is confusing. I love that is self-paced but I wish there was more flexibility with answering questions. Usually, when I get things wrong, it is because it is in a different format but still suits the question."
Freshman,4,"I love Truman so much and how its color is purple. The academics here do keep you pretty busy, but you learn a lot. Yes, it is a small town but there are some lovely mom and pop shops around. The campus is gorgeous and green, and there is so much to get involved with. The dorms are super nice, I recommend b&b or cenn hall, if not west campus suites. I also love the student union building because of food favorites like Chick-fil-a and Einstein's. Plus, there is a beautiful fountain in front of it that sometimes has purple lights on it. Everyone here is super nice!"
Niche User,4,"Definitely a high quality, low cost university. The rural setting can be a deterrent for some, but it keeps the students focused."
Sophomore,4,"Truman State University has a really beautiful campus, and the student population being relatively small is a benefit (in my opinion). The professors are able to take the time to get to know many of their students and they care about your experience. Truman has a great value and great location within walking distance of the town square. I don't know that I would change much of anything that could truly be changed since money won't be falling from the sky any time soon. It would be great to have AC in Centennial Hall and rennovate the Kirk Gym. I can't really complain. Good school. Just a small town."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished two summer courses online and the professor for one was very communicative and we actively used a discussion board. The other course's professor was less communicative but clearly laid out the work we were supposed to do. Both made sure to utilize our textbook and integrate it with the online learning side of the courses. I have taken other courses partially online because of COVID (who hasn't?) and the professors did an excellent job of transferring to remote learning. Some classses had scheduled zoom meetings where we held class discussions, others just had discussion boards, all of the professors were actively updating us, and my biology professor even made sure we could still have virtual labs."
Sophomore,4,"Truman has an extremely serene environment that grants an continuous atmosphere of peace and tranquility. Based on being a smaller university, the learning experience is enhanced based on familiarity with peers around campus and relatively smaller classes compared to other institutions. Truman pairs extremely competent lecturers with an environment that eliminates distractions to ensure success."
Sophomore,4,Based on the COVID -19 pandemic all of my courses taken were transferred to online platforms through the use of applications such as Blackboard and zoom where a smooth transition was made to maintain the academic standard. The initial Schedule for the semester was adhered to and the semester ended on time.
Alum,4,Professors for online classes were very encouraging throughout the courses. The professors know how to use online resources in order to further your education.
Alum,4,Truman State University is very welcoming with very smart and fun individuals. I enjoyed the activities on campus.
Freshman,4,I have yet to take classes at Truman State University because I will start college in the fall of this year.
Senior,4,"The online experience isn't bad. My classes are more focused on writing/ reading so there wasn't much we needed to discuss. My professors tried their best with zoom. They hosted office hours and one class even had set class hours (the same class but at different times for the people who work).  If classes were to switch online, I feel as if the professors know exactly what to do, they adapted to zoom fairly quickly."
Sophomore,4,"Truman State University is probably the best public college in Missouri. You will receive a quality education for a cost much better than any private colleges. Also, may professors have good connections with employers, so Truman State students usually can find a quality job right out of college."
Alum,4,"It was intellectually challenging. I had the opportunity to explore and grow my academic interests. My professors continually challenged me to continue investigating the topics I was interested in and develop my investigations. I was simultaneously given guidance and the freedom to explore my interests. It was difficult, yet rewarding."
Junior,4,"Professors are often of the highest caliber and the school itself is extremely affordable. The only thing holding the university back is the town; there's very little to do in Kirksville, MO, and the snowy winter weather can be a drag sometimes."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Truman State University! It was a challenging time, as my major was very demanding, but it was also very rewarding. I feel as though the liberal arts education and broad spectrum of classes required better prepared me for the real world and to become a more well-rounded and inclusive nurse."
Freshman,4,"Truman is a great school. There are so many opportunities to do what you want, from helping you succeed in your classes to finding your major to any of the hundreds of clubs and organizations where you can your path. Truman has great facilities and professors to help you with whatever you need. This is a great and safe campus that will help you find what you need in your college career."
Junior,4,"I love Truman. It is 6 hours away from home for me, but well worth the trek. They are reasonably affordable, have great programs, and the small campus makes it easy to get to know people. My class sizes are relatively small and my professors know my name before we even start classes. The academics at Truman are challenging, but that is what makes Truman's reputation incredible."
Alum,4,"Truman is a great school especially for the price. It is not a university that should be written off. The academic programs are hard, but they are great at preparing you for further education. The food is crap and the location is not the best, but overall it's an amazing university."
Sophomore,4,"While the teachers and learning environment are outstanding, and the campus is beautiful, the size and bleakness of the surrounding town hinders many students' resolve during the difficult, colder portions of the school year."
Sophomore,4,While I've had some issues at Truman I really do like this school. I've made some amazing friends here and even gotten myself involved in the school and the community. I recommend looking into all the clubs and activities offered by the school and going to all the free events. There are so many memories to be made while you learn and Truman does a great job in keeping its students involved. The only big issue I've had with the school would be some of the professors. I've had great professors that make learning a wonderful experience and I've had others who make me want to drop out of the school completely. While many of the classes are very challenging they are also fulfilling.
Sophomore,4,"Truman is a very welcoming place. The faculty is positive and helpful. They truly care about their students. Students always try their hardest and are a wonderful product of the learning environment. They enjoy going to school here. The mental health problem is a big one though, and though it's being well-managed, there are many things to improve."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful. The professors are amazing. The only flaw is the town of Kirksville itself, however the university has enough to offer that you have little reason to leave. I personally have enjoyed my time here and would recommend it to anyone who isn't here for sports."
Alum,4,"Truman is a complex and demanding school. It is overrun by passionate students with diverse issues. While I would go back, I would next time better prepare myself for the abrasive attitude on campus, as well as the mounds of work. The cheap price and average acceptance rates are appealing, and can be worth it if you know how to pace yourself and keep your spirits up."
Freshman,4,"Truman is incredible. It's so welcoming and the campus is beautiful. The education here is top notch at an affordable price. The dining hall food isn't the best, but the food options at the Student Union Building make up for it."
Sophomore,4,I greatly enjoy being enrolled at Truman State. It has provided me with an experience that has challenged me in the way I have longed for during high school. I greatly enjoy my classes which are full of useful information that I will need in order to succeed in my desire profession of being a doctor. I have met some of my most dear friends at Truman State and I continue to make more friends every day that I am at this college.
Sophomore,4,"A wonderful school that has an amazing return on investment. Campus is gorgeous and the professors genuinely care about their students. Classrooms are small and most of the dorms are really nice. The only downfall is Kirksville itself. In many places, the town is run down and there isn't much to do. However, Kirksville isn't a big enough of a repellant to miss out on the amazing oppertunities Truman has to offer."
Freshman,4,"It's in a really small town, so you have to be prepared for that. There is a ton of diversity on campus, and it felt very welcoming from the moment I stepped foot on campus. This school also bends over backwards to try and get you to attend their school. I like the fact that they offer automatic scholarships that you don't even have to apply for!"
Junior,4,I enjoy attending Truman because it is an affordable school and it’s easy to make friends. Professors are engaged and the standards are high.
Sophomore,4,"I am going into my sophomore year at Truman State University and I am honestly pretty happy with it overall.

Some pros include: dedicated professors, a variety of campus organizations and clubs, many scholarships and on-campus job opportunities, and a very affordable cost.  

Some cons include: a fairly small and boring surrounding college town, a big workload, and the issue of mental health at Truman.  

I found myself bored at Truman at times, since there isn't much to do outside of campus and I made the mistake of not joining any clubs.  Professors are usually nice and helpful but they still expect you to study hard and turn in assignments on time; grades are earned not given.  Even though Truman isn't really a party school there are still options to go to parties if that's what students want to do.  There are lots of options for getting involved and I recommend checking out campus organizations or greek life."
Senior,4,"Truman State University is lovingly referred to by students as ""nerd school."" The Truman experience is not what one might get at a bigger party school, though there are still plenty of parties and shenanigans. The students here have a talent for finding a balance. Classes are typically rigorous, but students don't have to sacrifice their college experience to thrive. There are many opportunities for on-campus or community jobs. I am a part of the school's music department, which is very tight-knit; I have too many professors that I might ask for letters of recommendation for graduate school - I'll have to pick!"
Sophomore,4,As a sophomore at Truman State there seems to be a good handle on pushing students to perform their best academically and I am excited to see where this college journey takes me.
Freshman,4,"I came to Truman very confused. Honestly, I did not even think I was going to end up there. Now that I have been there for a year I am really glad I went there! Getting over the food quality and the bad dorms was the hardest part. Once I got used to the atmosphere, I realized it was a very good school. The academics are amazing and the professors are some of the most helpful I have ever had in my life. Over the course of this year I have made some of the best friends in my life. Everyone at Truman has similar goals - we all came there because it is cheap, sure, but mostly we came for the good education. It is a much higher education for the small price that we pay. Truman is a good choice for anyone who wants a good education but cannot afford the outrageous prices of most universities."
Junior,4,"The culture is pretty decent, and its very diverse. The professors are good overall, with a few bad apples occasionally. But its fun, and I've made a lot of friends here, and I've learned a lot for not too expensive a price."
Freshman,4,"I have been going to Truman for about a semester and a half and my experience has been very positive overall. If you are looking for a school that is more focused on academic achievement and challenge, this is the school for you. If you are more of party student, there really isn't that much of it outside of fraternities. While the cost of admission may appear high, there are plenty of scholarships available for students to help lower the cost. Overall Truman is a great school with plenty to offer you if you want to challenge yourself."
Senior,4,The resources available are amazing and have opened so many doors. The professors and staff are here for students and have helped me through my toughest times. I love this community.
Junior,4,"I like TSU, because even though it's in a small town, there are a lot of interesting people and professors. I do think that the mental health program needs work, though."
Junior,4,"It's an alright public college. You should know what you are getting into. It is situated in a university town and the town itself has very low diversity in almost every aspect from the population to facilities and food. However, the small school makes up for that with a tight-knit community."
Sophomore,4,"Though it's a small town and small campus, truman makes up for it with its attention to it's students. Since it is so small it means it has that much more resources and energy to really focus on its undergrads and give them the attention and opportunities they need to help them suceed. The time and energy they invest in their undergrads helps sets their students apart when applying for jobs."
Niche User,4,I went on a campus visit in which I  learned a lot and enjoyed the scenery of the campus. I originally heard a lot of interesting things from a family member who attends Truman and now I am wanting to go there as well.
Sophomore,4,"I love Truman with it's relaxed environment and people. However, so wish the professors were more clear in their instructions. Chem department needs major changes."
Sophomore,4,"Truman State is one of the best public colleges in the mid-west. It has an incredible value, making tuition affordable while offering an amazing liberal arts education. It is located in the small college town of Kirksville, making it a ""hidden gem"" in the college world. Class sizes are usually around 20-30 people, allowing you to have a personal relationship with your professors. My experience at Truman has been wonderful: I have had rigorous classes that have challenged me, professors that have inspired me, and the comfort of knowing that my education here will serve me well in my future career field."
Alum,4,"Kirksville is a small town and it's not near any big cities, so it takes some getting used to, if you are used to larger cities.  It's easy to get around.  The University is competitive but class sizes are small.  There is a lot of help available for tutoring.  There are plenty of extracurricular activities to choose from."
Junior,4,"This school is very challenging and mentally stimulating. I have enjoyed the community here in Kirksville, not just on campus but off as well. The community feel and the financial ease are the reasons I chose Truman, as well as a somewhat diverse choice of majors. I have changed my major three times, and still plan on graduating in four years. I brought a lot of college AP credit into Truman, which has helped ""normalize"" the length of my academics here, although I changed my field of study a lot."

Choosing Truman University is the best decision I have ever made were my education and future vision is concerned. The school is highly equipped with adequate and efficient tools and resources necessary for growth, learning and student success. The professors are interested in education and helping students achieve their goals, even when they are struggling. I would definitely pursue my student with this university as they have majors/programs that I am passionately interested in. The university also takes very god care of international students, offering on-going support and making students settle and be comfortable as much as possible!"
Freshman,4,I love being a student here at Truman State. The people here are extremely accommodating and accepting of all kinds of people. The school offers amazing programs to make sure students are getting the best education possible to prepare them for careers. The only thing I wish Truman was better at is working with low-income students to pay for their school. Truman is academically challenging but worth every second!
Junior,4,"Truman State University is a lovely college. There are many opportunities for success on campus and has a very high return on investment. The diversity on campus is very minimal, and could be improved not only by implementing programs to encourage  the sharing of culture but also the mingling of those who have a different background than themselves. The campus is very beautiful but can still be updated, the city of Kirksville leaves a lot to be desired but there are still several things to do. Every single one of the professors I have encountered have left a positive mark on my education and I will forever be indebted. Overall Truman State University is an amazing place to get an education."
Freshman,4,"Incredible academics and a great campus atmosphere, but leaving campus and trying to find fun in Kirksville is near impossible. The value of the academics for a low price make it worth it."
Freshman,4,"I recently finished my first semester at Truman. Personally, I feel that the school is a great fit for me. The school size is small enough so that I feel like I can actually make a contribution and have the opportunity to participate in activities that would be more difficult at a larger school. Additionally, I have had no problem making friends here. The classes are difficult, but still manageable. Overall, I would say the only downside about the school for me is that it is three hours from Kansas City which makes for a long drive if I want to go to the city. Additionally, the food is not the most amazing food ever, but it is reasonable."
Freshman,4,As a student of Truman State i'd love to change the atmosphere and have  the campus adopt a stronger sense of community .Other than that it is a great school with amazing professors who are willing to help if you reach out.
Senior,4,"Truman really is a school for academics. I feel as if I have worked harder than ever before. However, the social scene at truman is lacking."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy Missouri Hall and so far so good.
College Freshman,4,"I am enjoying my time on campus, there has been plenty to do every weekend; even Labor Day weekend when there was barely anyone here! I would choose Truman again, mostly because it has what I need, not always what I want. And that can be a good thing! Budgeting is very easy to do when there is barely anywhere to spend your excess money!"
College Sophomore,4,"I like to live on campus at Truman. Dorms are clean and people who live there are friendly. If you live on campus, it is also easy to go to places around campus such as Convenience store, etc."
College Senior,4,"Truman has doubled the number of international students, and the LGBQT community has a safe network."
College Sophomore,4,The school is ehh but I've met some of the most amazing people at Truman which makes my experience here worthwhile.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the size of classes.  My largest class has been about 60 students, and that was for a gen ed requirement.  Most classes are around 20-30 students, sometimes smaller depending on your major.  Most of my professors have been great and want students to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus.  Campus police are usually on patrol, especially at night.  There's the occasional bike theft, but crime usually isn't common on campus."
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is pretty good overall.  The quality depends on where you live.  It's often more expensive to live on campus than off campus.
College Sophomore,4,"A large part of the student population never drank before coming here, and it is noticeable. There is also not a big drug scene, and it is decently hard to acquire anything other than marijuana."
College Sophomore,4,"The school has a very good reputation and a lot of connections, they will try their best to get you connected and sent in the right path with the right people."
Sophomore,2,"My experience with Truman State so far has not been a great one. The college is known for it's bright minds but needs to improve on facilitating those bright students which it houses. The mental health of many students has become sub-par and it seems as though campus is a breeding ground for depression, anxiety, and other mental illness. As far as education versus Cost, Truman is very cost efficient for the level of education received."
College Sophomore,2,no one really cares for sports but people who are involved in intramural love it and have a great time.
College Sophomore,2,"Truman is not known for it's athletics and it is very noticeable. We are a D2 school, but it might as well be community college intramurals. There is very little school spirit and fan support, though students seem to be proud to ""be a bulldog"". The girls sports are generally much better than guys, but that doesn't mean the turnout is good. 

Overall, athletics are almost a nonexistent part of Truman."
College Freshman,2,Greek life does not have an overwhelming presence at Truman State University.
College Sophomore,2,Some of the professors here really do care about your success but some couldn't care less no matter how many office hours you go to. It's very hit or miss
College Sophomore,2,"No one cares about attending any of the sporting events, there is no school spirit and only pathetic attempts are made"
College Sophomore,2,Truman is  a place for people who only want to study and not focus on being social/having fun
College Junior,2,"It has been three years since I lived in Missouri Hall, but the level of rule enforcement was ridiculously strict. It often felt as if the student advisors were looking for people coming home late on the weekends to call the police to give them an MIP. The housing process is very simple and you're likely to get one of your top choices. All of the freshman floors really promote a sense of community and there was a good social atmosphere. The rooms are fairly small, but it's easy to accustom to. Overall, the actual building quality is pretty good."
College Junior,2,"There is little school spirit at Truman. The football games get some attendance, but the other sports get almost no recognition. I've rarely stayed for an entire football game, even on Homecoming."
College Sophomore,2,"I had a lot of school spirit in high school when it came to athletics, but I don't have that here. I'm not interested in the success of our sports necessarily. When I hear we win I'm happy but it's not extremely relevant to me."
College Junior,2,"Greek life causes a lot of bad drama, including STD scandals, sexual assault cases, MIPs, and other negative press. The students who want to party join Greek life."
College Freshman,2,"If I could go back to high school, I would definitely look into more schools. Truman looks great on paper, but it is definitely not the place for me. I've been miserable since I got here and I'm transferring after I finish my first semester."
College Sophomore,2,The choices are few and pricy.
College Junior,2,"Food on campus, especially in the dinning halls, is not healthy. There is a salad bar and that is the extent of anything healthy or even colorful for that matter. All the food is white, gray, or brown. The SUB does have healthy options, and sometimes the convenience stores do as well, but they cost a lot of dinning dollars and meals which is not really encouraging for students who want to eat healthy."
Recent Alumnus,2,Sodexo does not offer enough fresh fruits and veggies and their menus are boring.
College Sophomore,2,I don't really care for greek life. The stories i hear and the things i actually see are terrifying.
College Junior,2,"Number one issue: Dry Campus. I think if Truman were a wet campus, we would not have as many issues in regards to parties, MIPs, and students safety, including sexual assault/rape. Truman needs a better attitude in regards to student social life, especially Greek life."
College Sophomore,2,Strictest on dorm drinking. some SA's are out to get you.
College Sophomore,2,"There's fast food: Taco Bell, McDonalds, Sonic, Dairy Queen, and different pizza companies.

Then there's a few decent Cinese restaurants. A few decent mexican places. And a couple other decent places. And that's it."
College Sophomore,2,"They give you money as an incentive to attend the school, but then you find out about the 60 hours of scholarship jobs you have to work in order to keep that scholarship. And you also have to keep your institutional GPA above 3.0."
College Sophomore,2,"The snow here really imposes on traveling, and it get so cold that no one wants to leave their houses."
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, the dining halls get pretty tiring pretty quickly. There is not a great deal of variety, so it is not uncommon to find yourself having the exact same meal three days in a row. They do have a monthly premium night, though, and that is always really popular."
College Senior,2,"Most restaurants are very cheap, but the food is generally terrible. I don't fuss much because I'm a college student and that's about what I expect, but my parents hate eating out in Kirksville when they visit. There are a disproportionate amount of pizza and chinese places, and if you're trying to go on a date, you've got about 2 options. They are convenient, because almost everything is within walking distance."
College Freshman,2,"Sodexo doesn't seem so bad at the beginning of each, but after eating it for a few weeks you realize that everything is incredibly bland. The SUB food is at about 1.5x the normal price."
College Senior,2,The school is pretty safe.  People tend to be very friendly.  Not many attractions at all.  Plenty of clubs/organizations to join and take active/leadership roles.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a limited variety of restaurants because of the size of Kirksville, where Truman is located.  The best restaurants are Coltons and Ruby Tuesdays.  Pancake City is cheap, but very sketchy to eat there.  There are no chicken joints since KFC closed down.  So you'd be better off learning to cook around here."
College Student,2,"Kirksville is small but you have to have a car to go around (to Walmart, HyVee, etc). If you are an international students, Walmart trip is provided every Sat for free.
If you intend to go out of town, Amtrack and CapeE (plane) are good choices with not really high price"
College Sophomore,2,"I know a lot of people involved with Greek life. They are sometimes very clique-y though, and often exclude those not involved."
College Freshman,2,"I am from out of state and have no car so I have a hard time getting around.  Although Kirksville is small, the only place that most people venture off to is Walmart.  I have yet to go.  Many students have cars so you just need to find someone that is going there at a time convenient to your schedule.  The downtown of Kirksville has many popular eating places and is within walking distance.  The buildings on campus are all fairly compact.  The farthest building for most students is Barnett and that is a 10 minute walk.  There is no shuttle bus on campus here.  You bike or walk pretty much everywhere."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not that many parking areas that are permitted for students. Professors have easy access parking and it is pretty much off limits for the majority of the day. The parking spaces for students are awfully small and very hard to fit in decently for the bigger vehicles. Once one vehicle is crooked and out of line then the whole parking line is messed up. The lot fills up fast! Sometimes you have to park in the lot that is out of the way of everything. However, all the parking lots are pretty close to campus so it is not too terrible. Ticketing is another story. You get the most absolute ridiculous reasons for police to ticket you. Anything from parking an inch outside of the line to not having a parking sticker on the proper area on the window"
College Junior,2,"No Spots – The parking lots for the dorms are always full during the week, which makes it very tough for other people with parking permits to get spots.  Also, as it starts to get colder, the spots on the streets near campus fill up too."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid is hard to get for anyone who is middle class. I personally wish that our eligibility had absolutely no connection to our parents and somehow was solely dependent off of ourselves. Transferring into Truman my GPA was about a 3.0, and I recieved no help. Though that is a low GPA even with a 3.2 that I had my first semester they were not willing to give me anything. Paying for college myself is really difficult especially now that my degree requires me to go to graduate school and it all collects interest so my debt will be through the roof by the time of graduation. I am a hard worker and I felt as though the scholarship or financial aid programs here at Truman should recognize that however there are about sixty five hundred students attending here and they cant afford to give everyone assistance which I understand. Life if just made a bit difficult when you are doing it on your own."
College Senior,2,"Student campus life is ver poor at best.  Many students go home on the weekends and almost all school sponsored activities and events are very poorly attended.  The student body doesn't seem to be united in any way.  Facilities are not bad, but could be better.  Excellent library although it is sometimes crowded and loud."
College Freshman,2,i have yet to see any sort of transportation around campus except for the athletes
College Freshman,2,Not Entirely Sure – I'm not aware of any bus systems in Kirksville. Your best bet is to bring your car.
College Senior,2,"Not the Funnest Place to Be – Truman itself puts on loads of events throughout the semester that are fun and interesting and often educational. Kirksville, however, provides little to no entertainment with one movie theater and only one fair all year that I attend. They do have a great all you can drink night on Thursday nights, though. Besides what I mentioned and a few measly restaurants, Kirksville is downright dull."
College Sophomore,2,"Prepare for It! Bring rainboots and umbrellas.
Bring snowboots and gloves.
Once it starts snowing it generally doesn't stop until about April. So be ready for that.

But when its nice, its GORGEOUS."
College Freshman,2,"Too Cold – Here in Kirksville, Missouri, it snows way to much. Some of my classes are far away and it's a pain to walk."
College Senior,2,"It's a Small Town. There is not much to do unless you can to the bars. If you want to go out, join a frat."
College Sophomore,2,"True Nerds at Truman – When you go to Truman, you should know that you're signing up to go to a nerd's school. Saturday mornings have foam-sword fights, wednesdays have nerf gun wars, and there is a large scale game (300+ people) of zombies once a semester. There are always exceptions, but the Truman attraction level is in essence what it means to be average."
Freshman,1,"If I could give zero stars I would. Hard classes does not mean learning. No time outside of classwork to do anything. Admin does not care about anybody, I have been screwed over so many times by multiple different departments. I was super excited to come to this school but I'm transferring. Unreasonable credit requirement, nothing to do, you don't actually learn anything and you don't have time to actually study your major/minor because you spend over 2 years doing random classes that are required to graduate- 63 credits. Statistics, precalc, chemistry, multiple English classes, music, physics... and they aren't easy classes they are HARD and even the ""intro"" classes are extremely advanced. Unless you're looking to be completely miserable and learn nothing in college while doing nothing but working I would suggest looking somewhere else. The price is good, but I'd rather spend the extra 3,000 dollars and go to a school that doesn't make me feel worthless and cry myself to sleep."
College Sophomore,1,"There is NOTHING in Kirksville to eat. Everything is fast food, unhealthy, or gross. There are only two nice places to eat/ go on a date. Plus, no late night places."
College Sophomore,1,"I hate cold weather. I think it's distracting and annoying. Here at Truman, you have about 3 weeks of ""nice weather"" from the start of the year up until mid September. Then it starts getting colder, cloudier, and overall just worse all the way until April. Then you have about a month of nice weather until the end of second semester. So you have about 1-2 months of nice weather and like 8 months of shitty weather, which is why it sucks."
College Sophomore,1,you can stay on campus fine without a car. you just require a car if you want to go to a store or go do other stuff off campus.
College Junior,1,Snowy as f*** and cold in the winter but nice in the fall and spring
College Freshman,1,"I hate Sodexo! Everything about the food company is terrible. I once found a hair in my ice cream, please... HOW?"
College Sophomore,1,I'm not satisfied with the amount of financial aid I'm getting each year. The out-of-state tuition fees is a lot and compared to that the financial aid is not enough. The process of financial aid is easy itself but the amount is small.
College Sophomore,1,"Kirksville is a small town, the main attraction is the university itself. If you are looking for a cool underground scene, lots of different places to hang and eat out with friends, or places to shop and spend your money, Kirksville is not the place. However, many students end up loving the Kirksville community because it is rural and quiet, perfect for avoiding distractions and focusing on your studies. Most students and community members are very nice, and students generally develop very close relationships with each other while in Kirksville. Main attractions: Campus, Rec center, 1000 Hills State Park, Wal-Mart, a few local restaurants, and Colombia (which is 1.5 hours away)."
College Freshman,1,There is NOT enough parking for the number of students with registered vehicles.
College Freshman,1,"It is very cold. It is always windy, so when it rains, umbrellas are hardly useful. It snows a lot, but classes are rarely canceled."
Recent Alumnus,1,They are very strict and if it was not for lenient SA's the dorms would be unlivable. The guidelines they are supposed to follow are unreasonably strict and suffocate opportunities for fun. The cops are not very thorough and will basically do whatever you tell them without any question which can be annoying if you have people that like to call the cops a lot around you. The policies and police waste everyone's time and rarely accomplish anything beneficial.
College Senior,1,"You can buy a plane ticket from St. Louis to the tiny airport right outside of town for about $50, which is totally reasonable as that's about as much as you'll pay for gas. There really isn't public transportation in Kirksville, but the town is small. If you decide to not bring a car, your bike will be just fine, and students are always happy to give each other a lift."
College Senior,1,The sports teams here do not do very well.  Fan support is usually decent however and we do show a good amount of school spirit.
College Freshman,1,"Dining Improvement – The dining on campus could be better if they serve a variety of healthy food. The best place to eat is Ryle Hall, but there are other places like Missouri Hall, Centennial Hall, and the Sub (which is the most expensive place to eat on campus). Also, better dining options for Sundays would make a difference."
College Freshman,1,Bulldogs Blow – Almost all of Truman's athletic teams are terrible and there is almost no student support of said teams. It is kind of sad how much we suck really.
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are pretty awful. It is guaranteed that there will always be a group of other kids in the lounges, regardless of the hour. SA's tend to be overly strict. Communal bathrooms tend to get super disgusting very quickly and it seems that people will always be up and making some form of noise in the halls no matter what the hour. I lived in Dobson and am soo happy to be living in an apartment off campus now."
College Freshman,1,"Secluded TTS Syndrome – Kirksville's only attractions are the Thousand Hills State Park, an average movie theater, Walmart, a small JC Penny,and some antique shops. Of course, there's always parties, but Typical Truman Student syndrome will start kicking in because of two reasons: Kirksville is super secluded and Truman students are usually too busy studying. The only thing to look forward to is weekends and breaks, so we can get the hell out of Kirksville."
College Freshman,1,"I haven't seen any off-campus transportation, but that's largely because it's not needed. Many of the students who live off campus are within a 15-20 minute walking distance to their classes, and there's plenty of available parking spots throughout the day to park for commuters."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm not too sure about the other sports, but my friends and I go to football games to watch our friends in the band, and leave after half-time. We've lost our HOMECOMING game for at least the last 2 years."
College Senior,1,The lots have recently been repaved but there's usually potholes galore.  If you move your car it is unlikely to get a spot when you return.

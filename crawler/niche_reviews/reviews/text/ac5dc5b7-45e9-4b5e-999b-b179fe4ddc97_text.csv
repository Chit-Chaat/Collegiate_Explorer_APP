Freshman,5,My experience has been great so far. I've met a bunch of amazing professors and students who are very welcoming.

Junior,5,It’s a great school a lot of diversity and openness coming from California it was a different energy that I needed
Junior,5,Staff is very helpful and understanding . They give great lesson and explain the lesson throughly . Great school to attend
Sophomore,5,What I liked personally about Bowie State was the family friendly environment that allows you to settle in and become comfortable with everyday life on a college campus.
Junior,5,"Bowie State University is a very good school. It is a small school, and has a home like atmosphere. The people on campus are very kind and friendly people. There are plenty of activities and clubs on campus that can accommodate to anyone’s interest. Overall I’m having a great experience."
Junior,5,Bowie state university is a great school. It’s a small school but the opportunities are still there. There are many clubs and activities around campus that can accommodate to anyone’s interest. The people on campus are also very friendly. Overall good experience so far.
Sophomore,5,"The Illustrious Bowie State University is like no otter HBCU! The family and friends that you can gain by networking and getting out of your comfort zone is honestly unbelievable. During my senior year of high school I wasn't sure if I even wanted to go to college, but since I've made the decision to go, I've been on many school sponsored trips, I've meet people that will be in my children's life, professors who actually care about my future, and a family. One of the best things about my University are the professors. Bowie State doesn't hire people just to teach, they hire people who they know will help and guide you to be the best student you can be, and it doesn't stop at your major. In my two years I have connected with professors outside of my major who constantly check on me and encourage my growth as a student and young adult. I don't know where I would be know if I didn't have the support system that Bowie has constantly given me ever since I made the decision to go."
Sophomore,5,"Like every other University, Bowie State had to continue the second half of spring 2020 online. Being a student with a disability, and with the help from my peers and professors I was able to get my first 4.0 ever! My professors were always available at any time of the day or night to email me back with a response. They knew and understood that this was new and unexpected for both us and them and they remained calm and supportive throughout this entire experience. Unlike my friends at other schools, I won't be worried about returning to online classes this fall."
Graduate Student,5,"I greatly appreciate the university's efforts to support students and take care of our physical, emotional stress through virtual extra meetings and classes to support our mental health during the COVID pandemic. The university keeps trying to connect the students and professors together to make sure the learning needs are met through the online learning. The transition from in-class learning to online learning was smooth and prompt without any delaying. They offered enough resources to ensure every students to achieve the semester goals and the graduation requirements. The professors had extra virtual meetings on blackboard to answer the questions about the uncertainty of the academic progress. I really appreciate all the efforts from the professors and the university leadership to support the great deal in student life."
Graduate Student,5,Bowie established the enormous resources for online training and learning from the beginning of the special circumstance during the pandemic. The students received the plenty of email notifications of online learning and the personal support via phone conversation through the tech staffs.
Sophomore,5,I love Bowie State because it feels like home. It is a generally safe campus and it is very easy to get acquainted with almost everything.
Niche User,5,"Although I have not taken any courses there yet I am very pleased with their overall service, each time I call someone is always available and pleasant."
Freshman,5,"Bowie State University is an excellent leaning experience, a conducive and quality educational facilities. Also super fun activities and events, like homecoming."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Bowie State University is there are many opportunities to grow and connect with different groups of people. Not only is the environment around the campus is safe and friendly, there is many jobs around to apply for when you want to make extra money when you are not doing anything on campus."
Alum,5,Bowie State University is great University that does not get enough credit. I know that the professors care about the students and it is a really cool family vibe I believe that it should be ranked among the Best HBCUs considering it is the oldest hbcu in Maryland
Freshman,5,"The thing I love about Bowie State University is that most of the students and faculty often connect with each other to make every student thrive and become their best possible self. Not only is that rare but it makes me a student who attends the university very proud to be apart of this new era. Our saying is ""Bowie Bold"" and I am ready to carry on this tradition."
Freshman,5,"I like the campus, the people, the environment, and most of all the professors and how they actually care about our education."
Niche User,5,Bowie University made me feel very welcome! it was nice to see others who look like me and even successful others at that. it felt like I was right at home and it was amazing to see the new buildings. my mom went there and she has nothing but the best to say about it.
Sophomore,5,"Bowie State University is amazing. Coming to school everyday is exciting because You know you are surrounded by people who share a common goal with you. From the students all the way to the professor you have someone on your side. The quality of education is amazing for the price of tuition and it’s other benefit is that it is a commuter school. When coming to Bowie state, you should feel as if you are in the right place."
Senior,5,"My experience at Bowie has been very pleasant. I have the ability to say that I have done just about everything a student can do here from living on campus, to commuting, to being an RA, and holding a position in one of its many offices. My advice to any student coming here is to make the best of Bowie. The Bowie State experience is what you make of it, meaning go out and get involved and make connections."
Freshman,5,It was honestly one of the best experiences that I ever had. The campus food isn't the best but the parties are never forgotten.
Senior,5,"I love the campus which is very open and has many opportunities for students wanting to really participate. And what is also great is the nice staff, so far each of them really care about the students. The students seem to enjoy their time in Bowie. There is many clubs, activities, and people to meet."
Senior,5,I’ve been a student of Bowie state for 4 years and it’s honestly the best university experience I could ask for. It’s average size population allows students to build a stronger and better relationship with their professor. Office hours are always available and there are enough resources to help each student. I wouldn’t change my undergrad experience for anything.
Freshman,5,Amazing academic life and professors are consistent with maintaining relationships with students inside and outside of the classroom.
Freshman,5,"I love the school, I'm 16 at Bowie State University and have got to know many fabulous people who have similar backgrounds and interests as me. I'm concentrated in my academics so I don't get distracted by what the wicked students are arranging with their pejorative actions/decisions. I've been luckily passing my classes and have had wonderful professors that have prepared me well. I highly recommend this University for anyone still deciding."
Freshman,5,"Bowie State University has a very broad range of things to do at campus. There are many sports, clubs and organizations at Bowie to be involved in and have a full college experience. It'll help you grow as a person as well as connections and find people that are interested in your same field of study."
Freshman,5,I loved how close it was too home and there is never a dull moment at this school. You can get really close with the professors since the classes are relatively small meaning you can get a lot of one on one time. There is loads of stuff to do on campus from joining on of there many clubs or joining sports or even pledging to a sorority/fraternity. Bowie state is financial the best school in Maryland if you plan to stay in state
Junior,5,"Make sure to join a club, it makes adjusting to college life easier. There are there clubs for everyone. I commute, so I cant say anything about the dorms or campus life outside of class, but I have heard there isnt much to do on campus unfortunately. Luckily you're just an 8 minute drive from the local town center"
Freshman,5,I like the atmosphere it brings and I like how diverse it is. Bowie State University serves many options and opportunities.
Sophomore,5,My time so far at Bowie State University has been the best 2 years of my life. Being here at this school has helped me discover who I really am and who I want to be in life. I feel that if i were to attend any other university i would not be in the position that I am in right now. I am forever thankful to have the opportunity to attend Bowie State.
Sophomore,5,Bowie State University has been a wonderful experience for me. The professors have always been very attentive and immersed in the future of all of their students.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed bowie state university over this past semester for its academics and social experience. Due to being an incoming freshman, I was timid at first to enjoy what college was to offer. But the professor is invested in helping the students"
Niche User,5,This will be my first year going to Bowie State University. So far the staff has been wonderful. I look forward to graduating from this school.
Sophomore,5,I love Bowie State. Its a beautiful campus full of school pride and so any talented people. There is never a dull day and activities are constantly occurring to keep student involved and enlightened.
Freshman,5,"I love the family friendly atmosphere, the care and love the professors have for their students, how caring and infatuated they are to get to know you and how they want to help you strive to do good and graduate with your degree and how willing they are to help and make you better. The campus is absolutely beautiful and just so warm and inviting."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Bowie State University is and has been so far a pretty good one. I believe that just like any college, you experience is what you make it, you have to make the best out of every situation which is what I've decided to do. They are constantly trying to come up with new and different ways for students to get involved which is one thing that has made my experience a good one thus far. One thing I think Bowie State could change is the food choice and adding more food choices."
Freshman,5,"Bowie state University is a great college. for my first year experience, it has been the best. so many new doors to life have been opened for me because of so many options that they offer."
Senior,5,Bowie State University is a great school.  The professors are educated and care about their students learning the material.
Freshman,5,I loved how your advisors my be your professors so they’ll always be there to help. I’d like to see change in the professors and more interactive work than always lectures or seminars.
Junior,5,"I have only been at Bowie for once semester, i am a recent transfer student so i am still new to the school, but overall i loved my first semester. I love the major i am in and i love the professors in charge of the major. The campus is fairly easy to navigate and the administrative staff  i have encountered have been very friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,Considering I’m a out of state student i didn’t know much about the area but i was able to fine such nice and kind people to show me around and make me feel welcomed.
Senior,5,I love everything about being at Bowie State University. i am so happy I chose this school. I am apart of the cheerleading team.
Junior,5,"I am a current student at Bowie State University. I decided to stay in campus my first year and it was one of the best things I've done. I believe staying on campus really lets you connect with others better and get a better feel of what it is your school has to offer. College is what you make it you are investing in yourself there will always be people at any university that say ""oh this school sucks"" but did they really give a solid effort or were they not ready to have such a big responsibility in college. Bowie is an amazing school for business I'm an accounting major and Bowie has provided me with multiple opportunities to be successful also they have a NABA chapter on campus. I couldn't have chose better for my major."
Junior,5,Bowie State is a diverse University with great teachers and even greater students. You will learn a lot at this school. The tuition is fair and I believe you get your moneys worth. Lots of students come to bowie seeking an education and come out with much more. When you leave bowie state you will have new experiences new friends and maybe even a new job.
Junior,5,"Distance,  teaching and professors are excellent for me. The set up of the campus is very captivating.  The professors know their stuff and they teach it with passion. The staff goes above and beyond to help the students with they are looking for it comes to registration and choosing a major."
Freshman,5,"Bowie State is a great HBCU to attend. It is a small campus, so you won't be lost within a sea of students and you will get to know familiar faces fairly quickly. There is a strong sense of community at Bowie State and everyone helps each other out."
Sophomore,5,"I love it. The atmosphere is just amazing, like everyone on campus is one big happy family. I encourage you to definitely come visit the school and see for yourselves. Our CAB does an amazing job in planning the coolest and most fun events on campus. Also very big shoutout to our SGA for advocating for us day in and day out their amazing."
Niche User,5,I do dual enrollment there so I’m not there 24/7 but the environment is super chill and everyone is supportive of each other!!
Senior,5,"Bowie State became the haven where I was saved from my circumstances, it's ja place to start fresh and be made anew. Our culture, community, and core values keep us together in the middle of any storm; you'll never have to face a mountain alone. BSU gave me everything I needed, even though I didn't ask for it. I love my HBCU."
Graduate Student,5,"The professors at Bowie State University care about you as well as your future.  They are very attentive to their students and the needs of their students.  You build a lot of great relationships at Bowie.  I would like to see a little more efficiency and communication in their financial aid department.  You don't know if you have aid until school begins almost.  Then you're running around like a chicken with your head cut off, trying to find funds to attend school."
Freshman,5,My first iffficao visit at bowie was participating in the new student orentation it really opened my mind to looking at bowie not only academically but overall fun in general. I loved the activates they had arranged for us all the new chants I learned the friendly staff and all the new peers that I ave made. Choosing bowie as my university was the best described I made as an adult .
Junior,5,Bowie State University is a very diverse school. It is a great place to build one's future and also experience personal growth. There are many things that make this school stand out but one this I enjoyed is the way professors are passionate about helping students archive their goals. I would recommend anyone who wants to have a great learning experience and building community to apply to Bowie state universities.
Alum,5,"Great school. The teachers are great and are easy to connect to, ask for help, and more. The programs are nice as well they are geared towards preparing students for the work world. The student government and activity board loves to involve the students and listens to students wants and needs. It feels like a family."
Works Here,5,"I like it here, all the professors I have had so far have been willing to work with me, and are very kind. I was also fortunate enough to obtain a job to work here, which is a plus."
Freshman,5,"Bowie State University is building a dynamic future on a proud heritage. What I like is that it is a diverse university where there are 5,600 students, along with faculty and staff, that get to represent many ethnic and cultural backgrounds. I also like that Bowie State University provides high-quality and affordable educational opportunities for students with ambitions to achieve and succeed."
Niche User,5,"Bowie state university is newly renovated, has great staff and students. The athletic teams are amazing and the spirit programs are too. I wish everyone check out Bowie State, there is a broad spesctrum of majors and things to do on campus!"
Graduate Student,5,The atmosphere was very welcoming and warm when I took a college visit. I love the diversity of the school.
Senior,5,I enjoy the one on one interactions. Also the dedication advisors and professors have for the students.
Freshman,5,"my experience at bowie is great this school is very diverse and has a lot of culture on campus. The area surrounding it is great if you ever want to get out and go shopping, eat, or ever want to hang out with friends. The students here are very nice and are very charismatic towards one another."
Freshman,4,Bowie is a growing university with a lot of potential. They offer a bunch of opportunities that allow students to branch out and try new things.
Senior,4,overall its a great experience. There are some professors that slack off that fail to put grades in a reasonable times.
Alum,4,"At the time that I went to Bowie, 1989-1995, my experience went fairly well.  I lived on campus for two years and then decided to commute my remaining years.  In hindsight, I should have stayed on campus.  Deciding to commute became a distraction for me and I believed set me back, thus adding another year to my undergraduate journey."
Sophomore,4,My online experience at Bowie State was a good/ bad  one I was able to still learn effectively and still understand everything like I was in the classroom
Senior,4,Bowie is a great school to attend it provided what i need to be successful in my future nursing career
Senior,4,"Also online classes allow me to work on my own and move at my own pace.  The use of online courses has made life at work easier, Since I don't have to meet on a regularly basis,  It is very convenient for me not having to meet on a regular basis. When a person has to work full time, it is hard for that person to successfully juggle their job responsibilities along with homework and study. A person can always take an online course to deal with the time constraints that a job will put on you. The use of online courses allows you to cover the material needed in school while maintaining your workload.
I've learned that to be a successful distance learner, you have to be self-disciplined and able to work well on your own. Since you won't be physically going to class each week, you can take part in class from the comfort of your own home. You must be self-disciplined because the instructor wont constantly be there to remind you of assignments or of project deadlines."
Senior,4,Bowie State is a wonderful university. It is very diverse and most of the faculty and staff are very helpful and kind. I just wish that there were more organizations available.
Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been really good. Every professor that I had was very concerned with students passing class. They make sure you made connections with them as well as other students to not only pass the class but network and get your name out there. I have yet to have a bad experience with a professor and hope that will continue until graduation.
Junior,4,One thing I like about Bowie State is that everyone is very welcoming and family -friendly. There are a lot of resources available on Bowie's campus which is very helpful. Bowie is also very driven to help their students succeed in any way possible.
Junior,4,My overall experience is that BSU is wondeful. The teachers want to see you succeed and help you in all the ways you need to be help. There is so much hands on experience here as well. Not only do they care about the students but they make sure we are involve as much as possible. Every week they have something in the student center that can benefit you for your college experience
Freshman,4,"Bowie state is a great school! Although I’m only a freshman, all of my professors have been wonderful."
Freshman,4,"Bowie State is a good school, I recommend that if you're in the state of Maryland then you should apply. There are a few things that I like about Bowie State. One thing that I personally like is the academics. There are great professors and staff all around that wants to help and guide you in the right direction. Also, there are great programs on campus that you could join that would make your four year experience and good four years. The students are nice and respectful and majority of the students on campus are engaged in something so they won't be just sitting around all day. Overall, I only been there for one semester and it's actually not bad, and I would like to continue to stay there."
Sophomore,4,"Overall Bowie State University is a well rounded university with the intentions to see all students succeed by providing the the utmost effort in seeking this goal. Although minor issues could use improvement, as far as, the amount of housing, campus food, and professor/student respect."
Freshman,4,"I like how the environment is calm and when it comes to being new on campus, people already treat you like family. The professors were great and the food, we have many options and two different ares we can go to. Lastly, the students are all from different areas and you learn a lot from each other and build a brotherhood or sisterhood."
Niche User,4,"Its been cool, lots of parties, environment is great, people are great, and it is like a family here. I love it!!!!"
Freshman,4,Bowie State University is a great school although it may not be the biggest I definitely recommend it to others. It is definitely great to choose if you really want the HBCU experience in my opinion. When I first started classes I was really nervous but it is all about how you choose to go about it. There are also some great people on campus that will help you with whatever you need which is very good. Being a freshman on a college campus is not the easiest at all so it is good to have people around you that support you fully. I would say for sure that it is good to get out there and go to events because that is one of the only ways you will truly feel comfortable and at home. Now the campus could use a little more diversity but for the most part I think it is great.
Senior,4,"I love Bowie State University for all the opportunities and programs that supports it students. As well as its amazing history of being Maryland’s first HBCU, which is over a 150 years strong. The only thing I would say that Bowie State University has to work on and currently is  would be how to market not only the University, but also to its student so they can be more aware of all that Bowie State has to offer."
Niche User,4,"Bowie state is a wonderful school with a beautiful campus. I felt as f I fit in easily and that it was my second home. The only downside would be that we had mold in one of our classes and they didn't tell us about it until two days afterwards. It took an entire month for them to clean out the mold and when we were about to move back into our classroom, another class took it."
Freshman,4,I overall love my experience at Bowie State University. The professors are very helpful and the university offers any resources you could possibly think of.  Also their tuition is very affordable for the students.
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my college experience so far at Bowie State University. In my time there I have seen the growth in my major department, college of study, and the university as a whole. I have been fortunate to be in a number of organizations and committees. One thing I like about Bowie is that they listen to the students and work towards change for better experiences."
Junior,4,The teachers are very good and give you opportunity to submit late assignment. It is also cheap and its a good investment of your money.
Sophomore,4,"Seeing as how this is my semester as a transfer student with Bowie State, I cannot rate all aspects of it.  So far it has been a very pleasant experience. Moving into the dorms was a very smooth process. I didn't expect it to go that smooth. I will say, that I would have like to have seen a little more attention to detail. For example, what and where  a student needs to go and do in order to utilize their meal plan. A new student shouldn't have to figure it out on their own. As a suggestion,  I would suggest all pertinent information be placed on the main bulletin board for students, as well as parents to see on move-in day as well as the first week of classes.
The dorms are adequate and appear to be well kept. So far I have no complaints about the food.. Because it is an HBCU, there is not going to be a lot of diversity, but I am happy to attend an institution where all of my peers look like me. But a little diversity would be ok too."
Freshman,4,What I loved about Bowie state was the community feel of it all. Everyone around me was so accepting and made being away from home a lot easier. The only thing that  I would change is the communication over the phone with the administrative offices.
Freshman,4,"I love Bowie State’s family hood. Being there makes you feel comfortable and at home. It’s easy to make friends and it’s easy to adjust. Everyone is so friendly and open, it’s crazy. Go Bulldogs!!"
Junior,4,Small campus and easy to navigate. I would say they need to update some older buildings. Everyone is cordial and sincere. The atmosphere is energetic and constantly moving in certain areas while tranquil in others.
Junior,4,If you are looking for a small school thats very passionate about what it represents then i would say bowie state is a good university. The teachers are good and i would say like to help the students get by.
Sophomore,4,"I liked that the college has a family, clean and fair environment. The faculty members are so willing to help current and upcoming students  achieve their goals no matter what. I was happy to find a faculty member myself that was willing to help and guide me to the right resources to succeed."
Junior,4,My experience at Bowie State was good. It is a family environment and the professors care about the student's success and education.
Sophomore,4,"Bowie State University is the Historic Black College / University that I am honored to be attending for four years of my academic lifetime. As a rising sophomore, my freshman experience was rewarding and comforting as I have completed two semesters as a deans list recipient (3.5 GPA). I've met many people along with great professors and staff. The only downside is a lack in financial assistance directly through the school. I would love more assistance in the finance department to make my enrollment in school more affordable and less stressful."
Junior,4,"I am happy with BSU considering how distant yet conveniently close to home it is. Bowie is affordable, & Marc Train and Metro accessible. However they need to be more strict on who they hire for professors, some are too lax and expect nothing from the students. Others are just too hard on students and it’s one thing to hold students accountable but it’s something else when you fail your entire class. The dorms are decent but only that. The food services program is getting better & staff and administration at Bowie is renovating Bowie to make it look more appealing. All of the organizations on campus could be promoted more because all of them are exciting.  Bowie provides a lot of wonderful experiences & opportunities for finding yourself & helping you prepare for your future  but it has to be advertised otherwise students won’t take advantage since  they are unaware. I fell in love with Bowie because it’s a close nit school and the education program there is amazing."
Freshman,4,"My experience overall at Bowie was fairly great first year in college I learned a lot but one thing about Bowie I don’t like is , it’s really hard to get in contact with anyone in almost any department and if you do they really don’t know the answer to the question you might have."
Sophomore,4,Good school that embraces the diversity of students. This school is also looking to improve on the overall experience of the facilities on campus. The professors are guaranteed to teach a student something before the conclusion of class.
Junior,4,"I have never experienced a school like this before. The first HBCU in Maryland. Like any other school, there are good professors and bad professors. There are many different resources available to students like the writing center, math center, the career center, and library.  Each professor wants students to retain the information given so they can be able to apply it to their future jobs. Overall Bowie State is a well-rounded university here to help students get a degree."
Freshman,4,"I went to Bowie state for a year, and I absolutely loved it there. The only reason I am currently transferring is that they don't have the major I want to pursue.  I only had issues with one of my teacher at the institution. Bowie is overall a well-loved community that wants to see you grow"
Freshman,4,Bowie State University is not at all like a lot of people make it seem. Many people say it is a party school but in reality it is more focused on education than anything. The atmosphere on campus is friendly and everyone is very respectful. There is always an event going on and opportunities for students available.
Senior,4,"I'm currently a senior (class of Fall 2019) at Bowie State University, and I transferred there since my Sophomore/junior year. Overall, I would say the school is great, although they do have their own issues. I have met the most wonderful professors that actually care about your life post-graduation. They have been like mentors to me, and they push me to be better. But then again, I am speaking from my experience in my department, I can't say for other colleges within the school."
Niche User,4,"My experience at Bowie state university was great ; everyone  was such nice people. Even though i was just  touring the campus , the students and staff made me feel at home.  What i like most about the campus are the different programs they have to offer. Something that could be change are their dorms but the community of the university makes up for it ."
Sophomore,4,It’s hard to make friends if your an out of state student mostly everyone is from Maryland here and grew up together.
Freshman,4,Bowie state is not your normal college its is one of the chilliest and most fun school i been on. Bowie is a school that you have to make fun for your self you make it how you want up here. It would be better if there would be more food spots and things like that but the area is good. And if there was more people who stayed on campus the school would be a better school but its an chill school.
Niche User,4,I have heard a wide range of good and bad things about this school but one thing I do know is that they care for what your next step will be in most programs. If you put your mind to it they will help you get where you need to be.
Niche User,4,I experienced homecoming and I took a tour at Bowie State in October. Everyone was very nice and open armed. Each question I had to ask was answered with no hesitation. I think Bowie State is a place I can grow with my culture and follow in my mother and father's footsteps.
Freshman,4,Bowie State University professors actually take time to break down things to the point that you understand and they just don't automatically think that you should know things.
Freshman,4,"I love Bowie State University, although no school is 100% perfect, Bowie met a lot of my criteria when it came to finding the campus that was for me. I was looking for a school that would give me the feeling of a home, and the Bowie State Community is really like a family."
Sophomore,4,"The experience is ok but, it could be better I like how they have so many tutor services open for any field that you study for to help with any class you take. What I would like to see change is for them to have more advisers available to help students figure out what is the education plan they have to take."
Sophomore,4,What I like about Bowie State is the convenience of the location and proximity it is from my actual home and campus and keeps me close to family. A lot of things on campus life need to change and bring in more networking events for students and alumni.
Freshman,4,"I'm currently enrolled in Bowie State University. I am a freshman. I love how familiar the school feels. As a student of color, going to a school where most people look like me and get where I’m coming from is very reassuring. It makes me feel comfortable and confident in everything I do. The only thing I would change is how much I do on campus. I work so hard and I focus solely on school work so everything else that isn’t mandatory is thrown to the side. I want to make more friends and do more on campus while I still can."
Freshman,4,"All of the teachers are really nice and are very understanding. Everyone on the campus is easy to talk to. The opportunities presented at Bowie state is outstanding, everybody wants to see you be successful!!!"
Junior,4,"What i liked most about the school is i feel safe , I enjoy having fun outside and in the  classroom, and that they're are a lot of nice and friendly people."
Alum,4,Commuter school but well get the better experience if you stay on cmapus. Try to join clubs and network as much as possible especially if you plan to remain in the area after graduation.
Sophomore,4,Small school with a lot of different personalities. Anyone can find a group to hang with or be a part of.
Niche User,4,The campus as a whole was beautiful. As you walk from one building to another the scenery is stunning.
Sophomore,4,Even though it's an HBCU there's still a lot of diversity amongst the students there. There's a lot of things to do at the school academically and socially especially during Homecoming. I would like for there to be more housing options and for it to be less expensive.
Junior,4,I am currently a Junior Accounting major at Bowie State University. Bowie State is a small school and great for scholars looking for a teaching based school rather than a research-based school.
Junior,4,"I have learned so much semester after semester. I met knew people, networked more, and grown academically. 
I still have more room to grow but Bowie has me better with time management, being an all around student, and getting to know and be friends with people who want to see me succeed."
Senior,4,"Bowie state is a great school. The campus is beautiful, the professors are very helpful, and the city is very safe."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Bowue State University  (BSU) has been great.  I enjoy living on campus.  I also like my professors and meeting new people in my classes. I often go to the campus library to study for upcoming tests.  I'm very fortunate to have a roommate that I like and get along well.  We both graduated from the same county and friends in common. There are several places to eat on campus and overall the food is good.   Something the cafe will have crab legs, steak and salmon!!   Homecoming week is usually the best parties!!! The few things I want to see change are more of a variety with food choices. I would recommend BSU as a great place to learn and grow."
Junior,4,"Bowie state University is one of the oldest historically black university in Maryland, it is a good School with a small population size. I really love Bowie state because ,with the small population size I can easily participate in class; which include  like asking questions in topics I don’t understand . I’m also lucky  enough to easily schedule appointments   with my professor, to ask question on topics that I couldn’t understand, It’s also a very quite campus, very conducive for studies and diverse as well."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the campus and the environment. People are helpful and hard working. At first, it might be a little confusing inside the campus to find the building you are looking for, but it is a small campus. It's also a quiet campus. No loud noises or no disruptions."
Senior,4,"Bowie State University is a great HBCU! What it lacks in aesthetics and campus activities, it makes up for in the one-on-one student to professor interactions and the relationships you foster from going to such a small university."
Alum,4,"I loved Bowie State. It truly felt like my home. Even now as an Alumna, I still feel the strong connection I felt then. I know all of my professors were invested in my education and they wanted to see me succeed. I could email them or call them at any time and they always gave me their 100% dedication."
Junior,2,"My overall experience at Bowie State University has been quite challenging. I find myself being grateful that God even blessed me with the opportunity to get a college education. On the other hand, Bowie State has not been as easy road for me. If it is not the professors that are lousy and do not care about you or your grade, it is the residents you have to deal with that have no respect for you. I learned a lot and have grown so much while being here and I plan on learning more because when you are uncomfortable and step out your comfort zone you grow much more than you think."
Junior,2,"The only thing I enjoyed about Bowie State University is the Entrepreneurship program because it helps you a lot with opening your business. The school itself is not that great, customer service is horrible and  they are completely out dated when you want to sign in Financial aid office, the employee are talking to each other instead of assisting students. In addition, the staff will send you office to office instead of  explaining to you the process of your certain needs. If you are receiving a transfer scholarship, you need look for the transfer representative constantly in order to receive your scholarship."
Graduate Student,2,"The administration at this university is absolutely terrible. It seems as though they are under staffed, because no one answers your calls, or responds  to your messages with any sense of urgency. The administrative faculty at BSU is also very rude, and inconsiderate of the students. I am a current graduate student here and I have been trying to contact the office of financial aid for TWO WEEKS! They give out misinformation and hold your financial disbursement for no apparent reason, and for some students like myself this is a major inconvenience. At most reputable institutions, your refund is disbursed before classes even begin. The attitude of the staff is very unpleasant after finally speaking with someone from the office, I was rushed off the phone, and my questions were answered with uncertainty. They did not the office of financial aid gave me an uncertain answer, leaving me in the exact same position confused and stressed."
Freshman,2,I like the size of the campus and the diversity. They do not offer enough housing and the administration part of the school is terrible. You will not get things done if you do not stay on top of the employees. I like that the school has lots of activities to do when you are not busy with school work.
Alum,2,"Education: 
- There are great majors the school offers but I'f your interested in one that's 
""less popular"" DO YOUR RESEARCH on what the program offers in education, networking, internships, and etc. I chose Sports Management but the program lacked in Professors that were knowledgeable of the subject and the program needs a complete re-do of the course requirements because they have failed myself and others on preparing us for any entry level position . Also, most internships make it a requirement that you must be able to earn college credit(s) in order to  qualify but the way the program is setup you can only do your internship your senior . Therefore, limiting your experience and opportunities within the field . I understand the school gives others that may not be able to afford a college education to do so or those who have lower gpa's and still want to attend college a chance but professors use that as  a crutch. The course work felt like high school."
Freshman,2,"Bowie State University well where do I start? The school itself is spilt into sections on one side you have all the people who are just there to be there, then you have people who are trying to transfer out the school (various reasons), and lastly you have those who are actually working with the school to build a career for themselves. Let me not forget about the residence halls... all but two are substandard and a waste of money."
College Junior,2,campus security needs to hire more officers and step up their safety precautious around the campus.
College Junior,2,Campus housing definitely needs numerous updates and renovations
College Freshman,2,Not really safe at all. A lot of robberies & gunshots every now & then.
College Freshman,2,"Seems to always be a fine given out , not enough order when it comes to keeping building clean and hear tumors about there being a roach infestation in the Haley residence in which I wanted to live in the following year but making reconsider from hearing that"
College Senior,2,Very disorganized school and teachers are bad
College Sophomore,2,The party scene at bowie is bad. The hours are barely enough time to enjoy yourself and the police make it hard to party. They are literally in the party being annoying. Realistically who wants to party in a crowd with cops? Plot parties are great until the police come.
College Sophomore,2,Took too long to process everything
College Junior,2,Nothing that is close enough to walk.
College Junior,2,Parties are boring because they are for bowie students only. We would like to party with others as well.
College Junior,2,The RAs pick and choose who has to follow the rules.
College Freshman,2,they are hard to find
Recent Alumnus,2,I only eat at Quiznos. The food in the cafe is so unappealing to me that I stopped going my sophomore year. Luckily I live in the dorm with a full kitchen so I can buy groceries. I feel bad for the other students that don't live in my dorm and are subjected to that food.
College Freshman,2,Visitation is horrible for freshmen. The school focuses more on that and parking.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a big variety, high cost, nasty food."
College Junior,2,Now that no one can live in goodloe apartments the only off-campus living arrangement is your home. You either live on campus or you commute.
College Junior,2,"There are no student discounts

Cost effective

Unhealthy"
College Junior,2,"Financial aid always seem to be ""out of funds."" 

Getting financial aid is always a hassle because the school is never willing to help unless you absolutely beg them for help and even then its like puling teeth."
College Freshman,2,It's ok the food is not all to good somedays and the dishes tend not to be clean all the time so that spoils my apatite most of the time.
College Freshman,2,Some of the polices hat we have are unnecessary. Expecially in housing with visitation.
College Freshman,2,They are unorganized and long winded. They have bad attitudes when you visit.
College Freshman,2,There is not a lot of places for us to have parties. We're in the middle of no where. We would have to travel to DC.
College Junior,2,I feel that Bowie is overly strict on visitation and alcohol
College Student,2,they have their good days and bad
College Student,2,there really isn't a party scene at bowie
College Sophomore,2,The nursing program denied me before checking my grade for chemistry to  enter the program.
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus police is always availible but I feel like they come to late. A lot of the residence hall programs to me seem to promote sex a lot because they feel like that will attract more students to come. I strongly believe that it influences sexual harassment and there should be more programs to take sexual harassment more serious.
College Junior,2,Food is alright just depends on the day
College Senior,2,They really do not have any near by dining options
College Junior,2,Bowie State University doesn't offer off campus housing. It is basically a commuter school so it is assumed that you have your own place or you live at home with your parents. The apartment building is on campus and you'll still have to follow rules of the residence halls.
College Senior,2,"The women in the financial aid office are rude and unhelpful and only tend to ""step their game up"" when someone tries to take action above their heads."
College Senior,2,The labs  in the library are TERRIBLE and OLD!
College Freshman,2,"You have to go at least 20-30 minutes off campus to find a decent late-night option. But other than that, plenty of fast food options are just 5 minutes off campus."
College Freshman,2,"If the weather is bad, you can guarantee that more than half of the class is missing; even those who live on campus become lazy on inclement weather days."
College Freshman,2,The computers are not really reliable. They always crash or freeze.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid at Bowie is ONE WORD Terrible!
College Sophomore,2,Not very familiar with it but those who I know often complain about it.
College Freshman,2,My college is historically black. Not too much ethnicity.
College Freshman,2,There is almost no variety so you are forced to eat the same unhealthy foods as you had the day before
College Freshman,2,The only transportation there is is the bus and it isn't very reliable on the weekends
College Junior,2,"My financial aid process has been a rough experience. My school dropping my classes because of my financial aid not showing up in the system on numerous occasions, and me having to sit out a whole semester due to that really set me back. I advise any student that is receiving financial aid to stay on top of everything because if they don't they can end up giving up on something that they really need in the long run."
College Sophomore,2,"Bowie State University is in fact an HBCU, so the university is predominantly black. There are other cultures and nationalities at the school but not much."
College Sophomore,2,"I live in the area, but I have visited other college campuses more lively than Bowie State's. You have to commute a good 10 miles in either direction of the school to find any good food places or half decent hang out spots such as money, skating, go carting, bowling, and laser tagging. It maybe more fun to someone who does not live in the area outside of schooling purposes."
College Freshman,2,The food is usually good especially on Soul Food Wednesday
College Senior,2,"Night life at Bowie State University is as fun as you make it. There are not many places to go to for fun that is close by. We basically live in the boondocks! Our school is an 80% commuter school and most people are home on the weekends. We do have parties once and a while and when they are really good, someone always ruins the party by getting into a fight. DC is 20 minutes away and for people who are 21 and older, going there to the bars and clubs would be fun; all you need is transportation."
College Sophomore,2,"The food during breakfast is always good. They serve omelets everyday that you are able to pick what you want inside of it. They also have pancakes or french toast with eggs, sausage/bacon, and potatoes. However during lunch and dinner the food is not always good. We also have the Pub, which is the place you get your food to go. Everyday they serve chicken boxes with french fries in one line, which are beyond nasty. On Mondays and Thursdays they serve grilled chicken, green beans and corn bread which are good. They serve Salad on Wednesdays and Tuesdays and Fridays are chipotle. You have to pay with your own money or flex to get Quiznos. We also have the Gold Room; which serves the best food."
College Junior,2,"It's been pretty nice due to the change of season. Most days, the weather is very unpredictable. Some days it'll be hot then the next day it's cold and raining. We call it pneumonia weather."
College Sophomore,2,Many of the facilities here at Bowie State are very old and need to be updated ASAP.
College Freshman,2,"The freshmen girls get stuck in tower, which is gonna be a bad experience that you'll have to deal with. If your lucky you might get into tubman, which is an older building and its a lot more spacious, or you might get into Hailey, which is probably the newest cleanest dorm. Bowie Place/CMRC, the on campus apartment. is the best place you can live on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There is majority african american students, a hand full of white students, and I've only seen two asian students."
College Freshman,2,A lot of students drink. It depends on who you are around to see certain things.
College Junior,2,"neither safe nore dangerous, not too much to do unless you have a vehicle."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is extremely open. I do feel that we are protected, but the protection is average. We do have a police force, but they can't possibly know when an intruder is on campus. The students would hardly know if an intruder is on campus, unless that person was acting in a suspicious manner."
College Sophomore,2,"The visitation restrictions are very strict. Visitors have to be out at 12 a.m. on weeknights and 7 a.m. on weekends. Also, visitation does not start until 5 p.m. The school does have strict rules about drug and alcohol use, but it is not strictly enforced unless someone is caught with it on their person."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't many places you can go and the bus stop running very early. The bus is only $1.80. But you have the Marc Train that take you further out than Bowie, and of course it will be a couple dollars more. Overall, the transportation is not good, I would refer that you have a car to be honest."
Junior,1,"The Professors mistreat students. Students voices are ignored. Administration is incompetent. My daughter has been there for 3 years and for 3 years she has suffered at the hands of negligence, disrespect, and constant mistreatment and all by staff. Sometimes I feel she is an inmate in prison. My other children will never attend this University. Do not go to this school. Run the other way..."

Niche User,1,Administration is absolutely awful. It seems that no one ever wants to do their actually job. The day I stepped on campus I had issues with financial aid and their terrible communication. I hadn’t recieved my aid until the end of the semester when I didn’t really matter anymore. I had to wing almost all of my class work because of that so you can imagine how my grades looked. I went onto the next semester with the plan of transferring after this one but ended up leaving all together. I had more issues with financial aid which costed me my housing. The water in the housing was extremely acidic therefore almost all the females were dealing with vaginal bacteria issues. I had about 3 in the handful of months that I was there.
College Freshman,1,I don't live on campus and thats one of the problems i have with this school. they do not have enough housing for all the students that attend their school. not everyone can commute or have the money to commute everyday to school. especially when you're an athlete and you have to be to practice at 5:30 in the morning. Also the way they go about housing is very unorganized too. The buildings also need some work. Some don't have air. Some have mold and bugs just a BIG NO
College Sophomore,1,I don't know if they have Greek life
College Freshman,1,"Save yourself the money and the time, you can do much better."
College Freshman,1,"Please. If you're used to things like clean floors, enough room to turn around in, and a bug-free environment then BSU is not for you. Unless you live off campus."
College Senior,1,it could be SO MUCH BETTER all of the rules enforced isn't worth the housing quality
College Freshman,1,The Resident Hall I stay in now is the worst. A lot of either old or broken things.
College Junior,1,"Visitation hours 

5pm is too late for visitors to be signed in

12 am is too early for visitors to be signed out 

we are young adults and should be treated as such"
College Freshman,1,The food do not taste well. There is no variety. The flex run out to quickly because I spend it on the only thing that's good which is Quiznos.
College Sophomore,1,"The school requires the same documents that I give to them every school year. They pick and choose who to give a scholarships. When applying for fafsa for my school, you should have all your tax documents ready from the IRS to email to the school and if you want a scholarship , apply early."
College Sophomore,1,The school doesnt help with off campus housing.
Recent Alumnus,1,The boys are made annoying
Recent Alumnus,1,the food is nasty and its the same thing all the time
Recent Alumnus,1,"I'm out in the middle of nowhere

I would like a coffee shop"
Recent Alumnus,1,I am person who is qualified to take part in joing a sorority. I am going to wait till grade school.
Recent Alumnus,1,ITS ALOT OF MONEY TO LIVE IN PG COUNTY
Recent Alumnus,1,Living on campus was the worst I was moved 3 different times for weed related issuse.  I hated living on campus
Recent Alumnus,1,The games are not free or redue price for student and the student do not get invoved
Recent Alumnus,1,Friday the campus is completely emepty. There is nothing special or Unique about my school.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I wish that I never came to Bowie, There is no campus life and its a step up from a Half-way House. I am nontraditional student and I can honestly say tht I had a better time when I was at Virginia State. The school has not gotten over the stabbing so there is little to none campus activites and you have to pay for everything . My grades have been good becuase I am working hard to get out of Bowie. The school needs to hire new instructors they have only one perfessor that teaches a number of courses. The stsudent center,closes early and we ""Student"" do not have acess to everything like the theater. The food is terrible no variety for vegetarian. Staff and student do not make out of state students feel welcome. overall I can honestly say Attending Bowie State University was a HUGE Mistake !!!!!!"
College Junior,1,Still working on the problem
College Freshman,1,I honestly don't like it. I'm not a party person. A lot of kids do party on the weekends though.
College Freshman,1,The amount of information I recieved about finanical aid was not enough to help me through the process the semster is almost over and I'm still having problems with finacial aid.
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid is the absolute worse as far as Bowie is concerned. There has been, and still is multiple issues with my financial aid."
College Junior,1,"This school is borderline ridiculous when it comes to how strict it is. Especially in the on-campus apartments where we have to show two IDs just to get into the building. And, god forbid, if you don't show your hall ID you will face a $50 fine. And the campus is completely dry. Zero alcohol tolerance so if you're looking for a kegfesting rager, keep looking."
College Sophomore,1,Area is surrounded by woods but has great african american events and great sport teams.
College Junior,1,"This pertains more to the offices and the people who are supposed to help you. Every office I called or visited was VERY unprofessional. They seem to have no interest in solving your problems or requests. No one knows how to help and doesn't know who to ask for help. Instead of going the extra mile to help, they simply say ""uhhh, I don't know"" and that's that. I've had many people answer the phone with a ""hello"" instead of ""hello this is Brittany (or other name) in so and so office."" When being transferred to another office, the call almost never goes through, and if it does, no one answers. No one gets back to your voice messages. I emailed a specific employee and they sent a mass email saying ""will someone help this young lady."" The campus life and classes are fine as long as you don't have any questions or problems because no one will help you!"
College Sophomore,1,"I do not live on campus. However, I am up there a lot and unless you do live in a dorm room on campus  there's not much to do, especially when it's cold outside. A lot of times you will find a lot of people making their own fun outside. There are no establishments immediately surrounding the school."
College Sophomore,1,"The freshman dorms, minus Haley, are terrible at Bowie State. The elevators barely work, or there are no elevators at all, its always either too hot or too cold. Visitation policiy is terrible everywhere. The apartment building that I resdie in CMRC or Bowie Place, is alot better than the tradiational housing. The only thing is that it is way too expensive, and they are way too strict for it to be an apartment."
College Student,1,You have a few stores and the Bowie Towne Center only if you want to go to Annapolis Mall
College Freshman,1,You really cant travel unless you have a vehicle the marc train doesnt run on the weekends
College Freshman,1,There are really only two main parking lots to park your car. Sunday nights are the worst because everyone comes back from home and its NO where to park.
College Sophomore,1,Every semester when it is time for me to move in my dorm I wind up in financial aid. My freshman year move in day the school had a large bill in my name be size they had me marked as an out of state student. I also have a female friend who was enrolled as a male (due to fault of the university)
College Freshman,1,the campus dinning does not look like a college dinning but they are building a new dinning place that looks like it is going to look good.
College Freshman,1,"Their are no nightlife at bowie state university no parties, it is really not a campus life school."
Recent Alumnus,1,They Barely Give Any! I haven't received any aid and I don't know anyone who has! They don't have enough.
Recent Alumnus,1,Nothing is in the area. It is far from everything.
College Junior,1,drugs are VERY easy to get on campus.

Sophomore,5,"Genuinely, I love the block system. Being able to tackle one class at a time has really reduced the stress in my life and I feel like I'm actually absorbing the material because my focus isn't split between multiple subjects. I would prefer if the classes last 6-8 weeks instead of just 4, but it's still definitely worth it!
I also love the community. I've never felt more at home or had more friends in my entire life! This school attracts smart, kind, loving individuals and I feel very fortunate to have met the people I have. 
The professors are great too, they are friendly and casual, I never feel afraid to ask a question or tell them I need help. I've actually become very good friends with several of my professors once I'm done with their classes. We really are one big cohesive community here!
If you're looking for a place to belong, I can't recommend MIU more highly. It's the only university I've ever returned to for a consecutive year."
Alum,5,Wonderful experience studying at MIU. Very top level professors and such an international experience with students from countries all over the world. The foundation of meditation and development of consciousness is amazing.

Alum,5,"I would highly recommend this university due to the superior learning experience. All classes are Consciousnesses based. That is done by practicing Transcendental Meditation twice daily which opens the container of knowledge, consciousness."
Alum,5,I had attended a couple of other universities before attending Maharishi International University (MIU) and found MIU to be a superior learning experience.
Alum,5,MIU was such a wonderful time in my life. I was able to center and ground myself and at t he same time get the education I was after. I made some of the strongest friendships of my life while being there. I couldn’t recommend it enough.
Alum,5,We didn’t have online learning at the time. Luckily we weren’t living during the pandemic that we currently are in.
Alum,5,"I completed a Master's Degree in Education in 1981. The content of the curriculum was very carefully balanced in terms of content, and in terms of faculty. I especially enjoyed the ""one course at a time"" focus, because it allowed us to be immersed in one area of subject matter, instead of juggling different content on a daily basis. I also benefited mentally and physically from the emphasis on daily group practice of Transcendental Meditation and Yoga. It was transformational in terms of enhancing my intellectual and emotional clarity, and self confidence. Overall, I can say with complete fairness that choosing MIU for graduate school was the best educational experience of my academic life."
Alum,5,I was there before online learning really became a thing... so I can't exactly speak to this question.
Alum,5,"Amazing people, amazing sense of purpose & mission, developing well-rounded individuals from the inside out."
Alum,5,"By the time I came to MIU, I had been to 8 other colleges and universities. I changed from one to another every semester because something was so clearly lacking everywhere I went and I was beginning to despair that I would ever find studies that were really meaningful to my life. 

When I came to MIU, I knew I had found what I was looking for. My parents, who had stopped funding my education after the second time I dropped out, saw that I was serious and resumed paying for everything. They were as happy as I was about me going to MIU. My Mom was really impressed when she visited.

I not only had a great educational experience and found direction in my life, but I gained so many new friends from all over the world who have become like family to me. People are so open, and I easily made friends with many of the faculty as well as other students. It was wonderful to be with people who shared my values and who were supportive of each other instead of trying to tear each other down."
Alum,5,"Fantastic diverse community of students, faculty, and townspeople. The curriculum makes learning easy and there's a surprisingly rich spectrum of activities for everyone."
Alum,5,"I did not need online learning when I attended the school, but this survey requires me to fill this space with 100 characters."
Alum,5,"I was part of the class that moved from California to Iowa back in the 70's.  It was an exciting time and a great adventure.  Many logistics and services were being worked out over the first year or so, but overall the transition was smooth as I recall.  The learning experience, coupled with meditation was excellent."
Alum,5,There was no online learning happening while I was attending MIU back in the 1970s.  I have no experience with the topic.
Alum,5,"After graduating from a large public university, I loved MIU's small, personalized graduate classes with professors who were expert in their fields."
Alum,5,"I did not do online learning, so I cannot rate it, but I do not want to skew your results by giving it a zero"
Alum,5,"Best time of my life- so special, so unforgettable. Unique approach to education with full focus on Self development!"
Alum,5,Though I did not take any online classes(not offered back then) later on I took many online courses and they were very satisfactory on all levels: knowledge presented and technically
Alum,5,I had a wonderful experience at MIU. Having such small classes allowed for really interesting discussions and personalized instruction.
Alum,5,"I graduated in 2006, so didn' t ever learn online. It was a great experience, taking classes in person ;) I hear they've adapted well to online learning though."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 1978.  My life and my careers all stemmed and grew and originated from my attending MIU...and continue to do so.  Jai Guru Dev.  I state the last phrase because I would emphatically state that MIU came from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Maharishi came from Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, Shankaracharya of the North.  The last time I was at MIU, I got the indication and information that for some weird reason, our origins and sources were being minimized.  Such is a real and practical injustice.  Guess what happens when you cut off the tree from its roots........................"
Alum,5,I liked everything about Maharishi International University. I especially liked practicing the Transcendental Meditation program and its advanced programs. They really made a difference. The school is focused on learning and knowledge rather than having a good time. Very important that others are exposed to this program.
Senior,5,"When I attended  in 1975 to 1979, we didn't use on-line programs to complete our education.  My experience was wonderful, and not only changed my life, but actually saved my life."
Alum,5,"Attending MIU were some of the best years of my life! I loved the camaraderie of like minded people, who were kind and fun to be with. I have always loved being a student, but being a student at MIU was at a whole other level--integrated with Transcendental Meditation, critical thinking and the feeling that we were and would make a real difference in the world. Before attending MIU I was on staff right when the campus was opening. I had never experienced the instant bonding and acceptance with a wonderful group of people as we opened up and cleaned out buildings, etc., getting ready for the students to arrive. I stayed on staff and then used credit to go to Teacher Training, and then returned to become a student. I graduated as valedictorian. I also met my husband there, married now for 40 years! We have 3 children who all went to Maharishi School and 2 of them graduated from MIU also! Since graduating, I have lived and worked in Fairfield."
Alum,5,"My four years at MIU were the best years of my life, lifting me to a new level of experience and understanding. The focus on developing the student’s consciousness and then relating all knowledge of all disciplines back to consciousness is unprecedented in education today. Every student should be able to benefit from such a complete education. It would be a different world."
Alum,5,It was an ideal learning experience and ideal living environment and  wonderful daily routine. I would recommend this University to anyone who is looking to improve their life.
Niche User,5,I did thoroughly enjoy taking one course at a time and being able to teach what we were learning through interaction and developing presentations to the class.  It was ideal learning for me and helped me become a teacher and professor.
Niche User,5,I never took online courses at Maharishi International University (formerly Maharishi University of Management when I went there).
Alum,5,"Holistic integrated interdisciplinary approach to learning was essential for me to expand my awareness regardless of the subject.   Dynamic passionate professors, small class side and everyone practicing the Transcendental Meditation technique made understanding of any subject area a breeze."
Alum,5,Was a student when Apple was still working out of a garage.    Had brain waves taken while meditating.   Expand the container of knowledge to be able to absorb and integrate.
Alum,5,I only took a few non credit  on line courses but they all were extremely lively and interesting. The professors really put their best presentations on line.
Alum,5,"I was extremely  happy the whole time I was at MIU and the experience prepared me perfectly for my present profession.
Having a University that actually cares deeply about the holistic growth of every student while providing the means to attain this growth, The TM Program,  is such a blessing .
I strongly recommend that everyone, young and old experience this educational  system and enjoy a lifetime of fulfillment."
Alum,5,"I worked for the university from 1980 to 1999 with a break in 1990/91 to earn a MA in Art. As an administrator and as a student, l loved being in a vibrant community of meditators and having access to group program in the dome."
Alum,5,"I felt there was a tremendous rapport between all the students at MIU.  It is a mutually supportive environment, where people want their classmates to succeed and achieve their best.  The work produced by student teams is often breath-taking in its scope and depth.  There is also a close and supportive relationship between students and faculty.  Faculty are not distant.  They are helpful, wanting each individual to display their unique gifts and shine as a unique person."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online.  However, from what I have heard from other students, the online learning environment is excellent, the result of many years of experience with what works and what doesn't in online teaching and learning."
Alum,5,"The faculty are committed to each student's success and go out if their way support you.
You meet a wild array of students that expands your understanding of the world, and they become lifelong friends."
Alum,5,I was not involved in any online learning. I did take an in-person class in web design and that was a wonderful course.
Alum,5,"The people here are very intelligent and very kind to each other. The atmosphere is stimulating but soft. The block system is much less stressful than juggling many courses at once. The faculty are not just experts in their field, they are very calm, balanced and reasonable, as well as entertaining. The students are from a wide variety of backgrounds which are all valued and respected. It makes for a relaxing and exciting overall experience. The focus on development of consciousness in its own right as a fundamental way to unfold your potential as an individual makes this place unique. Everyone here is always growing and changing, and the underlying sense of stability makes it safe and comfortable to do that. There is a high level of creativity and responsibility here. It's not a party school, but I found it to be a lot of fun."
Alum,5,"MIU was the huge foundation stone for my life.   After getting my MA, I felt like my intellect had been finely tuned, and my consciousness had been expanded, so I could live a fulfilling and progressive life to it's fullest."
Graduate Student,5,"Due to covid restrictions, several of my classes were switched to online via zoom or Microsoft teams. The professors reworked the curriculum to allow for hybrid learning. It worked without a hitch. I feel very safe being on campus and appreciate the covid precautions MIU has put in place. So far, so good!"
Graduate Student,5,"There are so many terrific things I love about being a student here, but one of the best is the block system - one class, in-depth for a month, then finished and on to the next in-depth class for a month, and so on. No struggling to juggle four classes at once over a semester, no homework in several subjects each night, no cramming for multiple finals. I find the one-class-per-month in-depth approach also allows for better retention and deeper exploration of a topic. MIU is one of the best decisions of my life."
Alum,5,"My master's program in professional writing was very high quality, and there was lots of personal attention. Basically, about ten students who were serious about writing spent 18 month together exploring different genres. The block system allowed us to focus intensively on one genre each month. I feel I came away a far superior writer than when I began the program. Most of the professors were professionals in their areas, not just academics. My concentration in non-fiction book writing gave me the confidence to write several books since I graduated. Not only did I learn a lot, I also had a great time."
Alum,5,"I recently took some online classes and was pleasantly rewarded. The professors used the technical opportunities of online learning to present their knowledge clearly, graphically illustrate their main points creatively, and interact with their online audience dynamically."
Alum,5,"Maharishi International University provided me an effective, well-balanced, and consciousness-based education in a friendly atmosphere of focused learning and comprehensive personal development. With outstanding academic attainments, remarkable faculty accomplishments, and impressive alumni achievements, MIU offered a well-rounded, fully accredited instruction in a variety of disciplines and unprecedented opportunities to develop human potential. At MIU I obtained an excellent education while enjoying in-depth personal growth."
Alum,5,"One of the best times of my life! Brilliant faculty, fascinating courses, lively atmosphere of interest in personal growth, great social life. The best feature of MIU was the element of consciousness and the awakening of consciousness in my own life and in the atmosphere on the campus. I don't think there is a better university anywhere in the world. In addition to being an all around fantastic experience, MIU provided me with the tools to be successful and to be fulfilled.  Can't recommend MIU highly enough!"
Alum,5,"I only took one course online recently and it was a great experience. Well organized, creative. and interactive."
Alum,5,I studied as a mature graduate student and found the professors very helpful with my research. I enjoyed the relationship with with the study and experience of consciousness.
Alum,5,I found that access to the wider internet information and communication with my professors was very very organised. My communication channels when I was overseas remained open. The availability of video library was very useful for me.
Alum,5,MIU was the best university I had ever attended. It taught me principles of my discipline besides details and how to go deep into any knowledge I put my attention on. I would like to see them make the pricing more competitive and allow alumni free classes as my other private college had done.
Graduate Student,5,I have enrolled in MUM online non-credit courses.  Enjoyed the courses.  Great online interaction and support.
Graduate Student,5,"It's the consciousness-based education that is not available anywhere else that attracted me.  Learning is more than just book learning, there is another component to it.   Objective knowledge can only be understood from a more expanded level of awareness.  Knowledge is structured in consciousness."
Alum,5,Distance education courses have been consistently engaging for degree seeking or continuing education students.
Alum,5,"Challenging academics, faculty best in their fields; a supportive and collaborative atmosphere that's life transforming for the better."
Alum,5,Didn't take online courses. There weren't any online courses when I was a student years ago. (This question required a rating.)
Alum,5,"Someone asked me recently whether, given my experiences in a major 4-year public university and MIU, I would choose to go to MIU again. The answer is: absolutely. The block system of taking one course at a time combined with meditation practice that allows for a much deeper exploration of a subject in an environment that is designed for stress free learning process. I don't know of any college where an instructor would be more concerned about students getting enough sleep than having to read 300 pages overnight."
Alum,5,"My MIU education gave me a great foundation for a career in communication/graphic design. I studied fine art at MIU and graduated with a BFA in graphic design in 1984. There was also an excellent writing program that  supplemented all the classes so while I was taking a physics course, for example, I was also learning writing skills. This has served me very well in many professional roles. On a personal level, the ""consciousness based"" aspect of MIU's educational system gave me a lifelong tool for self care, self-confidence, autonomy and yet a sense of global citizenship. 
I see that this survey asks me to rate MIU's ""party scene"". MIU is NOT a party school so if someone's looking for that, look elsewhere. It's rare for someone to drink/take drugs because students are there to improve themselves, not to wreck their brains. I'll rate MIU ""poor"" in the party scene category because of the connotations but we had really fun dances, talent shows and festivals w/o substance abuse"
Alum,5,"I have taken a few of MIU's online continuing education courses and have enjoyed them very much. Some are easily applicable to new TM meditators or new MIU students, such as the Maharishi Yoga Asana course, which is outstanding. There are also great courses for more advanced TM meditators. The course entitled, “Maharishi’s Early Years of Teaching, 1954-1964” should be a pre-requisite for anyone who wants to become a teacher of the Transcendental Meditation technique. And actually it would be a great course for anyone who’d like to know about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder and namesake of MIU."
Works Here,5,"Teaching online in the Masters in Maharishi AyurVeda and Integrative Medicine enables us to reach hundreds of students and health professionals from around the world, training them to become competent practitioners."
Works Here,5,"Very fulfilling to work with an organization that cares about its faculty, staff and students, and actually implements programs to ensure health, happiness, and inner development."
Sophomore,4,"I'm not a huge fan of Zoom learning, but the professors are trying their hardest to simulate learning in a classroom. I'm still getting my work done at least."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience has been decent. The professors have done a great job at reorganizing their classes in a way that is still engaging and helpful to the students. Personally, I've had to arrange my life in a way where I am getting outside exposure regularly since class is taking place in dorms a lot."
Sophomore,4,"MIU is a wonderful environment not just for those who are looking to pursue higher education, but those that are looking to pursue personal growth of consciousness and a healthier lifestyle. Learning TM has been beneficial for my personal and spiritual growth, and I appreciate being able to learn and build better habits that will optimize my life in the long run. Things have drastically changed this year due to COVID, however the University has done a very good job at mitigating the effects of the pandemic."
Alum,4,have not taken online courses but was not able to submit the survey without answering this question.
Alum,4,"I have only taken adult education courses, which need a little work to get some bugs out. Specifically very few of the questions were answered by the teachers."
Alum,4,"I only went to MIU for the personal development aspect, of which it stands alone in the educational field.
I left out one star due to the business dept giving a Schell best business student of the year scholarship to the second best student of the year. 
I had the highest GPA but they said because I was doing my next year in computer science I was disqualified !
How many people wouldn't switch to business forth year if it was free???"
Graduate Student,4,The community of seekers sharing the same path to spiritual growth is something I will always cherish.   Integrating Maharishi's SCI with every core course for first-year students provided a unified learning approach that very few universities can offer.
Alum,4,"A unique school with a unique goal: enrich students' lives, and learn with less stress. The academics at the school are not rigorous, but lessons are taught with the bigger picture in mind -- How does this particular class or subject relate to ourselves, to society, to the world? This fundamentally changes how students think and grow, both in school and beyond, and it's infinitely more valuable than any specific skill or course. Fellow students are engaged and open, and professors are personable, curious, and knowledgeable. It's a great experience geared towards people who seek something more from their university experince than just a degree."
Alum,4,"I have not done any online learning with MIU, so I cannot really rate it, but I assume it would be very good or perhaps even excellent."
Alum,4,"I didn’t have a chance to experience MIU’s online learning.  When I was a student at MIU, the internet just started, but I believe that MIU will provide the best online courses possible."
Sophomore,4,"I love it at Maharishi University. I am just an online student, so I can't say how things are on campus. But I love their consciousness-based education approach to learning and the structure of their online program."
Alum,4,"Having a university that sincerely puts the development of their students in an individual sense is outstanding and exceptional. I was able to take advantage of how well facilitated this is and it paid off many times over what I paid for my attendance here. I would like to see the development of the Sustainable Living department, the school become more self-sufficient in a general sense, and a more clear adherence to academic standards in order for this school to really reach it's potential."
Senior,4,"I love that I could come to a school with everything set up for the lifestyle I want to live. Meditating daily, focusing on one class at a time, and eating organic vegetarian food are all reasons why I chose this university. I also came for the special Sustainable Living program, which allowed me to learn about growing food naturally, building, renewable energy, business, and policy while still balancing my inward self work."
College Junior,4,very simple and easy and advisor makes it easier
College Junior,4,It is pretty safe around campus
College Junior,4,This is the best school I have ever been to
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have not heard about any sexual assaults since I've been going to school there, but I'm sure there would be ample response in trying to help the victim."
College Senior,4,"Very strict no drug or alcohol policy.  School safety helpful and vigilant, town police nice.  No men in girls dorms, there are some dorms where co-ed is okay but not overnight.  All school funded activities alcohol and drug free."
College Senior,4,"Lots of activities for students and locals.  Open mike nights every week, fairs, car shows, art walks, plays and dances, music nights.  Availability for new shows and events."
College Senior,4,Vegetarian campus and all organic food.  Variety everyday with some good staples like salad bar.  Food hot and good.
Alum,2,"I don't recommend this school. If you want enlightenment, spend a year in India and save yourself $100K. Many professors don't even have experience in their field; they're just assigned a subject. Extremely dogmatic, draconian and despite insisting otherwise, it's a religious school. You're expected to worship Maharishi, and must subscribe to his belief system, or you will be penalized. Having this school on my resume has hurt my job hunting, since many employers think it's weird, or not a ""real"" college. Plus, how can they have decent professors or administrators, when they pay $12,000 a year. That's slave labor, especially given the tuition.  It's a strange place."
Recent Alumnus,2,"On campus there is a cafe (limited hours), and the cafeteria (very limited hours). The food is organic, but it's hardly cooked in a pleasing manner."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Fairfield is a tiny town in the middle of Iowa, there's not much to do."
Recent Alumnus,2,Most of the buildings are extremely old and not kept up well.
College Junior,2,"M.U.M. tends to not be completely upfront about certain issues. They are heavily influenced by the Transcendental Meditation movement and try to incorporate too much of that in all their curriculum. 

Being a pre-med major it is hard to follow how to apply Vedic Science with certain subjects.  Although it's very interesting to have that influence with some things, it can't be applied to everything. 

The community here also reveres a guru (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi) and it is hard to get by sometimes, especially if they claim it's not a religious facility.  There is a lot of pushing of their views and ideals on new students to kind of re-program their thinking.  A lot of required classes tend to upset the students because they are heavily induced with Maharishi's philosophies.  

I am trying to transfer out because I want to go to a school that doesn't pressure the student into their philosophy.  It's nice for those who want to follow this lifestyle.  I appreciate it but I came here to get an education not become some enlightened master.  It's a mixed bag. You can really get a lot out of this place if you want but if you are trying to do some kind of prepatory program id advise sticking with a traditional school."
Recent Alumnus,2,The athletics at MUM are not mainstream. MUM is a small school with clubs and if someone wants to start a small athletic club they certainly can!
Alum,1,"Haven’t done online.

Alum,1,I haven't taken part in online courses.I haven't taken part in online courses.I haven't taken part in online courses.I haven't taken part in online courses.I haven't taken part in online courses.
Graduate Student,1,Not applicable...I was a grad student before online learning was even a definable term...1975.  I have spoke to more recent graduates who say that their online learning experience was most satisfactory.
Alum,1,It's an awful place. Student's learn nothing and no one has a life. Very dogmatic and oppressive administration. Lot's of discrimination. The town is very depressing too.
Niche User,1,"The level of digital media education is poor. The campus is very tiny 300-500 students. Extremely old dormitories, yet the yearly tuition fees are extremely high, $30,000+ for on campus. The teachers are only paid $12,000 a year.  I don't recommend this university."
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have a greek life and I doubt we ever will
College Junior,1,They have some international students. Maybe 5 gay people and mostly white people.  There is no gay life here. It's depressing
College Junior,1,"There is no nightlife here. There are a couple of bars that have a lot of the locals hang out.  A lot of the locals are scary and white trash.  There is a huge meth community in Iowa. There are NO clubs, no gay clubs no nice places to really go and have a beer without a bloody bar fight breaking out.  It's disgusting.  Being a gay male here is very hard and you will basically be single and celibate unwillingly."
College Junior,1,There are some really interesting hippy types here but most people don't care about you and they are pretty narcissistic.

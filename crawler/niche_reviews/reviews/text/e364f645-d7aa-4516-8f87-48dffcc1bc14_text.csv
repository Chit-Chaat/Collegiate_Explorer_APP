Sophomore,5,"I feel really at home on Oberlin's campus and in this environment. It's a place where I feel empowered to explore myself. The people keep me coming back at the end of the day. While the college itself is imperfect and there are things I wish I could change, my friends, community, and professors have made every hardship absolutely worth it time and time again."
Senior,5,"I'm so thankful that I have gotten to go to Oberlin these last four years. I have been able to do so much, meet so many amazing people, and have an all-around transformative experience for my time at college. The campus is this perfect size where you can easily get around everywhere by walking and you'll always see someone you want to stop and catch up with. There are many organizations and clubs that you can become a part of which is where I have picked up new skills I never expected to have had and made new friends with who I know I'll have lifelong relationships.

The campus has a collaborative learning environment where I have had made great memories working with classmates on various projects for class. There are lots of events and assistance provided by the college which have helped me streamline what I want to do as a career while also giving me the skills to do it well.

I strongly recommend you to come to campus to see for yourself, because I didn't want to leave afterward."
Senior,5,"While I wish I was back on campus for my senior year, I have found that professors are extremely accommodating with everything and have made my online learning as least stressful as possible. I was able to take all the classes I needed to graduate on time and I'm grateful for the hard work that has gone into making sure online classes work well."
Alum,5,"I didn't take classes online at Oberlin. My classes either took place in classrooms or sometimes at the homes of professors. One of the nicest things about Oberlin was the intimacy of classes, especially at the 200 and 300 levels."
Alum,5,"Oberlin still stands as the most transformative educational experience of my life. I found the professors to be deeply engaged with their scholarship and their students. Classmates were bright, curious and concerned with social justice issues. I was a science major (Neuroscience, pre-med) and an English major with an interest in music and found the academic and cultural offerings excellent."
Niche User,5,Absolutely amazing. Provides wonderful experiences to students and gives opportunities to learn at every moment.
Alum,5,Great school! I wouldn't have changed my experience at Oberlin for anything! I learned a ton and wouldn't be where I am in my career today without it.
Freshman,5,perfect place for study as professors are helpful and students are generally curious about everything. Love the environmental studies building and art museum. A lot of concerts every year. The location is ok and it may be a problem if like public transit.
Alum,5,I had a great experience at Oberlin. The academics were very challenging but in a productive way. Professors really cared about their students and were invested in their success.
Sophomore,5,"Oberlin creates a lot of opportunities for its students and does its best to work with students to create the higher education that they want to see. While imperfect, I am incredibly grateful for my experiences and education here and feel confident that I will graduate prepared to set myself up for a successful and happy life. As a generalization, Oberlin culture and academics provide many personal and professional challenges that promote growth in students while offering the support necessary to the process. I have enjoyed my time here and have met many lovely friends, professors, and staff members along the way."
Freshman,5,"I am incredibly glad that I chose Oberlin. It's a place that I think any person enthusiastic about learning and questioning the standards of society can find their place. The academics are challenging and will force you to test your morals, and many classes are demanding as far as workload and participation are concerned. I think the fact that Oberlin is so academically focused is why it's such a great place to go to college; I'm a firm believer in a rigorous liberal arts education, and Oberlin delivers. Many of my classes are interdisciplinary to an unparalleled extent of other colleges. I think the other thing so special about Oberlin is our sense of community. Every student at Oberlin, no matter the part of campus they live on, if they are in the College or Conservatory, or if they play sports, are always treated kindly and as equals."
Senior,5,"What drew me to Oberlin was how it prioritized cooperation over competition. I’ve found that while students can be very intense and passionate, sometimes to the point of being toxic, many of them are incredible people who want to help each other grow.

I think one of Oberlin’s best and most underrated qualities is student activities. We have a circus, a burlesque club, lots of intramural sports, a growing comedy scene, advocacy groups, a drag ball, and endless opportunities for theatre and music. Most of the time, you can find a way into an activity coming from any level of expertise.

Your experience at Oberlin is generally what you make of it. A lot of people make the mistake of overloading their schedule (very easy to do around here), and become very stressed. The academics can also become overwhelmingly difficult if you’re not careful to balance your schedule. But in my mind, even the difficulties have been worth it."
Alum,5,"Oberlin College is a great school, located in a fun Ohio town.  I was a college student with many conservatory friends. I loved the music and learning environment. The liberal views on campus challenged my own views; it didn't change my views but it allowed me to think differently and explore."
Niche User,5,Loved the diversity of the campus. Small and intimate exactly what  I need. Everything within walking distance and the music department was extraordinary. Enjoyed my visit.
Freshman,5,"A beautiful campus filled with many different types of people. Students are all very passionate and the professors really engage. All my classes are interesting and my overall college learning experience is amazing. The campus has a very historical history, which is fascinating. The food here is mainly local and vegetarian/vegan, and very tasty. There is also a lot of emphasis on environmental sustainability."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy Oberlin and all it has to offer. Academics are outstanding. Classes are interesting and challenging, the professors are brilliant and accessible. Both semesters I got the classes I wanted, though sometimes your have to sit in for a first few days before getting in. (Common at liberal arts schools.) 

Oberlin is a great size, small enough to feel like a community but large enough to keep meeting new people. Students are friendly. Some are quirky, athletic, political, or musical, but they are a great mix and you may be surprised at the friendships you make. There is always something to do on campus, and it is easy to get to Cleveland if you miss urban life. 

Athletics continue to improve, with several conference championships. Conservatory concerts are popular. The dining hall food is average, but if you like to cook or have dietary restrictions, you should consider joining a fun and delicious dining co-op."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Oberlin in the 1990s, and later went in academics and am now a university professor in the UK.  I will give Oberlin the highest praise that I possibly can--even in the hindsight of wide experience, I would not have chosen any other university or college in the world over Oberlin.  To this day, it is the place that I found the most fascinating, the most filled with interesting and unique people (faculty and students alike), and where I found the highest level of commitment to knowledge.  There is no doubt in my mind that the success I've enjoyed (e.g. a Fulbright fellowship and a tenured post at a major research university) is largely attributable to the superlative education I received at Oberlin.  All in all, not only did I spend four of the best years of my life at Oberlin, but in my professional opinion, it's one of the best places in the world to go for your undergraduate degree."
Freshman,5,Academics are amazing! The professors really care about the students. The administration does too. Everyone on campus is supportive and wants each other to succeed. Oberlin will open doors all over the world for anyone who attends.
Freshman,5,"friendly and open-minded people that are dedicated to helping you learn, and students that genuinely want to learn. the campus is beautiful but dorms are just okay. the meal plan is a rip-off for freshman and sophomores."
Alum,5,I'm a graduate from the Class of 1952.  Basically Oberlin taught me how to think and how to organize.  Skills that I used in graduate school and my entire professional life.
Junior,5,"As a current student-athlete, Oberlin offers a plethora of classes with the ability to concentrate your interest in a very specific area of interest. There are no TA's, professors are helpful and lead all the labs, diversity is outstanding, Music Conservatory offers daily concerts/recitals/performances, approx 3,000 students,  double majors and and dual degrees are frequent occurrences, and the sports programs are rising."
Alum,5,"Oberlin was a fantastic experience - such smart students and professors, such intellectual excitement -- and great music!"
Junior,5,"The academics are excellent.  The professors are always there to answer questions and help.  The classes are very small.  Even the lecture classes are small, never more then 140.  The campus is lovely, small intimate and 1950s-ish.  The food is better then most.  The dorms are the dorms.  All in all it's a wonderful place to spend 4 years."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Oberlin. I was worried about fitting in as a women of color, but there's so many different kinds of people. I'm extremely happy with my choice"
College Sophomore,5,"Wonderful variety of courses, generally enthusiastic teachers, small class sizes."
College Junior,5,The people involved are all in
College Junior,5,It's a place where you can really find yourself
College Freshman,5,Never before have I been in a place where individualism and self expression are so thoroughly cherished and celebrated.
College Junior,5,"Honestly, the Academics are the part of Oberlin I have no qualms about. I'm not a straight A student by any means, but I enjoy every class I've ever taken at Oberlin and my professors are always competent and nice. The registration process gets easier every year, as does the workload. One thing I wish I had learned sooner was that there's an Office of Disability Services available to those with learning disabilities/any issue that might get in the way of academics. The Office has helped me so much, and has really kept me on the right track."
College Junior,5,I think this is one of the safest campuses due to the attitude of students here about consent. Consent is viewed as really important here and students and faculty do everything they can to make sure people feel safe here.
College Sophomore,5,Great college with an eclectic group of students with progressive ideas and socially active.
College Senior,5,"As far as a music performance degree, it's one of the best."
College Freshman,5,"No real safety issues, it's a small town. Hospital right off campus and police/ safety & security are never more than 5 minutes away"
College Freshman,5,"Classes are often hard to get in to, but professors are intelligent and passionate."
College Freshman,5,"The overwhelming majority of professors are so passionate, quirky, and intelligent! A lot of classes let this passion bleed through and are so enjoyable and rewarding to take. There are many classes here that will rock your world! And the workload is manageable as long as you don't obsessively procrastinate."
College Freshman,5,"Even though many students graduate in majors that are unconventional or ""unmarketable"" they still seem to almost always find amazing things to do after graduation through the sorcery of the career services."
College Freshman,5,We don't have greek life but we don't want it anyway.
College Freshman,5,"Testosterone obsessed machismo athlete culture is not what you'll find at Oberlin. Instead you'll find quirky, sensible students who happen to play sports. They are also sometimes not very good at those sports but that only seems to underscore the fact that tossing around the old pigskin isn't the meaning of life for conscientious Obies."
College Freshman,5,"Oberlin is a very, very special place. Arbitrary rankings are fun and all but if you really want to find yourself completely immersed in a fascinating, artsy, weird little world that will change your life forever, I'd recommend Oberlin."
College Sophomore,5,v safe v secure v v v v v v v !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
College Sophomore,5,Just having an Oberlin degree basically guarantees me good jobs and opportunities post-graduation.
College Sophomore,5,I really loved Oberlin and I feel it has afforded me many opportunities an experiences that I would not have otherwise gotten.
College Freshman,5,"I love my dorm, it's a great community. There are a lot of bathroom options, which is very convenient."
College Junior,5,The professors are amazing! They are very willing to help.
College Junior,5,There are a lot of alumni that ate very willing to help and offer internships
College Senior,5,"Being a small college town in the middle of cornfields, safety is not really an issue in Oberlin. Campus crime does occur from time to time, but it's usually something not particularly serious, and the campus police does a good job in alerting students through postings on campus buildings. Female students report feeling really safe walking around campus and town at night. There are options for students who would prefer not to: RideLine and safety escorts. Students are quite trustworthy, and I have never had any safety concerns in Oberlin."
College Senior,5,"Oberlin is primarily comprised of upper-middle class whites from the New England area. That said, the campus is attempting to be more racially and economically diverse, through scholarship programs focused on encouraging minorities and students from working class families to attend. Oberlin students are some of the friendliest. Although there are some microaggressions that occur on campus, any outright acts of discrimination are not tolerated and are shut down pretty quickly by the student body. Students in the LGBT community feel quite accepted here, as there are many activities on campus that raise awareness and encourage dialogue. The only thing that is a little intolerant is the fact that conservative/Christian opinions are not really welcome here. If you are Republican/conservative, you might want to pick another school."
College Sophomore,5,"Having not looked into Oberlin beyond the front page of the website and having never seen the campus, I'm still not sure how I ended up there.  It was a very last minute decision that I caused a giant ant hill of stress and aggravation, as soon as I got used to the idea another worry would suddenly pop out of the blue.  Thank goodness I think the ants have finally moved out and now I know that I couldn't have ended up anywhere better.  There are simply too many opportunities to take advantage of at Oberlin, something which drives me crazy to no end.  Why should I have to choose between joining the circus, the equestrian team, the fencing team, going to talks with incredible professors who have such intriguing research and still have to find time for quidditch practice? Even without a full schedule of fun, albeit downright impossible classes it would be hard to try everything that Oberlin has to offer.  Somehow though, everyone does.  I might have a friend who knows a professor who recommended a lecture being given by his or her friend from another school.  My teammate might be involved in entirely different activities from myself and that gives me a window into their world and a totally different Oberlin experience.  There are no boundaries for Obies other than the ones we might have to create merely to ensure that we do actually sleep sometimes or even to maintain our own sanity.  Everyone can be involved in everything and therefore everyone comes away with a different patchwork of Oberlin culture.  I can say with certainty that what I take away from Oberlin when the time comes, will be in its entirety completely unique from anyone else who walks across the stage that day.  It is this understanding of differences which makes Oberlin students and alumni such a supportive community."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a lot of stuff to do on the weekends and weekdays, most of it revolves around the music scene"
College Freshman,5,I love Oberlin. I'm currently still undeclared.
College Freshman,5,I have always felt safe on campus. Even walking across campus when I'm going back to my dorm at 3am.
College Freshman,5,I always feel very safe and the town of Oberlin is small but it's practically part of the campus. It's great!
College Freshman,5,I like my schools social life. It's very inclusive.
College Freshman,5,The alumni network is great. Our winter term internship period is fantastic. As a freshman I'm not sure what the recruitment is like but a huge percentage of Oberlin grads. go to grad schools.
College Freshman,5,"If you're a hipster who likes music and social justice, this is the place for you. Honestly couldn't be happier here."
College Senior,5,"Many professors are excited about what they're teaching and are happy to be teaching in general. Courses are generally small and personal, and though the work can be demanding you can learn a lot."
College Junior,5,"Academics at Oberlin are hard, but most of the professors are wonderful and truly invested in their students. There is no curriculum, and students can basically take whatever they want. The workload is a lot, but since you get to choose everything you take, a lot of students are really invested and enjoy the work they are doing so it isn't a big deal."
College Junior,5,Geology is an awesome major. The faculty is so invested and enjoy what they're doing. A perk of being a geology major is the number of field trips and hands on activities.
College Junior,5,I love being a geology major. The faculty is so welcoming. Geology classes are often fun because there are a lot of opportunity for field trips. There's also research available and plenty of internships.
College Freshman,5,"Since I am in the conservatory, I had the standard audition process. It was a smooth and easy process. Everyone was very helpful and friendly and able to answer most of the questions I had."
Sophomore,4,"It greatly depends on the professor. Many of mine have been extremely patient with us as we navigate the online shift, but some have been annoying at best–– asking us to keep our videos on despite clear discomfort, maintaining the same workload. My general experience has been positive, though, since most profs are understanding and have a sense of how to use Zoom."
Alum,4,"I liked the rigor of the academics there, the diversity in the types of programming for students to engage with within their dorms and within student organizations. There are always opportunities for students to work and engage with the student body community."
Niche User,4,"I have never taken a full course online, so I cannot tell you about that. However, courses that worked in conjunction with technology were often very good."
Junior,4,"The professors and student body are incredible. The Oberlin community and academics have been the best part of my college experience. The campus is beautiful. My only complaint would be the administrations failure at times to listen to the input of the student body. However, the community makes up for this inconvenience, and there is always music everywhere."
Junior,4,"I had a decent online learning experience at Oberlin College this past semester. This was largely because I happened to be taking classes that translated well to online learning. Some of my friends who were not taking so many lecture classes did not enjoy the experience as much as I did. In my case, my professors really put the effort in to make the classes as engaging as possible."
Junior,4,"Oberlin College offers an excellent liberal arts education, whether a student attends for mathematics, creative writing, or the conservatory. Many students here work incredibly hard and contribute to an intensely academic and moralistic social atmosphere, of which an extremely high-performance faculty is also a factor. Many Obies hold their opinions with conviction and are well-equipped to advocate for themselves both inside and outside classroom settings, so come with a strong sense of self-worth. Obies are also characteristically open minded, and closely monitor spaces for equitability. One of the best ways to make connections here is to involve yourself intensely in several interests and support your peers."
Freshman,4,"Oberlin College has been amazing so far. All the professors I met have been passionate about their classes--some of them going out of their way to help every individual students. Other than professors there are amazing resources (writing center, career development center, etc) so whenever I have any difficulty I would have plenty of resources to choose from.

Classes are small so far except for my economic and computer science intro classes--but I get sufficient help nevertheless. Obies are also pretty amazing. I already have some close friends despite being a somewhat shy international first-year student (now rising second-year!). The overall atmosphere of Oberlin is friendly and open. It's a small campus, and everyone is nice so far! 

In this COVID19 pandemic, Oberlin really showed its capacities. It's one of the fatest colleges to switch to online courses and its professors adapt to the situation very quickly. They are also providing support for students!"
Freshman,4,"As a first year student, I've so far had great experiences with classes and peers. The administration is currently dealing with a lot of finance-related problems and it impacts student life sometimes. But it's a very good fit for me personally as a queer, Jewish student who wants to engage with those identities and the politics surrounding them,"
Niche User,4,"In my time visiting Oberlin College before learning that I was accepted through early decision, I loved it. The academics are great, the location is beautiful, and everyone is very welcoming."
Freshman,4,"Oberlin is truly a home away from home for me. The knowledge I have gained through my classes, my extracurriculars, and my general experiences has allowed me to grow as a person and develop my best self yet."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the community I found both in the college and the town of Oberlin. Diversity needs work, and accommodation for students of color requires deep listening and change."
Freshman,4,"Oberlin College met my expectations in the academic sense, for I find it challenging and have had very positive experiences with the professors that work here. However, there are many downsides I have come to realize with attending such a small isolated school. Many academic and otherwise interests are not represented here and the location can make for some frustration for people used to a much more fast paced lifestyle."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I like Oberlin a lot. The social scene can be difficult sometimes, but as long as you put yourself out there, you will succeed. Also, professors really want you to succeed, and will take the time to help you."
Alum,4,"Very unique college experience, academically challenge, and the place you go to learn who you truly are. You will meet the most unique and genuinely lovely people there. And even though it's in the middle of nowhere, if there's something you want to do, the school will find a way to help you do  it. But, it;s not for everybody."
Freshman,4,"It's gone pretty well so far. Oberlin is a complicated place with a lot of politics underlining the community. I love the academics here but socially I feel that Oberlin is difficult in a number of ways. In the context of being a POC, the community is small so it can feel difficult to really have some distance from others when needed. I will say that overall most people are well meaning though usually people are very self serving/ selfish though not in a mean way. This something that can be understood when spending time on campus. The campus is alright, it's pretty flat. The winters are typically harsh though this year was very lax. Even though I've said many things that are negative, I love Oberlin because the people here are very smart and are willing to engage about almost anything."
Freshman,4,Diverse living options that include menu and dining from true vegan to typical American. Relatively diverse student body but reportedly not as diverse as 30 years ago. As known.....political left but accepting of other views. Safe quaint local community. Admin very helpful and attentive in most respects. Third Semester program very well done. National art museum on campus....4 of 5 Profs last semester very approachable. Open door.
Freshman,4,"Great faculties-all my professors are available and are very willing to help every time I asked. The advisor system is eapaecially helpful;  as an international student, I receive a lot of support from the dean of students, who helped me make an important connection with an alum. The career center and writing center are also impressive. This is the best part of this school: as long as you try to get support, you get almost everything you want from the community.

The community is friendly and supportive, but it is very very left. Also the workload is heavy-as a good academic college. I did enjoy my first semester here, but I know indeed there's gonna be much more challenges."
Alum,4,"I was a chemistry major (class of 2016) and I honestly loved the program.  The professors are great and really care about the students.  The school itself is full of people who care and the grounds are beautiful, as long as you don't mind snow and cold in the winter.  The co-ops are great, and better financially, if you find the one that works for you.  Many of them are vegetarian so you need to be aware of which ones are going in or else you might get stuck in one as a meat eater.  The students in co-ops aren't trained to cook, they're trained in safety so your food might be safe but really bland or just bad.  The housing isn't bad, but the process for living off campus is pretty awful, you can only do it as a senior and even then not everyone who wants to is allowed to.  If you want a house instead of a dorm room it ends up being more expensive than it's worth."
College Freshman,4,"Although Oberlin is not known for their athletics, the facilities, equipment, and coaching are great. There's a noticeable gap between athletes and regular students on campus, but at the end of the day the athletes on campus are a true community."
College Sophomore,4,An Oberlin degree in the music field will get you in almost anywhere. Not as much prestige in all of the college fields.
College Sophomore,4,"Crime is very low, and most times I feel safe."
College Sophomore,4,"There are so many unique opportunities at Oberlin that other music schools don't have, like the connection with a college and the vibrant early music community. It has its flaws, of course."
College Junior,4,"The parties people throw are usually really fun to go to with friends. There's always good music playing and generally a fun, happy atmosphere. My favorite parties are Halloween parties because everyone's costumes are always so great. It's great to just, after a long week at school, go out and have fun and be goofy with your friends."
College Junior,4,"Parties are really fun to go to with friends, if you like that sort of thing, and if you don't you can guarantee there are about a million other things you can do."
College Junior,4,"The ""Obie"" Network is really strong, and I feel confident that I can use resources provided to me by that network to find a job after school."
College Junior,4,"I've taken so many great classes here, taught by great professors. When I came in as a first year, I wanted to take Russian, and now, as a third year, I feel like I'm conversationally fluent. I watch Russian films without subtitles, and I owe it all to my fantastic Russian professors. I also feel like I lucked out in all of the science courses I've taken, I've never had a bad science professor here. I've never had a bad professor, period. I always like my professors and TA's and I always feel like I can come to them to ask for help."
College Junior,4,"I've always had good luck with housing. First year, I lived in Noah, an upper class dorm. It was a nice dorm, but I wouldn't recommend that for the first year, since I would have liked to have met/hung out with first years my age. Second year I lived in Burton, which was great, since I knew people there. Burton is also a fantastic building. My third year, I lived in Talcott (a.k.a. Hogwarts), which was a beautiful building, and had great rooms. Housing on campus is usually pretty great."
College Sophomore,4,Some dorm rooms are small but typical from what I have seen at other college or universities.  Would really appreciate a sink/water source in every room.
College Sophomore,4,There is a new mindset that bright smart students can be great athletes as well.  The College is attracting better athletes to go along with the very high achieving student status. All programs seem to be on the upswing. New football stadium to attract better athletes too.
College Junior,4,I actually really love Oberlin.
College Senior,4,"Most professors are pretty good and there are some really cool classes in the Conservatory, but the Historical Performance Department is ridiculously disorganized and doesn't deserve it's international reputation."
College Freshman,4,With a good GPA and the right major you should have no problem getting a good job or getting into a very good med school or law school.
College Freshman,4,"Some of the dorms are pretty nasty, some are brand new & very nice to be in. Same goes for the houses"
College Freshman,4,"classes aren't too hard if you put in the effort, most students are odd, but nice people, staff and professors are helpful and really care about the students."
College Freshman,4,Safe town just lock your bike. Seriously: lock. your. bike.
College Freshman,4,"Scheduling/registration is horrendous 

People and professors are great. Lots of interesting conversation around campus."
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Junior,4,Great school but also difficult classes
College Senior,4,"Oberlin has a great variety of courses offered, given its size. Class sizes are generally very small, with introductory classes being around 40-60 students, and upper-level classes being 7-20 students. Most classes are taught in the traditional lecture style, but a handful are seminars or inquiry-based. Quality of courses is impressive, and most professors are well-versed in their field."
College Senior,4,"Oberlin is in a small town in the middle of cornfields, so it isn't sprawling with bars and nightclubs. However, there are a few good bars in downtown Oberlin, as well as the Sco on campus where students go to party. House parties are quite common as well. There is no public transportation at Oberlin, so students stay in Oberlin for parties (i.e. they don't go to other cities). It's hard for underaged students to obtain alcohol at bars downtown, as they are quite vigilant in spotting fake IDs, but many get their over-21 friends to buy for them."
College Senior,4,"Professors are mostly very well-versed in their field, and classes are very engaging, with professors challenging students. Most professors are caring and willing to help students out during office hours, although a few are less approachable. The registration process works in favor of upperclassmen, with seniors getting first pick of classes, then juniors, etc. Workloads can be heavy for some classes, but are doable if you manage your time wisely. Students have the option to create their own major, and are encouraged to pursue their interests."
College Senior,4,"Although a great school, it can be hard to get a job after graduation, unless you actively seek one out. The career center is helpful in guiding you to the resources you need to find a job, but the onus is on you to be proactive. Well-known employers come to campus to recruit qualified students; students in some departments are more sought after than those in others. Being a small, close-knit community, alums are quite helpful in making connections for current students or recent grads."
College Freshman,4,"The school itself is very community based, and basically everyone is cool and interesting and artistic and it just is such a great environment to be in."
College Senior,4,"The progressive attitudes of the campus, combined with the small class sizes and the friendly, tolerant community, makes Oberlin a very unique institution of higher learning. It is a place where you can be yourself and nobody will judge you unless you are infringing on the rights of others or making an insensitive comment. Classes can be challenging, but are rewarding, and the professors are great. There is never a dearth of activity on this campus, and there is something for everyone. Located in a cozy, small town in the midst of cornfields, Oberlin can become a bit stifling for students seeking for a more fast-paced environment with a vibrant nightlife, but it is far from boring. If you are strongly conservative, this may not be the place for you, as you will definitely be a fish out of water."
College Sophomore,4,I love the people that I've met and am having a wonderful experience learning more about things in which I am interested.
College Junior,4,"I really had to grow into Oberlin.  I wanted to transfer a couple times,  but I stuck it out, and I ended up really liking it.  There are a lot of strong personalities at Oberlin, and the classes are very difficult.  The political climate is very heated and is very much an echo chamber, but it feels good to be immersed in social justice and politics. The people are very friendly.  Overall great. My one gripe is the food. :/"
College Sophomore,4,There is everything but indian food.  Get feve brunch!
College Sophomore,4,You have to be selling lots of drugs that aren't weed to get in any real trouble
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had many experiences with the administration, but overall I think they do a good job of responding to student concerns in a measured way."
College Freshman,4,The food is great here compared to other colleges.
College Freshman,4,So far Oberlin has been great for me. I think it's an amazing school with everything a student could need.
College Freshman,4,"Great restaurants! Lots of variety in style, quality and price."
College Freshman,4,"There's a type for everyone at Oberlin, it's just tough to move around the different social scenes."
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe and cared for on campus.
College Freshman,4,I think the strictness levels at Oberlin are what they should be. In general rules are fair/lenient.
College Freshman,4,I'm a Bio major (possibly an art major as well). The only downside for me is that double majoring isn't easy at all because the major programs are so immersive that you don't have much time for two majors.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not an athlete but I know that there are tons and tons of opportunities out there. There is every level/style of athletics at Oberlin. If you want a school with a huge emphasis on varsity sport culture, Oberlin isn't the best for you, but you'd still be able to find your niche."
College Freshman,4,Lots of options for any person from big parties to small gatherings of friends there is something for everyone. Drinking and drugs are around but it's easy to not participate.
College Freshman,4,"People complain about it but it is what it is. They try to be healthy and organic and local. There seems to be a lot of vegetarian/vegan options. It's generally pretty tasty, if not repetitive."
College Freshman,4,"Although there's not a ton of off-campus dining options, the ones that exist are, for the most part, fairly good. The Feve is not to be missed."
Junior,2,The online experience is not good because of most 'bad' professors. DO NOT EXPECT Oberlin will provide you excellent college education! Oberlin has changed a lot. This school even does not have money to save itself.
Junior,2,"There are some great professors and staff members, but the administration is horrible for the most part. The facilities are falling apart and not worth the high cost to students. The college has stopped listening to the needs and wants of students, supposedly because of the budget issues. Campus culture is nor for the weak of heart. If you're not extremely liberal you likely won't fit in. There is very little diversity of thought"
Sophomore,2,"I am a sophomore and extremely unhappy with my choice. Although I have had good professors and many interesting classes, there is an inescapable and intolerable cool-kid elitism that makes Oberlin feel much, much smaller than it already is. I don't know what the statistics are, but many kids are just straight up rude, childish, concerned with image, and grandiose. I have definitely met some nice people, but there's this strange fake niceness that WAY too many kids here have. It makes me paranoid and confused. I feel like I am at a boarding school in the East. Which, surprise surprise, is where a good amount of kids come from. Oberlin is so rich that the liberalism is almost laughable. That being said, Oberlin has good academics but not very great minds. Mostly just kids who went to good high schools and come from educated families. I have little friends and am very lonely. I'm trying to transfer."
College Sophomore,2,I have lived in co-ops my entire time at Oberlin and the college administration does nothing to help keep our building safe or clean.
College Sophomore,2,Everybody hates varsity athletes and most of them quit by junior year.
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus housing is pretty bad. Not only are there incredibly limited options, the chance of even getting approved for off-campus housing is only available to around less then 3/4 of the senior class. Most people do not even try to get it. In my opinion it is not right that Oberlin forces their students to live on campus and forgo the real world experience they would gain leasing an apartment or house to live in."
College Freshman,2,"Oberlin is basically a village in my mind. A village with an incredibly limited food supply. There are a few decent options for off-campus food and a few pretty bad options. Among the decent are Subway, Agave, Alladins. Then there is Too-Chinoise which is an incredibly over-priced Chinese restaurant with terrible food and Magpies which is a pretty good pizza place with outrageous prices. After a month or two of trying to escape the terrible campus dining service food, the options in town start to get incredibly boring and repetitive. The only restaurants that are actually good in my opinion are The Feve, Mandarin, Lorrenzo's, and Black River Cafe. But even those become really repetitive after a while. Since there is no way to get anywhere outside of the small village unless you know an upperclassmen with a car(they make it incredibly difficult for freshman to have cars), there is no variety or new things to try."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't much of a party scene and what there is I wouldn't really even call partying. There are probably 4-5 houses that sometime throw parties on the weekends and after you have gone once it is just the same thing over and over again. If you are the type of person that wants to just go to a party and let loose after a long week of classes, this is not the place for you. They are all incredibly small and you will know everyone there. The music is generally quite terrible and live bands are a lot harder to find than one would think at a school with a world-class conservatory of music. I was highly disappointed when I explored the party scene here after going to parties at other colleges."
College Freshman,2,"The food is not good quality and the options on campus are incredibly limited. There are three dining halls on campus. However only one of them is open on the weekend and one of them is only open for dinners. There is also a very limited variety of foods at the two smaller dining halls and even the large one. I have been to dining halls at other colleges and ours just do not compare. The only pleasant place to eat is DeCafe which is a sandwhich/grocery store in the basement of the Student Union that makes sandwiches, wraps, and smoothies select times of the day. It is also rather difficult to eat healthy because the salad bars are very limited in their offerings and what they do have is very low quality. On multiple occasions I have ended up with salad or bell peppers that taste strongly of chemicals and are inedible. They also do not allow you to be off the meal plan even if you are one of the lucky few to get approved for off campus housing. You are still required to have and pay for a 7 meals a week plan, which is a whooping $4,000 that could be used to buy healthy and fresh food that you could cook at the place you are living."
College Sophomore,2,"Don't come here for the food, but food shouldn't be your main concern when choosing a college....

the Campus Dining Services food kind of tastes like poison rubber, unless you stick to making yourself salads and yogurt and cereal.

You can join a co-op instead, which is great but also gets repetitive, lots of rice and beans... and you have to work for the co-op which is time consuming but rewarding for lots of people

Eat in town!"
College Junior,2,"There isn't a lot of diversity on campus. Although Oberlin is very aware of ethnic, racial, and sexual diversities, when it comes to different political and religious beliefs students can be rude. Oberlin is a liberal place and students often take that for granted, thinking that all students are Democratic and Atheist like them."
College Freshman,2,"Long story short, if you don't have you're own car, you're basically going to have to walk everywhere. We do have a shuttle that is suppose to run 9PM-2AM but it's student run and not always reliable. Make friends with people that have cars!"
College Freshman,2,It's cold and grey for almost the entire year. Coming from California has been difficult.
College Freshman,2,Its too cold. Its terrifyingly cold.
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of kids work out other than those that were recruited specifically for sports. I play a club sport and I also go to the gym every day; I see the same fifteen or so people there, about half of which are professors."
College Freshman,2,Oberlin has a reputation for being diverse. I'm not really sure why. 
College Freshman,2,"Negative fifteen degrees. This is a thing to seriously consider before you come to Oberlin. If snow depresses you, you will not like Oberlin. Same goes for rain, freezing cold, wind, and getting dark at 4 PM. Expect to wear at least three layers every day. Invest in good boots and long johns."
College Freshman,2,"DO NOT DEPEND ON THE AIRPORT SHUTTLE TO PICK YOU UP. Repeat: do not depend on the airport shuttle to come. I've had it not come, I've had it be twenty minutes early, I've had it be fifty minutes late. I've had it charge me anywhere from five to twenty dollars. Don't trust it."
Recent Alumnus,2,Cleveland has some good ethnic restaurants but the area around Oberlin is pretty bleak.  
College Sophomore,2,"The weather can get students down in the dumps sometimes, but there are definitely beautiful days between the snowy and rainy gray ones. Cold weather= more time to cuddle up with a (text)book!"
Junior,1,"Oberlin is a terrible place for college life. Those 'excellent' professors are becoming less and less, while the 'quality' of new professors is extremely low. Right now, there are 30% 'good' professors and 70% 'bad' professors. For my experience, Oberlin's high-quality education does not exist anymore."
Sophomore,1,"Oberlin is terribly mismanaged. Only the professors are the saving grace. In trying to get students back on campus, they are subjecting them to real health hazards. They have mismanaged things like this in the past, it's bound to happen again. Furthermore, many people can't fulfil graduation requiremtns now that class schedules are very restrictive."
Sophomore,1,"The current administration is a joke. They've driven Oberlin into massive debt and now the students are paying for it, both literally and in the drop in quality of instruction. Oberlin was the worst decision I've ever mad. It simply isn't what it used to be. For an institution that preaches inclusivity, they are very hypocritical. The student body only serves to cause the college more issues. Just look at the Gibson's case."
Alum,1,"Did not care about us much, waste of money for recorded sessions and on top of that they claimed we would get money back but we never did."
Alum,1,"This school does not care about the well being of any of their students. There have been numerous students that have complained that they have tried to transfer, but the school ""forgot"" to send out transcripts, did not inform the students, and then those students lost out on opportunities. So many law suits for snap judgements made by the college (check out the bakery lawsuit) that effects the entire campus. 
The campus is dreary and depressing. No one has any sort of school spirit. The school as a whole is just deteriorating and heading in a bad direction. What once was is no longer, and I recommend anyone stay away from this place. 
Overall, overrated institution, and if you are considering going here, there are plenty of other D3 schools that are better and actually care about students."
Alum,1,"This college is going down the toilet. Their far-left political ideologies and extremist views is what cost the college $44 million in a lawsuit (look up Gibson's Bakery v. Oberlin College). You would have thought some of the faculty would have been fired, but no they are still trying to fight the case and just racking up legal fees. Wish I would have just went somewhere with actual diversity and a place that accepts new ideas, rather than have to fear violent repercussions just from saying something someone doesn't like."
Junior,1,"Beautiful campus.
Narrow minded professors with far leftist views.  
If your an anti-American Socialist with green hair and penchant for protesting for the sake of protesting this is for you.

Wish I could get a refund after 1 year."
Freshman,1,"I absolutely hate it here. Essentially if you aren't a left wing socialist you aren't the majority and you''ll feel uncomfortable. Sure the academics are gnarly and you'll make friends, but like me your friends will want to transfer and so will you and that'll consume your thoughts. Because it sucks. You like sports? Oberlin doesn't like you. I won't deny that some sterotypes about jocks are true but Oberlin Athletes are the furthest from the steroytpical athelte, in fact, they are belittled by the rest of the student body, it's like a reverse high school social setting. Way too weird and liberal and close minded, needs other view points- I don't mean Neo-Nazi KKK standpoints by the way, just moderate conservatives and the rest of the Obies shouldn't belittle and isolate those who aren't socialist leftists or shroomheads."
Sophomore,1,"Absolutely terrible! Talk to the students who think sushi is racist. This is the reason society has regressed, because education has become less intellectual and more emotional. Pick a more academically focused university for your children or for yourself if you are choosing. Trust me, you will thank yourself for it and the better future you gave yourself."
College Sophomore,1,No one pays attention to the athletics here. No school spirit.
College Junior,1,Athletics play a very small role in Oberlin's culture.
College Senior,1,"if you're not a moral relativist or atheist, it's extremely hard to fit in here"
College Senior,1,There is way to much sexual assault and drunken hook-ups at this school.
College Senior,1,"It is virtually impossible to find people who share my values which makes it hard to develop good, consistent friendships and since I have developed carpal tunnel, I can't even fully participate in the music aspects of the school. For these reasons, it is not worth it to be so far from home and to pay so much tuition."
College Freshman,1,we dont have any frats/sororities
College Freshman,1,There is no public transit in the town of Oberlin. The only option for getting to the airport is the $15 each way shuttle provided by a private company that has some kind of concession with the college. The college only provides transportation at night for students to get back to their dorms; there is no other transit to speak of.
College Junior,1,"Do not trust ResEd if your life depended on it. They pretend to help you but just lie to get you out the door. Screwed my roommate and I over with housing 2 years in a row now. Oh, but ""it's not their fault."""
College Junior,1,"I was assaulted on campus, but because I didn't seek medical attention, the school said that I have ""no proof"" of the incident occurring. This was after stalking and threats by an individual on campus. Moreover, the Student Health Services are horrible. You can't get an appointment until 4-5 days after you call to make an appointment, and there are no weekend hours. Student Health says that if you're really that sick, then the hospital is across the street. Guess paying almost $60,000 doesn't cover decent and basic medical needs. Did I mention that each hospital visit is at least $100? Moreover, theft occurs here like crazy."
College Junior,1,There is no nightlife unless you include The Feve and Agave as a great bar. Everything else around town closes at 7 p.m. It's absolutely awful. Agave's Mexican food is horrible to boot.
College Senior,1,"We do not have frats or sororities at Oberlin College. If you are looking for a close-knit community, you can join a co-op. They are communities of people drawn together by a similar interest in eating healthy, local food. They cook and clean together, and are much cheaper than a traditional meal plan. People get really close to each other because of how much time they spend working and eating together. They often have similar interests in environmentalism, social activism, or drugs. "

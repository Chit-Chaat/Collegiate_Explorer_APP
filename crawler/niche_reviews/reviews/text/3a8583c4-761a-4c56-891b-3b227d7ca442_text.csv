Graduate Student,5,"I have been entirely online thus far, and I do not feel like I am at any disadvantage. The instructions are so clear that I do not feel like I have to go to campus to understand the material better. It is great to feel so empowered, so much so that I will continue learning online."
Junior,5,"I've had a great experience at Willamette.  I've had wonderful and supportive professors, lot of amazing opportunities, and met lifelong friends.  Though Salem isn't my favorite city, there are plenty of things to do and the proximity to nature is wonderful.  The university makes an effort to provide students with lots of opportunities, both academically/career oriented, and just things to do for fun in free time.  There are lots of ways to get involved in anything you might want, and everyone you meet is very engaged and involved.  The community is so supportive, and I have found Willamette to be a great place to learn and grow."
Sophomore,5,"I feel as though Willamette University provides the ultimate college experience. The community is incredibly welcoming and supportive.  And one of the most inspiring parts is that so many people share an enthusiasm for learning and becoming people who make a difference. In addition to the amazing community on campus, the scenery is delightful. The Mill Stream runs through campus, and the landscaping is near flawless. The brick buildings are a bit older, but they have such great character and feel so much like home. It is a very historic school. The library is quite amazing, with a silent level for the students open late into the night. And we have one of the best Art Museums with love artwork from all around the world! And another one of my favorites is the Bistro. It is like the Central Perk of Friends. It is so cozy, serves great coffee and food, and is always full of people hanging out or studying. I could not imagine a more welcoming and fun-filled place to spend my college years."
Alum,5,"Willamette University uses a holistic admissions process, allowing for students to tell their whole story when applying.  Almost every professor is dedicated to helping their students learn and succeed, but also grow as a person and support them in their studies and life there.  I am so happy to have gone here for my undergraduate studies."
Junior,5,"Once the pandemic hit, Willamette transitioned to online learning. My teachers remained available for help for zoom communication throughout the rest of the semester. My learning continued to be almost as thorough as it would have been in person and I was very impressed by the transition. While some did struggle with the change, there were still many resources available for help. While I have never taken a strictly online class from the University, my experience with online learning was very good."
Junior,5,Willamette is a liberal arts school with a wide variety of students attending. It is extremely welcoming and accepting of anyone no matter their differences. I believe anyone can find a home at Willamette. The student to teacher ratio is really fantastic for being held accountable and for being able to create a relationship with your teachers and classmates. Everyone is supportive and cares for your success. It is a close knit community and you can say hi to anyone around campus even if they don't know you and you'll get a smile back.
Alum,5,"I truly had, what I feel, is an incredibly unique college experience. From the moment you visit, it's clear how genuine the Willamette community is! The tightly knit community is very conducive for close friendships. I played soccer at Willamette and loved the athletics experience; it was a great balance between having time for academics and extracurriculars, while still taking the sport very seriously. I also really enjoyed living in Salem. It does have a large homeless population, but it's right next to the capital building, there are plenty of great restaurants, and many pretty hikes in close proximity. Perhaps Willamette's most notable aspect is its outstanding professors! I received so much personal attention from them; I never remained stuck or felt like I didn't know where to turn when I was confused. They were always available. I just got a good job and am very well prepped for it from Willamette."
Alum,5,"I did not have online schooling from Willamette, but heard good things from peers. I'm writing this next sentence to fulfill the review length requirement."
Alum,5,"The professors care a lot about their students. I was able to easily reach out to my professors. Anytime I had a question on anything, they were just a zoom call away."
Niche User,5,great help if you do sports you will love it i think it has to be one of the best schools for education and sports
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at Willamette, particularly the professors. They care so much about individual students and your wellbeing both in and out of the classroom."
Niche User,5,"Will settle is a wonderful place, the staff are nice and helpful, the students are always happy and motivated. The campus feels like home away from home. It’s a small university that cares about the educational and well being of their students and to me that's more than enough to rate this university with 5 stars"
Niche User,5,I will be starting there in the fall. The students and faculty were so friendly and the campus was beautiful.
Freshman,5,"First day, I was nervous but also excited. I am now on my Second Semester the first year at Willamette and feel like I'm doing pretty good. It was interesting to experience opening days and find people who were going through the same thing I was. Transitioning from high school teen to a young adult, while learning how to live on our ""own"". I hope the rest of the college will be as great of an experience as my first semester was."
Freshman,5,"The experience was amazing, and the campus is really diverse. While it rains a lot, the climate is really nice"
Sophomore,5,"Although Willamette University a has a really small campus population, I have fallen in love with all of it. Of course you might not get the best professors, but, when you do they are truly memorable. 

One of the only downsides is that they underwent a major change within the last two years. They got rid of the Politics major (which is what I am actually trying to major in (but I found a way around it)) and replaced it with the PPLE major (Politics, Philosophy, Law, and Ethics?). Thus, any newcomers (after Fall 2018) will not be able to major in Politics.

(If you ever do get the chance to take a class by Professor Basu (Politics/PPLE) or Professor McNicholas, please do take it!)"
Sophomore,5,"Remember that feeling of entering school on your first awkward and nervous about meeting new people? Well, at Willamette, that doesn’t fly. Instead, we have a program called Opening Days, where all first-year students arrive on campus a week early, are put into groups based on their Colloquium class, and are led by their Opening Days leaders to participate in several activities that boast bonding and making friendships. Since then, I’ve never felt alone at all here and have always had a friend or a professor to talk to when I had a concern to voice. Willamette succeeds in having small class sizes that lead to better student-professor relationships, more focus, and an emphasis on the liberal arts college experience. The campus is beautiful in its layout, and the weather is mostly cloudy or rainy, with occasional snow, which is a plus for students who come from sunny/hot cities."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent customer service, professional environment. Quality education. Diverse professionals and professors"
Freshman,5,"The school is amazing! A freshman and really looking forward to finishing up all my years there. Amazing campus, teachers and just the people in general. So many majors to choose from and really nice athletics as well."
Alum,5,"Willamette offered a wide variety of Liberal Arts curriculum. My professors were great, and I was able to explore a lot of different topics. I also played soccer for the school, which allowed another great opportunity of growth while in school."
Niche User,5,"I visited the school three times before I decided that this was where I wanted to spend the next four years of my life. Everyone you meet is genuine and honest. They will tell you their real experience with the school and culture and will not just say things to get you to come to the school. I appreciated how small the campus really is as well, a ""large"" classroom has 40 people in it. This really allows you to get to know professors and peers better."
Niche User,5,"I love the community and how welcoming it is. It a beautiful campus, especially in the summer. There are many clubs and organizations that are offered so students will always have something to do. The professors genuinely care and will help, especially since the school is private. The student to teacher ratio is a bonus. The dorms are very nice as well. The rooms are perfect sized and there are rarely any problems concerning the living situations. I recommend to get to know your community more and explore as much as you can."
Freshman,5,"The professors and classes are absolutely worth it! Every class had students who were there to learn, professors who taught their content awesomely, and a generally great atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"I love Willamette! The professors here are very committed to student success, but the other students are also so involved in activities for student success, that it feels like a very cohesive community."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Willamette. My impressions thus far are excellent, Willamette is everything I thought it to be and more. I’m very glad I chose WU over the other schools I was looking at."
Sophomore,5,I love Willamette! It's filled with great people and amazing professors. My math professor said I needed to be in a different math course so during his office hours he gave me tests to see what course I should take. Then he taught me everything I had missed on the first day of the class I was transferring into. this is just one example of how professors will go above and beyond to give you a good college experience. The students there are fairly open-minded and it was easy to make close friends. I've been ready to go back for the whole summer!
Sophomore,5,"Willamette University, although not the largest school, gives students many opportunities to grow. Be it their close proximity to the state capital building, or the vast amount of student led organizations, Willamette offers a wide range of activities to it's students."
Senior,5,"Willamette University offers a close-knit, small college environment where everyone gets to know their fellow students and professors closely. Additionally, the campus is beautiful, and great for group activities or studying outside by the Mill Stream."
Junior,5,"I transferred here from a large research university. Wow what a difference. The professors are so dedicated to teaching and have a passion for sharing knowledge. I'm also loving the PNW. We are just an hour to the beach, or the concerts and art cultural of Portland or Eugene."
Freshman,5,"Went on a recruitment trip for the football program and everyone was literally soooo nice! Not just the faculty members on campus, who helped me out a ton (turns out my FAFSA wasn't submitted completely, whoops!) but the people and the community was also great."
Freshman,5,Excellent program for kinesiology. All programs have small class sizes at Willamette. The campus is very pretty in fall and spring.
Senior,5,"Willamette had provided a multitude of experiences that have completely changed my life. I have had the privilege of participating in athletics, working at the capital, and meeting several leaders that’s have expanded my worldview. While it is not perfect I would choose it again."
Freshman,5,"I first found out about Willamette University when my school's choir was invited to attend multiple workshops and choral events hosted there. I began looking further into Willamette and went on a campus tour. The campus is beyond luxury, with incredible historical monuments, many different food courts to choose from, beautiful dorms, as well as many other necessities. The staff is thrilled to help you out on your college journey, and welcomes you with open arms. This is a school that focuses on you as an individual and meets your needs gladly."
Sophomore,5,Willamette has an excellent and provocative poli sci program. I've enjoyed my classes and connected with my professors and fellow students. The campus is beautiful though Salem leaves a lot to be desired.
Sophomore,5,I came to Willamette this year as a sophomore transfer from the East coast and I love everything about it. I feel as if you can really be accepted for who you are and the community is amazing along with the opportunities that you can take.
Sophomore,5,"I've met so many great people here. The students are motivated, professors are engaging and all the staff I've dealt with are passionate about their work. It's a very pretty campus but the food is not good, at all, and Salem has been a real disappointment. Portland or the beach is just an hour away though so no excuse not to escape when you can."
Sophomore,5,"Small class sizes are helpful and faculty are excellent. However, upper-level classes close too quickly, denying access to qualified underclassmen."
Freshman,5,"It is a university with a rigorous curriculum. At the same time, the professors are very helpful, as this school is a small private school which allows for the students to be able to ask help from teachers in a smaller classroom environment."
Freshman,5,I have really enjoyed Willamette with all of the programs the university has to offer. The professors truly do care about all of their students and will do their best to see them succeed. The staff at the college is very supportive and always seems to have a positive attitude when approached. I have not had a negative experience yet with any of the staff or with my peers. It has become a great home away from home.
College Junior,5,"The alumni network for the law school is strong in Oregon and every alum I have met has been willing to bend over backwards to help out with job prospects or tips on getting through law school. The placement office has great relationships with local employers and with alumni throughout the country. The job hunting process will really be what you make of it and who you are willing to reach out to. They will meet you halfway, you just have to want it."
College Senior,5,"Athletics are very important to Willamette, as is showcased in the gym equipped with a pool, two locker rooms, two basketball courts, myriad classrooms and offices, a medical assistance room, a weight room, and a workout room with two multipurpose rooms. The students and faculty alike have a lot of school spirit and spunk when it comes to athletics - whether that be varsity or intramural."
College Freshman,5,"Since the campus is in such close proximity to the state capital building, there are great internship opportunities and the school staff is more than happy to assist students in this process."
College Freshman,5,The Greek life is less about partying and more about actually helping the community.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes -- you learn so much more, and it's really motivating. Since classes are so small, professors will know who you are, and many of them will go out of their way to contact you if something seems to be wrong. They're all really understanding, and want you to succeed / are willing to make compromises if you just communicate with them about your needs. I'm sure there are a few exceptions to this, there always are, but this has been my experience so far."
College Sophomore,5,"Getting an internship is a piece of cake. We are directly across the street from the Capitol building, and a lot of people do internships there. Even if you're not into politics, all of the state departments are there, so you can probably find something you're interested in. We're also right next to a hospital, so it's easy to do medical internships/jobs. The entire city was literally built around our school because it was the first thing in the area."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel so happy and at home here. There's a culture of acceptance, positivity, and support for one another that is evident just by being on campus. With a few exceptions, the professors will go out of their way to help you and keep you on track. The small class sizes make learning material so much more effective, and it's incredibly easy to talk to most professors outside of class because you're not competing with hundreds of other students."
College Freshman,5,I might have lucked out but I am in a double that is the size of two singles with a wall knocked down. I have more space here than I do at home.
College Freshman,5,"I think the dorm I live in is the best on campus. My room has plenty of space (I have one roommate) and there's a laundry room, vending machine, and full kitchen on my floor. Also, the bathroom's right next to my room (easy access) and there's hardly ever anyone in it. There's also a cafe open for breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday on the first floor of the building so I don't have to leave to get food (which is great for when it's cold and raining). Also, all the rooms have there own personal air conditioning and heater that you can control for your individual room for no extra cost! Also there's a pool right next to the building that's open in the spring/ summer."
College Junior,5,WEMS is a student-run emergency health response team. They evaluate students and take them to the hospital if necessary.
College Freshman,5,"Classes are challenging, but definitely educational and some completely question or change your views and mindset. Professors are supportive and willing to help. There is a very collaborative environment where students can work with each other in the library and in Ford. Professors offices are usually haver their doors open so you can talk ti them and ask questions while doing homework."
College Freshman,5,"I live in Eastside and it is great, the CMs are nice and helpful, the people are respectful and its cleaner than expected in certain areas. The price of living on campus is a bit more than it would be to live in town, but overall it is a great atmosphere for the first two years."
College Freshman,5,"Campus Safety is extremely responsive and willingly transports students back to their dorms if they are feeling unsafe within a 10 block radius of campus. Their main priority is safety, not punishment, which makes students more comfortable to call in cases of alcohol-related incidents. I always feel safe walking across the heart of campus at 11 at night."
College Freshman,5,Students constantly receive e-mails regarding career planning and internship opportunities. The alumni network is fairly involved and the employers on campus are friendly and understanding.
College Freshman,5,"While course registration can be difficult at times, the courses themselves are interesting, challenging, and substantial. Professors are consistently enthusiastic, informative, and helpful. The average class size is 15 students, and my largest class had 30 students. Class styles range from lecture to discussion to labs. While discussion classes push me out of my comfort zone and labs test my knowledge of course material, I prefer taking notes in lecture classes."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life at Willamette is pretty low-key but provides plenty of leadership opportunities and fun events for good causes. There are around 7 fraternities and sororities, only one or two of which have separate Greek housing. There is no prejudice against folks involved in Greek life or not."
College Freshman,5,"For me, the athletics program is perfect. I am not particularly sports-oriented, and I appreciate that athletics do not define my school. Many students play intramural sports for fun, and varsity sports are offered for more serious athletes. Athletes are still met with plenty of fan support, but don't expect an arena of fans like at large public schools. At Willamette, sports are typically more casual."
College Freshman,5,"Willamette is an inspiring and supportive place to learn. The professors are passionate and helpful, the academics are challenging but rewarding, the music and theatre programs are amazing, the library is huge, the food options are decent, the student life is exciting and eventful, the dorms vary in size, and the night life is fun and safe yet avoidable if necessary. I am very proud of my choice and I am very much enjoying my time at Willamette."
College Freshman,5,I had a great support system from the start. It's been a fun semester so far.
College Freshman,5,"Willamette is fantastic! I highly recommend it to anyone! For the most part, people are great. Professors are great! Atmosphere is mostly open and accepting. I love it!"
College Freshman,5,The people here at Willamette are amazing! I love everything about my school!
Graduate Student,4,"I like Willamette because everyone is friendly, fair, and helpful. Also, the program is highly supportive!"
Junior,4,"I took all of my classes online, which we were all given the option to do, which is very lucky.  Professors have been very accommodating and doing their best to transition to this new teaching style."
Alum,4,"I did not have any online courses as they did not provide those when I attended.  The online websites and tools for the school were sufficient, and the IT department was helpful when needed.  Most professors were easy to get ahold of over email.  Sometimes presentations were streamed or recorded and then uploaded somewhere, which was nice to have if a friend or guest speaker was presenting but you couldn't attend in person."
Alum,4,"I took advantage of Willamette's study-abroad program while participating in various extracurricular activities; as a result, I always felt productive and useful. With this said, one needs to put forth effort in order to enjoy the school. Though there are many opportunities, students must capitalize on them. Faculty are outstanding and are genuinely committed to the fulfillment of their students' goals. I cannot say enough good things about my professors. 

Willamette's downside stems from its falling victim to Gen Z's love for indiscriminate social engineering. I could have lived without Willamette's pandering to ""woke"" culture, to say the least. While many of my peers were steely-eyed realists there was no shortage of self-righteous, pompous, perpetually-offended/oppressed, and deviant individuals who likely grew up screaming at their parents instead of listening to them."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the small community at Willamette. The professors were always available, the custodial staff was always so friendly, and there were so many clubs that I could participate in. I got a lot out of Willamette."
Alum,4,"Love the professors and fellow students. Campus is beautiful. The academic rigor is pretty good. Financial Aid is generally very good.

Administration is so-so. 

The campus has a lot of work to do to fully support underrepresented students. There are offices and staff in place to help, but those offices don't necessarily get the support of other departments."
Sophomore,4,"I love how invested the professors are. Whatever students need, they are almost always willing to help. They get to know their students, and develop good relationships. Something I would like to see changed is the atmosphere of over commitment. Everyone feels like they need to be involved with everything possible on campus, but sometimes people spread themselves too thin. I would like to see the idea of doing the most you can while also keeping in mind you mental health, become normalized at Willamette. 
I also think the food services, dinner specifically, need improvement."
Sophomore,4,"Willamette is a school with great opportunities if you seak them out professors that care. It is a small school so you do have the things that come along with that, but you can still have a great time on a beautiful campus."
Sophomore,4,Every professor I have had or met has been genuinely interested in the courses they teach and the students they have. Professors here notice and care about students no matter how quiet they are and try their hardest to help you pass their class/graduate.
Senior,4,I have enjoyed getting to know my professors and exploring all that Willamette has to offer. I wish that sometimes the administration would be more focused on student concerns.
Sophomore,4,"I really love my time at Willamette so far. Almost all my professors have been excellent, as well as the people I have met. One of the best parts of Willamette is financial aid. The robust financial aid packages enable students like me to get a private degree who would generally not be able to afford it. The school is very small and does not have the social scene that bigger schools do but has a nice sense of community."
Graduate Student,4,"WU has a beautiful campus, the student body is very friendly, but it’s quite obvious that this is a private education for those with wealthy families. The students are mostly white, with some international students sprinkled in. There is a law school and business school as well. The campus is literally across the street from the capitol, which is beneficial for those interested in politics. Salem is a growing city but they are still struggling with income disparity and housing costs. Only an hour from Portland or Eugene. Amazing wineries both in Salem and 15 minutes away in any direction. Two hours from the beach, which means an easy day trip."
Freshman,4,"Willamette is an incredible place. Right in the heart of Salem, it's just across the street from the state capitol. Every professor I've had and the majority of the students I've met are wonderful people, interested in their courses and the world. Racial diversity is average/below average for a private university aside from the visiting Japanese students, but the student body is very diverse in sexual orientation and gender identity."
Freshman,4,"The university is an accepting community to all of whom it welcomes. While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship. I'm so glad to be fortunate enough to be able to attend this school."
Freshman,4,"I am so happy with my decision to attend Willamette. The academics are very challenging and I love that, and professors get to know you and encourage you personally. However, the administration is not transparent and has had issues with racism and classism."
Freshman,4,I really like the small class sizes because it creates a collaborative environment where you can get to know professors one-on-one and ask questions. I also really enjoy taking part in the Chamber Choir. The downside of Willamette is that Salem is not in the nicest place. It does not have much going on and it is hard to reach any place to go hiking or skiing from Willamette.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the small classes, the fact that the professors are passionate about their subjects and care about their students, and the small size. I did not enjoy the fact that the majority of the budget cuts came at the students expense while the president was enjoying giant pay bonuses. The heating in the dorms is poor and the wifi is terrible. On the other hand, there are many resources available for students and the professors do their best to help their students succeed."
Sophomore,4,"As someone who has grown up in Salem my whole life, I wasn't expecting to love Willamette as much as I do. However, I was surprised at how motivated students are, and how overly-involved students become (sometimes to a fault.) The Willamette community itself is pretty tight-knit, and it's very easy to get to know people. In general, you can walk into any room on campus and see at least 3 people you know, and 4-5 you don't, giving you a constant opportunity to meet new, friendly students. The professors are also incredibly dedicated and helpful with their time. WU also provides a lot of resources to students on campus, especially counseling services, safe ride services, and confidential EMT services. My only complaint is that the administration at this school is not nearly as connected to the community as other students or faculty are, and often bureaucracy slows down the process of what could be an incredible community for growth, opportunity, and inclusivity."
Junior,4,"The athletic community is the most valuable part of Willamette University to me, personally. Academically, I find many classes to end up discussing the same liberal issues, which I believe limits my education to a certain scope of thought."
Sophomore,4,"This college is really what you make of it. I'm sure that's a sentiment that others will share as well.

Here's what's up. Salem is not a very safe or exciting city, but that isn't incredibly important as the vast majority of student life is contained within a mile bubble from campus. We call it the ""Willamette Bubble"". You can do just about anything you can dream of as long as you're persistent and dedicated here. The vast majority of campus is very intelligent, competent, and articulate. That being said, there's a lot of extremely wealthy students that may come off as elitist. There are those who are rich and humble. This university's generous financial aid programs help out those who struggle.
There is a sense of responsibility for social issues on campus which is often productive, but unfortunately a noticeable section of the student body is hyper-liberal and somewhat unprofessional. There are still those who are sensible and can get real social progress done despite this."
Sophomore,4,"It's a small school, but there's lots of opportunities and interesting people! I've really enjoyed the small class sizes and the super helpful professors who really care about their students."
Freshman,4,"Willamette has been a great experience so far!  The professors are incredible and small class sizes makes the learning personal.  The campus is beautiful, but we have issues with our campus safety officers in regards to their response time and openness with issues happening on campus.  It's difficult to find a variety of healthy options, the cafeteria seems to find a salad bar to be the only healthy option needed."
Graduate Student,4,"Willamette University's campus is beautiful, with a creek running right through the middle of campus. The many historical buildings and the proximity to the State capitol make it a great place for learning about history, law, politics and state government. "
College Junior,4,"Most professors are very willing to help. If you are not able to make it to office hours, most professors are willing to make an appointment and many more simply have an open door policy."
College Junior,4,"The school really does seem concerned about student safety. There is an ongoing effort to keep students safe and I feel that campus security is quite vigilant. They seem to work very cooperatively with local law enforcement. There was one break in of a dorm, that I am aware of last year. There have also been intruders into the law library that have stolen students personal belongings."
College Junior,4,"I've really enjoyed how supportive and helpful the research librarians at Willamette University College of Law have been. They are really willing to sit with you and help you find your way through murky research, to clarify research queries, or to just lend a hand in figuring out where to start on a specific topic. I recommend their services to everyone."
College Freshman,4,Many students are apart of Greek life but those who are not do not feel alienated from those students.
College Freshman,4,This school has been immensely helpful in the application process for college as well as very generous in their financial aid packages. They are willing to work with you because they care about you as an individual.
College Senior,4,"Small classroom sizes, great professors, intellectually stimulating courses, and enough variety to appease any (or most) student(s)."
College Senior,4,"High quality career center, many internship opportunities, and a great alumni network."
College Senior,4,"Campus Safety, WEMS, and Bishop Wellness Center provide assistance to anyone in need. With counseling services, safety measures, and student EMTs, students feel safe and feel that the school is providing help in any ways they can."
College Senior,4,"Dorm life at Willamette can really help a student find their group. Students rally with their respective dorm, and the CM's/RA's throw parties for the residents."
College Senior,4,"I am not a part of Greek Life, but from what I have seen, it is an important aspect of WU. Greek Life provides a place for people to feel comfortable with a ""family"" of their own. There are many annual fundraisers and awareness events that Greek Life is involved with. It's an integral part of the WU community."
College Sophomore,4,Th graduation requirements make sure that you take a variety of courses and really develop you intelligence in multiple fields. The courses are challenging and interesting.
College Sophomore,4,The degree from Willamette University holds a lot of value especially in the Pacific North West.  The school has a reputation for being challenging so everyone knows that you are a valuable asset.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many support groups on campus.  There are also safe ride options to leave from parties.  Also, there are always groups of people walking together to leave parties safely."
College Sophomore,4,The campus housing is very nice.  I lived in the dorms all last year and absolutely loved them.  We had a dining hall right below us and a balcony out front.  The rooms were very spacious and had a lot of built in storage.
College Sophomore,4,"Being a soccer player for the university, it is great.  The facilities are amazing and all brand new with a great coaching staff and physical therapy team to ensure that athletes are performing at their optimum level"
College Sophomore,4,Willamette is a great educational opportunity with various ways for their students to succeed.  The small class sizes allow students to create great relationships with both fellow students and professors.  Every student is out there looking to have a great time as well.  You will find your best friend at this school and you will find people of every kind living in a happy and engaging community.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are small and you have the ability to take an array of classes with interesting subjects.
College Freshman,4,"Since the campus is small, it's relatively easy to feel safe. You're always about a five minute walk away from your dorm and can always find someone to walk with you if you are feeling unsafe."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are much more spacious and more visually appealing than the dorms of many other colleges in the area.
College Freshman,4,There are so many intramural and club teams. It's a great way to get to know people on campus and get involved.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is really big on campus
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics department is great, and it is fun to attend athletic events. The administration has made some unfortunate changes to the athletics, though, which is extremely frustrating."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are really invested in students' learning.
College Sophomore,4,Assistant work with professors is common and on campus experience is also offered.
College Sophomore,4,The campus generally feels safe and everyone looks out for everyone else even if campus safety is around.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy being in the common spaces and the convenience of facilities.
College Sophomore,4,I feel that I am part of a community where everyone cares about learning as much as possible.
College Sophomore,4,"The greek sororities here have an average size of about 70 people I would say. Obviously, you aren't going to love everyone in a group that big, but people still have basic respect for their sisters and would help anyone in trouble in a heartbeat; at least that's the case in my chapter. While the sororities definitely each have their own ""vibe"", their is still enough diversity in them that any one individual could probably enjoy being in several different sororities. All but one sorority has official housing.

The men's chapters are smaller and more niche. They're the ones who really throw parties, and none of them have an official, school-sanctioned house. They mostly all rent different houses off campus and rotate parties between the houses. 

I'd say there's mixed attitude towards Greek life on campus. No one will join you for not joining Greek life. A large portion of the school is involved in Greek life though, so you'd get to know a lot of people by joining. It's a small school, so it's not like you would ever isolated if you decide to join."
College Freshman,4,"I believe that the classes and professors are all great, and there are of course different professors and classes that may be boring, but the majority of the classes are interesting and fun even though you may not have thought so."
College Freshman,4,"Depending on where you live on campus, you can live in a place where there are many people who want to socialize or live in a place where everyone chills in their own room."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics program is open for everyone to go to, and you are not necessarily pressured to go to any. They offer some free games to support the Portland Timbers, and the athletic facilities are top notch."
College Freshman,4,"The enthusiam that the professors at Willamette University is great, especially when they discuss their different studies, whether it was studying a lesbian commune in oregon or writing an honors thesis regarding children and psychology."
College Junior,4,For the most part things are really nice and the buildings are kept up.
College Freshman,4,Campus feels safe but some of the resources feel like they pretend to care but don't really.
College Freshman,4,They're fine but I don't use them much.
College Freshman,4,The IM's are really big of campus which is kinda fun because it makes it a lot less intense of an atmosphere at games. Everyone's just there to have a good time and anyone can join.
College Freshman,4,"A lot of people are involved in athletics on campus and even those, like myself, who aren't officially involved in any sports, the gym is great and open to all students and there are plenty of recreational sports classes and clubs to join."
Freshman,2,I played a sport at willamette and it was not what I intended and I was falsely promised an academic career that turned out to be impossible. I did not enjoy the town or the people that attended the university.
Alum,2,"What a disappointing, uninspired group of people. I went to college thinking that my peers would work on interesting side projects, would have a desire to go out and explore neighboring cities, and would be willing to attend concerts and shows in Portland. Haha, good one! Most people here are self-proclaimed ""homebodies"" and want nothing more than to sit around and watch Netflix all weekend and smoke pot. Don't come here if you're looking for doers - kids here are completely passive and dull."
Alum,2,"I came into this university expecting to grow mentally, spiritually and socially, but sadly, my experience fell short. It's a fine school if you just want academics, but the administration does nothing to help students prepare for internships, careers or grad school. Moreover, no one wants to leave campus, so expect to journey out on your own if you want to grow as a person."
College Freshman,2,"Every party I have gone to I have witnessed some form of drugs and alcohol being consumed by students, and I know enough students that have used study aid drugs and who will casually smoke weed before class. Definitely a lot of drug users and drinkers which is something I wasn't expecting at a liberal arts college."
College Freshman,2,"I feel like there aren't many student-alumni interactions, or maybe there are and I'm not getting the memo. I also feel like getting a degree from this school won't really get me much pull in the work field because it doesn't have much states, prestige, or recognition."
College Freshman,2,"The professors are the best and I love the small class sizes, however the small liberal arts college in a relatively slow paced city is not for me. I need to go to school in a bigger city with more transportation, diversity, and opportunities... It's a good school for people who want to be lawyers, but that's not me."
College Student,2,"I rarely see any actual security on campus. We have a program called Willamette Watch where students volunteer to patrol the campus at night to make sure people feel safe, however the volunteers are almost always small people that could never defend an attacker. It seems kind of ridiculous to put all the pressure on students rather than actual police officers or security guards."
College Student,2,"The school itself is great for a liberal arts college, however I am looking to change my major to biochemistry, something I'd like to study at a more research based university so I am forced to transfer. The city of Salem itself is not a good place for college students, it is very run down and a bit dangerous, especially for a capitol city. I would 100% not choose Willamette University if I had the chance to re-do my choice. At first I didnt think that the small size would be an issue either, however, having only less than 2000 undergrad students, it really feels like i am repeating high school in a sad, rainy city."
College Senior,2,"In reality, the education you receive from university is not the most important part your college experience. Willamette has great academics, this is true, but the education is moot if the college environment doesn't allow you to grow your character and create valuable connections. I may be a bit biased, but I'd recommend only going to Willamette if you do not have to go into debt to do so. Willamette is a great place for students who need extra help to pass their classes, so if that is of value to you, and mommy and daddy are willing to pay for it, then by all means go to Willamette. Otherwise you are better off getting a STEM degree from your local state university for cheap and earning a higher income than you would as a Willamette grad."
College Junior,2,"The all you can eat has horrible food. All bland and tasteless and nasty. Also if you have the meal plan for it, you are essentially paying $17 per meal. Definitely not worth it"
College Junior,2,This school is expensive and I don't get the aid I need to come here. Also they will take away some of your aid if you receive scholarships
College Junior,2,Sports are not a big thing at Willamette.
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do close outside or on campus really.
College Junior,2,They have a board that people can post on that are offering off housing campus but they strongly encourage on campus living.
College Freshman,2,Some parts are ok but I don't want to live here.
College Sophomore,2,The only off campus housing that I know of is the U-Apps and they don't seem very nice. Also Salem is a sketchy and crappy town and the apartments around Salem are probably gross and not nice.
College Sophomore,2,The only close place is Subway and Papa Johns and I'm getting fat. I want a Panera or some place where I can get an actually good salad.
College Sophomore,2,"No one cares about the sports here except the people who play them. Sparks gym is good now but it took a super long time to build and the ""in the mean time"" gym was really crappy. Also they are still doing construction and that bothers me"
College Junior,2,Not many diversity in all aspects. Ethnic/racial diversity is bad. It had 4 professors who each identified as a person of color leave the university in pursuit of working at a more diverse university.
College Freshman,2,"Salem is not a very exciting city; I spend most of my time on campus because there's just not that much around. The good thing is that living on campus, downtown Salem and pretty much everything you need (mainly Safeway) is within walking distance. Downtown has a few great coffee shops and a mall. Aside from the RAM which is right across the street from campus, there are not a lot of great restaurants in the area."
College Sophomore,2,"As a non-Greek I'm going to be biased, but Greek life creates a major divide between students that can even permeate the classroom. Often members of a fraternity or sorority will choose to work with other Greeks rather than students who will actually help them learn and grow. Greek life is the easiest way to make guaranteed friends on campus, however you have to pay a hefty price to keep them."
College Sophomore,2,This is another disadvantage to the school. There is a municipal bus service but it only runs Monday-Friday until 7pm. There are school sponsored shuttles from the Portland airport that run over break but they're not the most reliable. It's best to either have your own care or befriend someone with a car that can give you rides.
College Junior,2,"Sure the coaches seem all fine at first, but you become a nameless rando as soon as you show up. They like to tout 'school first, sports second' but that's far from the reality. You are expected to retain  the practice/training schedule of a D1 program, but without the benefits of things like free stuff, people to help you with homework, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a a little to do, but most of the attractions are further away from campus. Those that are there are expensive and out of walking distance. You need money and knowledge of reliable transit whether it's public or your own."
College Junior,2,"For Fun – Our sports are not a big deal at all. We're such a small school that there's really not much recruiting, and honestly some of the intramural sports get more attention than the actual sports. Our football team is awful."
College Junior,2,Get there early. Or don't park on campus. Those are pretty much the only choices.
College Freshman,2,"So yeah campus is pretty strict. Most CM's are hardasses and are incapable of looking the other way on drinking in the room, noise etc. There was one CM first semester who was more likely to look the other way, which she got fired for. CamPo can be understanding but mostly sucks as much as CM's. My advice? Take your shenanigans off-campus early and often. Salem Police don't give a s*** about a couple students ripping a joint on the sidewalk because they're busy tending to meth heads and domestic disputes. Once you get off campus the world is your oyster as far as getting f***ed up goes. So get to it."
College Freshman,2,"ok the attractiveness of the student body needs to be made more clear on this site. Are there attractive girls at Willamette? Yes. Do you need more than two hands to count them? Probably not. I love Willamette, and I have plenty of friends that are girls, but oh my gosh it is slim pickings when it comes to genuinely attractive, in-shape girls. I understand that beauty runs deeper than the skin, but just know what you are getting into when you enroll. If you are an attractive girl and considering liberal arts schools in Oregon, please come to Willamette. I'm not being creepy, it's a really awesome place, but we don't have enough of you. You will get plenty of attention and basically have your pick of most guys on campus. Ok I'm done now."
Recent Alumnus,2,"it can hard to find a spot, and if don't have a student parking permit, you will get a ticket."
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, though Salem is Oregon's capitol, it's fairly boring. There are plenty of restaurants and a mall and a movie theatre. It can be tough to go anywhere that isn't downtown unless you have a car, though. What's nice is how close Portland is."
College Sophomore,2,Only Average – There is a Greek life on campus but it is not even close to what you would expect from a state school. Anyone can go to a frat party and no one is ever rejected.
College Freshman,2,"No One Cares – Sports don't seem to matter at Willamette, but that doesn't stop the school from giving away money to football players who couldn't go D1 or D2.  They still don't have the GPA or the ability to make it here."
College Freshman,2,Not Very Relavent – The Greek life at Willamette is not very important and you arent pressured to join. mostly they are having parties and arent viewed poorly
College Sophomore,2,"Quiet on Campus – The nightlife on campus is pretty much dominated by the fraternities and sororities. However, the campus is small, and there are lots of parties in student homes off campus. Club life is pretty quiet, Salem is not a college town, however there are a few bars for both gay and straight clientele. Portland has more options to pick from and is only an hour's drive."
College Senior,2,"Salem Is Awful – Salem really doesn't have a lot of good food options. There are a couple places within walking distance, and a lot more if you have a car."
College Freshman,2,An Awkward Library – The Hatfield library seems to be a very uncomfortable place for me.  I don't feel like there is any recognizable system within the library which makes it hard to find the material I need.  Its complicated to navigate.
College Freshman,2,"Two Majorities – Aside from White and Asian (Because of the Tokyo International University of America) people there aren't really that many other minorities represented at this school but that could partially be because we are a small private school in Salem, Oregon so we dont have many different racial groups to choose from."
College Freshman,2,Not as Diverse as Other Schools – Willamette is not as diverse as I would have thought it to be since it is a liberal arts university. There is an international school that is linked with the University but you dont see many of those students around as they usually stick to themselves.
College Freshman,2,"Not Much Around – Salem is a nice size and has some stuff to do, but you'll run out of things to do in the city quick. It's close to the campus and most stuff is in walking distance. Some cool old shops and Willamette river is about a 10 minute walk."
College Senior,2,"Rather Expensive and Not Very Varied – Off campus dining is not bad, but there is not a big variety of it walking distance from campus. Few restaurants have students discounts, and most of them are good quality but rather pricey."
Graduate Student,1,"I’m telling you this business school is a joke. I haven’t learned anything and professors just negotiate the final exams with students so everyone gets an A; there’s nothing academic or noteworthy about the Willamette MBA-P. It’s a low-quality program. But worse, male professors are coached by their bosses on how to be demeaning and sexist to women and get away with it. I was harmed by all three men involved in my case which they still have not fully investigated."
Junior,1,"As much as there are some cool classes here at Willamette, and having small classes and one-on-one interaction with professors is incredibly helpful, it's a very small school that has a ""bubble"" effect on the social environment, which can make some people feel like a hamster on a wheel going in circles. There are many issues currently with greek life, diversity, actual inclusivity (instead of performative allyship), and the tuition has gone up to 64k recently (for the year, including room and board). A very white, privileged, and often clique-y, place; multiple years there gets tiring. You must live on campus for the first two years (four semesters, specifically). Salem as a city is incredibly underwhelming as well. I'd also argue there is a culture of overachieving to the point of toxicity here. I think if you find the right people and right things to do to enjoy your time there, you'll make it through, but the aforementioned aspects of WU are some major drawbacks for me."
Alum,1,"Do not waste your money going to Willamette University. The alumni network and their career services department is awful. The school spends too much money on administrators and not on student services. If you want to go to a liberal arts school in Oregon that does it right, got to the University of Portland."
Alum,1,"Overall, this school has been a massive disappointment. It's a small school filled with middle to upper middle class white people, who espouse liberal beliefs and never leave their own groups. I am from a white, upper middle class background myself, but I grew up in a highly diverse area, and, trust me, Willamette kids were sheltered, spoiled (with attention, not material things) and were difficult to relate to on any level. Imagine a group of people who never left campus, practiced slacktivism and complained about how boring Salem is - those were my peers, and in general, they are miserable people. Come here if you want to use medium-quality drugs, sit around all day, and feel bored."
Alum,1,"This is an absolutely terrible school.  They should be ashamed to call themselves a liberal arts school when they have less liberal arts majors than OSU.  I was a biochemistry major (bad choice at a liberal arts school) and I feel like I was cheated on my education.  For example, I took Organic Chemistry I & II and got a C, B- respectively. The typical course schedule is 3 hours of lecture a weak. 2 hours of tutoring. 1 hour of supplemental instruction, and 4 hours of lab.  

After I transferred to USC I decided to retake Ochem I&II  and got an A both semesters on a more shallow curve.  You could say it was because I retook the class (which is partially accurate) but the hours at USC were 4.5 hours of lecture a week + 2 hours of optional lecture, 8 hours of lab, 4 hours of seminar a week and that's not including optional tutoring. 

The school is obsessed with creating a ""well rounded "" experience that they forget to develop complexity within your own subject."
College Freshman,1,"As a female Hispanic coming from a big, low income family, I am definitely a minority at this school. Everyone at Willamette is White or Asian and it definitely makes me miss my home more because of how diverse the San Francisco Bay Area is. Also, it's very noticeable that a large portion of the students come from wealthy or well-off families, which shows how much diversity they lack."
College Freshman,1,Absolutely horrible. College atmosphere is pathetic. There is HOPEFULLY one good party every weekend and that's if you're lucky.
College Freshman,1,It is horrible. They don't group you with people of similar interests and rooms are tiny.
College Freshman,1,Greek life here is the epitome of pathetic.
College Freshman,1,"There is very little diversity on campus, but it's not hard to find accepting people."
College Freshman,1,"There are not a lot of great places to eat in Salem. The RAM is right across the street from campus, which is pretty good, but that's about it. Overall, not many great options."
College Junior,1,"There is no diversity. There are straight white people. If I had to do it all over again , I'd rather slit my wrists."
College Freshman,1,It rains all the time and I'm depressed about it.
College Sophomore,1,"This is one of the major problems with Willamette. Recently, there have been non-students assaulting and harassing students and there does not seem to be a police presence to resolve the problem. Salem is not the nicest of cities and it's best to walk with others at any time of the day."
College Sophomore,1,There is very little parking room in any lots. Many people who pay money for parking passes end up having to park elsewhere because there is no room.
College Senior,1,"Remember to be safe. There are some all right house parties and fraternity and sorority dances, but recently there's been a lot of news made about the misogynistic and sexist behavior displayed by fraternities. I've had a great time at off-campus parties, but have had to get some friends our of difficult and dangerous situations before."
College Freshman,1,It is outrageous. It is incredibly hard to find a parking space and the parking regulations are unclear and stupid. the price of the parking permit is also very expensive.
College Freshman,1,"WU is predominantly a white school. Although there is a Tokyo international school within, there is not many African Americans, Latinos, Hawaiians, etc."
College Sophomore,1,It is really hard to find a parking spot.  You need to get to school really early to get a parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,Being in a fraternity isn't a big deal at Willamette. People join them so that they could try to fulfill their need to party in college.

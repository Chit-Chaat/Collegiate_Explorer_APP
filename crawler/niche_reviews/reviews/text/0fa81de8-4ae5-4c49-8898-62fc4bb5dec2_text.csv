Sophomore,5,"Because of SCADs well-known Learning program, their deliberate focus on creating a space for students to thrive and learn during the COVID-19 pandemic has only impressed me and keeps doing so as the quarter progresses.

Junior,5,"I found that if you have a strong sense of motivation and a self-starter attitude, SCAD will give you all of the tools to succeed. That being said, it is not an easy program to go through; the school requires a lot of perseverance from you, and expects things to be done at high quality including online classes."
Junior,5,"“We train commercial artists, not starving artists.”

SCAD is one of a handful of schools that fulfills the criteria of being both an accredited university and a commercially-focused trade school.

Its curriculum is focused on the arts and entertainment such that they can provide consistently decent level of training. Organizationally it’s made up of many individuals hailing directly from the industries that it caters to, providing both potential connections and referrals for students as well as a sense of insight as to how to effectively teach to the commercial art and entertainment industry’s needs. These needs include, but are not limited to, capability to communicate within a collaborative setting and efficiency in developing the materials of one’s work."
Niche User,5,"At SCAD, the individuals who led the tour provided valuable information that would assist me in my college search. They also provided accurate answers to questions that I might've had."
Niche User,5,The information sessions that SCAD provided also had valuable information. The admission advisors were able to answer any questions we had.
Freshman,5,"It fully diverse, a lot of new people attend this college for a strong career path in the future. Scad loves to encourage students to try all the opportunities they serve and participate in every event that they can benefit from."
Sophomore,5,"Though it was a bit of a rough challenge transferring to online classes, The value of the courses were still the same. SCAD did their best to make sure that all students got the most out of their online classes."
Sophomore,5,The overall community and the environment is the best that I have experience from a school level.  The community in itself is very friendly and it feels like you belong. The reason being is because everyone finds similar interest just like you.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience was a little difficult due to the pandemic. It did take some getting used to but overall it was fine. The teachers were very respectful and took into consideration that it is completely new. I really hope that I do not have to go through another semester of online schooling due to it having to many problems.
Junior,5,Online learning experience works well. Benefits with my part-time work as well as my extra-curricular activities as well.
Junior,5,Overall experience of the school is nice. Associated myself with some friends with different majors but get along well with them; Professors works well with interacting with the students.

Sophomore,5,my overall experience with Savannah College of Art & Design was great.  I was not sure at first but really learned a lot and I had a great time.
Freshman,5,"The admissions team is amazing and always reply within 24hrs, if not instantly. The programs are top notch and the teachers really work with us. Pricing is a little high, but they give amazing scholarships through the school itself, which helps immensely."
Freshman,5,I took am enrolled in the online degree program and so far am loving it. It greatly advanced compared to other online degrees/courses. Loving it.
Sophomore,5,"Due to the pandemic the school had to convert everyone to online learning and wow! They were ready and equipped. The professors were so helpful and willing to assist students with online learning. At the start of each week they would remind us about what was due for the week and deadlines as it took some getting use to the eLearning platform. I appreciated the discussions, the extra help sessions and the office hour sessions as it really made a difference with assignments. They even had fit classes online and online sessions for careers and special guests from leading industries to give presentations so you still felt like you were getting industry tips of the trade. I also had people from different departments reach out to me by email to ensure that if I had any concerns or questions that needed their assistance they could help me."
Sophomore,5,Overall I think they did a good job of transitioning students to the online platform and giving the extra assistance to students to ensure they still succeed in school.
Junior,5,"I love the resources we have available to us at SCAD. I’m always surrounded by so many talented students, which motives me to always do better!"
Freshman,5,"I have yet to attend any classes for the Savannah College of Art & Design. Regardless, my hopes for this school is high in that it will help me hone my skills as an artist so I can get closer to my goal of becoming an animator."
Senior,5,"Doing college work and meeting deadlines is very stressful and working a lot can be boring,  SCAD offers many fun activities to help balance it out.  Every quarter there is a festival that lasts about three days and there are many things to do within those three days.  SCAD offers many other fun activities in between as well so fun things can be come at unexpecting times.  The most fun things I have attended are early premiere of movies."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved my Summer Camp experience at the Savannah College of Art and Design last Summer of 2019! The technology was outstanding as i was exposed to 2D and 3D drawing. The staff was very friendly and organized. I would certainly love to stay campus because of the downtown atmosphere, gym, and tasty food!"
Niche User,5,"I have taken 4 classes at Savannah College of Art and Design now, the teachers are amazing and the environment is so inspiring and beautiful."
Graduate Student,5,I am excited about the quality of the fine art education at this school. I also like the opportunity of being able to attend an internship and learn about a career in Fine Art.
Niche User,5,I took the Savannah College of Art and Designs Rising Star Program and my experience was wonderful! I loved the classes and atmosphere SCAD had to offer and can't wait to go back. The people there were amazingly talented and became a group of supportive and encouraging friends. They were also very serious when it came to our safety and told us where and when it would be safe to be in the city of Savannah. The food was also good for what it was. There wasn't really a party scene as everyone was really focused on getting there work done. After homework was completed however there was cool events and hangouts like movie nights in the common areas provided for us by RA's and other students in the Rising Star program.
Niche User,5,The campus is inclusive for all students. It has activities for everyone and many activities are run by students for students. The campus is clean and safe as well.
Sophomore,5,"The environment is very professional, the majority of the teachers that I've had are fantastic. The school is really focused on preparing you for getting a job in the art world."
Freshman,5,"Loving my time here at SCAD so far. My roommates are cool, classes are interesting and the city is awesome; so much history, culture and beauty."
Freshman,5,I will be going to SCAD in the fall 2020. It seems like a beautiful campus with so many passionate students and professors. I'm so exited to start.
Graduate Student,5,"So far, my overall experience with SCAD has been absolutely enjoyable! While studying here, I have been grateful for the opportunities the school has opened up for me as an artist. Each and every day, I see myself growing and improving my work along with making connections and finding memorable companions. Choosing to attend Savannah College of Art and Design has honestly been one of the best decisions I have ever made!"
Niche User,5,"I was just accepted and so far I am in love with this school. While it is very pricey, I believe that the experience acquired from scad is like nothing else. I know that through scad I will accomplish my goals and dreams."
Junior,5,"You're going to read a lot of articles how our administration is a bunch of rich crooks, and tuition is too high. It's all true but... If you can swing the tuition (by taking basic classes at a cheaper community college) and realize most schools are run by crooked rich people, you'll like SCAD. Our dorms are pretty nice, Savannah is amazing, we have so many extra curricular resources to improve your portfolio, and our professors are super hands on. I wouldn't have learned what I have about writing and management if it wasn't for SCAD. I've attended a lot of colleges and SCAD has the best everything (except sports but who cares about that)."
Niche User,5,I visited this school over spring break and absolutely fell in love.  It was a great experience and I really enjoyed it and would want to go again.
Sophomore,5,I love how many class and major options that SCAD has to offer. I love Savannah! It's a beautiful southern city! I also appreciate how SCAD considers student safety a priority.
Sophomore,5,"I always wanted to go to SCAD. There will never be a day you'll get bored with all the things that happen. The teachers are career professionals who are currently involved with the industry, and they'll guide you to become a professional regardless of your experience. SCAD as a whole is an inclusive community, and they have resources for anything you may need help with."
Sophomore,5,"Attending SCAD has been a game changer in my life, not only professionally, but also personally. College gave me the experience to work with well versed, well educated, and very understanding professors who work with you rather than talk down to you. They are looking out for your best interests in becoming the next best group of creatives that they can provide."
Sophomore,5,"I am really enjoying my time at SCAD. I am learning a lot from the excellent professors and wide variety of class options. As a relatively quiet and reserved person, I love that SCAD provides and safe environment that encourages participation in academics and social events."
Graduate Student,5,Savannah College of Art & Design is a great learning experience. You will get a chance to work at a famous business world wide.
Freshman,5,I've only been at SCAD for one quarter and I already feel like this is a place that will help me grow a lot both as an artist and as a person. I've gotten really lucky with the professors I've had so far. I can't wait for winter quarter.
Niche User,5,"Savannah is a city of flourishing life. The academic scene will allow you to pursue your artistic passions and find your path in life. The professors are all very supportive of their students; they create relationships with their students. There is a thriving party scene, you will never be bored. Because the campus is spread out throughout the whole city, food choices are not limited. There is the option of campus dining or eating at a non school affiliated establishment. Because the city is full of so much color, life and culture, there are endless subjects to focus on for any artistic subject. There are beaches and forests and cities to travel to around and in Savannah. The possibilities are endless."
Niche User,5,I would like to see more about what other people have to say about the college and it’s overall quality.
Niche User,5,"The Savannah College of Art and Design has a very welcoming atmosphere. The campus food, dorms, and classrooms are exceptional as well as the city itself. A possible change to be made is more help with financial aid for students."
Freshman,5,Being a student at SCAD has been one of the best opportunities I've ever gotten. The community on campus is incredible. The school provides a bunch of wonderful resources to help you in your career.
Niche User,5,"I had the opportunity to attend SCAD Summer Seminar and absolutely loved it! I got to meet students from SCAD, stay in the dorms, eat on campus, and take 2 workshop classes with professors. Everyone has been super helpful and friendly! The admissions office is always there for you if you need them. The women's golf coach is super friendly and helpful! At SCAD they always make sure they meet your needs and make sure they are the right fit for you."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience with SCAD is great. I´ve had the greatest experience, especially on the personal side. Excellent people all over, the facilities are very well planned and the personnel that works for and with the students are well prepared. On the Academic part, the teachers I´ve had the opportunity to work with are very professional, this is a plus for any undergraduate. I belong to an Athletic team, more than a fabulous organization, the best coaches, the perfect teammates, and unconditional support from the university."
Freshman,5,"I like that the college makes you feel at home and apart of a ""Scad Family"". Professors encourage you to always give it your all and are always there to help. They want to see you succeed. The school also provides a lot of useful resources to use to your disposal, so you get everything you need. Its very easy to talk to people because your surrounded by people with the same interests as you. Its easy to become friends and work together to make something spectacular. Not only that but scad provides glorious places to visit with your friends to hangout and eat. There are many different choices and places to eat and the food is splendid. Not only that but Savannah location is not far from the beautiful beach. A good place to go to get away from it all in times of need. I love the school and everything it has to offer and I would never trade it for anything."
Sophomore,5,"The school is great! The teachers are awesome and have incredible experience in their field. They all really look forward to teaching students. The campus buildings are beautiful. My only complaint is the parking at the buildings, there is definitely not enough at all."
Niche User,5,I really liked Savannah College of Art and design. The school was large and has a lot of cool dorms. They have a lot of large dining halls.
Junior,5,"I was hooked on the fact that SCAD has other campuses in different location; Atlanta, Hong Kong and Lacoste, which really encourages students to travel to different campus and broaden their horizon. SCAD really helps students to get ready for the real world."
Freshman,5,"Applying and also being accepted to SCAD has been an amazing experience. The advisors and staff have been extremely helpful and patient with me through this process, and I would not change it for the world."
Graduate Student,5,"I'm on eLearning campus pursuing MFA in illustration. I think their online course is excellent and very friendly for part-time student. 

One advantage of SCAD is that eLearning is considered as a campus and students are free to transfer from eLearning campus to any physical campus if they want. 

People want to choose eLearning must be aware that only a very limited number of degrees can be completed through eLearning entirely. But on-campus students can also take online courses for credits. 

For students without self-discipline but have enough time and financial budget to enjoy on-campus life, physical campus may be more suitable."
Niche User,5,Maybe more connection with upcoming or interested students. Really give an idea of what they're getting into.
Freshman,5,"I attend the Atlanta campus. My advisors are very responsive, the campus is nice and clean, it's a good size - not too big but not too small."
Freshman,5,"Can't wait to start here this September! From what I have seen, this school seems so well connected to the industry for video production, as well as anything related to art."
Freshman,5,"Savannah College of Art & Design is a beautiful school! The campus is incredible, I'm so excited that I was accepted to the school and that I will be spending the next 4 years as part of the SCAD family. The staff is very accommodating and the curriculum is creative."
Sophomore,5,"A school built upon the desire to prepare you for a career, the focus SCAD has on real-world application is priceless."
Freshman,5,"Reason one of why you should attend Savannah College of Art and Design, is that it's an amazing school. Professionals in the art industry know about Savannah College of Art and design, it's very reputable. Another reason is that the professors at this college are all entirely 100% motivated to help you achieve greatness. They will always be happy to help you with class assignments, but will push you to your full potential. The third reason, is that SCAD students and faculty are family. Everyone here is kind and accepting. The students are there, going through many of the same classes with you. You never truly feel alone or down on campus. It's definitely any artist's dream school."
Graduate Student,5,Professional guidance to ensure career after graduation is excellent. Students are friendly and cooperate together frequently. Time management among professors needs a little work.
Sophomore,4,"I'm in my second year at SCAD, the Atlanta campus. It's small for a college campus, but overall the people are friendly. The professors I've had are great, they're very understanding and evaluate you based on your personal efforts and strengths. It takes a while to get used to the 2 and a half hours of class. Campus food is pretty decent and good for a school campus. They include vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options as well. There's not a big student life here despite there being some events, you often make friends through classes and mutual friends. You definitely can find your niche here."
Freshman,4,"As a first semester undergrad I believe that SCAD is a very good college for students who want a career in art. Due to Covid a lot of the school is shut down but I was able to attend on campus. SCAD has taken many precautions to keep students safe and it has helped them keep a very low score of positive cases. I recommend this school if you want to work for bigger companies, because SCAD will help you find and meet people in the career you want."
Freshman,4,"I have been doing good with online classes. Even though it is new for many of the professors they know their way around zoom and how to use it. I would be nice to be on site, but right now the virtual experience will make do."
Junior,4,My experience so far has been good. I am learning alot from my classes and the learning environment is very helpful and pushes students to do their best to succeed.
Junior,4,I like going here but there are many issues. The admin does not care about students. Im going here for connections in my career and I feel like im receiving that. If you want a good school for its learning and staff then this isnt it.
Sophomore,4,"SCAD is a very vibrant, quirky school.  It has amazing facilities and exciting events.  It is also very career-focused and competitive."
Senior,4,"SCAD is an excellent school with a wide variety of creative majors and great programs. SCAD has multiple campuses around the world with different courses to offer (I've only attended the Atlanta campus). There are tons of opportunities to share your work, build your portfolio, make connections find jobs, etc. The professors are wonderful. The environment in the Atlanta campus is professional and very friendly. Students build lasting connections. Overall it is a top quality Art School. The only reasons I am giving it four stars instead of five is because communication with them via phone or email is a pain. I can never find the right line to call, their websites are less organized than what I'm used to (both their main website and myscad), and their employee turnout rate is so fast, keeping a business card to call directly is useless. I never know who my financial adviser is or how to reach the office I need. I end up calling admissions to redirect me. SCAD is also quite expensive."
Senior,4,"I have only taken two online classes with SCAD in the same quarter thus far because of the COVID pandemic, and in my expereince, it is nearly the same as on ground classes. As an illustration major, my work would usually be turned in virtually anyway. The only difference in experience would be not seeing my classmates and professors in person, which though I miss that part of the experience, I still get to see them in class through video conferencing, and I still get feedback in class or through email. Online classes are also more convenient for me since I would normally commute 40 minutes to over an hour (depending on traffic) one way to SCAD when I attended on ground classes. I have all my equipment at home, so I don't have to go to campus for any reason. In all, I enjoyed my online classes. But if I had to choose, I would take my classes on ground as I greatly appreciate in person interaction."
Alum,4,"I studied in the Atlanta campus. I love my professors who gave me so much encouragement and guidance over my studies. One of my writing professors, who was also the chair of the department of liberal arts, helped me go over all of my cover letters and internship application. I also joined the student media and had a blast working with creatives from majors like photography, writing, painting, filmmaking, fashion design, fashion marketing, printmaking, illustration, animation, and more!"
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my Times I've spent so far at SCAD. It is an amazing place to push yourself in becoming a more creative thinker. From their academics to their special events, SCAD stands out among other schools with their diverse and innovative ideas. I would definitely recommend this college to anyone interested in pursuing a career in the arts."
Sophomore,4,SCAD is a great place if you want to be surrounded by creative individuals and pursue a career in the arts.
Alum,4,The only bad thing about online classes is that they are the same price as regular classes which makes no sense because you can't use any in-person resources or any softwares they only have at school.
Sophomore,4,The online courses were challenging but allowed me to push my creative boundaries and expand as a traditional as well as digital artist.
Sophomore,4,I like the diverse student community who is willing to collaboratively create with one another and effectively bring about positive change through art. SCAD allows for growth as an emerging artist with the challenging creative advice professors and courses provide.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman of SCAD Atlanta and I really enjoy my foundation classes of my intended major which is Illustration. I improved a lot as an artist and as an person in just a few months because of how challenging my art professors are. I also met and made many great artistic friends throughout my first year. I especially grew in communication skills thanks to my general education professors. Communication skills are highly valued in any field of work in the world today, and I aim to also benefit from the specially geared communication courses SCAD offers. If there was one thing about SCAD that I wish would change, it would be the cost of tuition but such a change will take time to negotiate."
Alum,4,"I had very well-versed professors and great resources. Most of the work was project-based, which I enjoyed."
Sophomore,4,"I started in the Hong Kong location, and thoroughly enjoyed my studies there. The professors were excellent, the student environment was very welcoming, and the local area provided nothing to be bored of. I moved to Savannah in my second year and the local area, though perfect for a weekend vacation, was not the most ideal for university study. The professors are excellent, however, and the bigger campus meant a wider variety of students to engage with."
Freshman,4,Their campus is absolutely beautiful! The equipment and resources offered to their students are great
Freshman,4,Savannah College of Art and Design was made for people who want to pursue creative careers! They make sure to give the opportunities you need to succeed right from the start. You just need to make sure you can get yourself there. Work hard and you will be rewarded.
Sophomore,4,"I think that Savannah College of Art and Design has great resources, but is an expensive school. I have gotten very good opportunities from this school and have been taught by very experienced professors."
Freshman,4,"SCAD is amazing school for the arts. I love being in sunny Savannah. I have had an amazing freshmen year. It is pretty spread out but it gives you a window opportunity to walk around the city. My professors have been nothing but supportive. Being a fashion design major, drawing is not my strong suit but I have improved tremendously just by going to extra help and having that one on one attention from my professors. The student life is  great as well. Living on campus at The Hive was a great experience as well. The dorms are well kept and it is nice to not have to share a hallway communal bathroom. Everywhere you walk in the hive there is a an opportunity to make a new friend and people will respond to you. The safety of the school is impeccable. The security guards are friendly and always need to check your ID before you go into any SCAD building.  I really enjoy being a student here and I really see myself thriving throughout the next few years."
Niche User,4,"The Savannah College of Art & Design is one of my top colleges to attend. As an aspiring animator, it has everything I need to succeed in today's economy. I am currently a high school senior, but I did attend the SCAD Rising Star summer program, so I do have experience in SCAD's programs, dorm-life, and many more. I really enjoyed every aspect of SCAD... besides the price. Other than that, however, SCAD was a great experience for me!"
Sophomore,4,"This isn’t the school for those who can’t take the heat, literally and metaphorically. It’s the hardest work I’ve had to put in to anything but I love every second of it and never thought I could be so inspired and learn so much from a professor. Absolutely love the professors above everything"
Freshman,4,"The professors work really hard to make the environment for the students to feel safe and at home so they can focus on their studies. The campus is beautiful. The dorms are spacious. The students are friendly, there is no other school I would want to go to."
Niche User,4,"I loved the environment and energy that Downtown Savannah brings. Everything from the artsy environment, architecture, and the food the city brings a positive and joyful experience. In saying that, I hope to further my career in cinematography/film by attending this beautiful and strong college called SCAD."
Freshman,4,"The Savannah College of Art and Design is a school made for students who want to be a major success in their field of study. While it is a large investment and the food might not be great, I like to think it is worth the money you are spending because I am never happier than when I am creating."
Freshman,4,"Being this is my first-semester attending SCAD, I am honestly pleased with the school. I am a transfer student from Georgia State University and the schools are two different learning environments. SCAD offers more one on one time with professors. I feel more engaged not only in class but on campus. Professors here seem to care more about their students rather than seeing us as another number and I appreciate that."
Freshman,4,"The biggest draw to SCAD is the opportunity to market yourself as an artist. You get to learn how to present yourself and make connections in the industry in order to have a career after college. I don’t have many problems that I could speak of, it’s hard to ask a school to do more when it already is actively trying to better accommodate it’s growing student mass."
Senior,4,"This is a college that demands you put in as much into it as you want to receive. Most professors in all majors are fantastic and will go out of their way to help you learn the most. Student life will take some time getting used to especially since there isn't a campus per se, as the entire city is dotted with academic buildings."
Niche User,4,"So far, My experience with the college has been great! I recently just applied and got a response within a couple of weeks! The way they treat first-time students with the college app process if noteworthy and make you feel like a part of their community. If you are interested in art or design, I highly recommend this school."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed my experience with SCAD. The campus is beautiful, the inside of the buildings are stunning, and the academics are insightful."
Freshman,4,"Experiencing SCAD was awesome for me as a freshman. Though at the moment I’m currently transferred somewhere else, I aim to be back soon after. I’m African so I came to a whole new culture and way of life and there were so many people that made me feel at home. Diversity there is really good as you meet people from all over the world. Academics was great too. Professors are really helpful and focused on drawing the best out of each student. Around Atlanta was nice too with a ton of places to visit. The school is neat and clean and looks good, the food is good not that great though, but on certain days you might be surprised."
Senior,4,"Savannah College of Art and Design is not for everyone, and I mean that in a good way. The acceptance rate of the school is high to give everyone a chance, but you only get out of the education what you put into it. People with no basis of art at all still have a chance to make it in a place like this since they don't require a portfolio for applying. However, I've seen many people drop out because they didn't put the effort in and didn't take their education seriously.

I have gotten a good education starting with the basics and working up slowly. Although I could have learned everything I learned here from watching YouTube videos, I would not have access to the programs as easily and would not have insight from people who have been in my industry, as professors are required to have been in the industry for some years before teaching at the college. I have learned many tips and tricks for Game Design and starting to build my portfolio to apply for jobs."
Sophomore,4,"I’m currently a sophomore and the curriculum at SCAD is great and the staff are mostly very nice and accommodating and if you are enrolled and are registering for classes make sure to check the professors on rate my professor, it’s very helpful website. Only think is it’s STUPID EXPENSIVE to go here and registration is kinda a lil dumb to me. I whole heartedly think they should have more sections of each class because the way it’s set up Your registration time Is based on your year so by the time sophomores and freshman try to register most of the classes are full so you have to find other classes to take and it could possibly set u behind because certain classes are only available in certain semesters. Otherwise the curriculum and assignments are fun and challenging and some are completely open so that u can showcase you new skills and creativity  which I definitely love."
Sophomore,4,I attend SCAD at the Atlanta campus and I find my experience here satisfying. I do believe that SCAD takes their education and student feedback seriously. One of the main things that a prospective SCAD student should bear in mind is how rigorous the curriculums can be. Time management and peace of mind to some degree are a must in order to succeed in this college.
Sophomore,4,"SCAD is a very good school, the professors are professionals in the fields in which a student studies. The on campus life is lively and you’ll find no shortage of peers who not only share your interest but can also expose you to some new and memorable experiences. One of the schools weakest qualities has to be the on campus food at the Hive, incoming freshmen will most likely have to endure the unappetizing meals with the acceptation of SCAD Days and even than it can be fairly crowded."
Sophomore,4,"Wonderful environment. Most, if not all, professors are working in the field and can give relevant advice to hopeful students."
Sophomore,4,"I love the enriching learning environment, and the countless opportunities to jump into the work world, join clubs relating to your culture and major, attend school events, and experience the field of study."
Freshman,4,"SCAD is a really special school with a really high drop out rate- for a good reason. This school will push you and resilience matters. Although the cost can hurt, even with scholarships, the people you will meet, quality of education, professors, accessible events, technology available, study abroad opportunities... and more, make it all worth it."
Senior,4,"SCAD is a great school with lots of opportunities for its students and alumni. The professors are valuable resources for finding projects to work on while enrolled and finding jobs once you've graduated. Some buildings are dirtier than others and need their resources updated like printers and computers, but overall SCAD is a positive experience."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my time so far in their online program. Just be aware of the annual increase in tuition cost if you are looking to apply.
Senior,4,The school as so much to offer for anyone in the creative field. The tuition is absolutely outlandish but the facilities are top-notch. The professors are generally well established in their fields and more and more people are hearing about SCAD every day.
Sophomore,4,"As a user experience student, this is the perfect place for me. The UX program itself full of amazing students and faculty and there is so many opportunities to work with companies and gain internships at some of the biggest design companies in the world. SCAD has connections out the wazoo. In addition, the students at SCAD are amazingly creative and motivational. 

HOWEVER,

Do not fully trust SCAD. They are a business. Making money and expanding are their first priorities. Take everything they say with a grain of salt.

There is a lot to work on in terms of health resources, improper spending, on campus housing, etc. The school has a lot of skeletons in its closets...

Think about your investment. Are the pros worth the cons? Will you be able to pay off your loans easily? Make your own opinion and think of SCAD as an investment to your creative career.

That being said, for me, SCAD is the right place for me to excel and I hope others can find growth and opportunity here too."
Freshman,4,"I am currently taking eLearning and while it can be difficult to manage ones self on the payment pages, it is still relatively easy to get everything you need for a career in Art."
Freshman,4,"SCAD is the definition of diversity. majority seems to know exactly who they are and they make sure you know too. Others like to focus on work, which isnt a bad thing."
Senior,4,Savannah College of Art and Design is very diverse when it comes to experimenting with different majors. Students have the opportunity to try classes from different majors that might help them choose what they really want to study. This gives them the chance to learn more about other majors and develop some new skills.
Freshman,4,I love it. It is absolutely amazing. The atmosphere of the city and school is quite inviting as if is my home away from home. Everyone is in such a creative and positive environment.
Junior,4,"SCAD has a number of highly competent and talented professors, and the college provides many opportunities for students to learn from professionals in the creative industry. However, student life is often isolated due to workload, and campus housing and food are far too expensive for the quality."
Sophomore,4,"SCAD is a very creative and vast campus to be in. Despite some minor issues people may have with it in regards to service, transportation, etc., it provides alot, such as a variety of drawing and internet resources, dorm supplies, good food, and other stuff."
Freshman,4,"Love the atmosphere. Faculty seems friendly and helpful enough, excited to begin! I was treated with respect by all, and I love the collaborative environment the school facilitates. I get to interact with others in different majors and am encouraged to work with them to create great work and great connections, which is quintessential in any field pursued as a result of this education."
Sophomore,4,"SCAD is a great school for those who work very hard and are driven, but even then, it is still stressful. Classes can be fun if you have a great teacher and enjoy the subject. You have to go outside your comfort zone to meet people, since you’ll need it. Food is not the best thing ever but there are great restaurants around. Beautiful city but scary at times. Overall good school."
Graduate Student,4,"The advisors are very helpful and professors are actually engaging and care about your success. The degrees, majors, and courses offered are diverse. You can take courses that actually feel like they are intended to help in your career endeavors. 

This school is all about allowing you to flourish as an independent thinker and embrace your ingenuity."
Senior,4,From my time at SCAD it is a fun school to be at it but also tough.  SCAD holds a variety of events each year and each quarter that a student attends.  It has different housing options for students and the food that is served is alright but there are other types of food options for students.  The main buildings have computers that have all of the computer programs that students use for classes and the dorms have them too.
Sophomore,4,"SCAD is a wonderful school, focused and determined to see its students succeed, provide any academic resource you could need, and a great learning environment. However, leadership of the school is less than ideal, and housing is in a crisis. The food is depressingly bad, and nothing seems to change when students make complaints or criticism."
Sophomore,4,"At the Atlanta campus, I really enjoyed my experience. While some things about life there seem a bit overpriced or cheap, like the housing I lived in before it got renovated, a vast majority of the school is definitely worth paying for. The food is really good, the educators are very well versed in a lot of different insdustries, and they're all very approachable and welcoming. My skills in illustration went leaps and bounds, and I would by far recommend the school for anyone."
Sophomore,4,"I love being at this University! I can't imagine going anywhere else. The school has such amazing and inspiring professors who won't give up there students, even if the students give up on them."
Sophomore,4,"I love that SCAD Is about helping students reach their full protentional. The state of the art equipment, Set life and the amazing opportunities they provide their students.  They have a casting office directly on set and students get the chance to work on feature films and sets."
Sophomore,4,"A good school that is worth the investment, excellent professors who are still working in the industry, up-to-date facilities especially in the digital media department, and nice historic town to explore on free days. Some cons: More good professors than bad but the handful that are present really need to be let go, food is usually more meh than good, school bus line can be unreliable so it's good to be prepared."
Sophomore,4,"I really liked the classes when going to SCAD, the teachers have their full focus on helping you succeed and making it fun and enjoyable that's the best part about scad. As well as activities and special events that were organized were fun and eventful and gave you opportunities to make friends. The dorms however weren't the best, I lived in a one dorm room with 2 other girls when the room is designed for two people. The food was TERRIBLE! Every week someone would get food poisoning, the food was not to be trusted. The chicken had looked like it shouldn't be served but the workers couldn't care less, the food never changed and for the price I'm paying I should be getting decent meals and not having to only eat pizza so I know I won't get food poisoning. But I mostly enjoy the classes and that's the main reason I love SCAD, the teacher are quirky and make the experience fun for you and the projects make you go into imagination."
Sophomore,4,"Interesting classes and a good diversity of majors. Lots of clubs and activities to get involved in, the professors are for the most part really helpful. Beautiful area"
Sophomore,2,"They're trying their best to make an online community, but it's not that successful because most of us learn more hands on and in person. It's been tough on everyone and harder to get good help on projects because we can't meet. They professors try their best given the circumstances and have been more lenient towards our situations."
Senior,2,"I like the opportunities they give students and the teachers are good but after that it’s not good. The campus could be closed off and not through the city, you could make classes better than school transportation campus food basically caused 1 of 15 student food poisoning, the local area is bummy even in the tourist areas, dorms are alright and safety could be hugely improved due to gang violence in the city, and hugely improve the student support system because it’s a joke.too much info is shoved into students in 10 week."
Junior,2,Doing online at this school is a waste of time. I cant afford to take another semester off otherwise i would be waiting to go back during live classes. It just doesnt work for my major.
Sophomore,2,At first when I first attended the school i was a little intimidated by the fact that I would be always surrounded by artists  and other different creators that  would have creation that would be so much better than mine but now i realize its not that bad.
Junior,2,"I will start off by saying that I have learned a lot at SCAD and most of my professors were awesome. The administration tries to make the school look amazing from the outside when in reality, the culture here is very bad. Many students are severely drained financially, emotionally, and physically. There is not any consideration for students health, as we get guilted into forking over more money and emotional energy into our work every minute of the day. It takes weeks to get a short appointment with a counselor and the services are pretty disappointing."
Niche User,2,"I have not attended this school but I had grown up dreaming to go here. I of course fell in love with the modern perks and luxury this school offers. I applied and quickly got accepted, many scholarships came in the mail weeks after. This is the point when my heart on this school changed. I had been avoiding the opinions of the graduated alumni who thought the school was a waste of money. I had tried to get in contact with the administrator of the school and she would not contact me back regarding questions I had. The communication of this school was completely terrible. I then realized how the school was staying afloat, they were conning students like me by giving thousands in scholarships making it seem like a good deal, but yet they charged hundreds of dollars to apply for the necessary things needed to enter the school. It doesn't matter where you get your degree as long as you're putting your money towards a well worth place, of which SCAD is not."
Freshman,2,Really did not like the school at all. They force all students; regardless of major to take multiple drawing and design classes and grade them on the same scale as students who are specifically studying that subject. The food is terrible and the dorms are run down and cramped.
College Sophomore,2,"There literally is no Greek life at SCAD. Some have tried to start up some but they have failed tremendously. I highly recommend against it but if you want to start one up, that's your call."
College Student,2,"Since it is an art based school with a concentration on education and creation, there is no time for sports. The students here are focused on dream jobs via quality education in the arts. There is not a sport focus or encouragement to venture away from the studies. There are not stadiums or huge country wide focuses on sport popularity or pressure for success. Sports are more for students who want to stay in shape and simply love the games they play. The nicest facilities are away from the central area of scholastic buildings and are secluded. This allows those students to have a sense of place and purpose, it is well planned for this school."
College Sophomore,2,It's an urban campus. A lot of walking needs to be done outside of school buildings and in the general town. The school buildings are all heavily protected however
College Senior,2,"Savannah has high crime rates. Students are always being mugged by gunpoint. SCAD ""says"" Security is there to help and cares but they don't. They tell students to walk home and night and it takes over 2hours for them to pick up students if they call."
College Senior,2,"Its weird that the school website advertises sports, because no one ever knows about them. There is one small gross gym at O-house dorms. But our school has no place to go or train. There is an equestrian center across the bridge in SC, but those kids are in their own little world. There's no team spirit at SCAD. Most students want to get their college done and over with and go to sleep."
College Sophomore,2,the safety on campus and the security transportation is poor. I dont have anything else to say about that
College Freshman,2,Just recently there were several shootings a couple blocks down from the freshman housing. Our school is spread throughout Savannah so it's not very isolated. There are a lot of homeless citizens and a lot of bad streets that you are generally supposed to stay away from. I have been catcalled a lot just walking to the central park. I carry around pepper spray everywhere I go.
College Sophomore,2,Don't let the scad day tours fool you. They only serve good quality good during tour days. It's bad and gets old quick. I didn't even bother eat for a few days
College Junior,2,Athletics aren't a concern at scad
College Sophomore,2,"You cannot get into school buildings without your id that you scan or have security cards tap, but that's all they do is tap the card. Recently Savannah has had multiple shootings happen, and SCAD's campus is spread throughout downtown Savannah so walking isn't that safe, especially if you're a female. The SCAD security transport system is completely unreliable."
College Sophomore,2,No places offer discounts for students.
College Sophomore,2,It's incredibly stressful and overwhelming for everyone involved.
College Student,2,it was bad beacuse my parents are not together and my dad didn't put his information down so fasa gave me no money
College Sophomore,2,"I wanted to move off-campus, but I would lose 30% of my scholarship money if I did."
College Sophomore,2,No one ever does anything. You need to be either 21 or have a fake ID if you want to have fun at night.
College Freshman,2,"I've heard that it's bad, but I don't know because I don't go to parties!"
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, options for students with food allergens and issues with lactose and gluten are practically nonexistent. The basic options offered would be okay if they didn't give students consuming them almost immediate reactions and food poisoning."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life, what Greek life?"
Recent Alumnus,2,Athletes? Does that exist here?
Recent Alumnus,2,Scholarships do not do much in the face of such a hefty tuition.
Recent Alumnus,2,Who has time to party? Classes are too demanding for much of a social life.
College Freshman,2,"The housing process is complicated, RAs don't help"
College Freshman,2,"Campus rules are very strict. Quiet hours are enforced starting at 9 pm and there is not alcohol permitted on campus, even if you are 21. For classes you get 4 absences, more than 4 and you automatically fail the course. Park in the wrong parking lot or fail to buy a parking pass and you'll be ticketed numerous times. Freshman aren't allowed to park in academic building parking lots. If you do, you'll get a ticket. Sometimes you can find a spot on the street, but it's difficult. Accidentally park in the wrong spot on the street and you have a ticket. I overheard a freshman say he's gotten 5 tickets within the first two quarters, and tickets in Savannah aren't cheap. It's virtually impossible to have any fun on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls are definitely meant for quantity, not quality. The Hive, which is the main dining hall close to freshman dorms, is avoided by many students because of food poisoning and instances of finding hair in the food. Sometimes there are decent meal options, but it's rare. The hours are weird, they close early on weekends and during the week there's a two hour gap where they serve no food at all. J.O's is probably considered one of the best dining halls. They have a waffle maker for breakfast and fresh fruit most of the time. The breakfast hours are not flexible, though, so if you want waffles you have to wake up at an ungodly hour. The pizza and fries are also really good. Bobbie's diner is another popular dining hall. It isn't close to the dorms, but they have great sandwiches. Again, the hours aren't flexible and most students go only if they're in the area during the week. The Turner Deli won't fill you up for dinner, but it stays open until 2 a.m, making it the only dining option that is flexible to a student's work hours. Carnival and dining halls near upperclassman residence halls are a little better, but not by much. Carnival is the most popular, but it doesn't offer a wide variety of options."
College Sophomore,2,"In my opinion and the opinion of many others that I know, the administration is disliked. Many do not understand why money is spent on useless things when it can be spent on other, more important items. As far as dorm rules go, drinking is cracked down on if it is done visibly, which is the policy for many other things, such as drug use and visitation. Enforcement also varies by RA."
College Sophomore,2,"Compared to other schools, the nightlife is almost nonexistent."
College Sophomore,2,"The housing is located very far from the majority of the academic buildings, making it impossible to walk to most classes, and making taking the bus, biking, or driving a necessity. The freshman housing varies in size, so it is possible to get a tiny room or get a spacious room, it just depends on luck. The atmosphere also varies by building; in some dorms, it is easy to hang out with the others in the building because there are open spaces, but in others there are no designated social areas or they are rarely used because of poor quality."
College Junior,2,"so we are an art school so for us to have any athletics is awesome. we have swimming, golf , tennis, cross country, lacrosse, and equestrian. until a few years ago you could have hard folly ball, base ball and basket ball to that list as well. Not to mention some of our teams are not that bad. Not say they are the best in the country but  we have some true athletes  that just happen to have a passion for art and SCAD is one of the few places that offers both.  However student spirit is zero part of this is due their is no advertisement for event we don't have our own felicity for events i.e. have to travel.  However their is high involvement in intramural sports and we have an amazing gyms as well and workout class and instructors and personal trainer for the general student body"
College Freshman,2,"The athletes are somewhat separated from everyone else. If you had to point to greek life, the athletes are it. Not to say people don't get along, but even sports events aren't that well attended and most just focus on doing work than going to a sports event."
College Sophomore,2,"Being an art school, SCAD doesn't take a huge part in athletics. Although, they have few really good sport teams. The athletes are allowed access to the sports area. Non-athletes have the gym and common rooms."
College Freshman,2,"The required GPA to keep your scholarships each quarter is a 3.0. There is no amnesty if you get below a 3.0 on your first quarter, so you would lose your scholarships and have to rush to find a new way to pay the remaining balance of your bill the next quarter."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much to do outside of what the school provides. A few parades here and there (if you're lucky enough to catch them), and virtually nothing else. I would be remiss, however, if I didn't mention the dangers of the city. Savannah is apparently a hotspot for crime of all sorts, and life seems to be pretty difficult for those without the luxury of living in dorms protected by guards."
College Freshman,2,"It's alright, although the rooms sizes vary and everyone pays the same, overly expensive price. It's a little unfair. Also, the only microwave you can have is a SCAD approved one through an obscure company in Iowa, and they run out of units quick. The only real benefit is proximity to other students, as you would pay a lot less for much more space and amenities in off-campus living."
College Junior,2,We do not have a lot of sporting organizations on campus because it's an Art school
College Sophomore,2,There are only two main school parties and they're fun. Off-campus parties are busted quickly by the cops.
College Sophomore,2,"It's the same food every day - pizza, hotdogs, hamburgers, french fries and you cant forget the vegetables that are lathered in butter... you have to pay extra for fruit"
College Junior,2,"The DWRI (dramatic writing) curriculum is not as good as it should be. They mix more courses related to FILM and MPRA (performing arts) than actual writing ones. For example, TV Piloting is a not a requirement."
College Sophomore,2,Good luck finding parking in the historic district.
College Freshman,2,I am in a long term long distance relationship but from people I've spoken to people of all sexual orientations here at SCAD have extremely difficult times finding partners. The dating environment is not good
College Senior,2,"Recently, SCAD has cut back on security campus wide. Previously, buildings would (at minimum) have a guard on duty in the evening/night to check IDs and have students sign in. Now, we have cameras that are supposedly being watched and roving security guards. They do provide a shuttle service if you're leaving the campus late at night. I do NOT believe the cameras are actually being watched and am very concerned that we are going to have a security incident that cannot be adequately addressed even if they are monitored."
College Junior,2,"SCAD is kind of an expensive school so trying to find financial aid to cover everything is difficult, especially when you are the only one paying for it and don't have a cosigner for loans."
College Sophomore,2,It's all just a big show and more trouble than it's worth unless you're rich and have not much other worries than to focus on just school.
College Sophomore,2,"Sure there are plenty of opportunities for POSSIBLE jobs, but a good deal of people don't get them. It's a great network of people though. Also, many with so much potential do not finish and just face financial burdens because the school is too expensive and doesn't offer enough scholarship for Single Parent households."
College Sophomore,2,Savannah is just a tourist attraction city run over by SCAD. After being here for about a year or 2 you have definitely seen it all and want to leave unless you're a country lover.
College Freshman,2,Tuition goes up and scholarships dont
College Sophomore,2,Over priced and dangerous. Re-purposed buildings are neat but poorly maintained/rebuilt.
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is spread throughout at least 20 buildings throughout several areas of Savannah. This makes it hard for security to dictate over specific areas. Also, high crime areas border many buildings and dorms because of poor planning."
College Freshman,2,"Security only worries about really petty things that are easy to deal with, not the real issues."
College Sophomore,2,"The school does not really help with off campus housing. People live off campus because they cannot afford on campus or they don't like the roommate situations. The school does not support off campus really unless it's their own apartments or another apartment place that is equally or more expensive. It's about the money, not the student."
College Sophomore,2,"It has only gotten worse. My freshman year in 2011 was good, but then they cut down on our creativity as a student body and what really made us happy, such as how we now can't have name tags or door decorations. How can you not decorate at an art college?"
College Sophomore,2,"For the percentage of the tuition you pay, you don't get very much. Most students have to work and try to go to school which makes their gpa suffer. But that's the power of a private college. Art students need better public colleges."
College Sophomore,2,Possible transportation with scad security but not reliable. Nightlife is boring and typical.
College Junior,2,"Sometimes horribly timed and has made me late for class several times, bus drivers like to take breaks at inconvenient times"
Freshman,1,"Currently, I am doing online classes due to COVID, It was stressful in the beginning but it seemed alright after. It's all about managing your time and organizing each subject accordingly since each of them needs time and dedication."
Sophomore,1,"they dont care about their students, they dont help you in online courses you are only allowed to ask one single question every unit. tuition doesn't change and we dont even have the same lectures for everyone some classes dont even have lectures and they just send you a textbook to read. waste of money not worth it"
Sophomore,1,The online classes could be a lot better and probably should use an other program other than Zoom.  I kept getting kicked out of meetings and videos have a lot of lag when played
Alum,1,"SCAD is a good school for students out of high school who do not know what they should be getting out of higher education. 

In a real world application SCAD is not a good school. It is a for profit institution and that's where it ends. 

Career council is non-existent. I had called the resource center for Alumni 7+ times and no one ever answered the phone or returned my messages. 

Go to the Alumni resource center and you will find Glassdoor, Linkedin, a salary calculator, and a SCAD portfolio site.

As a student I was never consulted on how a degree choice would impact my life or what I should expect. 

I had a ""CAD"" class where the professor chose to teach Photoshop instead and now I am disqualified for most jobs. 

I never knew until 10 years after graduating about the artist grant process or seeking funding. I have learned on my own. No business classes were part of the curriculum."
Graduate Student,1,"I am currently enrolled in the eLearning Graduate program and am pretty disappointed in the way the classes are run.  The classes are heavily discussion based, meaning you will be spending the majority of your time posting on a discussion board, giving feedback and answering or asking questions to your peers.  There is little to no interaction with professors and, depending on the courses, there are usually no video lectures as they advertise.  Professors can be slow to answer your emails and questions to a point where when they do find the time to respond, you have already submitted the assignment.  Assignments are graded at a slow pace, which can be an issue when assignments build on one another and you aren't receiving feedback from the professor in time to make any changes.  I often feel that this program is just busy work and does not prepare you for any practical skills that an employer will look for."
Niche User,1,"In any organization there will be people who drop the ball from time to time.  The question is whether someone can then pick it back up and run with it.  At SCAD, that doesn’t happen.  The ball, once dropped, stays stuck in the mud."
Graduate Student,1,"I had a terrible experience and I deeply regret having gone to SCAD for my grad degree. I ended up being so unhappy at SCAD, but always thought I could turn the next quarter around and make the program what I wanted. every quarter that went by was more time and money thrown away if I left. I felt totally trapped.By the end I felt scammed, reading articles about the salaries of the leaders of the school, or a Business Insider article harshly criticizing the schools ROI. I often felt like I was being nickel and dimed, reading over fine print and avoiding very expensive traps. I thought the quarter system was terrible for an MFA, ran into some very bad professors, and a croney system designed to protect them from complaints (serious ones). I thought there was little help for thesis, surprisingly few resources, crowded buildings, and tired, overworked staff.  I wanted my grad experience to be so great and I am heartbroken that I wasted it. You vote with your money. Go to an honest school."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,It's an urban campus. Which means you can't really walk to classes most of the time
College Senior,1,"Extremely over-priced. (more then 10k a year). They don't have enough space for everyone, they cram you in rooms with too many people. The RD's and those in charge of housing are extremely rude and uncaring. The RA's get paid minimum wage unlike most colleges that offers free housing. Resident Life tries to always push their views on others and get people to sign up for crap no one has time for. If they spend their ""budgets"" on making the dorms affordable and safe instead of stupid RA programs it would be better. Security is terrible and there have been break-ins in the dorms. Buses and transportation never show- if you don't leave hours ahead of time you can be late for class."
College Sophomore,1,"Spring House is a rip off. They double stuffed the single rooms and triple stuffed the doubles. You will still pay full price for a single even if you're sharing it with another student. I personally only got a corner of my tiny dorm because my roommate over packed and hogged the living space. You will not have privacy. It is not worth the money you are paying. With the mandatory meal plan, you're paying almost $1500 a month in rent. Save your money and share an apartment with someone else. More space, no crappy food, no obnoxious rules."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a greek life. I'm happy about that.
College Sophomore,1,i hate living on campus. they room you with people you are not compatible with and the buildings are always dirty. not very sanitary
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life and it won't be happening any time soon.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"We have no Greek life at my school, but I wish we did."
College Junior,1,There is no greek life
College Sophomore,1,The good sports aren't in the Atlanta Campus.
College Sophomore,1,Living in the city is overly expensive and over populated.
College Sophomore,1,"I haven't been to one college party yet, so I'm not so sure of the party lifestyle."
College Sophomore,1,It's a miserable place to live for an art school.
College Sophomore,1,The only flavor is bad.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Administration in Atlanta campus needs serious improvement in collabtating with teachers and understanding the nature of art education versus traditional schools. Administration puts pressure on teachers to fill up class time with lectures rather then allowing students studio time with the professors. This eliminates teacher feedback and guidance during the creative process. Also, administration needs to work harder to provide a better gallery space In the city for the students."
College Freshman,1,No greek life at scad
College Sophomore,1,There isn't even a nurse office or health center on SCAD Atlanta campus. The medical response is terrible and is probably the worst part about this campus
College Freshman,1,I wish i lived on campus!
College Junior,1,"they have just one scholarship for actual students, and it is really difficult to get it. The other scholarships are offer just for new students in the application process."
College Sophomore,1,"No parties on campus, hard to find parties. Unless you are in the group no body knows about them."
College Junior,1,We do not have a Greek life
College Sophomore,1,bad bad bad bad there is nothing available. you will get no where
College Sophomore,1,"WASTE OF MONEY! There are so many better options out there. Its a dangerous city, the school has no connections to the real world you have to do everything yourself. Unless your major is Industrial Design or Interior Design get out of there as fast as you can. Many students transfer with a 40% rate of students not coming back... get a liberal art eduation and then go to art school for grad school."
College Sophomore,1,Just to have a friend stay over the night you have to fill out paper work and have them show their ID and visitors pass every time they go get something to eat or go into a dorm. Its also a dry campus so be careful smuggling alcohol in the dorms. If you get caught twice youre gone.
College Sophomore,1,Remember going to football games under the lights and cheering for your school and having fun with your friends? Well kiss that goodbye. Although there are sports they are a joke at scad. The students who are athletes are rude and unfriendly and think they're higher than everyone else except behind close doors everyones actually laughing at the athlete who committed to an art school for sports...
College Sophomore,1,Waste of money and time. You will spend hundreds on courses that have nothing to do with your major. Fashion Marketing students have the highest transfer rate as the school actually is very weak in this subject. It's a creative school for artists not for business students or anything outside of creating something.
College Sophomore,1,"Fashion Marketing is horrible at scad. Your freshman year you will not even see a piece of fashion as you are forced to sit in 2 and 1/2 hour drawing, painting and sculpting classes. The school is very weak in this area with no internships or anything available."
College Sophomore,1,"I feel that the off-campus dining options are too expensive to afford, I rather eat at the cafeteria or starve."
College Sophomore,1,It's an art school- that speaks for itself :)
College Sophomore,1,"I have maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout my freshmen year and have received no aid from the college.  On the other hand, I know students who are failing classes, with a 2.0 GPA, with $18,000 a year scholarships."
College Freshman,1,There is sadly no Greek life at SCAD
College Junior,1,There is no greek life at SCAD.
College Sophomore,1,"There are hardly ever any parking except maybe at the one freshman dorm which only freshman park at. They need to build a student parking area, not just at the dorms, or be a bit more lenient with the parking tickets. We pay enough for them to do that instead of using all the money on first class plane tickets."
College Sophomore,1,"Conan O'Brien once referred to the SCAD Bees Basketball team as the ""Fighting Acrylics."" So, not great."
College Sophomore,1,Our school wishes they had Greeks. We don't have those things.
College Sophomore,1,We never here about anything. No announcements. Students would love to hear about it too.
College Sophomore,1,I don't even think our school has Greek life....
College Freshman,1,people will not invite you to parties they are super secret. its rude.
College Senior,1,Athletics arent too much of a focus at SCAD with there being such a heavy workload
College Senior,1,"What nightlife? There are a handful of bars down town for those who like to drink, but aside from the tourist-driven places, the 'college bars' are pretty boring. It's better to stay in at a friend's house and hang out than go out."
College Senior,1,"Unless you are at one of the main freshman dorms, on-campus eating options are limited, and extremely expensive unless you have a meal-plan. In the building of my major (which is open 24/7) there is NO late-night dining options which is terrible because many students do not have cars - and our building is not in a very nice neighborhood, so walking down the street to the McDonald's is not a safe option. There is one snack and one drink vending machine in the entire building, and they are not always stocked."
College Senior,1,"Nobody really cares about sports teams at Art School, but the gym hours are pretty ridiculous, and there are no locker rooms. "
College Senior,1,"SCAD has buildings all over the city and parking is a nightmare at most. You normally have to pay for a parking meter for each class(if you can find a spot open), because there are usually only about 4-6 spots available that are usually taken by faculty. "
College Freshman,1,Campus dining is not all that great. The food is expensive and not good enough to cost that much. A lot of the time I would just get pizza because all the other food I tried was not that good at all.
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have much school spirt. Its an art school so you cant expect much. Everyones to busy!
College Sophomore,1,"The bottom line is that Savannah is very, very small, and many hours' drive from a real city.  There are so many things you just can't get here (no Trader Joe's or Ikea), for which there aren't good local substitutes.  Also, if you want a decent job or internship, you'll have to move to a larger city."
College Junior,1,"Even though our campus is very traverse when it comes to the diversity of students, the acceptance of a African American students is very poor when it comes to treatment and helpfulness to their need in both Academic and Financial Areas. Even though the campus itself is regard for churning out the Most creditable of workers, It seems that in the majority of the classes, students of minorities are less than helped by the professors and TAs when it comes to crucial teaching and practices in class work. The teachers show favoritism and often neglect students that ask for help that could either equate to passing or failing the class. As a whole, the entire program needs adjusting to allow equality for all students."
College Sophomore,1,"The driver's don't really know how to drive,  they also don't always stick to the schedule, but once you adjust to it all you can figure your way around."
College Freshman,1,There are too many girls for the amount of guys there are.
College Freshman,1,"Again, security is kind of a joke so drugs and stuff happen, just smell the air."

Junior,5,"The most caring environment you could ever experience on a college campus. The communication between students and staff is efficient, there is great collaboration between staff members.  The academic center is accessible to struggling students. There are resources for students to use during their academic journey."
Junior,5,"My first online class experience was very successful.  The syllabus was very clear and easy to follow. There were 2 discussion questions each week where I was able to respond to the questions and then read 3 or more discussions from other students and comment or provide feedback.  That provided a similar experience as though I was in a classroom discussing with other students on the subject.  The main assignment was due at the end of the week which was adequate time to turn in assignments. I like that this platform has a visual calendar that shows what assignments are due and when they are due so that you don't miss anything.  Great instructors, they communicate and provide video conferencing to discuss any challenges or curiousities that arise during the course timeline."
Niche User,5,"The new campus is beautiful and it is such a friendly environment. The counselors have been super helpful and communicate important information very well. I am a senior in high school and plan on playing beach volleyball at the college and can't wait to experience all of the amazing reasons why I chose the college: athletics, small environment, friendly teachers and students, it's gated campus, and faith."
Niche User,5,I would highly recommend Arizona Christian for those desiring to learn in a small atmosphere with instructors that know who you are.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman going into Arizona Christian. I don’t know much yet but,  from what I see and hear when I go to visit I am just at loss for words on how much they really care for students at this program. It is such a great thing to be apart of and I am happy that I will be attending ACU."
Junior,5,"Arizona Christian University is genuinely one of the friendliest campuses you will ever be a part of. People are always happy and are willing to have a conversation with anyone and everyone. The teaching staff is very knowledgeable and understands how it is to be a student-athlete. The library at ACU is a great place to get help on assignments and to find information on all classes. There are athletes everywhere you go, and this helps the dynamic of the ""student-athlete"" life.   Overall, the environment in which you will be in is stress-free and very helpful when it comes to academics."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a Sophomore at ACU. My experience has been great. This is a new adventure me because I am from California. The faculty, coaches and students make it a great place to be a part of."
Junior,5,"its a very healthy environment , an individual can really thrive. The professors are willing and very helpful. The students come from all backgrounds and get a long very well. This university is more involved in people's lives ; hands on. The people here lift each other up so much."
Alum,5,"Great environment with caring and friendly faculty and staff. I felt very welcomed when I first stepped into the school. Great variety of sports and extracurricular activities. They do focus on the Christian faith, but they don't force it onto their students. Being there I've grown so much in my studies, my athletics, and in my faith. Very grateful to have graduated there with endless memories and friendships."
Niche User,5,This school is really good and makes me study deeper into my biblical studies. Also the class sizes are so small I love it. The football team is great.
Freshman,5,"ACU is an awesome school. The students and professors are very nice, and the classes are really interesting."
Junior,5,"ACU is a wonderful school. The people are incredibly nice and the classes are both fun are challenging. The class sizes are very small, which allows you to get to know your professors and classmates, which is a huge advantage over larger universities. I have definitely grown in my faith since I started attending this school, and have received the academic preparation that I need for a career in my field. "
College Junior,5,"It is super safe and warm environment, don't have to worry about anything!"
College Junior,5,"Dorms are nice and clean, very beautiful interior and everything is new!"
College Junior,5,800 out of 1000 students are athletes! Do I have to say anything else?
College Freshman,5,The sports are great! Its so much fun being able to be apart of it.
College Freshman,5,It's only the best. I love everything about how I'm getting taught and the ways professors really engage.
College Freshman,5,I think it's awesome. The setup is awesome I love it :)

College Junior,5,We have career fairs every semester to help students get internships and jobs.
College Junior,5,We have a great safety security staff that are constantly walking around and making sure everything is okay.
College Junior,5,"I love the community we have at Arizona Christian University. The teachers are amazing, and because of the smaller class room setting you really get to take advantage of one on one time with the teacher. There has been much growth in my life since I started going to school at Arizona Christian University. It is truly a big blessing to be apart of such a amazing school."
College Junior,5,Campus Housing is the best!
College Freshman,5,"Awesome, chapels are the best!"
College Freshman,5,I love this college (Arizona Christian University). I have become so much closer to God and have become so much happier with everything. The people here are amazing and it's possibly my favorite thing about this school.
College Freshman,5,"There are no parties at ACU which I think is great. However, there are many events hosted such as worship nights and inter murals."
College Freshman,5,There are many great places nearby!
College Freshman,5,Arizona Christian University does a fantastic job on keeping our campus safe.
College Freshman,5,"We're in the middle of a hopping town! There's every fast food restaurant you can think of within a couple of miles. There's nice, sit-down restaurants, and also exotic bistros to try out.  Regardless of your price-range and taste preferences you can find the perfect spot to dine!"
College Senior,5,very easy and plenty of help from staff
College Senior,5,has my major and in depth studies
College Freshman,5,School spirit at ACU is through the roof!
College Junior,5,"Our school is so unique and you have to have an acquired taste for it.  It's super small and you won't get the typical college experience, but you will be so changed when you leave this school.  The facility and Christian worldview have such an amazing impact on it's students. You will grow so much in your relationship with Christ. Yeah we don't have the best facilities, or the best parties but we have something here that is special.  Our school is founded on a greater purpose, growing in our relationship with Christ."
College Junior,5,Everything is super close so you don't have to drive anywhere to get from class to class on campus.  All the food places are within 7 min so the drive is easy and close.
College Junior,5,"You feel like you still live at home with your parents when you are at our school, there is so many rules.  If you don't want as many rules, live off campus!!! They are super strict about girls and boys in the same room too."
College Junior,5,There is an entire mall just 7 min away from our school which provides great dining options cheep and expensive both. On our Student ID we have discounts to our favorite places that everyone goes. Go to duch-bros or chick-fil-a for sure!
College Junior,5,The workload is easy and the staff are the absolute best! The Christian worldview on Education helps us to remember why we teach.  Most students also get a job right after college.
College Junior,5,"I love the Education department at our school. It is one of the largest departments and has a small group of amazing faculty and staff. The work load is not too bad at all and the Christian world view and outlook makes wanting to be a teacher all that more amazing! 90% of the students that come out of the program also get jobs while they're student teaching, it's amazing!"
College Junior,5,The weather here is wonderful and because of that I like to be outside a lot doing things with people
College Sophomore,5,It is a very simple process. The summer going into my first year I filled out forms declaring my major and a couple of weeks before school was an orientation where you completed your schedule with an advisor. They had a recommended schedule already based on your major but you had the choice to make adjustments.
College Sophomore,5,The parking was improved as more space was opened up. It's free and no one is forced to park far from campus.
College Junior,5,The process of getting into my Music major was a breeze. I auditioned by singing a song I had prepared and took a written exam. They told me right after that I had made it into the Music program.
College Senior,5,"I am in the Biblical Studies major at ACU. It is a phenomenal program and I am challenged every day not only at school, but also in social life with others because of what I have learned. Because this program has challenged me, I can now challenge others to think critically about relevant topics in our culture."
College Junior,5,"It's Phoenix AZ. Sunny all day every day! It does get very warm, but that has never effected any event or sport."
College Senior,5,"Phoenix Sunshine...'Nuff Said – The weather in the Valley is gorgeous. It's warm all winter and outdoor activities are available all but a few days during the schoolyear. When it does rain, people go outside to dance in it because it is such a rare and exciting occasion. When the temperature hits the sixties, we all pull out our scarves and winter boots to wear with our t-shirts. It's the most beauitful place to go to school!"
College Senior,5,"So Many Options! Arizona Christian University is close to many of the great and unique dining places in Phoenix. From authentic ethnic restaurants, to streetside cafes and every fast-food place out there, you'll never have to look hard for a good place to eat."
College Junior,5,The dorms are definitely a great plus to this school! Very modern. Very clean. It was a enjoyable experience.
College Junior,5,"There are a lot of options to do at night. Such as hall events, hanging out with friends etc."
College Junior,5,IT has been the best experience for me1 I love the enviornment1
College Freshman,5,Good Education – The classes are thought provoking and really help students strive to impact the future very positively with information learned.
College Freshman,5,Safe and Sound – Great protection not a good fitness center though. small gym.
College Student,5,"Many to Use – There are many computers to use at Arizona Christian University, quantity is not the problem. The only thing that could be improved is the quality of the software on the computers themselves."
College Junior,5,"ACU is a place where students can come and develop among peers in a positive and uplifting manner. I personally know many members of the student body. As a matter of fact, as I'm sitting in the library I've had a minimum of 20 students walk that I know on a personal level. The genuine nature of my classmates is refreshing. Being a part of leadership now, we are striving to build up community in a way never-before seen."
College Freshman,5,Business Administration – The school is extremely helpful. The professors and the head department chairs are always available to discuss your course plan. They provide tons of opportunities to attain internships or anything along those lines. The workload is decent; they really prepare you for your future career.
College Freshman,5,"General Compus Aesthetics – Arizona Christian University (formerly Southwestern College) has an amazing atmosphere all around. Being a smaller-scale school, the community is fantastic. No matter what, people are going to support you, uplift you, and push you to do your absolute best. The availability for places to study/computer space may be limited, but it's well worth it to attend the school. Also, the school is located in the heart of Phoenix. There is a mall ten minutes away, as well as many restaurants, and a gas station right up the road with the best prices in the area. Many discounts with the ACU student ID, too! Definite plus, and I would recommend this school to anyone!"
College Sophomore,5,"You Barely Have to Lift a Finger – The financial aids at Southwestern College is so user friendly, that it is almost like the student doesn't have to do a thing. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help with any questions the student has."
College Junior,5,"Experience on Campus – As an Resident Assistant this year and Volleyball player, I have become very involved in the school and absolutely love it. The uniqueness of the small school community is awesome because it is fun to get to know majority of the people on a deeper level. The events that take place such as banquets, homecoming, or hall events is a good way to get people involved. If i had the choice to do it all over again, I definitely wouldn't change my decision."
College Junior,5,"Some people would say that the campus is strict but we see it in a different perspective. Because it is a small Christian college, their main goal is to hold everyone accountable for their actions. None of the rules are out of line or in place without a reason."
College Junior,5,"Overall the sports here are fun to watch. Because it is a small college, getting to know people is very easy, so getting to watch them is very fun! Majority of students who live on campus attend games and get the crowds excited!"
College Sophomore,5,"Christianity Is Everywhere – I go to a Christian college, so everyone believes the same thing. I love it because whenever someone has a problem or needs help, we can all set up a little prayer group and no one feels left out."
Senior,4,Arizona Christian University is a place that strives to reach and teach every student what living for Christ looks like. The staff and faculty put in alot of effort to ensure the experience at Arizona Christian University is welcoming and fun.
Senior,4,During the beginning of the pandemic outbreak ACU ensured all students were notified of the online transition. The professors were well equipped and willing to teach students the ins and outs of the new platform.
Freshman,4,"At the heart of Arizona Christian University truly is Jesus. I love how Tim, the pastor, is hands on and comes to events. It is a smaller school which is nice because classes are smaller and getting know people is easy."
Senior,4,Arizona Christian University is a great school because the teachers and staff really care about the students. They show it by reaching out to help all kinds of students no matter their circumstance. They tie faith into the courses and atmosphere of the school in a loving way which helps us students get through tough times.
Junior,4,"ACU is a good college to attend with a staff that truly cares about the students.  However, it can be fairly disorganized, and it is very small."
Sophomore,4,"Arizona Christian University is a very comfortable campus to be on and our culture is second to none.The way everyone conducts themselves is what makes it hard to even think about leaving.Being touch with the Word is what is the best part about it, the diversity of people make it to where your not left out no matter what the situation is."
Sophomore,4,"While attending Arizona Christian University, I can say that I have had such a great experience schooling wise, spiritually. I love the environment and the fact that we are expanding our campus , students, and staff. The staff members are very involved and you can tell that they love what they do for living. They have the students best interests at heart. At Arizona Christian University I had little knowledge of the Bible, but in two years I've learned so much more."
Junior,4,"Arizona Christian University is a small private christian school with great faculty and amazing teachers, they are every passionate and caring. I would recommend this school to people who have a passion for Christ."
Senior,4,"I came to ACU last year to help prolong my baseball career in college sports. Not only did I do that, but I was  able to improve not only in sports but within myself as well. With a small campus, you constantly see the same people throughout the campus, I improved my sociability within myself and got to make a lot of new friends while here because of it."
Sophomore,4,Haven't taken any classes yet but all the staff I have come into contact with always has a smile on their face and is very welcoming. I meet with the head of the financial aid department and she was very helpful and told me what I needed to fix on finical aid information. Also the football coaches are very respectful. The counselors are very helpful with planning your class schedules. They accommodate well for athletes and their time frames with practice and game schedules.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Arizona Christian has been very fun. I have met a diverse group of people from all over the world including Germany, Spain, Columbia, Mexico, and even France. As far as schooling goes, the professors are great. The school is a smaller campus which makes it easier to communicate with professors one on one to ask questions. Overall, you will be put in a great environment to succeed with great students and great community. If you're not a party person and would like to keep your priorities straight, ACU is the place for you."
Sophomore,4,"I wanted to attend a small Christian college. Arizona Christian is perfect. I'm on the baseball team but also find time for inter mural sports and pick-up basketball games. The campus is small but the people and professors are great! They also have most varsity sports such as football, basketball, soccer,  golf and more!"
Freshman,4,"Arizona Christian University is 100% dedicated to its students. The professors are fantastic, coaches are all amazing and every single person that works for the school is working toward the same goal. Although campus is small, it is very well taken care of. The dorms are always clean and the suites and rooms are all very big. ACU is a great place to start school if you are looking for a small university that is centerd around The Lord."
College Junior,4,"I think that having a degree from this school will be even better in the next couple of years, golden days are coming!"
College Senior,4,Professors are great and very passionate about God and what they are teaching.
College Senior,4,Drugs and alcohol are almost extinct on ACUs campus.
College Senior,4,I have noticed that all the professors are very passionate about the classes they are teaching and really involve the students due to the small class sizes. They do a really good job of not making it a waste of time.
College Senior,4,They do a good job at ACU.
College Senior,4,"From my experience looking at the housing, it looks great! First time I've ever see a dorm room with an oven and stove inside of it. Spacious and clean as well."
College Freshman,4,campus housing is amazing!i love it! its very great
College Freshman,4,Greek life is an important event that most people do.
College Freshman,4,Great very loving school. The teachers seem nice.
College Freshman,4,"They really care. This school wants to help you, they want you to thrive in life."
College Freshman,4,I don't think it is a problem on our campus at all and if it was to be it would be dealt with very well!
College Freshman,4,I think our athletic department rocks!!!
College Freshman,4,Everyone essentially wants what's best for everyone and they will deliver that.
College Junior,4,"Football games, basketball games, you name it. Our school has a big heart for support. Each home game is important and many students go out to support the teams. Some of the best memories are made during these games."
College Junior,4,It is a great school!
College Freshman,4,We have campus security around 24/7
College Freshman,4,There is very little to no crime at this school. We have campus security that will make rounds and have phone numbers that we can call for whatever emergency.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy living on campus. I really enjoy the size of the dorms and how close it is to my classes. The cost is very high.
College Senior,4,"I feel very safe on campus. However, there is little (that I am aware of) to provide a safe place for students who are victims of crimes, assault, abuse, etc. on campus. We have a campus counselor, but that is all I am aware of."
College Senior,4,"It's pretty good. There are a lot of people who come on campus to recruit; however, I have not experienced a faculty member being intentional about helping another student find an internship or career opportunity."
College Senior,4,"I don't live on campus so I don't have much of an opinion. However, from my experience, the residence hall is a great facility and there is a huge emphasis on community within the residents."
College Senior,4,"There is a large emphasis on students participating in and encouraging their fellow students in every area of extracurricular activities, including sports."
College Senior,4,"Arizona Christian University is a great school that offers many classes in a growing number of programs. Every class it taught from a Biblical worldview and with an emphasis on Christ. 

The major drawbacks are the lack of online courses and the lack of class availability per semester."
College Freshman,4,I think they do a great job and I feel safe!
College Freshman,4,"Although I did not live on campus, I stayed with a couple of my friends who did a couple of times and I thought they were nice."
College Freshman,4,"I was blessed with the scholarships offered, but tuition is just so expensive either way."
College Freshman,4,There are many restaurants that are all around our school.  They range from nice to casual.
College Freshman,4,If attending ACU I would definitely recommend living off campus.
College Freshman,4,Plenty of different places to go no matter what you are looking for.
College Sophomore,4,The security staff are always visible and I have not had any problems.
College Freshman,4,"Extremely clean, spacious, and inviting. The only downside is that it's expensive."
College Sophomore,4,We have campus safety working all day and night.
College Freshman,4,They are pretty good about it.
College Freshman,4,There are nice attractive people.
College Freshman,4,I don't go to bars or clubs much.
College Freshman,4,I think they are all great buildings.
College Freshman,4,I wouldn't mind living in Phoenix
College Freshman,4,It seems fine to me
College Freshman,4,I am pretty happy with my dorm.
College Freshman,4,Off-Campus Dining is pretty great and convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are great, fairly new, and spacious."
College Sophomore,4,This campus is strictly a dry campus- meaning no alcohol or drug use permitted.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a great variety of majors to choose from. The professors at ACU are helpful, and are Christians as well so they are there for you to help you with academics, or even counseling. Most of the professors pray before class begins and its just a great Christian environment. One popular major at Arizona Christian University is Music."
College Sophomore,4,"Fairly diverse, and it’s primarily a Christian University, so most of the students are Christian."
College Sophomore,4,Just typical fast food and chain restaurants near-by.
College Senior,4,so safe . 1 big family
College Senior,4,depends on who u know
Freshman,2,It’s very pricey for what they have to offer. It’s overpriced for being a Christian school. I was promised many things that were to happen but none were given. There is no security what so ever. Anyone walks on campus
Freshman,2,"This school offered my son a football half ride to play there. Well they moved to a bigger campus which use to be a small military airbase. Well I came from CA to do a visit to there new campus. I see about 7 different coaches and the head coach never spoke to me. about 40 kids showed up.They broke us up in about four groups. Then they told us their faith and what the school meant to them. After that we went on a 45 minute stall tour and they fed us cold pizza for lunch. We went into the coaches office were we meant with one of his asst coaches who told me we get 14k off are tution. It was 9k per simester when all said and done total 18k per year in a small school of 600 kids. Most of the kids there were athletes of some sport, so that was strange. I say half rides is a scam. Academicley they had a small list of majors. I mean I seen more choices at your local community college."
College Freshman,2,there always up your ass about rules. they expect everyone to be sheltered at this place for 4 years. but once the shelter kids leave they don't know how to interact with people not like them
College Freshman,2,"There are snitches everywhere, you can not get away with anything."
College Freshman,2,There is not a good atmosphere. I feel judged and don't feel like its a community.
College Freshman,2,"There were some major issues at the beginning of the semester with contacting the financial aid department. They would not return phone calls and I didn't get things sorted out until after the semester had already started. I wasn't even requesting financial aid, I was trying to opt out of a loan!"
College Junior,2,"Our gym is small and the sports teams all have to compete for the one gym, our SAC or student center is great and hold 90% of the classrooms. Our library is super small.  We have fun campus events and they're well publicized. Students usually hang out in the SAC, Café, dorms, at the outside tables or in the library."
College Senior,2,Small school and athletes are usually frowned upon.
College Senior,2,"Only one caffeteria and place to eat available. Not bad, but little selection and often same things."
College Senior,2,"The campus is small, because they started out small. Now that they've done a whole bunch of marketing and improvements, they have more students than the campus can really cater to. It's crowded in the library, and there aren't a ton of open quiet spaces inside to work on a laptop. If you have a dorm room you're okay, but commuters typically have to study off campus."
College Senior,2,"They're so flooded with the influx of students, that they cannot process paperwork fast enough on their out of date systems. They'll be moving to Jenzebar this year, which was definitely paid for by raised tuition, room and board, and pretty much fees across the bar. Expect tuition to keep going up. Hopefully you won't have to wait 2.5 hours the first 3 weeks of school to see 1 of 2 financial advisers. Make appointments early, and keep checking."
College Senior,2,"It is almost non existent, however it is not hard to find a group of people that consistently get together and make their own.  Although the school polices behavior pretty strictly, students will always find a way to circumnavigate those rules."
College Senior,2,"Strict is an understatement.  In being a private university, Arizona Christian has the freedom to police who you invite to your dorms, what pictures you put on your facebook, and the language you use."
College Senior,2,"I think our school needs to stop raising tuition and spending the money on ""free"" Ipads for currently enrolled and incoming students. I think rather the tuition should not be raised, and if raised there should be more scholarships involved rather than free Ipads!"
College Junior,2,"This Is a Christian School – This is a Christian university, so if there are different orientations, beliefs, political stands, it causes a lot of tension between people as well as gossip."
College Freshman,2,"Strictness Is Quite Ridiculous – The school is pretty strict. We have a slight dress code for the length of shorts and spaghetti straps. The dorms are closed to opposite sexes, unless its one of the 4 nights in the week it's open from 6pm-10pm. They are not lenient whatsoever on skipping classes. If you miss 4 in one class, it is an automatic letter drop off your grade."
College Freshman,2,"Wouldn't Suggest It – The only reason I would vote ""no"" with off-campus housing is that you have to be 22 to live off-campus without a parent, and it would be a little pricy. The area is just south of Scottsdale, and just north of a not-so-good part of downtown Phoenix. On-campus is probably the best choice. The suites are amazing and roomy, the beds are comfortable, and there are two showers in each room as well as a fridge, microwave oven, and a toaster. On-campus is affordable and feels like an apartment anyhow."
Freshman,1,"I never took online courses, just in person and they were TERRIBLE. Teachers did not care if their students did well."
Freshman,1,"WORST SCHOOL EVER!! Professors genuinely do not care about their students and do not provide resources to make sure they are successful. I was disappointed in the Christian aspect as well, Professors and students were SUPER judgmental and hypocritical. In my opinion they were all fake Christians. They put on a show and would pretend to be Godly people but in reality were nasty and judgmental people."
Junior,1,"This school is a joke! The res life is strict and find every way to fine you. The food at the school is terrible. The classes are not hard and the school feels more like a high school. The college experience is poor. The school is so strict that its more like a prison/cult then a college. The schools slogan is ""Transforming Culture with Truth"" but the school is more interested in Money then their few students. They have a very high transfer rate because the school lacks what students need to thrive in college. The dorms have poor working wifi if they even have wifi at all."
Freshman,1,"If Bible's your thing, this school is for you I guess... There's two chapels to attend every week for no credits and this university requires volunteer hours. What is this, elementary/ middle school? If you fail, there is a $375 fine to pay and an F on your transcript. 

On top of that, the staff at this university is so unorganized. Not worth the money or time to attend this school. The people here can be quite judgmental if you don't act or do things their way. ""Christians"" all the way... even if some are just superficial Christians on the surface they judge just the same if not harsher.  

The dorms are ridiculous. Even if you petition because you can drive and live near the school, they won't let you. You have to pay for meal plan that sucks and never know the menu  before apparently technology and uploading things students should know on the school website is not this school's thing."
College Sophomore,1,A degree from ACU is basically meaningless. Your better off going anywhere else in Arizona.
College Sophomore,1,"Academically, ACU is a joke. It's very difficult to find rigorous courses to take, and tuition is very expensive. Save your money and go to another school."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus safety is probably better than what you'd find at most schools, but worse than you would expect for a Christian school."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus housing is awful, and way too expensive. Do yourself a favor and go to a different school."
College Sophomore,1,"Athletics at ACU are underfunded, and the teams really aren't that good."
College Sophomore,1,"My experience at Arizona Christian University has been awful. High school was much more academically challenging; a degree from ACU isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The facilities at the school are just embarrassingly bad for an actual university, and the WiFi never works. Not only that, but it's ridiculously expensive relative to what you get out of the degree. ACU has the highest tuition of any school in the state with the lowest academic standards. If I could go through my college applications as a high school senior again, there's no way I'd choose ACU. If ACU appeals to you because it is a Christian school in Arizona, I strongly encourage you to go to Grand Canyon University instead."
College Senior,1,No such thing as parties at ACU.
College Freshman,1,its nonexistent. people judge you if you go out. many would rather just play card games and be ok with that instead of getting somewhat  out of their comfort zone
College Freshman,1,it sucks. people snitch all the time. you can't tell anyone anything without it get around to the whole school. kids act like they're in middle school by the way they are quick to tell on you
College Freshman,1,I do not get into the party scene because I do not like being around people that drink and do illegal stuff.
College Freshman,1,There is no/or very little and boring party scene
College Freshman,1,Food is gross. Mistake pork chops for chicken and many other alarming factors. There is no variety.
College Junior,1,"There is nothing going on at our school because you are not allowed to drink, you're not allowed to have inappropriate parties and so the most exciting thing that might be going on is a prayer group. haha"
College Junior,1,We have this tiny parking lot that I pay $50 to park in and end up parking on the street every single day!!! It's terrible!
College Freshman,1,"On campus and off campus living is in the control of the school. You sign a no drug or alcohol contract at the beginning of the year, regardless of age. There are set hours for coed visitation, and you are expected to dress a certain way and listen to a certain type of music."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life.

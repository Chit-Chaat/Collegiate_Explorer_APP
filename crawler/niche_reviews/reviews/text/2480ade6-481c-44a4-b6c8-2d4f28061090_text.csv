Junior,5,I have taken online classes most of the time I’ve been at Cameron and I usually love them and learn well from them.
Junior,5,What I like about Cameron University is that it’s a great school that is affordable. The people are genuinely amazing and the professors actually care.
Sophomore,5,Online proffers I’ve had have all been great. They have all been easy to communicate with and very helpful.
Sophomore,5,I love the involvement that is provided for the students. It is really nice being able to be involved.
Sophomore,5,"I’ve had an amazing experience with Cameron University this far. I haven’t had any school experience since I graduated high school ten years ago but Cameron has made this process easy and have been very helpful. I have recently made the Presidents Honor Roll, and I am very proud and grateful to have achieved that. Cameron University has provided me with many wonderful resources towards furthering my education and my career."

I have recently made the Presidents Honor Roll, and I am very proud and grateful to have achieved that. Cameron University has provided me with many wonderful resources towards furthering my education and my career."
Freshman,5,"Everyone was well. There is no trouble among campus and the professors work hard to teach. Cameron is taking the procedures for the virus seriously, requiring masks to be worn or any type of shield and are promoting their concern for the safety of their students openly. Cameron is a very clean campus and very open to breathe in."
Sophomore,5,"Cameron University has been a great school to attend for the last year. I am entering my second year here and I have already learned so much and made many friendships with fellow students and faculty. My professors and Instructors have been so understanding with me and always make sure I understand what we are discussing before moving on, but also makes sure we put in the appropriate work to succeed."
Freshman,5,"The administration people have been so helpful and resourceful. If they did not have the information, they provided the names and emails of people who could help."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is very open and inviting, it a great smaller campus where you really get to know your classmates and professors. There is a large diversity and several clubs to join depending on your liking."
Niche User,5,"I love all of the resources that are available to the students there. The professors  are excellent, diverse, and are willing to work with you. The classes are small, which is a plus for me. The school is very organized, which is not something that every school is able to accomplish. There is a wide variety of majors and minors to choose from, and there are several organizations that you can join. All in all, the school is excellent."
Junior,5,I enrolled at Cameron University in August 2019. I have been very pleased with all of the professors help and knowledge. This college is very friendly. The commute is about 45 minutes for me to travel to Cameron.
Sophomore,5,The teachers here really care about the students. Most schools I went to only care about the paycheck.
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time at Cameron University mainly because of the professors. I have found that the university's professor's truly care about their students' success and are willing to work with individual's schedules for extra practice.
Freshman,5,Cameron University has a inviting feel at their campus. The small class sizes help the adjustment from high school to college much easier. I would pick Cameron over any other school because it is now my home.
Sophomore,5,"Cameron is a great University for those who like smaller class sizes, and great teachers. Students of all ages, including many veterans, work hard for their future careers."
Freshman,5,"I love how much help and support they have to surround the students! Free tutoring hours, kind teachers, and multiple events throughout the year. You quickly begin to feel surrounded by close friends, even family."
Niche User,5,I would like to see Cameron get a football team.  Cameron use to have a great football team. They even went to the Rose Bowl. I met some of the previous coaches. I think it is about time they look into getting another football team to represent the school and the community. I think they would be a good division two team. They would be number one. I have faith and hope that one day they will consider getting a team again.  Cameron is a good school they have some community support. But they need to change some of their academic programs to keep up with other schools in the state of Oklahoma. The campus is great and Fort Sill is a great military community that utilizes Cameron University.
Freshman,5,"I start Cameron University in fall but just going to my orientation, I can tell I’m going to be happy there. The staff and introduction made me feel happy to be there. Getting my classes in place was easy so I’m happy to call myself an Aggie."
Freshman,5,It’s an amazing college and I look forward to going to class everyday. I have just began my summer courses at the duncan campus and the teachers really care if you understand what their teaching or not. They want to help you and they are interested in the subject they’re teaching.
Sophomore,5,"As I just finished up my first year of College I honestly loved it! I couldn't have asked for a better roommate or ""dorm mom"". I was scared to leave home but by the end of the year I wasn't ready to leave my ""home"" and all of my ""sisters"". Cameron does a good job having things for us to do at night while taking breaks from studying. I recommend everyone who is looking for a good school to give Cameron and the dooms a try! I can't wait for August to hurry up and lots of sleepovers with my favorite girls."
Niche User,5,"Clean and the staff is friendly. They have multiple opportunities fitting different people and their needs. Professors are well trained, they have a sense of awareness."
Freshman,5,"The campus and small and easy to find all of the classes and get from class to class on time. The education is excellent, and the staff is very friendly."
Niche User,5,"I know MANY people that have gone there and they turn out very intelligent and well rounded individuals! Many courses that are needed everywhere.
The town is very loyal to it's University! 
Students are very active in the community and are proud of their school!"
Sophomore,5,I love that Cameron is so committed to helping it’s students succeed both educationally and socially. Being a single mom of 2 boy the flexible schedules allow me to further my education while still being able to work and provide for my family. I never thought I would get the chance to make it through college but Cameron university has made that possible.
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity and small school feel of Cameron University! It’s also a plus that because of the small class sizes the teachers know your name.
Freshman,5,"Being a freshman, first time college student this school was so easy to connect with every one was so friendly and very helpful. The school isn't that big so its not hard for you to get lost. The professors are very very helpful and informative and really strive to see you pass their course, Lawton being a military town it's very diverse and so many ethinictys and backgrounds so I didn't feel out of place at all."
Sophomore,5,Cameron University is an amazing college to attend to. It is a very affordable place for higher education. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I have learned a lot from this place and it is a very pleasant place for learning.
Junior,5,"This is close to home so that I did not have to stay on campus. I am an older student so this college was a good choice.  Cameron University offers a lot of different academic choices and it fit my needs to a certain point. I would love to see Cameron University offer a 4 year degree plan for engineering. Unfortunately, Cameron only offers a 2 year degree plan for. All of the staff at Cameron is very helpful and is dedicated to making sure students are successful."
Graduate Student,5,"Really nice campus and GREAT instructors for my field of study.   I have learned so much and they are accommodating  for disabled individuals like myself.  However, there is no type of grants or scholarships for Grad students."
Freshman,5,Cameron University is a wonderful university to attend. Teachers are wonderful and there are many advisors and resources to help with student life
Freshman,5,"It is a very active and lively campus. Not only is it a great place for education but it is also a great place to connect, hang out, and make new friends from many different places."
Sophomore,5,"For anyone who wants a small-town setting, Cameron is the place! With classrooms no more than 40, you're able to get one-on-one helps from your teachers and even classmates! Everyone is nice and has a smile on their face for being that the safest college in Oklahoma. Teachers are understanding with nontraditional students and want nothing more than to see you grow! We have different types of learning centers with free tutors for most classes. I've grown so much at Cameron. Not only as a student, but as a young woman becoming a productive member a society."
Sophomore,5,I love this school. The faculty members are also willing to help and answer questions without making you feel dumb for asking. The campus always stayed clean. The campus is just the right size to walk across campus to your next class without feeling rushed. If I had not had to have relocated I would love to have finished college here.
Sophomore,5,Cameron is a great college. It is affordable compared to other colleges. As Cameron is a great school that has a different range of different cultures.
Freshman,5,Cameron has been an amazing school to attend. The class room settings are small which allow the professors to get to know each student. This is nice because most major universities do not allow this to happen because classes are huge.
Niche User,5,"For what I have been able to experience from Cameron was more than exceptional. The campus and all features of Cameron Are Beautiful. The hospitality of the people I
Met was very inspiring . It is very close to home and is in walking distance of most local stores and restaurants. Overall I enjoyed everything about Cameron University."
Freshman,5,Very nice people and the professors are helpful and the small college allows you to easily communicate with your professors.
College Sophomore,5,So far every professor I have had at Cameron has been passionate about their jobs and the courses they are teaching. The class sizes are perfect because they are fairly small and it seems like a more one on one which is perfect for learning.
College Sophomore,5,The campus security is excellent. There is constant patrol and people always on call.
College Sophomore,5,The Greek life on campus is awesome! Everyone is very easy to get along with and are not viewed badly.
College Freshman,5,I had a professor  by the name of Mary reynolds she was the best at teaching math .
College Freshman,5,They have security on campus
College Freshman,5,I have been to a couple different colleges but I have never experienced the support that I do from cameron. The advisors are great! And so are the professors  they try to do anything they can to help you be sucessful in what your trying to accomplish.
College Sophomore,5,"I really appreciate every teacher that has taught me at Cameron. I learn new things in every course. Professors are different, but they all have one common goal, to enlighten students in an area of study. I have never had a class where it was too many students. There are a variety of interesting courses available."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on campus. There is a police station on campus, so there is no drama. Police patrol campus throughout the day to make sure everything is going well, as usual."
College Sophomore,5,"I am elated to be attending Cameron University. Cameron University is unique because it offers everything a huge university would, for less tuition. I would attend Cameron over and over and over, which I plan to do (Master's)."
College Junior,5,It is easy to get the classes I want.
College Junior,5,Campus police checks the campus regularly. There are alarms everywhere. I feel safe on campus.
College Junior,5,The instructors are available and helpful.
College Freshman,5,Health is a big deal
College Student,5,I love the school I currently attend. It is not to small or to big so you get the individual atttention you may need.
College Sophomore,5,I love Cameron because I am sure to have one on one time with professors if necessary.
College Senior,5,Lawton has quite a variety of places to eat and different cuisines.
College Senior,5,The administration is fairly decent.
College Senior,5,I received any financial aid quickly with no hassle.
College Freshman,5,you have a  great variety of choices
College Freshman,5,That is not a problem at  cameron
College Freshman,5,i like it because  my major you learn almost a variety of thing out of it
College Freshman,5,Very involved in the community
Freshman,4,I have not taken any classes online but I have heard that the professors are just as serious through screen as they are in person.
Sophomore,4,"The online classes were sometimes more to handle than in-person classes. They have discussion boards that took up a lot of time. With that being said, I have enjoyed most of my online classes so far."
Junior,4,"The online portion of Cameron is not terrible at all. The professors know how to work well with their online courses, and they continue to update their students throughout the semester. From my experience my professors have worked well with me and I have had no struggles with an online course."
Freshman,4,Cameron university is an excellent option for those looking for an affordable degree. This is especially the case for those looking for a future in psychology or nursing.
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, decent amenities for a small university, public transit, large choice of groups, sororities/fraternities, clubs and organizations to join. The professors work closely with students, setting them up for success and helping them with any issues. Very caring and compassionate staff. Lowest tuition of any 4 yr university in the state of Oklahoma."
Freshman,4,"I am a concurrent student at Cameron University and I love the school. The professors are great, they are willing to work with you. The classes aren't very big either, so the professor will get to know you throughout the year. Cameron isn't very far from my house, so the drive isn't very bad, and the community around the school is really great. The school is so diverse! I love Cameron University and so will you!"
Niche User,4,I learned a lot in my English Composition class that improved my skills which made my job t my internship much easier.
Sophomore,4,"It was an easy process. However, this is the only college I had to pay to apply for. The others were free."
Niche User,4,"What I like about Cameron University is the requirements for my Business degree and that it is close to home, so that I do not have to worry about traveling far and it seems easier to reach out to teachers for help in my education. I live about an hour away from the university and I get to visit my hometown whenever I am free. I plan on going to the college right after community college in my hometown to complete my Business degree and hopefully get into entrepreneurship in the future!"
Junior,4,"Cameron is a small University with a large feel.  Its in Lawton Ok, which is home to the Ft Sill Army base.  Because Lawton is a small Army town many of the students at Cameron are current or former military.  The campus is quaint and inviting.  Most people are very friendly.  There are several clubs to get involved with on and off campus.  The college attempts to offer most classes found at bigger universities. The class sizes are small enough that you don.t feel lost. Most professors are helpful and make time for students after class.  Cameron is very affordable and offers a plethora of activities. Its a great place to attend."
Niche User,4,"Cameron university - while I do not actively attend - is an amazing campus. All of the staff persons and students there are exceptionally nice, and you never live more than 15 minutes away from home. It is centrally located in Lawton, and is in a place of extreme convenience for its students."
Sophomore,4,"Cameron University has been good to me as my first college. The campus isn’t the biggest, but that makes it easy to navigate. Most of the people I’ve met are friendly and the professors are great. As a nursing student, the science department is excellent with lots of knowledgeable teachers. I’m glad to have studied here."
Freshman,4,"I loved how beautiful the campus is and how small the classrooms are. By the classrooms being so small, the students are able to build great relationships with their professors."
Junior,4,"Cameron is small but very nice. There have been one or two professors that I did not care for, but most of my profeesors are excellent. The campus is pretty and clean and the library is nice."
Niche User,4,I like how the staff as Cameron-Duncan are really helpful and  eager to help the students in anyway possible and really encourage us to take part in their activities. The teachers are willing to help as much as possible and the mentors are more than willing to help the students succeed.
Freshman,4,"Cameron has made me feel at home. I am only a concurrent student, however they have made me feel welcomed in so many was. Even made me think 
I should stay home and go to Cameron."
Freshman,4,"This college is a place that has lots of different degrees to follow with a manageable tuition. They offer multiple scholarships, and the staff is professional. If you are bored or have lots of time between classes, they also offer over 15 on-campus events a week."
Sophomore,4,"Cameron is a good school in order to easily obtain a business major.  Most of my classes are online, and the advisors are willing to work with you and your classes."
Freshman,4,I love the student to teacher ratio. You really get to know your professors and they love to help you.
Freshman,4,The Grounds and overall appearance of the school is very nice and peaceful. I have not met a teacher or instructor that wasn't willing to help in someway.
Junior,4,"Great school, Lawton is known as a rough town but the school is great and in a good part of town. The staff is usually pretty good as well."
Sophomore,4,"While I transferred from a different school; my time in Cameron University was a pleasant experience. The professors were nice and willing to assist in any problems you had with your school work. However, there isn't much of a party scene and the location isn't very developed. Outside of school there isn't much. If you are the type of person that likes something like that it might be boring to decent. If you don't care about parties and such, it is a very decent school."
Freshman,4,It's honestly a great school to attend and everyone is very welcoming and supportive! The campus is well kept and its really great after a bad day to walk around and there are so many smiling people who don't realize that just a simple small makes such a huge difference in someones day!
Sophomore,4,Very good atmosphere diverse campus. Staff very helpful and the classroom size is great so one is able to get one on one with instructor if needed.
Senior,4,I really love the school! Classes are small which means you can get one on one attention with the professor. All the staff is really nice and helpful. With everyone being nice it just makes the environment positive and comfortable to be around.
Alum,4,Cameron University is an excellent accredited college with a diverse student population and faculty. The university is aptly located in a city that is perfectly balanced to offer students an environment conducive for study and yet offer recreational activities to relieve the stress of studies. There is easy access to transportation and the county hospital is located opposite the university. The university offers many options for studies and is always expanding into other disciplines.
Freshman,4,"As I have just finished up my freshman year, I can say that the university is a recommendable one. The campus, the professors, and the courses are worthy of any degree -- I would however like to see the Art department attended to. Better resources and rooms are needed, as well as a couple professors. There is a lack of instructors and the existing problem of the wrong instructors misguidedly teaching other classes."
Sophomore,4,Cameron is a very small school so you get the chance at a lot of one on one interaction with you and your professors.  I have only had one professor that I did not like my entire time here at Cameron.  The professors are always helpful and nice and most of them honestly love their job so they make it interesting.
Sophomore,4,It is a really great university. Some professors are really helpful where others are not. The food is okay. The directors do a fine job.
Sophomore,4,"My name is Yauheniya Shviadok, I am from Belarus, it is my  second year in Cameron University, so far it's been a great experience. Overall college life and campus are very different from what I used to see back home. There are a lot of international students here, so I wasn't surprised when professors where really nice to me and wanted to help me with anything they could just to make my life in Cameron easier. All students are very friendly and always give you a helping hand in case you need it. So far it has been a great decision to come here, I am not regretting anything"
College Junior,4,Everyone does there best to be as helpful as possible its a big plus for the university.
College Junior,4,"It is a well rounded university that has a great diversity of students and instructors alike deffently on my top ten list 3rd out of my top 3 being O.U. Then Austin, Then Cameron University in Lawton."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't personally done anything with career services on campus but I have heard nothing but great things.
College Sophomore,4,I love where I live on campus. It is great and very great place to live.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not ,personally, a huge sports person but the athletics at our school is great."
College Sophomore,4,I love my school. They have been very helpful in everything that I have needed or done. I feel like I am getting a great education.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are great and easy to talk to. At the Duncan campus the courses are great and exciting but definitely challenging. Cameron University has classes offered in class, online, ITV, and hybrid. Class sizes are small but it makes learning easier."
College Sophomore,4,"A course was required as incoming freshmen that highlighted the dangers on campus such as drug, alcohol, and sexual assault."
College Sophomore,4,"Cameron University located in Duncan was the best choice for me. The size of the college makes accessing classes and professors easier than a larger campus. With fewer students in classes each individual gets to speak ones mind without feeling intimidated which one might feel compared to a larger class. I would choose Cameron University again if I could do it all over, because of the meaningful friendships I had made through the semesters and the level of dedication and commitment that I have obtained due to attending the Duncan campus."
College Sophomore,4,It is a great college with a amazing atmosphere. The teachers will do anything in their power to help when we are having trouble on something.
Recent Alumnus,4,Cameron is definitely an option for a lot of people.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I would say Cameron is better than okay. Don't hesitate to choose Cameron if it looks like a good fit for you academically. It's not tiny but it's small, so don't expect it to be similar to a huge flagship university. Lawton has 100 000 people, so don't expect that you are going to a place like Manhattan or Miami. Some classes are hard, some are easy, but I found the professors were very approachable and worked with you. They wanted you to do well. Classes were usually pretty small."
College Junior,4,I feel as though there is plenty of availability in the local area for my field of study
College Junior,4,I enjoy my classes and always feel like the professors want you to succeed
College Junior,4,I personally have not heard of security issues.
College Junior,4,Greek life is present and helpful to the community.
College Junior,4,"The classes are usually 25 to 40 students, which makes it great for student/professor involvement. The professors/instructirs want to see you succeed and offer up any help. The school offers tutoring and online sources. I love it!"
College Student,4,I would rate it this way from the way the professors are considerate of students personal lives.
College Student,4,I enjoy the overall experince with the nice and upkept football stadium along with the helpful professors.
College Student,4,I have only been on the Cameron University field for the marching contest i have competed in but from what i have noticed is that it is well maintained.
College Student,4,My experience at Cameron University was and is an enjoyable one considering the professors help you if you need it from english to math but even if they cannot help the point you in the direction of the tutor.
College Freshman,4,A few of my classmates have gotten jobs right after their intership.
College Junior,4,"The teachers say that once you can get a degree from the school, a high number of students go on to get great jobs in the field.  While this may have been true in the past, the declining job market in the united states is making it increasing difficult to find work after college."
College Junior,4,"Hardly any crime on campus, never heard of anything happening to the students here."
College Junior,4,In my own personal experience the school as done well to teach me what I've gone to learn.  I feel however that the school is not preparing me for a job using the skills taught to us.
College Student,4,"Most professors are great, some are awful."
College Freshman,4,"I didn't plan to go to school while I was in highschool but, they have a program called ""Open Doors"" to help high school  adolescents chose the correct paths."
College Freshman,4,very diverse with different race and ethnicity
College Freshman,4,the curriculum is really good for a small school
College Junior,4,So far professors are knowledgeable in their fields and most seem willing to help. class sizes are prefect not to big.
College Freshman,2,Girls were loud and living on the first floor sucked
College Junior,2,"Very specific to who can join, and almost no awareness to for them."
College Freshman,2,no form of late night events
College Junior,2,I say bad because it is really non- existent at Cameron.
College Sophomore,2,"You're not getting a full experience. Education is not quality, food is mostly fast food and not healthy, and nothing to do in the surrounding area."
College Sophomore,2,"There's hardly anything to eat here if it isn't fast food or typical a diner restaurant. The only ""exotic"" food we have is Panda express, the Chinese food at the mall (the best place for Chinese if it isn't Panda or the Hibachi Buffet...), the tiny Thai food place, and the Korean Buffet (REALLY good). We also, have Kobe and a few Japanese restaurants but they open late, are on the whole other side of town, or just questionable??? I'm dying for actual good and diverse food but there is none!"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't attend parties but everyone talks about how little and bad the parties are at my campus. People actually go to other campuses for parties, which I hear are pretty good."
College Junior,2,"Takes a lot of time, need lots of information"
College Sophomore,2,Not much information provided on any of these topics.
College Sophomore,2,"There are several homes for rent and sale due to the high military turnover in the area, however the cost of the rentals are extremely high for the area. Lawton has no main attraction and there really isn't a center of the city, everything is on one strip (Cache Rd.). I would say live on-campus if at all possible."
College Sophomore,2,"Getting into this school was very easy, however the requirements thereafter are ridiculous. Cameron requires you to complete a computer efficiency course as well as a University Life Success course prior to graduation, also these courses must be completed within two semesters of your initial semester. I find this ridiculous because I am a transfer student and also a supervisor in the Army. Why is it a requirement for a Junior and a mid-level NCO in the military required to take a computer class and university life course. 

I wanted to join the pre-law program; although you are able to visit the school website and see Dr. Longoria as being the point of contact, he/she is no longer employed at the school so there is no pre-law program as advertised. I have actually spoken to the Department Head and she informed me that they have no idea when/if this program would return. So as of right now, any student that is seeking LSAT guidance or internships within the law program, we are left out and left in the wind because Cameron has failed to recruit or employ any assistance for them. 

Although admission is easy, you are nickle and dimed once you enroll in your courses. The books are outrageously expensive and although you pay math lab fees, you are required to purchase an online account with Pearson for over $100 which totals one math course around $300 in most cases."
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus dining options aren't close to the campus at all. All restaurants are primarily on Cache and Gore and only on the west-side of the city.  The majority of restaurants are fast food chains and very fattening (Burger King, Taco Bell, Jack-in-the-Box, Mooyah, Wendy's etc.). There are a few good rib joints but other than that its pretty worthless place to live."
College Junior,2,"Where do I start? Well, College Night at the bars does not ever end well. They let in people that are not in our college, and these people are the ones that cause an uproar. I can count two instances when gunshots were fired and more where fights broke out. Parties here are either a hit or a miss. This was all this year, 2014. Parties here in 2013 were way better. The baseball team used to throw them."
College Junior,2,"Quality is not what you would expect of an institution calling itself a ""university."" Professors are either barely qualified to teach or completely incompetent. Powerpoint lectures and unanswered questions are the norm in most classes."
College Junior,2,Financial Aid? The staff here are as a whole incompetent. Huge hassle to get financial aid and in-state tuition.
College Junior,2,High prices and low quality selection will most likely keep you on campus.
College Junior,2,The only healthy options are McAlister's and Atlanta Bread...
College Junior,2,Really pathetic in this category. No housing and Greeks are basically non-existent.
College Junior,2,"The local area of Lawton is rather remote. There are a couple of coffee shops, but definitely not the feel of a 'college town.'"
College Junior,2,"If it were good, there would be a bigger uproar about it I'd imagine; I hardly know that we have teams."
College Junior,2,"I have lived in this town for a majority of my life and it has grown a lot, but now going to the local college I feel as if Lawton, OK isn't a college friendly town. Cameron is known for being a commuter school, so I feel that since many people commute from their hometowns to school the atmosphere of these town is focused more on that aspect. There isn't much for students do off campus besides go to the local shopping centers or go to the wild life refuge."
College Junior,2,"I was able to get loans and grants from the government like most other students in the country. If you would like a scholarship form the university, do everything you can to avoid being either white or male. If you are both you do not qualify for any scholarships at this school. Scholarships are only offered to minority students unless you get one from your program/major."
College Freshman,2,The library has issues with the printers all the time. There's other labs only available to residential students and one open to all but it's very small and printing is limited.
College Sophomore,2,Army aware of Greek life
College Sophomore,2,We don't have a football team
College Junior,2,Not much nightlife. Nothing in town but a couple bars
College Junior,2,"My favorite experiences include being a member of the Aggie Showstoppers, a hip-hop dance team that doesn't exist on campus anymore. I also like the honor societies that I'm in, but we don't ever do anything. I don't like the social scene. I don't have any good friends on campus, never had a romantic relationship, and none of the activities interest me. This is why I wouldn't choose to attend this school again."
College Freshman,2,The financial aid office could be more helpfull
College Sophomore,2,I believe the campus needs a lot more dining options than the ones we have now. It gets boring eating the same thing all of the time.
College Freshman,2,The officers are really strict about parking and it drives me insane! Once I parked in a teacher parking lot (I didn't know it was there was no sign or anything) and got a $25 fine and I explained to them this was my first time on campus and they still made me pay it...
College Freshman,2,The facilities are older but the college is trying to fix them up so they are nicer and nature friendly.
College Freshman,2,I hate how a lot of the cute guy all they care about is there appearance and how they love to drink all the time. Ugh its frustrating because I don't care to drink.
College Freshman,2,"There is not always a lot to do in Lawton, but we make do with what we got. My friends like to go out to eat, then go bowling or maybe to the movies."
College Freshman,2,Most placing are fast food and only a couple placing in Lawton have student discounts.There is not a lot of variety in Lawton and after awhile you get tired of the same old food!
College Freshman,2,"Its hard to get around and even to campus if we have bad weather, but most of the time we have good weather."
College Freshman,2,I was a lot of work applying for scholarships and after filling out a ton I only got one... Needless to say I was disappointed.
College Freshman,2,I plan on having an internship through the hospital and I would have top handle a lot of responsibilities.
College Freshman,2,"Taking the bus is a lot of effort because you have to match up times, its just easier walking around campus and driving whenever your not on campus!"
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of kids on drugs and that is pretty noticeable and occasionally I see some drinking but I don't really hang out in that crowd.
College Freshman,2,"They are not very good. Most of the house are gross and look not safe at all, I would be very nervous living off campus."
College Junior,2,There is a bus stop near the campus. I think most people drive. But there is not a lot of parking so you have to leave early so you can find a stop to park.
Recent Alumnus,2,We don't have a football team.
College Student,2,"I'm sure that there are better programs for official students, I didn't get much information when I first started this year."
College Senior,2,Really strict about parking policies and if you don't have a parking pass then you receive a ticket.
College Sophomore,2,It gets really hot being so close to texas. I was scared when we had a tornado.
College Sophomore,2,There are not many Greeks at my college. They are around for very few academic reasons. The only time I have personally heard of them is only when they are throwing parties and there will be plenty of beer.
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part, students dress fairly normal. However, there is a minority of those who choose to dress somewhat scandalously or odd. I notice most of the students get along quite well."
College Sophomore,2,"I have my own transportation so I'm not sure how the school's transportation options are, but I'm pretty sure all there is are taxis and buses around town."
College Freshman,2,"I am a Mathematics major at Cameron. I would not suggest pursuing math here if you intend to make a career out of it. First of all, my adviser had to brush the dust off the Mathematics curriculum binder when I enrolled for classes. This was very disheartening to watch, because I knew I was not going to be enrolled in the classes I needed in order to challenge myself. Second, the math classes are far from challenging. I enjoy math because it makes me think critically and it applies to important life issues. Cameron does allow for minimal critical thinking, but you are graded on effort and not if you do the problem right. If you want to pursue Mathematics, I suggest either switching majors or switching colleges of interest."
College Freshman,2,"Cameron University isn't very strict. The school boasts of being a smoke-free/breath-easy campus, but I see people smoking on campus quite often but nobody stops them. However, the police force can be a bit too extreme. A friend of mine bought a car and drove it to school the next day, intending to buy a parking permit later that day after class. But to his surprise he arrived to a car that wouldn't start, so he asked an officer to give him a jump. The officer noticed he did not have a parking permit so my friend received a ticket for wrongful parking and the officer refused to help him jump his car."
College Student,2,I don't live in campus's so I can't honestly give anyone an opinion on the campus dorms
College Junior,2,"There isn't a lot in Lawton. I grew up here. You can find a lot of scenery at the Wichita Wildlife Refuge about 20 minutes away, along with a tiny tourist spot in Medicine Park. Other than that, just a couple of bars, couple of move theaters, bowling alley, Arts for All festival & International Festival."
College Senior,2,The weather in Lawton could be extreme sometimes but it won't affect classes except it is a nasty snow storm that could compromise the safety of students.
College Senior,2,Fraternities and sororities are not a very big deal at Cameron University for the most part. Some of them really make an impact on campus every now and then though with their activities.
College Sophomore,2,Lawton is a small town but decently big. Theres not much to do but the people here are nice.
College Junior,2,"The biggest disappointment at Cameron University is that we do not have a football team. In the early 90s when we did have a team we were good, but since then the athletic involvement amongst students has dwindled."
College Junior,2,"Pretty much, its hard to find stuff to do locally in Lawton, If you're not over 21 than you can forget about going to the bars, which is almost the only thing to do. There is two local bowling alleys. Plenty of restaurants. 3 movie theaters. It fairly easy to find a local house party that is going on if you know people. Other than that, if you really want something good to do on the weekends, get with some friends, go to a party, or get a job, save some money and go to OKC or Dallas when you get the chance. Or you can always get some extra study time in."
College Sophomore,2,The weather is often too hot to live off campus without a faster means of transport.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Enough to Do. The local atmosphere leaves something to be desired. Movies. Mall. Putt- putt. Those are your options. Places nearby have fun stuff to do however. Medicine park just got a hookah lounge, Brick-town is a blast, and if gas is not an issue and you are wielding a season pass, Six Flags is cheap and fun 3 hours away."
College Sophomore,2,Process Could Have Gone Smoother – the financial aid process has been going pretty well until i found myself suspended from campus for academic purposes but getting to find other schlorship oppuortunities is somewhat a stressful adventur. but i suggest going to the finanical aid office and speak with someone that oversees the scholarships to see other available aid.
College Sophomore,1,To my acknowledgement Cameron University does not have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,Professors were nice and very helpful. Passing classes were easy as long as you did the work.
College Freshman,1,Food was good. The wifi sucks. The professors are okay well the ones that speaks English. The people only care about others looks and not academics. Savannah State is fairly easy to get into. Doesn't require that much work. Community Service sucks. The people are disrespectful and mean.
College Freshman,1,not really any that i know or have heard of
College Sophomore,1,I didn't know the campus had a fraternity
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties whatsoever that I have seen advertised.
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible! Lawton is the most boring and dry town I have ever been in. Oklahoma City is a little over an hour away, and Wichita Falls, Texas is approximately forty-five minutes in the opposite direction. Everything and anything you would want to do as a College student would be in either one of those cities. This town needs to appeal to it's College students and bring out more night life and attractions to keep us here. I'm gone as soon as I graduate."
College Sophomore,1,"Visiting Cameron's page, you see quite a bit of sororities and fraternities however there footprint on campus is moot. I would have been interested in joining DST (Delta Sigma Theta) however, there are no chapters in Lawton. There are also no fliers around nor do I see them walking around campus representing a society of greek culture."
College Freshman,1,its way to  expensive to live off of  campus
College Freshman,1,not much nightlife in this town unless you plan on driving  45 mins away and there is a high  crime  rate.
College Freshman,1,We need more  sports like football and lacross
College Junior,1,"If you like fast food like mcdonalds and burger king, the town has all you need. If you are like me and do not eat fast food, buy a forman grill. There aren't many healthy eating places here. the two best are McCallister's which has been open less than a year, and subway."
College Junior,1,"Cameron University has virtually no party scene. There is no where to even have one on campus. Your best chance for fun at this college is at the bars in Lawton. In all honesty though, the bars in Lawton are awful. I recommend this university and this town to absolutely no one, under any circumstances. This is a terrible place to spend your youth"
College Junior,1,"The dorms are small and around 50 years old. The school built some apartment style dorms called the village, you can tell they were very cheaply constructed. there is virtually no social life. The school offers no amenities, there is virtually no social atmosphere. the only positive is the low cost, however, living off campus like I currently do is a far better deal."
College Junior,1,Cameron University has the minimum amount of athletic teams they can get away with. The school has a stadium with a football and soccer field but only lets the local high schools use the facility. Cameron has no football or soccer team. Students do not pay attention to the sports the university does offer because the university does not promote them.
College Junior,1,"I am a male so I do not notice anything about the other males on campus. I have noticed the girls at the school are rarely attractive, and if they are attractive, they have a spouse already. Lawton is an awful town and Cameron University is an awful university."
College Junior,1,Cameron University does not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,There's not much that goes on here. You have to drive 45 minutes to denim and diamonds to dance and the town has little for college age people.
College Sophomore,1,"I do not party, and I mostly attend church gatherings."
College Junior,1,Greek life isn't well known on campus

Freshman,5,Professors have been empathetic when it comes to problems with technology and confusion on ways things are done. Questions are always answered.
Freshman,5,I liked the smallness of it. There is more time for Professors to be able to give individual attention without having to worry about falling behind schedule.
Niche User,5,"Even though I only spent two years at la sierra, it was the best experience I ever had. The school is very welcoming, making everyone feel apart of the community. I still keep in touch with all my friends that I made at the university before transferring out. The professors where very kind and committed to teaching their students. From my experience, the professors love helping students who struggle with the class and even go out of their way just to help prepare their students."
Freshman,5,"La Sierra provides a welcoming atmosphere, which really helped me as an incoming freshman who didn't really know anyone on campus. The teachers and advisors I had also worked hard to make sure I could reach my academic goals throughout my first year."
Junior,5,The criminal justice department is amazing. The teachers care about their students and every teacher has experience in the field. It is like a big family.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed la sierra’s campus and the surrounding of the campus is very eco-friendly. The campus is more smaller which I enjoyed because I like how excessive it is to get to each class.
Graduate Student,5,The Best thing about La Sierra University is their Criminal Justice Program. I'm a graduate who is currently working in Law Enforcement. The Criminal Justice Program genuinely cares about my success! They train us to be Colleagues not just a graduate. The Core Criminal Justice professors all know their stuff and teach from their real world experiences. I owe my future to them! Best decision I ever made.
Sophomore,5,I began studying at La Sierra for my pre-nursing because they have a very good program that helps you transfer into Loma Linda nursing. I experienced amazing classes where they put your knowledge to the test and professors who truly want to see you succeed.
Junior,5,"La Sierra is a small university, which is great because you can become friends with many people. The classes are smaller. Having the classes smaller allows us to be able to go to office hours and talk to the professors."
Freshman,5,The campus is small but so beautiful. I love the environment and just how nice the students and faculty are.
Senior,5,"I enjoy attending La Sierra University.  I like that the professors are helpful and genuinely want to see all their students succeed.  All professors offer office hours, where their time is specifically for students to come in and ask for help, and aren't busy with other work.  They are usually available through email, as well.  All other staff and faculty are helpful and always cheerful.  La Sierra University provides many resources to increase student success, such as the writing center, tutoring center, etc.  The writing center will review your work and help you if are doubtful about your writing, thesis, order, and more.  The library has a database that makes it easy to find reliable journal articles and more, to which the librarians are glad to teach you how to use it.  I also like that La Sierra plans many events for students where food and games are provided.  There is a lot of life in La Sierra University."
Graduate Student,5,"La Sierra University Criminal Justice is the best decision I ever made. The school is always exciting to be there and learn, it doesn't get old or mundane. Most professors are very interesting and they teach from experience for the Criminal justice classes. I think the best part about the school is the staff. I really feel like we're family and they truly care about my well being and academics here. The Criminal Justice Program has it's own campus complete with a Courtroom, Gym, tactical training rooms, CSI Lab, Police Driving Simulator and Police Shooting simulator. I made a lot of life long friends here who share my passion for Criminal Justice. Who will also be my future colleagues. I'm glad I attend this amazing school!!!"
Freshman,5,La Sierra is a great school. It can fit to everyone's needs. It is also a quite yet beautiful campus. I got to know this school through baseball and baseball scholarship. The athletics are great and amazing people. The academics are amazing and provide the essential tools and help to all the classes.
Niche User,5,"The best thing about La Sierra are 2 things. The first is that the class sizes are small, so you get the attention that you need. The second is that you are treated like family from everyone. Your peers, staff, even President Wisbee"
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed my first year at La Sierra University! I found it really fascinating how professors urge you to do better and become a better scholar as a whole.
Freshman,5,La Sierra University is a beautiful institution. The people are welcoming and everyone is friendly. It is a wonderful experience. La Sierra is home.
Junior,5,"The La Sierra University Criminal Justice program is the best decision I've made for myself. All the promises made to me are true. Small Class sizes, applied learning... Family oriented learning. I absolutely love this school."
Senior,5,This university has been a blessing to my education and overall experience. This school has given me the chance to learn and grow in the mind set of getting a great education from the subjects I have studied. The professors here are amazing in the fact that they want to teach you and they want you to learn and they want you to keep trying and not give up. They show you compassion in the fact that they understand the stress of school and outside personal problems.  The school is a private school and yes it is expensive but you are getting what you are paying for. From the education to the help for classes with tutoring and health and wellness of faith and mindset. This school is very diverse and open minded to all students. This school has been positive and welcoming to me and since I came from a community college experience and la Sierra university was an eyeopener due to the fact of the experience from my professors and the beautiful campus and to the church.
Sophomore,5,"I am going into my 2nd year at La Sierra University and the one thing I really enjoy there is seeing the beauty of the campus. They take pride in the look of La Sierra and they take care of the scenery. The people there are very friendly and since it is not a big campus you meet a lot of people. A few things I do not like about La Sierra University would have to be the food because it is for vegetarians considering it is a SDA school. Also the math depart is not that great so if you do consider going there, a lot of students tend to take math outside of the University. The best sports at La Sierra would have to be the women’s volleyball team, and both women’s and men’s soccer. But overall La Sierra is a decent school Andrea I would recommend it if you are looking for a smaller school."
Freshman,5,I like the diversity La Sierra has. The university is filled with positive people and a friendly community.
Freshman,5,Amazing and influential school. An amazing location and with great safety. Made fun friends who inspire me to be great.
Freshman,5,"La Sierra University is the dream university to attend. The class room size doesn’t consist of more then 26 kids per classroom. This makes it easier for the professor and your self to have a one on one help. Everyone here including students,professors and academic advisors are extremely helpful. La Sierra university guides you in the right direction for you the degree your trying to obtain."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent university. Very caring professors. Great spiritual atmosphere. Small student to professor ratio.
Freshman,5,La Sierra University has a beautiful campus and a great location. My experiences with La Sierra have all been amazing and I always feel welcomed.
Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is super nice and very respectful. The staff were not rude and even the students were very kind enough to give directions if you looked lost.  The campus is also a very safe and friendly environment that is accepting to anyone and everyone.
Niche User,5,"La Sierra University is located in Riverside. The students and staff make the campus life and overall school environment pleasant. As an incoming freshman, people have made the process enjoyable. From frequent phone calls, to email reminders, this school provides the best people to know. The campus and beautiful and the education system is one of the best. The classes provided help lead a student to a successful future. The classes set help mold to your individual major. Not forgetting the councilors, they are the most helpful people on campus. They are always approachable and can guide students in a bright future."
Sophomore,5,"La Sierra is a Seventh-Day Adventist University, and it fosters a wonderful Christian environment. As  Christian myself, I appreciate this greatly. However, although it is a religiously-based University, the curriculum of the professors is also wonderful in that it doesn't throw religion in the faces of those who aren't religious. The professors still do amazing research with really no noticeable religious bias. I work as an archaeology lab assistant (as a I am an archaeology undergraduate student), and I have witnessed that the science programs at La Sierra are very extensive and reputable. Research for science as well as religion courses is conducted in a respectable way, exploring all worldviews and cultural contexts."
Freshman,5,I couldn't imagine having a better experience in any other school. I am glad I picked this school since its small and easy to focus in class. Not only is it easy to focus but the professors are extremely well at teacher. Every professor is great at their job and it really shows that they care about their students.
College Sophomore,5,My school has been helping me both academically and spiritually. I enjoy the classes I've taken so far. The teachers and their TA's have been helpful as well as their lessons in class. I liked majority of my classes and I had a lot of fun with my new friends.
College Freshman,5,I haven't been in any situation where it felt unsafe and when there are any kind of dangerous circumstances the university sends a warnin email to every student. I always feel safe whenever I man at the campus but it is always best to be at guard.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are only about 20 students which is great because you can communicate with your professors and interact more with your fellow classmates. The professors are friendly and approachable and will make time for the student if he or she cannot meet the professor during their office hours. Us students have great communication with out professors.
College Freshman,5,"I heard from a senior in the same department of my major that the faculty advisors and career services help students get an internship before they graduate, which is great because thishas always been a concern ever sinceI started college."
College Freshman,5,"At La Sierra University the safety and security of the students is well put. As a student, I feel very safe as if I am at home and there is not much crime going on. The safety of this school is an important issue and the school has done a significant job to keep all students safe."
College Freshman,5,"My experience with the courses and professors at La Sierra has been the best. I have actually had the chance to meet with my professors one on one and discuss any concerns or questions. The class size and style is appropriate, it is small and many students are able to understand and focus on the lecture."
College Freshman,5,"La Sierra university is very friendly and easy to become part of the la Sierra family. There are many activities that bond students along with staff memebers. Besides the activities, the classes have helped gain more knowledge and the professors help every student one on one when they need it. My favorite experience was when all the freshmen gathered together to bond and get to know some of the current students at LSU. I would choose this school all over again because I learned new ways to communicate with people and I feel my personality changing for the best."
College Sophomore,5,This school is very diverse. There are people from all over the world that come to attend this school. Also there are probably a lot of people with different sexual orientations but they might not speak up about it because they are scared.
College Senior,5,I can tell my professors care about me. They know my name and have relationships with me and all the students. Discussions are possible within the classroom since the class size is a good ratio and so views and ideas can be shared. The professors know what they are teaching about really well and they engage students in conversation and come prepared.
College Senior,5,"All of the parking tickets we pay on campus goes torwards security technology. Therefore, we are in safe hands with 24 hour surveillance"
College Senior,5,"I could easily reach out to know about the status of my application and would get a prompt response. This is through both the phone and email, and I was greeted with respect and given the answers I was looking for"
College Freshman,5,"La Sierra University is a great school, I absolutely love the classes-they are a lot much smaller than most college classes so you have a greater opportunity to get to know your professors and classmates. It has been an amazing experience attending this school, everyone is super friendly and willing to help in any way, it is a christian school its a great way to grow in christ and receive a education."
College Freshman,5,I am so happy that I chose this school. The people are really friendly and the campus is extremely diverse.
College Freshman,5,"La Sierra University is a unique college for its constant involvement  with the students. I t engaged the students and faculty on a friendly environment, making students feel secure. It has a nice vegetation, with a lot of trees which makes it look very nice."
College Sophomore,5,"It has a wonderful atmosphere, the staff goes above and beyond for students and the quality of education is phenomenal."
Recent Alumnus,5,"La Sierra University is a unique college for its constant involvement with the students. It engages both the students and faculty on a friend type of basis, allowing students to feel secure and at home. La Sierra University prides themselves in being the best and teaching students to give back tho their community, in fact it's very common for student life to raise donations for non-profit organizations, the most recent being human trafficking. La Sierra University has greatly impacted me on a level I was not expecting, for I am now an active citizen who plays an important role within my community."
Recent Alumnus,5,Everyone is unique in their own way that there is not one student on this campus that is by themselves because everyone knows someone or has that one friend that they are best friends with.
Recent Alumnus,5,I know a friend that she went through this and the security and some staff were aware of the situation and were very helpful with my friend to make sure she was safe on campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,The faculty and athletes are very friendly and caring that they love to show their school spirit anywhere.
College Freshman,5,"I sometimes wish that I lived on campus, however. I like commuting to school!"
College Freshman,5,"I personally think that I am in the best major on campus! It is amazing to be working one on one with experienced law enforcement, and getting to meet others from: The Secret Service, US Marshalls, CHP Officers, and so much more! I LOVE my major, and I know that I have found my passion."
College Freshman,5,I was very happy that I received a scholarship when I agreed to come to this University. Every amount helps!
College Freshman,5,"I attend La Sierra University, however, it is apart from the main campus at a nearby Corona campus, and I LOVE my school. I commute to school, but it is very worth it, since I am getting one on one interactions with my professors. I wouldn't trade my school for any other school. I feel like my school isn't boring or long, since we are all like a family."
College Freshman,5,Social life is really fun you just need to have the courage to get involved.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are always helping students and there are always labs and special study options to help students. Workload is average, the stress is low due to this and the registration process was extremely easy."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Local areas offers many different choices in partaking events and such. Students often find local activities to attend, as well as holding get-togethers at restaurants."
Recent Alumnus,5,Administration for school is highly rated because of the careful thought and planning that goes into taking care of students.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Campus housing offers students a variety of options to cook, as well as to maintain cleanliness."
Recent Alumnus,5,Being that our school doesn't offer Greek life. I suppose I wouldn't have much to say about it.
Recent Alumnus,5,Both on and off campus dining are very nice. I would highly recommend both.
Recent Alumnus,5,"As of my personal awareness, I do not hear of the partaking of any parties. The scene for campus is very well-kept and teaches students morals and values."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The programs offered to students for the ability to excel is extremely high, for the faculty on campus dedicates a majority of their time for academic achievements for students."
Niche User,4,I never took online courses (classes online) But their blackboard and student portal was very easy and simple to understand and navigate.
Freshman,4,The online learning experience has been a huge adjustment and my teachers have been pretty understanding during this transition.
Freshman,4,"A really great school! Everyone is really great and super friendly--every time I asked for help of any kind, I was always given it with no hesitation. Not to mention the professors are really cool and definitely know their stuff! I had a professor who gave extra credit when we would submit pictures the most random things she asked of and every time we would she would give us a fun fact. The learning center is really helpful, not only do you get credit for every hour you spend in there, but you also get all the help you need from the tutors there! I dont think I would have been able to pass my math class without my constant visits there."
Niche User,4,It seems like a very nice and comfortable school. The meals look and taste all healthy. The people all around have a good vibe.
Sophomore,4,"Throughout my two years at La Sierra University, spiritual life and reaching out to the community was what I really enjoyed when I enrolled there. Most classes, prayer is needed to start the class, and this was a great ministry. By doing this, I have built that habit when I study or even when there are opportunities to help reach out to the community. One of many outreaches, we were able to give gifts to local elementary students. However, there are some things that I believe need to be better. Since I am a commuter, I hope they are able to work with the schedule for those who commute because some times are not available for me. Also, their food has a great sense of the idea of being healthy, but it needs to have more nutritious meals than instant and preserved foods. Overall, a school that wants to know you on a personal level so you can truly apply what La Sierra University has done you and me."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at La Sierra because the small class sizes have allowed more one on one time with professors and makes learning in class much easier. One thing that I would change would be mandatory chapel attendance for students since many of us don't practice this religion and I feel like it is a waste of our time.
Junior,4,"I liked how all the students in the campus went to a church across the campus to do chapel, it was a nice experience."
Sophomore,4,Great environment to be at. Very nice students and faculty. Small classes that allow to have stronger connections with professors.
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at La Sierra University. I made a lot of good friends there and I feel like the academics are excellent. The classes are small and so the teachers are able to help you one on one. They are also available outside of class and have a range of office hours. One of the disadvantages of the school is the tuition. The tuition is a lot more expensive because it is a private school. I also did not like that there were not many student events on the weekends so the campus was dead during the weekends.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere of the school, however there are a few places that I wish could be improved about it. For example the cafeteria does not serve great food, and there are many places on campus that need maintenance but never get fixed."
Freshman,4,Overall La Sierra is a great school to learn and grow. Other then the poor communication its a great school.
Alum,4,"On average, a good school. It should improve its cafeteria food. Also, provide better advisors. There is great diversity with both students and professors. The campus itself is very pretty, although some buildings need a bit of remodeling."
Niche User,4,I feel that when I went to go visit La sierra it had a vibrant feeling and I was extremely interested in this school. There are many things to keep busy and the diversity there is great.
Freshman,4,"This campus is very nice, the people here are friendly and eager to learn. The food here is good, yet you get tired of it, especially if you plan to study here for 4 years you're guaranteed to be bored of it. Overall, this is a great school. I am glad I came here :)"
Freshman,4,I am a freshman and so far it's been really good. All the teachers are super nice and helpful. The student body is super friendly as well so it's easy to find a group where you fit in.
Sophomore,4,"La Sierra University provides a wonderful class environment with professors who care about your concerns and troubles. The classes are challenging and help you grow academically and personally. They accept a large variety of people which helps students to become aware of the outside world around them. The campus is beautiful and serene; where nature can be observed and admired. The local area is resourceful with many stores and fun locations to visit. The food follows a vegetarian diet, however, they have many options to chose from. La Sierra University involves all their students to take part of fun events that happen frequently. For an example, during dead week they provided puppies to take away the stress. Overall, La Sierra University is wonderful. The only thing I would like to see change is reconstruction on their dorms and some of their buildings."
Sophomore,4,The teachers are willing to help you with homework and they want you to succeed. Everyone on campus is friendly and they want you to succeed and have a good college experience.
Sophomore,4,"La Sierra is the great university that can help you a lot not just for education but build your opportunity to changed your spiritual life. LSU also good for you if you would like to know and close with your professor or mentor because LSU has small classes and it really helps to know more with them. In La Sierra every staff and members on campus very good and friendly, if you have some problem they will help you and try to do something. One biggest thing that I like about LSU is my spiritual life changing every day and it's amazing because we not just get the education but also get something positive in life."
Freshman,4,"La Sierra University is a campus filled with hope that helps students, like myself, feel comfortable in the environment we are surrounded in. There is exposure to new cultures.  I believe the skills students gain from the university are very helpful and help enhance academics and professionalism because they help students become more effective in school and in our careers. There are many things to expect to gain from a university, but I know La Sierra is a great college who is determined to provide students with the best resources to become great people and have a great college experience."
Niche User,4,It is a very good like the appearance. Seems to be a good environment to be in seems they are a lot of nice people here.
Freshman,4,"La Sierra University features a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. On top of this, the professors care for your success and do their very best to ensure that you do yours. The people here are very nice and welcoming as well."
Freshman,4,"La Sierra is a Seventh-Day Adventist private school. I have never been to any private school before and I am not Seventh-Day Adventist. The University campus is huge , though the population of students is small. I like a small populated school because professors are more available and there are more options for one on one."
Graduate Student,4,I enjoy the professors in the Ancient Near Eastern department and the department itself.  They are very approachable and willing to work with the students and to meet the needs of the students.  The department secretary within the School of Divinity is very helpful and resourceful in letting the students know what is going on with class additions and changes for the quarter.  She also lets the students know about events and activities within the department in a timely manner.
Freshman,4,The staff is really friendly and everyone connects with you. Also the teachers help a lot the it comes to studies.
Alum,4,"Although some of the professors were not top-notch, most of them were quality teachers who really cared about students academic performance and community involvement."
Niche User,4,"I was there for a weekend on choir tour, the college students were insanely welcoming and gave us so much enthusiasm on our stay.  The door housing was welcoming and the dorms themselves were clean and roomy. The food was delicious and I loved the pizza and variety of choices to pick from.  The campus itself is very beautiful and it made me very excited to join in the fall. I loved the pretty water fountain when you first drive into the campus. Their teachers seemed very much happy while we got a tour of the campus. The students waved and said hi and greeted us as we walked around campus. My experience was great and the weather was good I can't wait to go back."
Freshman,4,"I'm going in as a freahman. Everyone is very open to answering questions, you just have to figure out what to ask. The music department has been very welcoming."
Freshman,4,"La Sierra is very invloved with the local church, and they truly do put an emphasis on spirituality. This is great for people like me that value various forms of christian lifestyles. Since the school is very diverse, it gives room for everyone to be who they are without fear of being judged. The students are from many cultures and backrounds. But perhaps the best part is the academics. The chemistry department has upgrated their technology in order to make it much easier to understand concepts that otherwise would have been more complicated."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at La Sierra University! I am a part of the the athletic program. I absolutely love La Sierra. The food isn't great but the students are exceptionally nice and the professors are extremely helpful. The two things I wish would change would be curfew and the no meat policy. Since this school is seventh-day Adventist there is no meat sold on campus. This sucks but you're still able to eat meat on campus, just not cooking meat and there will be no meat sold on campus. The other thing I oppose is the curfew. Depending your age determines how late you get to stay out and if you don't follow this your curfew will keep getting shorter and shorter. Besides this La Sierra is a very beautiful and welcoming University."
Freshman,4,"La Sierra University is a very inviting, welcoming, and easy-going campus. The teachers are great, paying attention to the needs and desires of every student. The atmosphere is also beautiful, with views of both Mount San Jacinto and the San Bernardino Mountains. The campus is extremely diverse with people from all over the world. It is a great place to be yourself and express yourself without having to hide. It is also a very religious campus with a large emphasis and focus on God and a person's relationship with God. Overall, the school is pretty good, I would recommend it!"
Sophomore,4,"La Sierra University delivers according to their word, at least for the most part. It is very Christ-centered, which is obvious in the active role Student Life plays on campus. As an undergraduate student, the school is very helpful in teaching students how to create connections in the professional world. It also provides many opportunities to network with big-name companies. But it also seemingly lack resources for students who attend short-term, such as I. The process of schooling as a pre-professional health major was rushed and often uninformed. I had to rely on word of mouth and the experiences of my peers over the advice of the pre-health advisor. Overall, the experience was positive though."
Freshman,4,It's an amazing school  and all the students are really nice and kind the school is also supper quiet and food friendly
Sophomore,4,"I like how small the campus is. It allows you to connect with your professors. 
I would like to see student financial services be better. It always takes a long time even with an appointment. I would also like the staff that works there to provide more options for students who are struggling to pay the tuition."
College Senior,4,Security people can be really rude sometimes. I feel like it is too many security guards on campus.
College Senior,4,"The school is small and friendly. I trust most of the students there. We have professors from top schools in our biology department which is great. Not too many things going on during weekends since people are having cars. Math department is not good. The best departments in my opinion are business, religious studies and biology department. Very friendly and chill environment."
College Junior,4,Its a great college that doesnt get enough credit for how good it really is. There are many great professors and its campuses are efficiently located.
College Junior,4,"They can work on recruiting more such as maybe a job fair for camopus jobs. However, the career prospects seem very well. Many of the staff are alumni's."
College Junior,4,The professors and taff seem very much intrigues with their students and desirely care about their well being. I have never met much professors that truly care.
College Junior,4,The campus police is always a call away and patrolling. As well as we have a free doctor on campus.
College Junior,4,The classes are smaller in size compared to most university creating a better bond with the professors.
College Freshman,4,"Going to orientation was wonderful , every one from students to the staff was willing to lend a hand and inspire. The environment was very friendly and comfortable."
College Sophomore,4,Academics is obviously one of the top priorities of the school.
College Sophomore,4,Almost every race represented.  The amount of diversity in every area is present.
College Sophomore,4,"People don't really do drugs, and if they do, it's not very noticeable."
College Sophomore,4,"I think that a degree from this school will very well help me to get into Loma Linda University, a graduate school, and get into their nursing program."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses required sometimes for the prerequisites aren't necessary but can be applicable.  Class sizes average 30 students or so, there are many classes offered, but most of the time the classes that are offered are the ones needed to graduate."
College Sophomore,4,"I have learned a lot, and I think that this school is unique because it focuses on academics, spirituality, and a sense of community.  I would definitely come here again if I could do it all over again."
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love what I am studying at La Sierra University. Although the Ontario campus needs to expand to accommodate the growing number of students. There were more classes offered this school year which gave students an option. The finance process is still a hassle, making the last quarter of the year even more stressful. The general education classes still seem like a waste of my time, and the classes range from being big and small, it just depends on how interesting the classes seems. Overall La Sierra University had a great Criminal Justice program that should continue to thrive in the future."
College Junior,4,The schools goal is to offer students a degree that will help them become helpful members in the community. The school also helps the Criminal Justice students by offering the opportunity to get a guard card and sends information about jobs hiring guards. The Criminal Justice school believes that if a student were to work as a guard it will give them life experience and make it easier for the students to get hired by the Criminal Justice system once they graduate. The school also offers internships within the criminal justice system.
College Junior,4,"Overall the classes offered this year were better and there were more options than last year. The classes offered were great and the professors were good as well. I can always count on one administrator to help me with finances and anything else I need help with. Since the Ontario campus is small you get to know everyone quick. Overall tone of the students, some are good people and others are rude, but the school year this year was better and highly more interesting than last year."
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are really excited about learning, and there is a wide variety of them. I rarely have classes cancelled, and they take their job seriously. There are a larger variety of courses you can take for your general ed which is very nice. most of the class sizes aren't too big, unless you are in a lecture class. I like the class sizes."
College Freshman,4,"La Sierra University is a great school to attend, because of the close community environment it provides for students and faculty. This school holds some of the friendliest students you will ever meet. Some of my best memories are hanging out in the Eagles Nest with all my friends. The teachers really care about you understanding the subject, and will always be there to help. The school provides many activities and services to help make your year enjoyable. I would choose to go here again, because of the diversity, wide variety of classes, excellent professors, and the acceptance the school brings to everyone."
College Freshman,4,"As a Freshman, we have coaching meetings with an advisor for the whole year and it has helped me greatly because my advisor influenced me to go to campus events that are held throughout the quarter. In these events, I have made friends that are very supportive on any decisions. I make and also give me their personal opinions regarding a decision I feel uncertain about."
College Freshman,4,"Maybe it is because of religious affiliation that I have little concern about the issue of crimes and safety at the school. Security is constantly patrolling the campus, gates surround the entire campus, and street lights keep the campus well lit at night."
College Freshman,4,"Although the school provides boarding, many students choose to commute. This factor results in a campus that is rather distant emotionally. There is a lack of community within students, especially commuter students. It is driving distance to the large cities like Anaheim and Los Angeles, making it easy for student to find things to do during their free time. The nearby Loma Linda University is where many undergraduate student are seeking to transfer to. I would choose this school if I was to go back into time because it has offered many resources and insight into entering the job market."
College Senior,4,"The safety and security of this campus is excellent. There are few cameras, but the security is tight."
College Senior,4,The professors are exceptionally friendly and nice. They are engaging even if they are not their students.
College Senior,4,"In regards to team spirit and fan support, we highlight the most out of it regardless if we win or lose a match."
College Sophomore,4,"the academics here are good. The workload is decent, and the curriculum difficulty depends on what program you are in."
College Sophomore,4,This school is surrounded by gates and at each gate you must use your ID card to get in once its past a certain time which is good because it limits creeps. Also the security kiosk is 24/7 so if anything happens you can call and report it to them. The parking lots for each dorm is gated also which provides an extra sense of security.
Freshman,2,"The best thing about the school was it’s campus. It was well maintained. Wish I could say the same about the dorms. Larger than my friends but sometimes smells and leaks water into dorms. No greek life. Very few programs that are interesting and don’t conflict with time. The food was okay, all vegetarian thanks to seventh day Adventist.

They attempt to track most of your movements. They have curfews and mandatory check ins at 10pm. No opposite gender in dorms. It’s less about safety and more keeping us “straight and narrow.” 

The teachers were the best thing about the campus. Some admins were okay- others less savory. 

The academics were quite poor and I was forced to leave because I knew my major would never be fulfilled successfully here. (pre-law)

Free buses in Riverside but it’s better to have a car. Safe but homeless from LA occasionally slip in. 

TL;DR: Save your money and go to a university of California school nearby!"
Junior,2,"They have a good faith based atmosphere. The sport teams are well catered to, and the school team spirt is prevalent. There are local eateries and shopping near by for students to go to."
Niche User,2,"Such a poor school. Record office faculty members are really friendly, but most professors have in mind: ""Students just blame, and not study"" which makes me depressed even though I studied hard. Not only one time, but keep saying that you guys don't study. extremely unprofessional."
Senior,2,"The faculty at this university are incredible, they are genuine people that care about their students and their success. However, the administrative side of the school is highly corrupted, and focus on the business aspect of running a university."
Freshman,2,"Academics are good, the teachers are friendly and understanding. Downfall- There is no social life because most students are commuters. My paperwork/applications/financial papers have been lost repeatedly. Communication between clubs/departments and students isn't always that great. If I could redo my college decision, I wouldn't go here."
College Sophomore,2,Security is not very on top of it.  There was three break ins in one month in one of the small parking lots.
College Sophomore,2,"I play a sport at school.  The sports teams do not get very much attention, or scholarship money for the athletes to work towards.  The facilities need to be updated."
College Junior,2,"Since the Ontario campus is not located neat the main campus in Riverside it is difficult to attend the sport games, and in reality no one in the campus quite cares for the activities that happen in the main campus."
College Freshman,2,"The fields do not adequately provide bathrooms, only port-o-potties. There are few stands for fans to sit and watch. The gym floor is not straight and does not bounce at all spots. Mostly parents are the main supporters of the sports. Few students come to watch. The athletes usually go to each others games when possible. The only locker rooms available are the ones next to the gym that are for everyone to use. The school is not a very athletic school."
College Senior,2,Not many people really pay attention to it.
College Senior,2,"Atleast from my experience, it's hard to connect to alumni and their network. You have to seek your connections and make them yourself."
College Freshman,2,"Although I have not stayed off campus, others have stated that it is a bit better but harder to find any areas that are available, cheap and close to campus."
College Freshman,2,"The school tries its best to get you ass much aid as possible, but it is a real pain to get them. Financial Services has somewhat poor customer service and it takes a very long time to talk to someone about your aid. If you are lucky enough to meet with someone, you still have a long road until you can get any sort of aid."
College Freshman,2,"The housing/apartments for students outside of school is nice! But, it is pretty pricey and most of the staff just recommends to dorm. The bad part about the dorms is that the school is pretty strict and there is hardly an freedom for those in dorms. I feel bad for some of my friends when they complain about the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"I had gotten great financial aid before attending and it suddenly changed the first day of school. Once I got home, my mom & I had to make several calls, e-mails, and meetings with a financial aid counselor to get a decent amount of aid. It was a complete hassle and extremely stressful. I'm now even having trouble again for Winter Quarter because my financial aid changed again. It's a huge hassle and especially now due to the holidays coming up and my mom being a single mom."
College Freshman,2,"Most of us, students, do not care how we look going to school because we're there for an education."
College Sophomore,2,"While some may think that high campus strictness is good for safety, I believe that it deprives students of the real college experience. The police at my school are strict and unfair at times."
College Freshman,2,The school is to strict and limit all sort of unlawful behavior.
College Freshman,2,"Nothing is walking distance, and what is, isn't that amazing."
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are very spacious, but there is a curfew, and it is an all girls/guys dorm. None of the opposite sex may come in."
College Student,2,No night life at all.
College Freshman,2,It's mostly boring on campus. Some of the halls have events once in a while which is cool.
College Freshman,2,I believe that there is not much greek life at my campus.
College Junior,2,La sierra university is generally a relatively average campus.
College Junior,2,The computer labs in my opinion at this university are mediocre at best
College Senior,2,The building are very clean but are extremely old that they need to be remodeled.
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus houses owned by the school are very close, within walking distance. There are even some apartments just as close also, and they are very nice, however are not owned by the school. The homes owned by the school are old, and don't look as nice to live in. Choosing the right roommates is crucial in your off campus living experience."
College Sophomore,2,"There are apartments and houses around, but the quality is poor."
College Sophomore,2,"It wasn't smooth at all, they don't take holds off until you go in person. Very strange process for something that should be simple"
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife at LSU is very quiet. Nothing goes on on campus during the night. There are occasions when there will be play productions, small concerts, or talents shows. House parties are thrown throughout the year so make friends who are in the know."
College Senior,2,"The school has strict rules about drinking and drugs and if they are found, you can be expelled from the school.

Parking rules, worship attendance, and dorm check-in rules are also strictly enforced. Not a place for slackers or rule breakers."
College Freshman,2,The campus strictness is pretty enforced. If you are caught in the wrong parking lot you will get a ticket. Then you are not allowed to drink well going to this school. There are offense give which are warning but only goes up to three.
College Freshman,2,Parking on the campus can be good sometimes but if you get there late it will be horrible looking for a parking. You want to get there at least 20 minutes before class to get a parking
College Sophomore,2,Very strict when it comes to drugs. No night life on campus. parking rules are enforced so becareful where you park.
College Freshman,2,There is absolutely NO meat served on campus. Adventists follow a guideline that states that meat shouldn't be consumed. There is only fake meat. The food gets repetitive after a week.
College Junior,2,"There is a variety of different races; I am unsure regarding religion. The majority of the students are Caucasian, Asian, and other."
College Junior,2,Most students aren't allowed to live off-campus. They have to give a lot of paperwork to prove that they are living with a family member or are over 22. I feel like this is unfair. We're adults! Living off-campus should be strictly between us and our parents.
College Junior,2,If you are not SDA or a rich DO NOT COME HERE. The school is extremely expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"Student Life – La Sierra University is a veggiterian campus and Seven Day Adventist school. I am majoring in Criminal Justice, so I live in Riverside CA, but my program is in Corona,CA. It is very hard for me to transport to my campus because I am an out-of-state student with less resources. I am trying transfer asap."
College Junior,2,Div 3 – Hardly considered any real aspect of La Sierra's Campus life.  A bit of a joke.
Junior,1,"It was difficult, this institution is not fit for online learning. The professors were unprepared and the I wish the school adjusted their grading system."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek life.  It is a religious school.
College Junior,1,There is no greek life offered at La Sierra University. It is not offered at the main campus and it is definitely not offered in the other locations.
College Senior,1,Most students only go to loma. otherwise nowhere
College Senior,1,"adventist biased, uncooperative, some are okay."
College Senior,1,Dorms are terrible and dirty and broken mostly.
College Senior,1,This place sucks. most teachers are biased & rude
College Freshman,1,I am not so sure if la Sierra university has any sororities/ fraternities since it is a seventh day Adventist Private school
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife here is basically nonexistent unless you have friends who know where to go. But since there are no girls allowed in guys dorms, and vice versa, it is hard to have a good party. Its just impossible."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have Greek Life at my University. I sometimes wish we did, but since I attend a private university it is very strict."
College Freshman,1,There are no parties. I heard of one and believe it did not end up happening. There are no parties here.
College Sophomore,1,Does not exist at my school !
College Sophomore,1,"My school is fairly small because it is private. No parties, no social life, no outings, etc..."
College Freshman,1,"It is expensive to live on campus and you are not allowed to live off campus so, it sucks."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,Its extremely strict. It affects our social lives only because I had more freedom at home than I do here. I feel like I'm not in college.
College Sophomore,1,There is no night life at La Sierra University. It is almost considered a sin if you go out clubbing on a week day instead of studying.
College Sophomore,1,Many of the dorms are very old. The community bathrooms are old and some of the showers do not work. The toilets are old and they get clogged easily. The community restrooms are just a disgusting mess. The rest of the dorm is old but its habitable.
College Sophomore,1,If your not a vegetarian like many other people then living on campus and relying on a meal plan can be tideous since all they serve is vegetarian food . There is no meat options for meat eaters which I think is ridiculous.
College Freshman,1,"LSU has a zero tolerance policy on alcohol and drug use. If caught, the punishment is being kicked out of school. Do not do any of this in your dorm room, or with people who are not trust worthy. The punishment is severe and can get you banned from attending Loma Lina University for medical school."
College Senior,1,"There are clubs in downtown Riverside or an hour away in LA, but there are not any near the school. The school definitely does not provide transport to these places, public transportation stops early, and students must return to the dorms by 2 am.

There are no bars nearby the school either as there is a strict no drinking policy and the area is classified as a a no alcohol zone."
College Freshman,1,"The sports here are terrible.
There is no football.
Basketball is Division 3. 
It's like high school athletics all over again"
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely nothing to do around campus besides eat. 
There is a mall not too far away but it gets dull after a few times."
College Freshman,1,"RAs do a room check every night if you live on campus.
No alc, tabacco, or drugs of any kind at this school."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing besides campus. You must walk about fifteen minutes to get to even the closest restaurants. It isn't like a college town here at all. It is very suburban and quiet. The restaurants or dining places aren't geared for college students.
College Junior,1,"I received some financial aid for school, but as soon as I was not a freshman anymore, they took the majority of it away. It is very tough to find scholarships for students who are not freshman. However I did receive some aid from donors who used the La Sierra name. For that, I was greatful. I would like to see La Sierra keep in mind their upperclassmen students more (and the 4.0 students!)."
College Junior,1,"Everyone Does It – This is actually an A for me but a higher grade ""indicates that drugs and alcohol is not a noticeable part of campus life and no pressure to use drugs or drink alcohol seems to exist."" At LSU, drinking and drugs are expected. So the lower the grade, the better!"
College Junior,1,"The school is very stingy with aid. They load you up freshman year and after that, it gets more and more expensive."
College Junior,1,"This school does not serve meat, it serves old veggies."
College Junior,1,I Don't Like It – Some people probably like the overbearing heat pounding into you all day and night but I really dont like the heat.
College Junior,1,The buildings at La Sierra are old and in need of renovation.
College Senior,1,"Housing Off Campus Is Difficult – Only married students or students over 21 are allowed to live off campus (if they are not living with their parents). Students do break the rules, but it is a hassle and not cheap. There are plenty of apartments and houses nearby though."
Recent Alumnus,1,THER IS NO NIGHT LIGE – its a Seventh Day Adventist school so the kids don't usually do anything friday night. If you need something to do look at other schools nearby like UCR or UCI
Recent Alumnus,1,Kinda up tight and not that pretty. Its really hard to find a chill girl on campus
College Sophomore,1,Not Enough Money – I play baseball here and have experienced the lack of needed money for athletics. We have to take a cramped bus on three day trips and we don't have the proper training tools to improve our talents.
College Junior,1,"Christian School – Because of the religious influence that is a part of our school the rules can sometimes be strict.  There are no drugs or alcohol allowed on campus.  Dancing is sometimes restricted in certain cases, but it is still allowed as long as it is approved."
College Junior,1,Process Is Not So Great – it takes a very long time to get any paperwork done or reviewed by the financial aid office. and for any money to come through takes a while
College Junior,1,you do one thing wrong and they never stop bothering you
College Junior,1,"I enjoyed living on campus, until the tuition increased. So I had to move off campus, because the tuition for my school is too expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"Dorm Life – I live in Angwin Hall here at La Sierra University. Angwin is considered one of the more lively dorms on the campus which is rather hard to believe. Most of the girls hardly leave there rooms. It is almost impossible to get to no the girls on your hall, let alone on other halls. Angwin and the other dorms definitely need social improvements."

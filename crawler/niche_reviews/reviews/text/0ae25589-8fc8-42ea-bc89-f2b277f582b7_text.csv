Sophomore,5,The campus offers a lot of resources to help you learn about internship and research opportunities. The community the school creates is a welcoming community that offers a lot of services for students to take advantage of to succeed.
Junior,5,At Xavier I've been pushed to open my mind to possibilities I never accepted before. The class sizes are small so its a very close relationship you develop with professors. Everyone wants you to succeed and are more than willing to help.
Freshman,5,Xavier is doing a good job with providing online courses through Zoom. The experience wasn't hard to adjust to and is just as efficient as a regular classroom. They made sure to give the students what they requested when it came to having hybrid classes. We greatly appreciate the consideration the staff are giving us.
Freshman,5,"Xavier University of Louisiana is a great college to attend. During this pandemic, they're doing everything in their power to make sure that us students stay safe. We're able to have a whole entire dorm to ourselves and they're also housing students in hotels. They also offered to do online classes for students who don't feel comfortable with coming to campus. We're also required to wear masks whenever we are outside our dorms and we cannot enter any buildings without it. In addition to the mask requirement, we're practicing social distancing and taking it very seriously. I appreciate the steps XULA is taking to make sure that we're staying safe and limiting the cases of COVID-19. Also, we're required to get tested for COVID-19 before stepping onto campus and we're able to get tested at anytime because they now have a center open for testing. I'm very impressed with Xavier and the steps they're taking to make sure we're safe. I love my HBCU and will continue to support them."
Freshman,5,"The staff is extremely professional and they make sure that you have all the tools to succeed. The campus is always clean, the classrooms are always clean. The food is great. Just five stars all around."
Freshman,5,"The online classes are amazing. The professors really take their time out to teach you, so you will not feel left behind. I am doing great in my classes so far and it is all thanks to Xavier's professors."
Alum,5,Xavier adapted to using the Brightspace interface platform my second year and I definitely transformed the overall online learning experience. Its easily accessible and easy to navigate. Great choice!
Alum,5,"Although Xavier doesn't have the typical hbcu party environment I wouldnt' change a thing about my experience there. Xavier excels in academics with courses tailored to your degree, electives that expand your worldview, and faculty that challenge you in a multitude of ways to mold you into an adequate professional ready to achieve greatness. As a Xavier graduate I truly can say my time there has shaped me into a better individual and allowed me to foster professional relationships to lead to my continued success"
Sophomore,5,"Within light of recent events (Covid-19) Xavier did an excellent job to make sure the needs of students were met. Academically they immediately put teachers through a training program to help with the transition to online learning. They made sure to keep in constant contact with us as students to let us know what was going on and what to expect. University staff and teachers were more than willing to continue providing students with any extra help they may need, including video calls, fast email responses, and providing work groups that had student tutors all around the clock. Overall the experience of online classes was a smooth and easy transition."
Alum,5,"My experience at Xavier University of Louisiana was amazing. From being immersed in my African American culture and seeing the brilliance of what the students were doing at the University 2 the city and all of the culture of New Orleans combined into one hub, my experience was nothing short of all inspiring. If I could change anything about Xavier, I would like to see more African-American professors on campus in the classrooms engaged."
Alum,5,"While I only took one or two online / hybrid classes at Xavier University of Louisiana, my experience was great! My professor provided us with ample opportunities to ask questions and allowed us to feel as if the online experience was as close to traditional and interpersonal class as possible."
Graduate Student,5,I did not take online classes. The teachers posted assignments online to help you excel in the class.
Graduate Student,5,"Everyone on campus is very welcoming and friendly. Also, the professors are very accessible and always willing to help students."
Junior,5,Xavier is an institution of hard work and dedication. I love that my HBCU encourages leadership and community service amongst many other core values. Overall attending this University has prepared me for my lifelong career. This University not only provides immense opportunities and resources but is also a place that values family.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Xavier University is really amazing. The people are really nice and so are many of the faculty. The school places a lot of importance on education, therefore, you can expect that the classes are very rigorous. The athletics at XULA are not that popular, and as far as the food goes, it can get pretty basic or bland at times. Also, you can expect that there is a lot to do in New Orleans and on campus (as long as your involved). Over I love my university and wouldn't trade the experience for any other."
Freshman,5,I love my HBCU! The administration and faculty work closely with students to ensure their voices and concerns are heard and put in motion. Intense curriculum prepares students for their career and advanced degrees.
Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman, but my experience at Xavier has been wonderful! The academics are extremely difficult I am a biology pre medicine major planing to be a pediatric hematologist/oncologist since I suffer from sickle cell anemia. The staff and professors are extremely interested in your learning and success! I hope to have a great rest of the semester and finish strong."
Sophomore,5,The teachers are really nice and they are dedicated to helping you get into whatever field you may be interested in.
Niche User,5,I liked the campus and how professors are serious about their students getting the education they need to be successful in the future.
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my HBCU experience. I was a Mass Communication major so I was able to get work/career-related experience before I graduated. I worked on the student newspaper, the news shows and the yearbook staff. I also enjoyed student life. There were many organizations for students to join to not only make a difference on campus while having fun, but these organizations also helped develop friendships."
Freshman,5,"My experience with Xavier has been great so far. Although I haven't been here long, it has been a walk in the park so far. What fascinated me about this school is the fact that the people here makes it their duty to provide great service. They show that they care and they are always there to help. Everyone here is like family and that's something big for me. Wherever I go, I always want to feel welcome, and at Xavier you receive just that."
Senior,5,Xavier University of Louisiana is a diverse campus that is focused on preparing students for the next chapter of their lives. One of the things i love about Xavier is that it is very family oriented. The teachers and staff treat you as if you were their actual family. Another thing that i love about the university is how dedicated they are to the progression of education as Xavier has multiple students and faculty who complete published research.
Freshman,5,"Xavier University of Louisiana is a very student oriented, and friendly school. The professors here help anyone in need, and they offer alot of assistance. The sports are very good, and we are one of the top teams in our division."
Niche User,5,"Xavier University of Louisiana is by far one of the best HBCU's there is! Highly recommended.       Xavier University of Louisiana has a great medical result of graduates, amazing food and culture. New Orleans is fairly small and its quite easy to get around once you understand. The people are friendly and have lots of fun. New Orleans is known for specific things that Xavier definitely portrays in their activities which involves each and every body. An amazing time is all Xavier University of Louisiana brings to you!"
Freshman,5,very encouraging place and uplifting! The campus is beautiful and the people including staff are very nice and welcoming.
Niche User,5,"Did a campus tour and it was awesome. This school offers students unbelievable amounts of opportunities to be successful while in school. Whether that be helping with resumes, preparing them for interviews, and helping get their businesses off the ground (you don't have to be a business major for them to help you with this)."
Freshman,5,"Xavier University is a HBCU, this is known for putting the most African American doctors into medical school. Here at Xavier, I have connected with a lot of people that has been very beneficial. I have been granted the opportunity to do a lot of volunteering as well as have the access to a lot of resources. At Xavier, they strive to push you beyond your limits and prepare you for the real world."
Junior,5,Very good school filled with hard-working students and dedicated professors. Plenty of quiet study spaces to get work done when needed.
Freshman,5,xavier uniersity is a wonderful historicaly black romaan cathlic university in the center of new orleans.
Niche User,5,When I went to visit the campus I loved how diverse the campus was. I especially loved that the school had so much to offer.
Niche User,5,Once you graduate from Xavier University you will leave ready.  My sister graduated from Xavier and I went to Dillard.  I would often visit Xavier campus a lot.  My sister enjoyed her 4 years and she was well prepared for the work force.  My sister would always say that Xavier is a school that challenges you.  She buckled down and studied and made honors.  It was worth the investment.  She said if she had to do it all over again she would.
Graduate Student,5,"Great experience, so far! The faculty and staff are very nice and helpful. I love the facilities as well. Very cleaned and well maintained."
Graduate Student,5,"Hi, my name is Johnny Le and I'm currently an upcoming third year Pharmacy student at Xavier University of Louisiana. I attended undergrad at Xavier University of Louisiana for one year before being admitted into their pharmacy program. What I enjoyed most about Xavier were the small classrooms and the professors. The professors took their time out to actually know their students and were always helpful during office hours."
Sophomore,5,"I loved my experience for my first year at Xavier. The classes are fast-paced, but the teachers and other resources on campus really work hard to help you succeed. The atmosphere for learning fosters a friendly competition, so there are students there that will help you succeed. I would not suggest coming to Xavier for a degree that is not medical-related, due to the expensive nature of tuition. Xavier is a private, Catholic, and an HBCU, which means that federally, the school is underfunded. It is also underfunded by the state. Nevertheless, Xavier is a wonderful institution to pursue a degree."
Junior,5,GROWING UP XAVIER WAS A DREAM OF MINE. NOW I AM HERE AND I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE. MY PROFESSORS HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND DURING MY TIME HERE AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEM.
Freshman,5,My experience at Xavier University of Louisiana was great for my first year. I had met a lot of new people. We became a family. Allowed us to get ourselves out in the community.
Sophomore,5,"Great atmosphere and the faculty and students care about you. Tough, though there are many resources and opportunities here."
Freshman,5,"The professors are very nice and are willing to work with you. The  campus is beautiful and  the campus food is good. In New Orleans, you will get the chance to experience a different culture and atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"Xavier University of Louisiana has been an amazing experience! I wasn’t sure of how my transition from high school to college would be, but I must admit that my counselors, professors, and classmates have made this journey incredible. I look forward to the upcoming years ahead!"
Alum,5,Xavier University changed my life! I had the best HBCU experience and was prepared for whatever life threw at me.
Niche User,5,I  think the school is very nice. After talking to many others they all have come to a silent agreement that they feel like it is the right place for them. when it comes to helping there students financially they are all in no matter what they are very involved In making sure a student has what they need.
Freshman,5,"Xavier University of Louisiana is a college that welcomes everyone with open arms. The faulty and administration really care about all of their students. The school provides many resources that help you to succeed ; for example the biology and chemistry tutoring sessions and centers, the health and wellness center that provides counselors for personal and academic help and etc.... Xavier University of Louisiana is a great school and should be at the top of everyone's list for a college."
Freshman,5,I love the Administration and all the students. This school is the perfect school for an African American women like myself.
Niche User,5,I love that Xavier University is a HBCU. Xavier university is known for helping a lot of black people succeed in life. Xavier university provides a catholic church for their students i love that.
Sophomore,5,"Xavier University to me means a gateway to more opportunities. I have a lot of older mentors who attended Xavier University and are now working on the highest level of doctors, and I’d hope Xavier can bless me with same opportunity. I have researched that the university has remained first in comparison to Ivy League schools like Harvard and Yale University when it comes to bringing through the largest number of Black medical students, as well as Black students with Bachelor Degrees in Biology and Physics. That percentage rate is very exciting and drives me to want to accomplish my goal at Xavier. Xavier gives off a welcoming atmosphere of community and collaboration amongst the student body, the professors, and the faculty, making them seem like the type to help nurture and guide me throughout my time at Xavier."
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year at Xavier University of Louisiana was amazing. The professors and advisers are always available to help you when you are having trouble. There are so many resources that are open for the students to use to help them. The campus is beautiful, and has an amazing environment."
Freshman,5,"My experience was great.!!! I met wonderful, empowering and inspirational staff members. Who looks foward to pushing me in my next steps of being a proud Xavierite..!!!!!!"
Freshman,5,"I'm a first year student at Xavier and so far I can say that I'm proud to call myself a Xavierite. This school is amazing. The education here is amazing because the professors care about their students. There is nothing bad about Xavier except their street. Streets around Xavier are horrible. It's so bumpy and it's killing my car tires. I hope Xavier will fix it soon. Overall, I recommend students to go to Xavier."
Freshman,5,I feel like I am learning more here than I would at other universities. All of the teachers I have had so far seem really dedicated to their jobs and enjoy the subjects they teach.
Freshman,5,my time at Xavier have been great. the professor care about you.the students are like family. I am not a party person but there are place that you can enjoy yourself and still be safe.
Sophomore,5,My favorite thing about Xavier is that it surrounds me with motivated people with goals and a passion to make sure that those goals are reached. The people here help one another strive for excellence. One thing i would change would be the work load.
Freshman,5,My first semester at Xavier was a great experience. Everyone there is treated like family. There isn't really anything I would like to see change I just hope that the school keeps it up
Freshman,5,"I love the fact that Niche doesn't make you apply to scholarships by filling the same information in over and over again, they use the information that you give them and the info that they need you fill that out. Nothing should be changed about Niche it's an awesome website and is extremely beneficial to the ones who are trying to scrape up money to get through their education."
Sophomore,5,"Xavier is a great school! If you are willing to do everything they tell you to do, they will ensure your success. Xavier has also been rated the number 1 school in America for placing African Americans into medical school."
Sophomore,5,My experiences so far at Xavier have been extraordinary. The diversity here is simply amazing. The work here is slightly challenging but the resources that they provide you helps you tremendously in the long run. One thing that they can improve on is providing more scholarship opportunities for people with specific majors. Other than that it's a great school all around.
College Sophomore,5,The SASO office is very active with helping students find jobs upon graduation. The networking is very great due to the alumni and their continous participation.
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at this school has been amazing so far. I have been apart of the Peer Dean Association this fall, which was an amazing experience for me. We helped the first-time freshmen transition into the New Orleans/Xavier University community. My school is unique because it is the only HBCU and Catholic school in the country. We are rated #1 in getting African-Americans into medical school. Our reputation is phenomenal. Our students are very focused, friendly, determined, and smart. We work as a family to ensure good grades and a good experience in order to succeed both here at Xavier and in the world later on in life. If I could do it all over again, I would most definitely without a doubt choose Xavier University of Louisiana as my school."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour of Xavier, and I loved the layout of the school. Not only that, I also loved the environment of the school and how diverse the school is."
College Freshman,5,"So far my school makes is very comfortable being away from home. My favorite experiences are how inviting the staff is, which gives me the desire to push more. What makes my school unique is again the wonderful staff and how professors make sure you understand everything."
College Sophomore,5,"I did not want to attend Xavier University in the beginning. I choose to because of the amount of financial aid I would receive. I wanted to go to another private college in another state, but my parents would not allow me too. Xavier would have been my last option. When orientation started I realized that Xavier may be more then what I thought it was. As I started to attend classes, I realized that academics are one of our main focuses. you have to be focused and learn to leave everything else behind you. I was also one of those students who thought college would not be different then high school. I thought I would just study the same and it would be ok. It was not ok and I lost part of a major scholarship and it devastated my parents. I learn that Xavier will push you above and beyond your boundaries. I tried putting myself behind the boundary of high school, but it did not work."
Freshman,4,The people are nice but the school has to do better overall. It hard for students to find help from the staff.
Junior,4,"Right now because of the pandemic I'm taking all my courses online however if I was on campus of course I'd be in person, but from what I see most of the professors rather face to face communication and most have gotten better with communicating especially when it comes to the emails. I've had some troubles when the teacher hasn't emailed me back at all as a result I didn't get the help I needed. A few tips for the future classes like math, chemistry, organic chemistry, statistics may not be the best idea to take those online. Absolutely take those courses in person if you can this is my advice to you. Some classes you can study through a computer like biology, Psychology, or even Cognitive Neuroscience (a class I'm taking). Of course this all is your preference when it comes to online classes but this has honestly been a drastic change for me and I'm sure a lot of others. I hate learning through a computer screen as well as paying thousands of dollars for it, but they have adjusted."
Junior,4,"I honestly love the school its academics will definitely get you prepared for the next level that I know without a doubt. Yes, the campus itself doesn't look the most glamorous however the energy from the students is there. I feel as if Xavier can be a better school if they found better professors in my opinion. Not saying most of the professors there are bad, but considering this HBCU graduates the highest black doctors in the U.S. I expected more. Since I'm a student athlete I will say I had a little trouble managing my time and my priorities are all over the place but I'm happy to say I'm currently doing amazing there now.I wish they could focus more on if the teacher can actually teach the lessons and not just read from the powerpoint and call it teaching, as well as hire the teacher who has done really well in there days in school. I say that because not all great students are great teachers this is one aspect I feel like they fall short on.Overall its a very amazing University"
Sophomore,4,"For the most part, online learning has gone well with Xavier. Professors made a very clean transition to online learning. The only downside is that some classes were labs and those worked better in person than online because of the experience from performing experiments in class."
Junior,4,Xavier is challenging for sure. I struggled my freshman year due to lake of time management. But success is possible.
Niche User,4,So far the school has been great everything but my balance that i owe the school due to my fasfa taking forever to process. but everything else is great the culture and the area.
Niche User,4,even thought we have covid going on the are trying there best to make the student life as normal as they possible could for us.
Junior,4,The only thing that I would change is the quality of the food and the safety of students. Other than that I miss the home feeling of being on campus.
Junior,4,This spring were forced to move courses to online. It was kind of difficult at first but once I adjusted it was amazing. I found that my professors were easier to communicate with and were always eager and hopeful for our return
Sophomore,4,"I love Xavier and have little to no complaints with the school. It is a little pricey, but the education there is first class. They make sure to properly prepare you for the world after college, especially if you are interested in medical school. The crowd at Xavier is not the most diverse, likely because it is an HBCU so many may shy away from applying there. But coming to a school like this opens your eyes to a culture and scene that you may not be used to. People are very friendly and are willing to take the extra step to help out others. Campus life is nice, very peaceful at the school due to the small population of students. That provides small classrooms though, this ensure each student can get the personal help they may need to be successful. The community around Xavier is not the best, but definitely is not the worse. There is no need to be worried about safety though, our campus police are on patrol constantly and will make sure you get to your destination safely."
Sophomore,4,The university offers an amazing experience. Academics are rigorous but manageable. Offers the best education for African american students.
Sophomore,4,Online experience was different but still effective. All of my professors were easy to reach. No issues experienced during class zoom class meetings.
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my freshman year, but so far, I love the academic environment of Xavier; there are a lot of resources that are available to students, specifically STEM students. Also, there is a community feel amongst students, and since we are a small university, you will get to know the majority of your classmates and professors. 

Drawbacks to the university: If you are a non-stem major, resources for that major are significantly less, but you do have a closer relationship with your professors than in the STEM majors. Be ready for the academic pace of Xavier the material isn't that hard in the first year, I am a chemistry pre-pharmacy student,  its just the pace we move it at can be challenging for incoming students if they weren't prepared in high school."
Alum,4,"I think for my degree, Xavier was by far the best option for me. As a pre-med student, your advisors are very hands-on to ensure your entry into medical school. I cannot speak for other majors, but I can definitely speak on my own. Everyone wants you to succeed from your professor to your peers."
Sophomore,4,The overall community at Xavier has made me feel welcome overall. I have enjoyed several of my professors and many of my classmates. It is great to be able to relate to people I see on a daily basis on deep levels. I also enjoy the Starbucks and Chick fil a that was added to our campus recently. The social experiences the school offers for students could be better as well as the food served in the cafeteria. It is decent but it could always be betters
Sophomore,4,"Xavier University of Louisiana is a University that is very diverse. The people on campus are very compassionate and welcoming. I love the fact that once you are a Xavierite, you are always a Xavierite. As well as, the students and the faculty would do everything in their power to make sure that you succeed. One thing that I would like to see change is some more diverse food options in the cafeteria."
Freshman,4,"I like the extensive preparation for premed students. Also, the professors are really helpful and care very much about each and every student."
Freshman,4,The school is hard but the staff truly cares about the students. It is a smaller environment and the classes are not too big.
Freshman,4,"Xavier University so far is an enjoyable and good school. Students here are provided with many resources to help them succeed in their courses such as math resource centers and supplemental learning. In addition to academics, the social life is good as many people are friendly and do not actively seek problems with anybody."
Freshman,4,I would have given this a full 5 Stars but move in day was horrible. I think there needs to be a better process.
Sophomore,4,Xavier is a great school for those looking to pursue a career in the medical field and also in other fields. The work is hard but it is too prepare for graduate school. The on campus activities are fun as long as you participate. Its a great experience.
Sophomore,4,This upcoming school year will be my first time actually attending Xavier. Ive been on their campus many times for field trips or workshops. I also have have friends who go there and say it is such an amazing school and experience.
Sophomore,4,"Xavier is a very amazing school in my opinion however before you go you have to have your priorities aligned. I'm a athlete so when I'm going to practices and weight room and track meets while trying to studying. Like me my first semester was a little rough but I eventually came to with balancing everything out and making sure I have everything together as a athlete and as a student. I will also say the more your involved the more scholarships it opens doors for more people and possibly more scholarships to come your way. The professors really are amazing too because even though they aren't a big school if they see that your trying to do better in the class or anything they WILL help you out. It really does get easier throughout your years here also but that doesn't mean slack up, all I'm saying is that if you come here be prepared to put in the work to go to medical school and furthering your education. Everything counts at this school."
Freshman,4,"Xavier University of Louisiana is an HBCU that I enjoy very much so. The staff cares and really wants and tries to help the students succeed. There are many resources for students to seek help in whatever subject they are needing help in. The professors office hours are very flexible and they are very attentive to their students. The only problem is there is not much diversity in the professors, it is majority white at an HBCU. Very great source of education just wish there was more adversity for professors."
Freshman,4,"On good days, it's a four, but that's is not because of the environment but because of the people you meet. The environment will tear you apart."
Sophomore,4,"I am now a sophomore at Xavier and the academics are outstanding. The different energies from fellow students can definitely be something you have to be careful of and to stay clear. The food is....okay. Dorm living isn't too bad. Overall, I feel safe and I couldn't see myself anywhere else."
Alum,4,"I will say that I attended the school during the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina. My experiences there cannot be recreated due to the fact that the city was in a particular state of shock. From what I can see and do like about the present time, is that the University has had a lot of money poured back into it and has many more amenities than previous. The buildings have been updated, and even more facilities added. I believe that the school is now aesthetically a rival of those other colleges in the surrounding area."
Niche User,4,"Xavier University of Louisiana was truly a home for me. I loved everything about from the campus to the classes to the teachers to the community, Xavier is a place where you can truly feel love radiate from every corner."
Sophomore,4,Xavier is very great school. I love it!! It has a great atmosphere and you're surrounded by people who all want you to do great.
Sophomore,4,Overall Xavier University of Louisiana is a outstanding HBCU. Xavier just recently moved up to number two on the HBCU ranking. Although academics are a struggle depending on you're major the professors help you every step of the way because they want you to succeed. They have endless resources like chemistry tutor rooms and even English. They provide you with a 24 hour library room for late night studies. A shuttle is provided to take students to their dorm rooms from the library during finals. Although Xavier has many amazing things that go with the university they lack when it comes to finical aid. It is very un professional and messy.
Sophomore,4,"Xavier is a diverse school despite it being a very good HBCU. There are plenty resources, review sessions, and professors who are willing to help, and if you become familiar with them, the better."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the overall experience that Xavier University of Louisiana brought. It really made me feel at home and welcome as an incoming freshman. The academics are tremendous and the amount of services available to better our skills are great! Overall, I would only improve the housing and food accommodations. The housing needs to be more up to date and preferably bigger living space. The food needs to be more appealing and more of a variety should be brought to out selection."
Sophomore,4,"Xavier is honestly a home away from home. Faculty and staff are truly invested in seeing you succeed and become the person they believe to be. The school focuses on promoting a just and humane society within the community around the school, as well as our communities back home."
Sophomore,4,"Xavier University is one of the best universities one could ever attend and on top of that it's an hbcu. What I love about Xavier is its friendly environment and familiar atmosphere. It's tough academically, however, it pays off in the long run. Xavier does have a few drawbacks, however, it all depends on how you look at it. I recommend Xavier to students who are up for a challenge and won't let anything get in his/her way."
Freshman,4,I love the environment of the school. Everyone wants to see everyone succeed. There are many resources that the school offers outside of class and the professors office hours.
Sophomore,4,"My school is one of the BEST HBCU's in the country! I enjoy having like-minded black colleagues  in my classes and around the campus who are eager to succeed as much as I want to. We have lit parties, yet we know when it's time to study we study and will miss a party for the sake of our grades."
Sophomore,4,"More course, more teachers. Overall school is affordable and does challenge you to become a better student of life and offers insight to diverse leadership."
Freshman,4,"it is a very rigorous enviornment with helpful teachers, peers, and resources. the teachers really care about your success and being around motivated students that are all there to accomplish a goal as you are helps a lot. they encourage us by showing how the regimen of the school has been successful in countless people’s lives and how it will be successful for us too as long as we follow it."
Sophomore,4,"As a student athlete at Xavier I really think Xavier is a very helpful school. The teachers understand that you’re an athlete so they try to make your schedule as simple as possible. When it comes to test and quizzes they talk to you and set a new time to meet with you so you can take it. Also as a student you aren’t looked at as a number, instead you are your own individual person. I really enjoy being at Xavier because it’s both really strict when it comes to academics but also really fun when it comes to student life. There’s always different organizations teaching students about what their organization is about. Whether it’s their research that they’ve conducted or just simple information about what they are about."
Freshman,4,"Xavier University of Louisiana offers more than an education, it offers a lifetime of guarantee of knowing what you’re doing in the real world. It helps students practice for adulthood as it quickly approaches. Xavier’s academics are one of a kind. With each major they offer comes proffessors who are experts in teaching critea and making the information memorable!"
Freshman,4,XULA is a great school to attend. I feel it’s a place you can really call home. Friendly faculty and staff for the most part.
Junior,4,"I enjoy being in such a tightly knit community as well as the cultural emersion that being at an HBCU provides. As a premedical student, the environment at Xavier pushes you to be the best you can be to become a strong applicant for medical school or any other health professional school for that matter. However, the experience there is not for everyone as it is academically intensive and doesn't have much of a party atmosphere. But the lack is remedied by the fact that the school lies in the Crescent City."
Sophomore,4,"I LOVE TH CAMPUS! It's not too big nor too small. For the most part, the professors are very willing to help you WHEN you apply yourself. They keep it real and I love that. The dorms could be better but overall I love my HBCU!"
Junior,4,"The school is smaller than most universities  so the professor student ratio is quite favorable. The material is very challenging but is giving to you in a way that helps you. The students really work hard to do well in their studies and everyone helps each other so that everyone can achieve their goals and graduate. There is a great science program that produces many doctors, pharmacists, engineers etc. but every other field of study is just as good and the school also has a strong since of community."
Sophomore,4,"The school has great academics and provide many resources to help students. There are many clubs and on campus activities. I learn about new clubs all the time. The students are very welcoming. Of course, all professors are different, but upper classmen are willing to share the professors' strengths and weaknesses. The classes are ALOT of work, but it;s worth it at the end."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Xavier University of LA. It's a good academic school and although it's not a typical university with frat and sorority houses and massive dorm parties, -being by Downtown New Orleans solves this problem- it provides its students with the academic knowledge to succeed in any profession that one desires."
Sophomore,4,I'm a sophomore at Xavier and I love the school. It's a private school. You don't have to have a car to get around the city but I do have one. They have campus buses to take you every where.
Freshman,4,The campus is small and easy to navigate outside. Inside the classes are numbered strange and you're likely to go the wrong direction the first time. There are quality resources for whatever you seek help in costs are included in tuition so utilize to the greatest of your ability.
Senior,4,My overall experience at Xavier is truly one of a kind! Coming from California and moving to New Orleans was a transition. My Xavier family made me feel extremely welcomed.
Freshman,4,Xavier University of Louisiana was definitely the best choice for me. Its a small university with a family atmosphere.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience has been somewhat exciting. In that, so much has came along with being a freshman. My athletic nature gives me a competitive edge on things, whether in the form of new social arrangements, to the demanding nature of being a productive student athlete. In that light, this entire experience has truly been exciting and one that I plan to manage and pursue onto the finish line."
Freshman,4,"My short experience here at Xavier was a challenging one. Xavier pushes me to new heights and challenges me every week to be better. I like the small campus and how everyone knows everyone, it calls for teamwork. I also like how the faculty are here to help you succeed in life. One thing that I do not like is how their food is disgusting, some days it is good and other days it tastes like water, but I highly recommend Xavier to everyone"
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed the overall interaction from the staff at Xavier i.e. professors, financial aid staff, and library staff.  I even enjoy the environment on campus, it has a family feel.  I have not enjoyed my staff in the St. Katherine's dorm; the laundry washers/dryer don't work well and the 3rd floor showers are not well kept.  I don't enjoy the café food either; but there are other options for students that are cost effective.  "
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been magnificent. I love my school and I love my courses, professors, and what I learn."
College Sophomore,4,Our campus police are amazing. They help those who cant make it to class or the cafeteria due to an injury. They parole around the campus at all hours throughout the day to ensure a safe environment for the students. The campus police are very informative to each student and are always one call away. Campus crime is truly not an issue at my school. I feel very safe on campus at any time of the day/night.
College Freshman,4,"I think it's a great school, wonderful education but you really have to want it and want to do it!"
College Student,4,"I love Greek life and I feel it is an important aspect of college life. Although there is no Greek housing, the Greeks do well in serving both the campus and the rest of the community."
College Student,4,"Athletics are great, despite the fact that Xavier does not have a football team. But all of our other sports teams are great including tennis, basketball, volleyball, and track."
College Student,4,Xavier University of Louisiana is an awesome school that is dedicated to academic success.
College Junior,4,"Most professors are very helpful and will do almost anything to see you succeed and some don""t care. But for the most part, all of my professors have done extra to make sure i was in a position to succeed."
Alum,2,"Most of the faculty and staff at this school are not the nicest people to deal with. They are rude and ""bougie.""  This is not the case with everyone of course, but it is with the majority which is really sad."
Sophomore,2,"I have a huge hate in my heart for Xavier. I’m unhappy. It's depressing and my mental health has suffered severely. The social aspect of the school is deplorable in my opinion and there aren't enough engaging extracurriculars (KEY WORD ENGAGING, there's clubs, but many aren't active or present on campus). I don't feel like I'm growing as a person at the University at all and I honestly can't think of what my University has done for me to make me a more dynamic and successful individual. It hasn't bettered me. It's disappointing and I'm not just saying this out of spite. I'm a current sophomore and God willing I plan to stay and graduate just because I've already started. I'm a STEM major. I know many will read this and maybe think ""well maybe he/she just doesn't study"" or ""maybe he/she just isn't smart"" but no. I study every given moment. I graduated from a gifted public school 3rd in my class with a 4.0 (4.2 current) GPA. Xavier killed me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone honestly"
Graduate Student,2,Xavier University of Louisiana is a decent college academically.  There is an obvious bias in the professors viewpoints.  Some students do not feel comfortable on speaking about their beliefs because of how professors may mock them.
Freshman,2,The Financial Aid office doesn't care about you at all. *insert yelling Ye* The school is great academically so if you plan on living off campus it is perfect. The campus live is terrible and it feeling like a prison. We are very clinch-ish but I kinda love that low-key. Everybody is friendly enough to hang with but understand that there are still snakes out here.
Freshman,2,"I liked the size of the campus because it was easy to get around, but i didn't like how the campus is so open. There is a neighborhood in the middle of it. Most of the staff is pleasant, but there a few who are lazy. The math and english departments are great, and chemistry is decent, but the rest are pretty bad. Also New Orleans is a bad city for a college or any type of improvement for that matter. The classes are small though, which can be good. It really just feels like II'm still in high school here. Xavier doesn't give you much room to make your own decisions and grow."
Sophomore,2,"I use to like all the events that happened on campus, but recently we have been frequent dangerous situations that we can't talk about to the public happening on campus. The food is getting better, and the internet is working faster. Professors (depending on who you get) care more about your well being than a check. I would definitely not live on campus if I did not have to."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are not up to date and they are old, so the amount of money charged is way over priced. It's gross, especially the community showers in the freshmen dorms."
College Sophomore,2,Xavier is known for a school of Academics everyone so worried about maintaining their GPA to keep their scholarship that sports are not the first or anyones concern beside the athletes that play that particular sport.
College Freshman,2,It is a right of passage.
College Freshman,2,Sports are not a focus on campus whatsoever.
College Freshman,2,the food in the cafeteria is fattening and the dorm rooms are run down and need repairs.
College Freshman,2,"Team performance is good, but there isn't a lot of sports. The only sport that gets attention is the mens basketball team."
College Sophomore,2,It's very strict freshman year and it takes forever to get use to
College Sophomore,2,"Our school doesn't allow on-campus parties, so all of the parties are off-campus. The regular parties at Legacy and other spots are mostly filled with freshman, so not a lot of upperclassman go to them. Plus they're very expensive if you don't get the presales and buy them at the door. If you're a freshman, I would go to all the major parties that other freshman will be going to. Recently, a new popular spot called The Lounge opened up and has the best parties, especially around a holiday or special event. A lot of the upperclassman go to it and other people from other schools. Bourbon Street is always fun with the right people. Overall, all of the partying happens off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Almost all of the administrative staff have attitude problems and can be rude at times. Very few are nice and willingly to help you out in certain situations. The staff at the front desks of the dorms are very strict with visitation and curfew hours and can easily write you up for not following the rules for them. For parking, your car will be booted within the next 30 minutes if you park in the parking lots without a parking permit. Sometimes you can get away with it."
College Freshman,2,Our food is not the best in any way but you can always bank on a hamburger and french fries
College Freshman,2,"It exists, but it really isn't a big deal. Very low-key"
College Freshman,2,"They have extremely strict rules about everything. No drinking even if you're of age, no smoking, no sex, etc. I understand their rules but then they have such lenience in regards to privacy. You get a lot of time for visitation every weekend for private visitation, in which ""no sex"" is ever occurring lol."
College Freshman,2,"I do not know of any parties, and the parties that are going on are off campus and somewhere else."
College Sophomore,2,The Greeks are basically nonexistent on Xavier's campus.
College Junior,2,Go to the office early and get financial aid.
College Junior,2,Non-Greeks  don't care who the Greeks are..
College Junior,2,The cost it to high for students to pay on their own.
College Freshman,2,"The athletic facilities are only for athletes. There are no gyms for students to workout in. Intramurals are not a big part of campus life because basketball is the only popular one. We only have basketball, tennis and cross country as our varsity sports at school and not a lot of people attend the games or meets."
College Freshman,2,"I am a Psyhcology/ Pre-Med major. I take all the classes required for my psychology major, along with classes required for the Pre-Med curriculum. It is very hard to be a Pre-Med major. It requires a lot of time and dedication."
College Junior,2,it is so hard to connect to the schools network that it takes a good 15 minutes t keep signing i n so that the network recognizes your computer.
College Junior,2,"they don't do a good job notifying students about financial aid limits then look all sorry when you don't have anymore aid, like the student supposed to know."
College Junior,2,"If it rains too much, the streets are prone to flood and it is hard to get from one end of the campus because of the flooded streets."
College Freshman,2,Taxis are the means of transportation most freshmen have to use.  They get old and expensive quick! The buses and trolleys are fairly cheap especially for a day pass.  There are no campus shuttles throughout the day.  At one point in the semester students could tweet the student government association from 7-12 pm on weekdays only for a ride someplace.
College Freshman,2,Even though there was a rule passed that banned students from smoking on campus people do it anyways.  Many students drink and when parties are advertised they real people in with the promise of free alcohol.  The drug store around the corner does not card students so alcohol is easy available to however wants it.
College Freshman,2,Nearly everyone smokes weed or drinks alcohol…or both.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone talks about how hard it is to receive financial help here. I know the school is small so they are limited on funds, but it is pretty tough."
College Freshman,2,"Night life is not really good here. Everything is so far. Shuttles pick you up at certain times, so you are pressured into making a decision on whether or not you want to really attend. Also, there's bourbon st. which a lot of people, i'm sure, participate in drinking alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"You never know when it's going to rain, storm, or be sunny outside."
College Student,2,needs to improve with showing records accurately
College Freshman,2,"It's so crazy. Winter,Spring,Fall,Summer in one week."
College Freshman,2,Most of them are banned.
College Freshman,2,"You don't know that underage students are drinking unless you hear about it personally, it's not like they're out there about it. Also when you walk on campus, anywhere, the Mary Jane is noticeable, you can smell it."
College Student,2,There is a 17 to 1 ratio of girls to boys so the boys are generally nonexistent. It is predominantly black with Asians in a close 2nd. The boys are interested in almost all the things the girls are.
College Student,2,There are 3 meals a day at 3 set times. Don't make those times..you won't eat. There are three cafes on campus but they aren't always open. The meal plan is 3 meals a day with an added $50 per semester for cafe spending. 
College Junior,2,The strictness really comes into play during social activities. There is more things you can't say than things you can say. Social interactions are monitored (dancing and such). Language is a huge part of it. 
College Freshman,2,I personally do not enjoy the campus dining. I have heard from many others that they do not like it either. 
College Junior,2,It's okay. Only times students really show up in numbers is during Homecoming and if we play Dillard.
College Junior,2,Since are school is blocks away from Gert Town and HolleyGrove a lot of crime takes place near campus and when I say crime I mean murders. Don't safe to walk at night to McDonalds or Rally's no matter how many people you have with you. There are bullets holes in a few building on campus.
College Junior,2,Parties are weak and public transportation is horrible in New Orleans especially when 92% of the buses stop running at 10pm.
College Junior,2,Social life is bad. Administration is horrible. Only positive thing about the school is the education. And I can get a good education else where.
College Junior,2,Social life is really non existing. In order for us to have a successful party we have to join colleges with Dillard University. The events they have on campus for Homecoming and Springfest is also a complete waste of our SGA Fees. Constantly running out of food. Only have enough to feed 500 people and they know more then 500 people attend the school. I am disappointed in that aspect because I have been expose to some great Universities in Georgia and I just seen a lot better.
College Freshman,2,"The school hardly talks about the off-campus, so I can't really put any suggestions into that."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather her is very up and down. One day it's raining, the next cold, and others windy. "
College Sophomore,2,There is one the campus dining which has no variety.
College Freshman,2,I've heard horror stories from friends about how difficult and slow the process was to get financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus dining is horrible. The hours are inconvenient and we have no late-night dining options; therefore, we have to order takeout or pizza. Also, sometimes the food is not good or even looks edible so a lot of us don't eat certain meas a day, even though we are forced to pay for it. if  didn't have to pay for a meal plan I wouldn't I would use the money ad buy my own food."
College Sophomore,2,"This is college and giving us strict limitations on everything is not going to prepare us for life. However, th hail visitation rules and curfews are that bad, its just everything else."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is mediocre for the price that is paid. There are barely any options, especially for vegans and vegetarians. Hours are set and not very compatible with the average college student's schedule. "
College Senior,2,There aren't many to choose from with the guy to girl ratio being about 1:100.
College Senior,2,There is limited parking both on the street and in the parking lots. 
College Sophomore,2,"Majority of the campus is african american, now you will see some diversity in the college of pharmacy but that's pretty much it. From time to time you meet the foreign exchange students as well."
College Freshman,2,"Because XULA is a catholic based institution, drug use by any student is strictly prohibited. Underage drinking is also prohibited. The breaking of these rules will result in a loss of all or part of your financial aid. A curfew of 12am on weekdays and 2am on weekends is set for all freshman living in dorms and all visitation in dorms are monitored and are limited to 12pm to 11pm. The viewing of pornography on Xavier's wifi system will result in a suspension from wifi for a determined period of time. Any weapons brought on Xavier's campus will be confiscated and potentially turned over to the New Orleans police department."
College Freshman,2,"Parking lots at Xavier are limited and because the campus is spread out through a neighborhood, the parking lots are spread out and most times not near to where you would go to class so walking a lot is required. Parking decals that cost $50 a year are required to park in all Xavier parking lots and if one is not identified on a car in the parking lot or illegally parked on the street, that car will receive a boot on its wheel and have to pay $150 to get it removed so its best to buy a decal because street parking is limited. Also it is best to arrive at school 30 minutes early to ensure getting a parking spot closest to the class you're going to."
College Junior,2,"I wouldn't neccessarily call it strictness, you're just reminded that you came there to get an education and that comes first. Oh yeah, and that it's a ""Catholic Institution""."
Sophomore,1,"terrible. the school should have taken into account environmental and  resource changes. Additionally, time differences added a lot of stress on many students."
Junior,1,"Overall, I am very disappointed with my college experience at the Xavier University Of Lousiana. They brag about being the number one college to get African Americans into medical school but fail in many other ways including professionalism, respect, and safety. If you struggle in science classes and you plan on going to medical school I recommend going to a different school. The faculty at Xavier does not work with you in trying to help you pass. When you come to Xavier as a student you are expected to achieve and when you can't Xavier is very unforgiving. The dorms, cafeteria, and overall campus safety are awful. If you are looking for a good education, safe campus, respectful faculty, clean dorms, and overall good college experience, Xavier University is not it. Save your money and mental health and chose better!"
College Freshman,1,We don't have a football team and there really isn't much school spirit.
College Freshman,1,Xavier is a really good school ONLY if you're a bio-pre med major or pharmacy major. this school is really expensive and not worth the money in my opinion.
College Freshman,1,"HORRIBLE!!! especially for freshmen. 

very old and run down"
College Freshman,1,"School is very unhelpful, don't care about students unless they are Bio-Pre Med or Pharm major. 

WAAAAAAY too expensive for the foolery you have to deal with"
College Freshman,1,"The freshman dorms are so disgusting. The bathroom are old and constantly dirty. I heard that it's moldy because of hurricane Katrina, and the fire alarm is always going off. Overall, I hate the freshman dorms"
College Sophomore,1,You have to have a back up plan either eat in your room or out
College Freshman,1,Gay people have it best here because they have unlimited visitation while straight people do not. DO NOT COME HERE LOOKING FOR NO RELATIONSHIP MOSTLY EVERYONE HERE WILL PLAY YOU.
College Freshman,1,The officers are rude and so are the administration. Horrible school in general. You could be sexually assaulted here and no one would even know because its so easy to do undercover bad things. They are always hiring random people and always treating the young men here as criminals. Not a good school.
College Freshman,1,This school is a horrible choice do not go here. DO NOT EVEN WASTE A TRIP TO THIS COLLEGE.
College Freshman,1,"The school is unnecessarily hard and I would consider going to a school that is hard and worth it. Like this place is not worth being challenged because they do not provide you with anything. This school seriously is not worth the money, time, or effort. Parents your child will hate this school unless they come with a couple people they know but eventually you will fall out."
College Freshman,1,"Deltas run it for the girls, AKA's just came back, the Q's are lame, the Kappas are nonexistent, the Alphas are the only cool male group, they are suspended and they aren't even on campus anymore, the other greeks do not exist here. Im serious like it you are a Zeta here, you will be laughed at."
College Freshman,1,"They only sport here is basketball. Track is straight but there are no track events held at Xavier because we do not have a field. We do not have a good work out facility right now and we are getting one but it still will be open only 4 hours a day. 3-7 Monday-Friday. Closed on the weekends. DO NOT COME HERE FOR SPORTS UNLESS YOU RECEIVED A SCHOLARSHIP, THIS SCHOOL IS NOT WORTH IT. This school will give you a lot of scholarship money but honestly they do that because no one will come here. They hand out a lot of money because no one will attend this school because it sucks here. A lot of people transfer from this school because of how bad it is ran and how there are no people here to help. This school is extremely limited in tutoring, it is way to small, the environment is smelly and uncomfortable. I am serious do not come here if you are looking for fun or anything like that because this school is bad. This school is not fun unless you smoking weed or drinking. They are lenient on being under the influence but be strict when it comes to visitation. You can turn up down here but just not on campus. You will find plenty of girls here to mess with but because it is so small you can't get all of them. Ladies there are no dudes here. This school is not diverse and it is not worth it. You have to swipe for every class and if you do not go to every class you can FE and fail the course and lose your financial aid money. These folks do not care about taking your money and they are so rude down here. It feels like you are at a community college because it is so small, everyone knows each other, and it doesn't feel like college at all. Also the cleaning crew here is bad and they do not even clean up well. There is mold everywhere in the bathrooms and bugs too. DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT AN EDUCATION WITH NO FUN. THIS SCHOOL IS RIGOROUS, THEY REALLY TRY AND BE LIKE HARVARD BUT DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY NOR THE FACILITIES TO BE EVEN IN THE SAME CONVERSATION AS HARVARD."
College Freshman,1,"ONLY GET AN APARTMENT IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. IT IS NOT CHEAP BUT IT IS WORTH IT, ONLY BECAUSE XAVIER HAS EXTREMELY STRICT RULES ABOUT THEIR VISITATION AND STAYING OUT LATE."
College Freshman,1,"You do not get any type of off campus discount. That is nonexistent. Also the convenience of eating is horrible because most places close at 9 pm or 10pm and there are like all these homeless people that beg you til your ears fall off, are very scary, very weird, and they are crazy. THEY WILL ATTACK YOU. NEVER WALK ALONE. The area around this school is actually bad. It is beyond dirty and filthy, the stores smell so bad and so does the school, you might want to get a job if you go here, and this school does not offer any shuttle to take you places at night. You can only go about twice a month with the shuttle. And everything that the Dean says at orientation is a lie..unless he says there are no parties, thats true.. but no one will wake you up for class or none of that mess. Dude is a liar."
College Freshman,1,"Visitation is extremely strict. They do random room checks every once in awhile but most colleges do that. The visitation here is limited. You can barely sneak around and get someone in your room. If you ever get someone in your room after visitation, you are a king but it isnt worth it cause you will lose visitation. This school has horrible restrictions. You do not want to come here for fun. Its not fun. DO NOT COME HERE."
College Freshman,1,"The technology is horrible. The wifi is very bad and if you try and use skype or oovoo, you will most likely be out of luck. This school is not good at technology. The tech team is horrible too. They do not help and they have bad attitudes. Mostly everyone that works at Xavier have bad attitudes. They are very ugly towards people and you may end up arguing with a teacher or resident assistant. The resident assistants are horrible. The parties are okay here but THERE ARE NO PARTIES ON CAMPUS. Any party you go to will be off campus, Tulane has really good parties...(should have went there instead of here) this school does suck. DO NOT COME HERE."
College Freshman,1,"The cafe is horrible. They do not serve good food for you. The food they have here is not like something you will find at any other school. It is not 24 hours and it is very bad. Seriously you will spend more money on off campus food than on campus food. You will complain about not eating good enough food. If you are a male, you will not like this school. There are a lot of girls here, but no lie most of the girls here are undercover thots. They will give you something. Not a lot of girls here are bad but a good majority are. I suggest you attend a school where you will enjoy your campus experience. This school is not good. DO NOT GO HERE!"
College Freshman,1,"The dorms at this school are extremely horrible. This school is horrible in general. The administration do not help nor do they know anything. They hire people who do not even know how the school operates, to work the front desk in the dorms. Visitation is limited for freshman. It is 6-11 Thursday-Sunday and thats it. It is not fun and the greek life is extremely horrible. The Alphas are the best group here but...they are not even on campus. They are suspended. The deltas run the yard for the females but the events are low key and it impossible to get involved on campus because its so small and there is nothing to do. The class meetings are boring and so is the school. Also as an incoming Freshman you will always lose visitation randomly. I am very serious, no matter who you are you will eventually lose visitation. DO NOT GO HERE. Im beyond serious."
College Sophomore,1,Something that bothers me is the strictness of the curfew enforced on students.
College Sophomore,1,It is very poor. Xavier is an HBCU.
College Sophomore,1,Staying in Katherine Drexel hall was the worst experience of my freshmen year. It was never clean and the curfew was ridiculous.
College Junior,1,I wish they would tell students more about off-campus housing in order to give students more options.
College Freshman,1,"Xavier is very strict. Drug use is prohibited of course, but even if you are 21 you cannot bring alcohol on campus or in your dorm room. We have certain days and times for visitation, and each person has to turn their ID into the residence hall director during visitation and retrieve it after. If you violate any rules that Xavier has, you have to go in front of a number of administrators and plead your case as to why they shouldn't withdraw you from school. Professors are very strict about cheating. They will turn you into the Dean of Academic Affairs if you look like you are cheating."
College Freshman,1,The most popular varsity sports on campus are the basketball games because there is no football team.  The games are boring and almost nobody attends.  The athletic facilities for students are HORRIBLE! The gym for non athletes is small and half of the equipment does not work and the hours are not flexible.
College Freshman,1,Every time I have tried to get in on the party scene the location is usually a club where I have had to stand outside trying to get in for over 30 mins and in the end I always ended up leaving before I am let inside.  This IS NOT a party school.
College Freshman,1,I hate the curfew and visitation policies.
College Freshman,1,"I stay in Katherine Drexel residence hall. It's pretty disgusting, there's mold above the showers, floors are always dirty (either with pee, blood, etc.), the toilets are usually unclean. A lot of people get turned off by continuing to stay on campus because of how nasty it is."
College Freshman,1,Computer lab in library gets crowded pretty fast because it is one of the only ones that students are aware of. Printing is not that hard of a task because printers are available in library. The network/wireless reliability is extremely poor. Students complain about the wi-fi all the time.
College Freshman,1,"The campus is so strict that it makes student want to rebel every chance they get. The students are so used to restrictions so when they finally get out they act crazy. They think they're being smart with their specific visitation hours, but in reality it makes the students more eager to get into the opposite sex's room on those designated days of visitation."
College Freshman,1,Xavier has no tolerance for drugs or alcohol.
College Freshman,1,If you want to eat somewhere you better know the phone number of these off-campus dining places and or have a car to get there.
College Freshman,1,"If you are going to come here, please have a lot of financial aid because it's just too much all around."
College Freshman,1,"I hate the housing here. Theres mold on the ceilings and the bathrooms are disgusting, not to mention the roaches"
College Junior,1,They really drag you around in circles to get a few dollars out of them.
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman living on campus really sucks, they are so strict. I heard the rules get more lenient as you advance."
College Senior,1,Without a car I don't know how any one can get around the city. 
College Senior,1,If you are looking for nightlife on campus you will not find much. There are a few places around schools like Tulane but unless you have a car you won't really be enjoying much of that.
College Freshman,1,"Expect to find little diversity.. You will only see African American and Asians. I honestly do not mind. I am not racist. But the people at Xavier are so closed minded towards other ethnic groups. I am Hispanic and i have found myself on very awkward situations, Various times, where classmates would talk about how they got accepted into other Universities, but they were not going into a white people school. Xavier community is very close minded when it comes to diversity."
College Senior,1,"If you attend Xavier, the only nightlife you should be considering is a nice comfy bed or studying."
College Freshman,1,"People always stress about finding a safe apartment in New Orleans. The city is very unsafe and the most decent apartments are the same costs as the dorms we live in. Most students purchase apartments in Metairie when living off campus because it is close, safe, and affordable."
College Freshman,1,The quality of the food is inconsistent as well as the options.
College Senior,1,"horrible parking, will get a book and or ticket for anything."
College Senior,1,crazy weather in which you will not be excused from class. a hurricane can be on its way and you still have to go to class
College Freshman,1,"There is transportation, but it is very limited to specific and general places around the campus and the city."
College Sophomore,1,The library is always noisy. Other schools' equipment is more up to date.
College Sophomore,1,"We pay $50 for a parking permit, and we're not always guaranteed a place to park. The roads are narrow and almost all drivers have a terrible case of road rage."
College Sophomore,1,RTA ( the public transportation system in New Orleans) only run every 45 minutes in the day and every hour at night.
College Sophomore,1,I have friends who have been ion XUPD force for over 20 years and they never kicked anybody off of campus and they won't. They want their money.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. Simply because there is limited available parking, everybody just ends up parking in the streets. Which is bad for the people that haven't yet mastered parallel parking. The only way to insure you get a spot is to get to school before 11."
College Junior,1,"The cumputers on campus are kind of old. They update the software, but they just need to do away with the whole thing, because it's almost 7 years old and they run slow. Computer labs have peak hours and they can be filled for hours, especially during finals. The network is reliable but they can be slow at times. You pay for printing and sometimes it can be a hassle because you can run out of money on your card and you'll have run a half mile just to insert money. You can bring a personal computer and connect it to the school's wifi, but that's about it."
Recent Alumnus,1,There's Only One Cafeteria! There's only one cafeteria and not much to choose from!
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Much Going on – Xavier University is a small campus, therefore there is little about Greek Life."
College Sophomore,1,The meals get too repetitive and as the semester comes to an end the cooks start slacking on their jobs when we need good food the most!
College Junior,1,Strict as Hell – Xavier is extremely strict! Curfews for upperclassmen on campus!!
College Junior,1,"Bad Outweighs the Good – Whilw Xavier is an excellent school, it seems as though they mainly focus on pharmacy. The other course are just mediocre"
College Freshman,1,The dining services in campus are horrible. There are no outside vendors so the cafeteria is the only option. There is no variety in the choices and the quality is not good. Because the food is being paid for students should have better choices.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is okay, they do not provide as much fun."
College Freshman,1,"xavier is an academic school, nothing more and nothing less. don't even think about having fun. xavier will do everything possible to prevent this from happening."

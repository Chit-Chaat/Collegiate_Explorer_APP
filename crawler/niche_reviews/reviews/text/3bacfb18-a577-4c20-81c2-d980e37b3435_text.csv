Sophomore,5,"when I chose to go to Goodwin University, I thought about location and what the program had to offer. I'm a single mother I work full time I have two young children and I have a part time job. With all of my daily activities going on I needed to find a school that had the program I was interested in, as well as the flexibility. I know  I needed to find a school that offered night classes, as well as online classes. Although I found another school that offered evening classes, I compared the prices, and what the program had to offer. I decided to go with Goodwin because it was more cost effective as well as the school offers online classes, which was good because I would be able to work on my own time based on what the course flexibility would be.  With that being said I am now a sophomore at Goodwin University and even though I have some credits that transferred in, I believe I chose the right school to go to."
Sophomore,5,"This is my second semester at Goodwin, although I am a sophomore I choose to take online classes instead of going in because it was more ideal for me. When I first started I took a summer module which consist of 15 week classes which is technically a semester long ""cramped"" into 7.5 weeks. Although the advisors tell you, you can work on your own timing it's actually not true. Following the syllabus is and always would be the best way to go, and if you have any problems yours able to talk to your professor either by email or phone. For me I personally liked online classes depending on what class you take the course outline is simply just reading answering discussions, essay's, and taking a quiz, or a final, just like if you were on campus your able to get tutoring if need be."
Junior,5,"Goodwin College is located in East Hartford, CT, but also offers classes online.

The most commonly reported benefits of attending Goodwin College are ""Good teachers"" and ""Positive environment"", but respondents also mentioned ""Flexible class hours"" and ""Hands-on training"" as notable benefits."
Junior,5,"Online Classes at Goodwin University. ""Having the flexibility to choose between daytime, online, and evening classes is great, especially for students who have jobs or kids."" Their nursing program starts classes 3 times a year and they have the largest nursing school in CT. They are very business savvy and new create programs in fields that are in demand or about to flourish. Most importantly, I can say having gone there they have great teachers and great clinical instructors in their nursing program. I can't say enough about goodwin. It is expensive, but I think it has made me a very well rounded candidate for any nursing path I choose, so the cost is minor compared to the experience for me."
Junior,5,"The first three semesters, I was fully online. The professors were quick to email back when you had a question. The professors went out of their way to make you feel like you were right there in class with them."
Senior,5,Assignments were very do-able with appropriate time management and the material presented was beneficial to our learning. It helped develop and maintain our critical thinking skills in the nursing program. I am very satisfied with the program and glad I chose Goodwin's Nursing Program.
Senior,5,"Goodwin's faculty and staff are very supportive of one's career and helps everyone  to grow. They want good nurses out on the field so the faculty members make sure they answer our questions and concerns and assure we understand the material that is being taught. If extra help is needed, they offer flexible office hours and practice assignments to help students who are struggling. Goodwin University is a very nurturing facility and encourage hard work, strong work ethic from their students."
Sophomore,5,"I was scared going into the summer of 2020 semester because I had a science class I was taking and I was feeling intimidated because I am a hands on learned when it comes to things like science. However, I have been pleasantly surprised. My professor has been very helpful if I have concerns in regards to material. With the lab material being online it has been put very clear and easy to understand as well as engaging. Its actually a lot of fun and I find I’m doing very well despite my initial thoughts."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Goodwin College! I find that all of the faculty from the Dean all the way to the security team and janitorial staff are absolutely amazing! Everyone I encounter on the staff at Goodwin are so friendly and helpful. All of the have been wonderful and willing to help in any way they can to help you succeed in your journey. I also find the environment at Goodwin to be very warm and welcoming and I feel comfortable and confident taking classes here. I also find that the library is an awesome environment to work in and the library staff is knowledgeable and are ready to help! A key point to Goodwin College is their tutoring center. It’s absolutely free for students and all the tutors I have worked with have been wonderful! And lastly, Goodwin college has counseling services free to students. I think that is such a wonderful service to provide. I recommend Goodwin to all my friends looking to go back to school and I rave about it to everyone!"
Senior,5,I have only experienced orientation online but it was so welcoming and very organized. They introduced everyone and actually had great personalities
Senior,5,I am beginning my accelerated nursing program and they have been so helpful in everything that I needed.
Sophomore,5,I love that my advisor always checks in with me to make sure that I am on the right path with my classes. The fact that I can complete most of my course work online is great since I live 40 minutes away!
Sophomore,5,Very easy to complete coursework and also very flexible! I have been able to use my tablet with online learning everywhere I go.
Junior,5,"During my time at Goodwin College I have been able to experience a wide variety of activities, professors, students and courses. There are an immense amount of resources for students to receive help and guidance. The professors encourage student to student interaction which helps create a rich and close community. I would highly recommend Goodwin to anyone considering it as an option."
Freshman,5,"It's a great school, I attend evening classes, it works well for me.  

The instructors are great, they really want you to succeed.  They challenge mind, encourage spirit and help to bring out your greatness."
Senior,5,I like Goodwin College because of the atmosphere of the facility. There were a couple of teachers that help me with a situation that I was going through and by them giving me encouragement I was able to exceed and change myself into a better person.
Freshman,5,I've had an amazing experience going to Goodwin College. I'm learning a lot and would recommend anyone to enroll.
Freshman,5,"I like how easy it was to apply to Goodwin College. The admissions office was very friendly and helpful. Financial aide does all they can to ensure you understand aide, scholarships, and loans."
Junior,5,"I have been here for a little over a year, and so far I love it. Everyone has been so helpful, and responds quickly to any questions I have. My professors and academic adviser are always there to help. The schedule is very accommodating to my busy schedule. I am a single mom with 3 children, and I also work full time, so this is very important to me."
Sophomore,5,"They have been very helpful, any time I had a question or issue it was easy to get a hold of them.  IT is very helpful, made the process very easy."
Niche User,5,Goodwin College has a pretty campus near the CT river. There are a diverse selection of bachelor's and associate's degree options to choose from. The staff is amazing and everyone appears to be very helpful. The college has 7.5 week fast track classes in order to accelerate your learning and complete degrees faster than other colleges.
Freshman,5,Choosing Goodwin College was one of the best choices I could have ever made! The staff is super helpful and intent on helping you achieve your dreams. They make it super easy to help you choose the correct career path for you and show you what needs to be done to get there.
Freshman,5,Everyone has been really helpful and the teacher I've had so far have been great. I like that there are online classes offered because my work schedule is busy and it allows me to get everything done on my own time. The teachers have been responsive when I have a question.
Junior,5,"The staff and instructors are so supportive and friendly. Everyone says hello to one another and holds the door for each other as well. Far more organized than any other school I have been to. Occasionally things (ie: paperwork) will slip through the cracks, but easily rectified if brought to staff’s attention. I do wish there was a gym and that the cafe offered more gluten free options."
Sophomore,5,"I love the flexibility in schedules! As a mom of four, flexibility is a must. Campus is clean and well maintained and the grounds are beautiful. The view of the Ct river is amazing. Faculty and staff is professional and personable making it easy to discuss anything with them. I also am very fond of the professors I have had so far. Online professors provide a open line of communication and are quick to respond to emails and messages which makes online learning so much easier. The professors on campus are friendly and knowledgeable. They have been very encouraging and truly want to see their students succeed. The school also provides so many options for extra curricular activities like clubs, keeping moral up."
Freshman,5,I have really enjoyed my time with Goodwin College. I never feel like I have a question that I can't get assistance with. Signing up for classes was so simple. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the night, weekend and, online classes. They make it very easy to take classes while working with the diverse hours and days. I also enjoy there MODS online class option, where you are able to take one class for 7 weeks followed by a second class for 7 weeks. Therefore able to complete 2 classes in the same semester without over doing it at a time."
Freshman,5,I love Goodwin College mainly based on the flexibility of their classes and I am able to take what I need before starting the program  and don't have to drive to the campus.  The staff is great and very helpful with all questions I have.
Sophomore,5,Goodwin College has been an overall great experience for me.  I was a little apprehensive at the beginning not knowing what to expect.  Everyone has been more than friendly and willing to help with whatever you need.  The professors are knowledgeable in their field as  I have been able to ask any question and receive a proper response.  The students have also been great as we are all there for the same reason.  I am only able to take the evening classes and have felt safe around the campus.  Since my first class I have had a positive experience and I have been recommending Goodwin as a great place to further or start an education program.  I am pleased to have met so many wonderful people as well as obtain new knowledge for myself to be able to better myself.  I am very pleased that I chose Goodwin to continue my college education.
Freshman,5,"I just started my classes at Goodwin college. So far I like it, the environment and atmosphere in classes are excellent. Some professors are not grading fair, but most of them are very nice and understandable. I would suggest for everyone to pick this college, and you will not regret it."
Freshman,5,"Goodwin College have the best and caring Proffesors. You learn alot. Goodwin is clean and is a kind enviroment. I feel safe because of there are security guards, but it seems that because we are 18 and older, our reaponsibility is to keep ourself safe, in other word they don't care about your safety because we are adults."
Junior,5,"The nursing program is great, they are very supportive and the LPN bridge has really been an easy transition for me."
Alum,5,Very strong RN program that now included BSN program as well.  I graduated equipped to go to work in a hospital setting right away.
Sophomore,5,"The support they give to their students. Also the availability of classes, having options for online classes and hybrid. Flexibility is a must in life."
Freshman,5,I love how nice the teachers are in Goodwin college and the school itself. The only thing I would change is the price it’s alittle pricy
Freshman,5,I like how the College and Professor's alone work hard and stay longer to make sure their student's achieve in what ever course they're taking. I love the flexibility and the ability to email or chat with your teacher's or librarian.
Freshman,5,"Goodwin College staff are very quick to respond when I need help. I love the flexibility of the college, you can work full time and still get the career you need. They have online, night and day classes which help with anyones schedule."
Freshman,5,Such a great environment to learn in. The staff is with you every single step of the way. They are knowledgeable and supportive. Goodwin made my choice simple when choosing to return to college. I know at Goodwin I will be a successful student.
Freshman,5,"HI,
I went to a community college once before,  and when I reached out for help, I was dead ended multiple times, and eventually forced to quit. Goodwin College, and it's outstanding staff make it ridiculously easy for absolutely anybody, including those with learning disabilities, and all walks of life,  to be able to learn, retain whats being learned and ENJOY being a student. I missed being a 4.0 student by ONE exam this past semester (my own fault of course), but in the meanwhile, before Goodwin College, all paths were unclear as far as my capabilities went. I dropped out of High School THREE TIMES before I found an outstanding group to help me push through to get my diploma,  and now I have another OUTSTANDING STAFF standing beside me once more. THANK YOU ALL FOR EVERY WAKING MOMENT GIVEN TO THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT COME TO YOU WITH PROBLEMS AND LEAVE WITH A DEGREE A FRESH START, HOPE AND A NEW OUTLOOK ON LIFE. God bless you all. Thank You. Thank You.  Thank You."
Junior,5,"i love this college! classes are small, professors are proactive and always available when needed. they offer alot of resources to help students get through college"
Freshman,5,Great. Teachers and faculty are helpful and truly one of a kind. I love the flexibility and availability of classess. The only down side is cost but with all that I love I’m willing to pay more.
Sophomore,5,The teachers are amazing. They all take the time to help you understand the material and provide growth in the class. There are many resources provided by the school for success.
Junior,5,Goodwin wants their students to succeed. They have alot of available resources to help their students that are not available elsewhere. I was more successful  at Goodwin in 2 years than 8 yrs at a community college. However it is fairly expensive.
Freshman,5,"I have just begun at goodwin college with the intent of doing dental hygiene , all the employees are very helpful and extremely kind. The staff want you to succeed and are willing to help students as much as they can."
Freshman,5,"Goodwin is a great college for everyone. Everyone is very welcoming and willing to help. Goodwin offers many career fairs for students, extracurricular activities and academic help. Best experience ever!"
Freshman,5,I started Goodwin college in 2017 after being out of school for over 20 years.  I was very nervous going back to school and Goodwin College has been very helpful in getting me ready for college. The professors and staff are great and having the option to do online classes is great.
Sophomore,5,It has been an awesome experience. Since the first day the staff is always able to   help you and the professors are very knowledgeable and professional.
Sophomore,5,The advisors go out of their way to help and the teachers create a great learning experience! The campus also offers tutoring and student services. There is always a place or a person you can turn to for help.
Niche User,5,It’s real clean and has a lot of nice places you can go to just hang out. I recommend it to anyone wanting to go to a 4 year school. A bit expensive however
Sophomore,5,Goodwin College is very helpful with classes that work around my schedule. Most classes are offered online for the people that cannot make it to class because of their schedule. I truly have nothing bad to say about Goodwin College. Very glad I am attending school here.
Sophomore,5,"Goodwin college offers many students services, gives back to their community, events for  the students and their family to partipate in."
Freshman,5,So far I have had great professors who help me as much as they can . Very flexible with hours . Class rooms feel comfortable and I feel I can learn and have successful class discussions. Prifessores are always available to me every time I needed something .
Freshman,5,"As far as class times go, they are very flexible in offering a day and night class option. They will also tell you they offer day, evening and weekend clinicals. They do, however the way they determine what you get is by a lottery where each student picks a number out of a bag and that is the order you get to choose. If the only options left are days and times you can't do, they tell you your options are to make it work or sit the semester out and have first pick next time. Seems pretty harsh since it is a pretty expensive program."
Sophomore,5,I love Goodwin College! They have small class sizes and professor know the students by name. Its good for students who don't like big lecture hall with hundreds of one people and the campus over looks the Connecticut river.
Freshman,5,"So far as a new student to Goodwin the staff is overall very helpful in picking classes, getting finical aid setup, and picking the right major for you. One thing i would like to change is the cost of classes."
Junior,5,I like the flexibility of the class schedules. The campus is beautiful and so far all of the staff has been incredibly helpful. The pre-requisites to the nursing program can take quite a while so it's best to take as many classes as you can each semester. I like that they have a strong online curriculum and I was able to complete a majority of my classes that way. I rated it low for party scene/dorms because they really don't apply. A lot of the student body is adult based and those who are returning to school.
Sophomore,5,"I honestly LOVE this college. The faculty and staff are simply amazing.  Admissions was incredibly helpful in getting me started and very optimistic about my future.  The advising staff is literally ALWAYS available via phone, email or in person and they are happy to help.  The professors are caring, patient and genuinely want all us to succeed. I have never felt more at home at a college."
Sophomore,5,This is my first semester at Goodwin and I am very happy with my decision to attend college here. The professors and wonderful and know the material.  The library has materials for the science classes such as models and slides to help learning difficult material easier outside the class setting. Defiantly recommend this school to anyone looking to further their education.
Sophomore,5,"I love Goodwin College. Their class offerings of on ground, online, hybrid, day, night, 15 week and 7 week make it easy to find a schedule that will fit your life and goals."
Junior,5,"The nursing program is amazing. We get to participate in so much. We have O.R., endo, and I.R. observation days. Any opportunity to accompany a patient to I.C.U., or on any diagnostic test, we're right by their side. 
The instructors seek out opportunities for students to gain practical experience. They allow our voices to be heard during safety huddle. They treat us with the utmost respect and value our input.
The staff, in turn, treat us as peers and adjuncts, not as speedbumps in their patient care. 
Goodwin makes me a better nurse with every clinical and lecture day."
Junior,4,I have been at Goodwin for a little more than 2 years and I could not have picked a better school. The professors are very professional and I have learned so much while attending.
Freshman,4,This is my first year at Goodwin and I love going to my classes because classes are usually in small groups.
Senior,4,"It has been in interesting ride, but it was awesome!!  I would recommended for anybody.  It is conveniently located off Route 2, and has a good long term support for the for their alumni."
Freshman,4,I like Goodwin College because the teachers are constantly there to help and support you and the class times work around my busy schedule.
Freshman,4,So far this place is great. Super flexible schedule the professors are great and super helpful. So happy to be back in school.
Senior,4,Staff especially counselors are very attentive and always there to help. There is lots of flexibility when it comes to the classes needed and working around daily lives.
Sophomore,4,Goodwin College is my saving grace they were the last school to make me actually feel as if they actually cared about my education. The professors really stand behind their students to make their dreams come true. As long as your willing to put in the work they are willing to help you. Not once did anyone at Goodwin College discourage me from chasing my dreams of becoming a nurse. I am truly thankful to be at a school where everyone cares about the students and just want everyone to succeed. I'm happy to be apart of a community that is accepting of everyone even if you messed up in college the first time around. It's not about the mistakes you have made it's about how you correct them!
Freshman,4,I think I made a good decision to transfer to Goodwin. Their nursing program is reputable with a plus of accepting applicant three times a year! Goodwin works well with students that work full time and have other responsibilities outside of school. They want you to succeed
Niche User,4,"I enjoy the fact that I am a dual-enrolled scholar that is in high school, meaning that I take early college courses free of tuition. I am doing this in order to save money."
Senior,4,"Overall, I’ve been happy with my experience at Goodwin. I’m currently in the last semester of the nursing program. This school I geared towards adult learners offering flexible class schedule including online and hybrid classes."
Freshman,4,I’m currently taking all online classes so far it’s been a good experience other than issues with financial aid.
Freshman,4,I would like to see the campus cafe update and add on to their menu. Overall my experience so far has been good.
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman, everyone has been so friendly and helpful. From admissions to financial aid and everyone in between, all of my questions have been answered promptly and fully. I highly recommend attending an info session if one is available for your program as well."
Sophomore,4,"Good school, very expensive. Great teachers. They really want you to succeed. Help is always available. IT dept is lacking."
Alum,4,Goodwin college is a small school with frindly staff. Everyone is very helpful in guiding the students towards the right path.
Sophomore,4,I've been attending Goodwin College for that past 3 years and it's been a good experience. Everyone there is very helpful and will help you achieve your goals. I recommend this school to adults who are continuing their education.
Freshman,4,Love this place and the staff is great! I wish it was less expensive! I have been to a few colleges and after 8 years I came back here. They help you every step of the way. Someone is always available to help. They are very involved in the community. They have so many programs for the students and the families. They involve everyone.
Sophomore,4,Wonderful school with incredible flexibility for someone with a busy schedule. A bit expensive for a commuter school.
Junior,4,"If you are planning to proceed your education in nursing, Goodwin College has a point system in which makes it harder to get to the program. That is the only  down side. My advisor, Kristin Moreland, is great. She listens, she gives you feedbacks and she has made a big difference in my journey. The professors that I had taken class with, had been very attentive to my needs."
Freshman,4,"In finding a school that has a LPN to RN program this was the best fit.  It is frustrating that I have to retake science classes even though I hold a Bachelors Degree.  The option for hybrid and online classes does help in a busy schedule of life, kids, and work."
Sophomore,4,"Goodwin College is the college that works when basically no other college works with your schedule. I am a mom of young kids, have a house and am married. I have tried community college because it is cheaper but it does not have the flexibility Goodwin does. They offer many online courses, courses all day and evening and even on the weekends. It is what works for a student with a very busy lifestyle especially working and a family."
Sophomore,4,Goodwin College is a good college. To be honest its the best college I've ever attended. There customer service is excellent. Overtime I've contacted someone at this college someone always gets back to me. Classes are very convenient to match with work schedule. A lot of online classes are available at this school. This school offers a lot of support for the students. Advisors work so hard along with students every step of the way to ensure success. The only reason why I gave this school a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because of the expense. Its a private school so no surprises there its expensive.
Freshman,4,"When I was looking for direction Goodwin College helped me figure out what I needed to do to get my bachelors degree. They got right to the point and within an hour I was on my way to earning a higher degree. I felt like I wasn’t just a number. 
They gave me hope for the future. Before I found them I was unmotivated. It was all about knowing what I needed to do to make my education get back on track."
Junior,4,Been a student with Goodwin College for the last 4 years part time and my over all experience has been good. Tuition is high and admission into the Nursing program is extremely limited with applicants having to submit and wait from 3-4 times causing students to have to look elsewhere for nursing programs.
Junior,4,I liked that Goodwin College genuinely wants their students to succeed! They have tons of resources that are there to help you succeed academically but also after graduation when entering into the career world. I have had trouble finding aid for school and they have found me money to help me with my financial burden.
Sophomore,4,"I love the flexibility the school offers. The online, weekend, and night classes make it easier for students who also work full time.  All of the staff including professors, admission officers, and advisors are extremely kind and helpful."
Senior,4,"The campus is very clean and comfortable. The staff are very welcoming and helpful, as well as friendly. The professor are good and go the extra mile. The cafeteria is small so is the student center not much for me to do as a student. Although the activities that are always offered do make up for the small space. They are up to date on all the latest learning material and technology that is the biggest thumbs up. Overall good school."
Freshman,4,Very new and innovative buildings.  The teachers are friendly and helpful.  Great parking.  The landscaping is beautiful.  There is no living arrangements and it is all commuters.  There is not good food options on campus.
Niche User,4,"I loved that Goodwin offered early classes that I took while I was in high school. The classes they offered to other students and I were classes we were actually interested in and enjoyed. Not only were the classes fun, the professors were extremely understanding of our situation of  being high school students, but challenged us at the same time. I took in a lot of information from those classes and I also earned 15 college credits."
Freshman,4,"My advisor helped me with scholarship help and assisted with setting up classes that fit my schedule , super convenient to have weekend and night time classes"
Sophomore,4,Attending the Goodwin College was certainly a great experience! All the teachers were very helpful and every student will feel connected with everyone. The way the teachers teach the students are very easy to understand
Alum,4,My experience was better than I expected. Everyone works to help you succeed. The professors are all professional and caring. They totally understand the daily life each student has and try to disperse the work in benefit of the student.
Alum,4,I have been associated with this college for over 10 years now in one shape or another and they really do go out of their way for you to make sure your college experience is a good one.
College Freshman,4,After graduating Goodwin College I plan to stay a my current job at Hartford Hospital. Currently I am CNA and once I get my nursing degree I hopefully cause stay were I am and switch over to the nursing role.
College Freshman,4,"At Goodwin College the class sizes small depending on the class. In one of my classes I would have maybe 15-20 students in a class, maybe even less. The teacher can get to know the students one a first name basis. I like that the class sizes are small because I feel more comfortable talking to the teacher and they know who I am instead of me being a number in a big auditorium. Goodwin offers many courses for students, courses includes nursing, business, home land security, teaching and many more."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school because the class sizes are small, which means that the teachers get to know you on first name basis. My school also has flexible class times for adults that have jobs like myself. Goodwin has day and evening classes as well as hybrid classes which are classes that you take on campus and off campus. Goodwin also gives very good support to their students, they offer tutoring on campus as well as online tutoring for free. I would recommend Goodwin College to any in coming high school student as well as adults who want further their education."
College Junior,4,Flexible class schedule allows me to work full time
College Junior,4,Easy to access and post
College Junior,4,Professors engage the student to help learn
College Junior,4,The RN program is well received by employers
College Junior,4,Competitive and up to date with current day employ
College Junior,4,The flexible schedule is helpful for working moms.
College Student,4,"I was able to be a Part-time worker and still able to take morning classes, which was very convenient because i was then able to complete all class materials after classes in the Learning Center and use computers to find resources. i was still a new student so i didn't have any credits to transfer."
College Junior,4,"Fairly easy to schedule. I have taken mostly night or online classes. Night classes start at 6, after work gets out."
College Junior,4,"Have only used for career fairs, but they are easily accessible to anyone that wants to use them."
College Junior,4,"Classes are what you put into them. The professors are all there to help, even the online ones."
College Junior,4,Great experience. Gave me all the tools to succeed post college.
College Sophomore,4,They easily took 43 credits that I had from previous colleges. The class times are flexible enough to be able to work full time and go to school full time as well. I haven't had any frustrations with my experience at Goodwin.
College Sophomore,4,I have no done any online courses.
College Sophomore,4,There is staff on campus to help place you in internships or job opportunities. I am not far enough in my education yet to have needed to use these services.
College Sophomore,4,I cannot wait to receive my degree from Goodwin College. I have just started my education here but so far I am definitely enjoying it.
College Sophomore,4,"I am entering the Social Work major at Goodwin which is a new Bachelorette program that they are starting. Since I will be within the first cohort of students to enter the program, the program is still being designed. So far the workload is tolerable and the teachers are great."
College Sophomore,4,"Choosing to attend Goodwin College was one of the best decisions I have made. Although the classes are expensive, I feel that I am definitely receiving a good education. The environment is warm and welcoming, and the staff is also very helpful and encouraging. The professors understand that each student has a life outside of the classroom and they are willing to work with you. The classes are flexible and you can easily fit them into your schedule, as well as doing independent study if you are unable to make it to class regularly. I love Goodwin."
College Senior,4,"As part of the nursing program we are required to complete 5 semesters. They require one lecture class for 3-5 hours and one clinical for 8 hours a week. This can be completed in either days or nights which works well with students who work or have children. We have a moderate workload but it is not overwhelming. Clinical is at surrounding nursing homes, hospitals, and rehab centers. Many students have been hired right out of college into the hospitals that precept us."
College Senior,4,My school works very well with mothers and people who work full time. Classes are available all year round including nights and weekends. I was able to complete my degree while keeping a full time job the entire time. The nursing classes average around 25 students in lecture and 5-8 students per clinical group. The admission process went very smoothly with the help of the staff. The teachers are extremely knowledgeable in their field.
College Junior,4,Most of my credits from CCSU and Capital Community College transferred over to Goodwin. This was both general core classes like english and algebra as well as electives and humanities courses like abnormal psychology and life-span development. Any questions I had the advisors were easily able to answer for me in a reasonable amount of time and I don't think I had to repeat any course which I did have to do when I transferred from Capital to CCSU.
College Junior,4,They have a career services center and they also offer higher degrees in many fields for those who want to continue their education.
College Junior,4,They have a career services center which is open to students who are enrolled and then accessible to alumni as well. They will help with resumes and even job placements.
College Junior,4,I really haven't had any professor that I would complain about except for one A&P instructor who just never seemed to give us any real direction. The quality of the labs though are great. You definitely get your moneys worth in there. The class sizes are pretty small and the convenience of scheduling is great.
College Junior,4,I'm in the nursing program now and it is by far the hardest thing I have ever done. It takes up a lot of time outside of the classroom but the instructors are willing to help. They have a tutor specifically for the nursing students and the head of the nursing department is wonderful and accommodating if situations arise. All day clinical experiences are nonstop and you are exhausted by the end of them; but it really is hands on in hospital settings.
Niche User,2,"I highly recommend going somewhere else for your education. Many people go here for the nursing program. The cost for just one of their science classes is almost $4,000. The problem is that you MUST take the pre-req classes there or you do not get the points that you need to get into the program. I would recommend going to a community college before even thinking about going here. Even though they offer a BSN, they make you get your associates degree first. The advising staff are completely unorganized. You make an appointment to figure out your next semesters classes, and suddenly you need to take 4 more classes than they told you that you needed to the semester before. Its almost as they make stuff up as they go along. If you're going to pay an incredible amount of money, you should be able to get a quality education."
Junior,2,"Good environment with faculty and resources provided to aid and assist in your academic career. Goodwin is an exceptional school with small sized classes which gives you that one on one connection with you and your professor and/or peers. The school hosts a good amount of events throughout the year that range from community service to recreational fun with other students on campus. Considering the cost of tuition of Goodwin College more is expected. The school doesn’t have any sports teams but instead has clubs hosted by students. As for other recreational activities, not much is available. This school has the sort of style that speaks “come in, do your work, graduate and leave”. Not much diversity for student life."
College Junior,2,"I was extremely upset after I completed my application to Goodwin and found out that many of my credits from other institutions would not transfer.  I attended both Merrimack College and University of Connecticut - both reputable schools with respected curriculums.  I found it extremely frustrating that, although I had taken four different Psychology courses at those schools, Goodwin did not accept all of them, and I still had to take another 100 level Psychology class to fulfill Goodwin's requirements.  All of the information in that class ended up being, essentially, a review for me, and a waste of my time and money.  Goodwin also requires that students take a library research course, which is yet another waste of time and money since I have prior college experience and am more than familiar with library research practices.  It was not possible to test out of either of those courses, so I was forced to spend the money and take the time to complete them when I could have been taking other classes to get me closer to completing my degree."
College Junior,2,"I was first told that there would be no out-of-pocket expenses to get started, and that's all I've had."
College Sophomore,2,I don't like the fact that not all credits can be transfered.  They make you take more classes then you need which they profit at from all the extra classes.
College Junior,2,"Tuition is very expensive at my school. After four years of education, I ran out of financial aid and now I have to start paying out of pocket for another year until I graduate. However, I think the tuition costs are worth it because Goodwin College has already helped me achieve my career goals and I haven't even graduated yet."
College Junior,2,My major is homeland security. Great teachers for the major.  I feel like the school doesn't care about me because I am not a nursing student.
College Junior,2,"Goodwin is a great school if your a nursing student. If you are not like me, its horrible its like they dont even care about you and just want your money. There is zero community on campus. Goodwin is more like a seconded job to most students and professors. I also find that none academic staff sucks they have know clue what they are doing."
College Sophomore,2,"Transfering credits is a horrible experience and there has always been problems and issues with this issue. Very poor. It's a private new 501c rookie college as stated, in 1999.  If you have 64 credits and an associates degree in Health from UCONN and transfer to goodwin you wil 98% have, very seriously, little to no credits. You maybe would have 8 to 12 credits, and it's a horror show. 60 thousand in debt and now have to start over with more debt, and all that work trash. Even R.Ns that have worked in ER as RNs, already trained liscensed going back for their BSN are robbed. They have to take prequisites and other R.N classes already taken. Overal very poor.

College Freshman,2,For a college that advertises that they work around the working person is such a lie. They sucker into taking their classes by filling you with empty promises. Not happy with this college at all.
College Sophomore,2,"Ok- I do have to say one negative thing about Goodwin, and that is the lack of space in the library! The library seems huge, but there are very few private spaces to go sit. Also, there are not enough computers. Lastly, the librarians will be out to get you if you print too many pages. There are absolutely no color printers as well. I don't have a printer at home and it makes it difficult if I need to have color printed for a lab report or graphics presentation."
College Sophomore,2,"Although I am not sure how accurate this is, I heard that Goodwin College does not assist their nursing graduates into jobs."
Recent Alumnus,2,They dont really tell you where you find everything but you can easily well depending how smart you are find it yourself.
College Junior,2,The Process was smoothly. I would of like the school to provide with more financial help. I am confident that at the end it would all be for the best getting my degree will be a great experience and life changing event.
College Junior,2,"The school seems overpriced. With what we pay for tuition the school should replace and/or fix everything that is broken in the student lounge. The financial aid process is easy, no problems there."
College Senior,2,"Wow Are You for Real – Never prepared, I dont tell people I go to goodwin"
College Senior,2,"Its All About the Money – When I first started goodwin they painted such a beautiful picture of how it will be then, you sign the paper and its all about how much money they can get out of you. They conviene you that you are required to take useless classes to max out you're student loans and financial aid. Then when you realise this they say well you should have been on top of youre loans. I honestly belive they do not have youre intrest at heart."
Freshman,1,Terrible . All they want is your money. They won’t help you sign up for classes. You’ll get stuck in the worst classes. I ended up getting very sick and they didn’t care. They stopped answering . Just wanted me to fail
College Freshman,1,"I feel they only want my money. I have been going since 2009 and I was suppose to be done in 1 yr, and 8 months according to the open house. I still have not been excepted to the program. They had me take more and more classes"
College Freshman,1,"On line courses are excellent for convenience. I work 40 hours a week so it helps to take the on line classes. The thing I hate the most is having to post a discussion 3 times a week and having to respond to other students posts. I feel that time that is spent posting is better spent studying. It's is very, very, frustrating. I hate that part so much."
College Freshman,1,The school is very expensive and financial aid does not do a great job at advising the students about all costs. Many students end up maxing out their student loans before graduating.
Recent Alumnus,1,"this is just a school to learn, no campus life really or social scene"
College Senior,1,labs are inadequately supplied to meet the students need. ex 6 students for one cat torso. Extra help wasn't available for AP1.  Cant get one on one help
College Senior,1,"Financial Dept. The school is very overpriced for what you receive for your educational needs. Their tuition &amp; financial  departments aren't coherent and when you try to find out information, nobody seems to have a clue.They can not seem to correctly bill out your tuition. They don't give you an itemized bill and they don't tell you have to pay thousand more in fees for the health science programs."
College Senior,1,"Helpful if you're looking for minimum wage job, but they don't tell you anything you can't find online. Post-grad help is non-existent. You are on your own!"
College Senior,1,"Online Class – Like to blog, tweet, or facebook? Then the online class is for you! Just log in and spill whatever is on your mind- as much as you can. The more you write, the better your grade. A lot of BS."
College Senior,1,"Registered for 2 semesters at 7 hours wait time EACH time. Heard one person came at 1am to get name on list. Registration is archaic and unprofessional. How can a ""college"" of whom claims to be flexible to the working adult continue such a process? Goodwin employees don't sympathize, but rather throw us the ""take it or leave it"" attitude."

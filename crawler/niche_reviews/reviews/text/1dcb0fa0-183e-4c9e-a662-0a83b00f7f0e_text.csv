Freshman,5,"Great staff, great environment, best College President in the world! If you want these, go to BJU. Hands down, an amazing college."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any online classes but my friends who did all say it was a great experience, very well put together! I would highly recommend taking an online course from Bob Jones University!"
Sophomore,5,"Bob Jones is indeed a very special school. I love many things about it but I will give my two favorites. First, BJU is committed to keeping God's word and the gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of all they do. Each year, students take Bible classes and there are daily chapels. Dr. Pettit and the other members of the administration are constantly attempting to encourage our spiritual growth. Second, the culture of the BJU campus is wonderful. When I arrived as a freshman I was very nervous about meeting new people and fitting in. After only a few days there I really felt accepted and loved. The teachers were super welcoming and the upper classmen were always willing to answer questions and help.
As to what I would like to see change, BJU has very strict and frankly unreasonable policies when it comes to dating. For example, guys and girls are not allowed to kiss or even hold hands. I believe this to be unreasonable and I believe it is a change that needs to be made."
Sophomore,5,I have taken several classes online through Bob Jones. The professors did an excellent job of adapting to doing the lectures and grading and communicating with students all online. The lectures were of good quality and easy to understand. And the professors were always available to answer questions from students. The home work lead was manageable. I was able to still work full time while doing a three credit class. Over the past few years BJU has been offering more online options than ever. Having been able to do some over the summers has given me a lighter credit load each semester. I would highly recommend the BJU online learning.
Sophomore,5,I finished the spring 2020 semester online due to Covid-19. The professors did an amazing job switching quickly to online versions.
Sophomore,5,BJU is a great school. There is a great sense of community on campus. The academics are great and its a great place to grow. The professors really care about their students.
Freshman,5,"I have not done online learning at Bob Jones, but while talking to them on the phone I have had nothing but positive feedback. They communicate very well and want nothing more than to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,I love the school. The atmosphere is great along with the people there. The staff is very friendly and wants to make sure you get the most out of your work. The teachers are very respectful and work hard with you to make sure you succeed. The people there are amazing. It is just a great place to be.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Bob Jones University and I absolutely love it. The professors are incredible, the eduction is amazing so far I have loved my experience going to school there."
Sophomore,5,"It was great the teachers were accommodating and understanding, and I was able to learn a lot.  I would recommend it to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"All the faculty that I have had classes seems to really care about me and my academics and make sure I am doing well physically and mentally,"
Freshman,5,"My experience proved quite difficult at first due to the rules and regulations of the institution. As I learned more about the reason for the rules, I began to appreciate attending this school, especially with my peers. The people at Bob Jones make the whole experience worthwhile. Most students treat others with respect and show the love of Christ through their actions throughout the day, on and off campus. I would describe the student body as a family due to the chapel and society meetings throughout the week pulling us closer as an institution. The academics prove quite rewarding especially in the nursing field. I am proud of Bob Jones University, and I will continue to be thankful despite any challenges brought by Covid-19."
Freshman,5,The president truly cares about his students. He supports all of the programs at the school and works to make them better everyday. The professors are very understanding and will work with you whenever you need help.
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at Bob Jones. The faculty truly care about you as a person and take the time to invest in your future. Also, for the size and cost of the college, BJU has excellent resources."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year attending this school. So far i'm loving it, everyone makes you feel welcome and tries to help in any way possible. The professors are helpful and try to guide you into your career path."
Freshman,5,My experience at BJU has made my freshman year amazing. The faculty cares about my education and I can go to them whenever I need something. The housing situation is good and I have made some great friends from my hall.
Niche User,5,"I have visited Bob Jones University multiple times in the past year and I was very impressed by it. The academics are challenging, and I know they will help me become well prepared for my future career. The overall atmosphere is something that drew me to Bob Jones, the students I met were level-headed and well educated, yet still capable of having  fun and seemed to genuinely love their college. The faculty is very involved and interested in the betterment of their students. The Christian morals make for a safe environment as well as a unity and brotherly love among the people at Bob Jones. I am very much looking forward to attend in the fall of 2020."
Freshman,5,"Bob Jones University is an overall excellent school. I wish they had their own bus system, that's all."
Freshman,5,"Bob Jones is incredible! I can honestly say there’s nowhere else I’d rather be! The professors truly care about all their students and want to see them grow academically and spiritually. The preaching in chapel, life groups in society, and Biblical worldview in every class are stellar. The liberal arts core really sets BJ apart from other schools and gives you a firm foundation and very well-rounded education. Anyone who is serious about his or her faith and doesn’t mind a few rules (they’re not bad, trust me) should definitely come to Bob Jones!! You can’t get this anywhere else!"
Niche User,5,Bob Jones University has an excellent academic experience that provides students with lifelong skills.
Sophomore,5,I have visited many other colleges prior to deciding to attend BJU. I must say this has been the best decision I have made. You wouldn't believe how much the faculty and staff truly care about us as students. I will admit the curriculum presented to us is harder than other schools but it is helping prepare us for what's ahead. Deffently a school worth a visit.
Niche User,5,"I’m not currently attending,  but I plan to. Every phone call, email, and visit has been flawless. They have a caring staff, and I have heard nothing but raving reviews from the students. The academics are challenging. I’ve been told that some students in the nursing degree have felt that medical school was easy compared to Bob Jones ."
Senior,5,"If you are looking for a college that is unlike any other, then BJU is the place for you! At BJU the professors actually care about their students and take time to help them and talk with them outside of classes, the students are kind, and it is very easy to make friends. BJU helps students to grow and become responsible and respectful people. BJU is also a very clean school in that there is no smoking, drugs, alcohol, and wild party activity allowed or accepted."
Sophomore,5,"I have only attended Bob Jones University for one year, but I have loved every moment of it. The professors are truly invested in each students' life. They keep the class interesting."
Sophomore,5,"This University is amazing! Not only are the academics challenging, but you really learn the information. The professors are fantastic and want you to succeed. They are always ready and more than willing to help you. This college offers a unique atmosphere that promotes taking your faith seriously and encourages spiritual growth. The staff and students are genuine about their faith and are passionate about leading others to the Lord and being a light to this world."
Freshman,5,Bob Jones University has a very professional atmosphere.  The students dress for success and wear smiles on their faces.  The staff and the students create a very friendly work ethic and inviting spirit.  The classwork is not easy but the professors have a open door policy and enjoy helping their students succeed.
Niche User,5,Bob Jones is an amazing Christian College with a desire to push their students toward becoming the best students and Christians they can be. The teachers push the students to excel academically. The teachers really do care about the students.
Sophomore,5,"The work load is rather large; however, the excellent degree of education is worth the work. It is large enough at 3,000 students to have more than enough friends. Yet it is small enough to have camaraderie. The invaluable name that our graduates have given Bob Jones University also gives those who follow an advantage. I am very thankful for the safe, enjoyable, and valuable education that I am receiving at Bob Jones University."
Junior,5,I am loving my time here at Bob Jones University. The teachers here are amazing. They will go the extra mile to make sure you have what you need so that you can excel in their class. I would like to see some of the rules and regulations change and they are. I would highly recommend BJU to anyone looking for a Christian liberal art's degree.
Niche User,5,"I loved Bob Jones University and can't wait to enroll in the fall! The academics are excellent, the professors are so helpful, and the campus is beautiful. Their fine arts programs are beyond compare."
Sophomore,5,"Bob Jones University has been an excellent choice for me. I enjoy most of my classes and the professors are more than happy to help whenever I have questions. They are down-to-earth and offer great advice! I have done well at classes that were even a little out of my comfort zone. My roommates have always been courteous and kind. There is plenty of room in the dorm buildings and it is clean and comfortable.  It feels like a tight-knit atmosphere and I always feel safe! The dining commons is a great place not only to eat, but also socialize. It is a warm and welcoming atmosphere that easily feels like home even though I am miles and miles away from my home. I know that I am growing both academically and spiritually and being prepared for life in the real world."
Freshman,5,"Bob Jones is a University dedicated to helping students grow. Everyone you come in contact with is looking for ways to encourage you to grow in your academic skills as well as your spiritual walk with God. The fun, friendly atmosphere, along with the Godly mentorship from every faculty member makes everyone who steps foot on campus feel welcome and at home."
Junior,5,"Bob Jones University is a great place where students and faculty work together to grow, learn, and advance in the journey of life. The academics are challenging, but the professors are supportive and full of knowledge. I have enjoyed getting to learn and grow throughout the past couple years. The opportunities I have had with Bob Jones range from interacting with well-known educators, participating in Titanic: the Musical, volunteering in the community, and more. The student body is great and the atmosphere of the university is exciting. I am quite thankful for where I am."
Freshman,5,"Bob Jones University is a great place with good, godly people who care about their students. Their programs are top-notch and the campus is beautiful. God does things there!"
Niche User,5,I have visited campus twice in preparation to attend there in the fall of 2019.  I like the lay out of the campus and the friendliness of the staff and students.  I have taken two online courses and appreciated what I learned from the professors.  I am looking forward to being on campus and experiencing campus life!
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity that Bob Jones University exhibits. There are so many opportunities for cross-cultural connection and it brings the whole student body together. Their academics are excellent, accompanied by caring professors and professional students."
Junior,5,"My favorite part about Bob Jones is that the academics are very rigorous. There are very few classes that you can just ""get by"" in. Each class is designed to stretch you academically, emotionally, and spiritually. Since I really care about my education, I greatly appreciate this type of academic environment. By the end of the semester, I am confident that I will have a thorough understanding of the subject that I have been studying all semester due to the courses rigorousness. The classes at Bob Jones would not be rigorous, though, without the help of the professors. The intensity of each course is due, in part, because of high standards that they set within their classrooms. The combination of the courses rigorousness and the high academic and moral standards that each professor sets in the classroom creates the most ideal environment for learning."
Sophomore,5,The faculty are wonderful. I would like the college to cost less though. The faculty want you to pass- you just have to talk to them. Go to their office hours.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to Bob Jones!!! The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The people and faculty are simply amazing! I met some of my closest friends of my life here at BJU. 
The teachers really care about you as a person and will do everything within their power to help you. They are very understanding of work schedules and other life circumstances and will help you when you feel overwhelmed. They will open their offices to you anytime you need to talk, even if the subject is completely unrelated to schoolwork. 
The dining common staff is simply angelic. Ms. Kathy, the person who welcomes people and swipes ID cards for lunch, works her hardest to learn every person's name. Once she has it down, she will call you by your name for as long as you attend the school.
Even though college is the hardest thing I have ever done, attending Bob Jones University is worth every second and dollar spent on this school."
Sophomore,5,"overall a very good school could use improvements in some areas like food, but other than that a very good university."
Junior,5,"Bob Jones University is a great place to get an education. Not only are the courses interesting and rigorous, but they have a basis in truth. God's truth and gospel is seen in everything in this school."
Freshman,5,The campus is great and my academic councilors were wonderful.  What I love about BJU is that they are a God focused school.
Sophomore,5,"Bob Jones is an excellent school. The education here is top-notch, and one of my favorite things about classes are the teachers. I've never had a teacher that didn't care about my success or didn't make sure that I knew that I could come visit them in their office if I ever needed help. Not only that, but the teachers and leaders in the school pray for us daily. The people here are so kind and friendly, I've never made more friends than I have at Bob Jones."
Freshman,5,I love the people at Bob Jones. They are incredibly gracious and care about you. I would love to see a couple of rules change. The dress code for one.
Junior,5,Fantastic!!! I love the school. My professors are great they are always willing to help me if I'm struggling. It has great academics and gives us the opportunity to experience fine arts events that I might not otherwise get to.
Freshman,5,"I love the faculty and staff at BJU.  They have a great attitude towards the students.  They are always willing to help and they seek a personal connection with you as a student.  They don't want to see anyone fail and repeatedly offer their services to you as a student.  Another thing that is great about BJU is the campus.  It is beautiful and once you know where things are, it is easy to navigate.  If I could change anything at BJU, I have no idea what I would choose.  So far with my experience I have not had many complaints.  The complaints I did have were probably attitude problems.  I guess you could say I like the school and need to study it a bit more before I lodge an official complaint."
Sophomore,5,Bob Jones offers a vigorous set of academic courses as well as many opportunities for growth in your relationship with Christ and fellow Christians.
Sophomore,5,"I came to BJU with quite a few reserves, but I was convinced it was the school that was best for me. I am so glad I acted outside of those reserves, because my first year there was absolutely fantastic. I was challenged by the academics, and was stretched far more than I thought I could be, but because of those high standards, I succeeded far more than I thought I was capable of. The atmosphere of the school itself is so encouraging, and the Godly influences that surrounded me was both a joy and a challenge for me to grow even stronger and deeper in my faith."
Freshman,5,"I loved the fact that you could join a smaller group of students called a society. A society gives college a more personalized feel. The classes I visited were engaging, and the teachers were really nice."
Freshman,5,"One of the many things I love about Bob Jones University is the love and care I have experienced from everyone here. Everyone goes out of their way to make me feel at home and make sure I have everything I need. As a student with physical limitations, I have received all the accommodations I need to succeed. And most importantly, their is a wonderful Christian environment that encourages me and helps me grow more and more in my faith on a daily basis."
Sophomore,5,The academics are excellent. The teachers are always there if you have questions and want more than anything to help you achieve your goals.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at Bob Jones University. I am a biology major and my professors are highly qualified and passionate. They've given me an even deeper love for science and have been immensely helpful in my studies. The academics are challenging, but the professors are willing to help and want to see you succeed. The results are very rewarding. I have been able to make great friends and connections and grow my leadership skills. I've also been able to have great experience to help me in my field and in life and ministry in a local church."
Freshman,5,"Being a liberal arts university, BJU provides students with an extremely well-rounded education due to the liberal arts core courses required of all students. BJU has a wide range of degree programs that vary anywhere from Studio Art, Music, and Theatre, and similar fine arts degrees, to Business, Accounting, etc. and science and math degrees as well."
Sophomore,5,It is a good Christian environment with excellent academics. The teachers encourage the students and will spend time helping the students to understand the material better and help them succeed in the class. The teachers invest time in our lives and they care more about seeing us personally grow than the grades.
Senior,5,Bob Jones University is Unique and you won't find a Christian university that knows how to enjoy and live a Christian life.
Freshman,5,"The academics are very challenging. There are more rules than the average university, but they are all grounded on Christian principles. The stricter rules have been well worth submitting to because of the high academics and Christian atmosphere. The four times a week chapel services help unite the student body in a unique way that isn’t seen on other college campuses."
Junior,5,"I Loved this college, I had some of my best and worst memories there, but I have seen God work to change me so much throughout the years here."
Freshman,5,I love Bob Jones University. It has a healthy growing atmosphere.  The faculty are ready to help and are understanding. This Christian School thrives in knowing more about the Lord.  What brought me to Bob Jones University is their loving Christ-like attitude. The faculty teach in such a way as to make sure that the students are understanding the material and how to implement the material into each students’ field while upholding the worldview of the Bible.
Senior,5,"I love Bob Jones. Excellent education, excelent environment but i would love to see a change in the way they view music."
Alum,5,"Bob Jones was a great school all around. They really care about their students, physically and spiritually. They have caring staff, and a great student body who are all there for each other. They are highly recommended."
Junior,4,The classes are thorough and well worth the cost of tuition. I am in the Comm Disorders major and would like to see more development in that department.
Junior,4,"I took my entire freshman year online, and I found the professors to be very accommodating and communicative; which is very important for a successful online learning environment. I will say that I missed campus resources such as the writing center when isolated at home. But, overall, my experience was a positive one; and my grades did not suffer from a lack of in-person consultation."
Sophomore,4,My online experience went quite well. I personally hate learning off a computer but finishing out this past semester online was not half as bad as I expected it to be. The professors helped make the transition so smooth and were so accommodating the entire time.
Sophomore,4,"I am a culinary student, so for me it was rather different. However, all the professors pulled together, and made it a relatively smooth transition. They did a great job answering any questions very quickly, and were honest about the challenges."
Sophomore,4,"If you don't mind rather strict rules, this is an excellent college! The teachers are wonderful, and the student body is very tightly knit."
Junior,4,"I am a junior Biomedical Research student at Bob Jones. My experience with the faculty, especially the science faculty, has been exceptional. The instructors at the university are well qualified for their positions, having years of professional experience and teaching experience. The university has shown me not only the knowledge I need to succeed, but also the attitude I need to succeed. The only issue I have with the university is the overbearing attitude of the administration. They assume the worst of the students behavior, and it often feels as though they’re waiting for us to slip up. Overall, an excellent education with a few drawbacks."
Freshman,4,"Bob Jo es is a great school that really sets its expectations high, for those who are looking for a Christian environment."
Niche User,4,As a prospective athlete to BJU I loved the environment of campus. Most of all I fell in love with downtown Greenville.
Sophomore,4,"The university strives to instill academic and personal excellence in each and every student. The faculty and staff care for each member of the student body physically, mentally, emotionally, academically, and spiritually. BJU is a great place to go if you want a faith-based education and exposure to the arts."
Junior,4,The professors at Bob Jones are amazing. They are all wonderful Christians who love the students. The professors are always willing to make time to help when needed.
Freshman,4,"Bob Jones University's students and staff are warm and welcoming. The campus is beautiful and the academics are manageable, yet challenging. A point of contention for many people is the rigid set of rules and the quality of the food."
Niche User,4,"Not bad. Very nice. Godly, and well recognized. Very clean, has nice rules, very nice. I liked everything about it. I felt at home."
Senior,4,Bob Jones University offers many great academic programs and is constantly looking to add more. I have enjoyed my three years as a student and I am looking forward to finishing up my last. The teachers have been encouraging and are constantly willing to help you in any way they can.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere! Great staff, great professors, and great coaches! I would love to see a worship team in the future though!"
Freshman,4,"Bob Jones University is a place where both an individual's intellect and character will be tested. The courses offered are excellent, as are the professors. The living situation is where the character testing comes in due to the random assignment of roommates."
Freshman,4,"Bob Jones is the best Christian University in the country; the students are friendly, the campus is smaller but cozy and well cared for, and the surrounding area is just beautiful. I strongly recommend this college."
Niche User,4,"Over the years I have been on the Bob Jones campus many times, and will be attending as a freshman this fall.  Their fine arts program is spectacular, and I am particularly interested and impressed with their nursing program."
Freshman,4,"Bob Jones University is a very demanding but enjoyable college to attend. The academics are very rigorous, but the teachers are always willing to meet with students outside of class and develop relationships with the students. The only complaint that I have is the lack of activities that are available on campus. The school is working towards solutions to this but are still acquiring the funds."
Niche User,4,I went to college-up-close at Bob jones University. It was a wonderful experience. The teachers all care about the students and want them to succeed. The classes prepare you for life and allow you to learn in a fun environment.
Niche User,4,"Great education, but not a lot activities to do on campus. Therefore, the campus always seems dead, especially on the weekends."
Niche User,4,"Bob Jones University is overall, a very good college. They have exceptional teachers that genuinely care about the students, great athletic programs, and has a very short commute to downtown Greenville. Most companies in the south know about the great quality of a Bob Jones education and tend to choose their students over others. The only downsides are the lack of variety in the cafeteria and somewhat strict policies. Overall, this school should be highly considered for anyone taking their education seriously."
Sophomore,4,"Bob Jones University does a great job with their quality academics. The staff and faculty at the the university is outstanding. It would be nice if the quality of the food could improve. It is also a little expensive. The campus is very nice and they do a good job of maintaining it. If you want an education, this is a good place to go. If you want to party, this is not a good place to go. The dorms are average. Nothing nice."
Sophomore,4,"I think that academically Bob Jones University excels, but the rules and overall expectations that the school carries out only because their benefactors can be hard to achieve. Their so-called desire to prepare us for the future only gives us a skewed reality of what the actual workplace is really like."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed just about everything! The food was good, the place was interesting, and the people were very friendly and kind. Although, when I visited the campus with my mom for a conference the sidewalks were very dirty. At sundown, my mom just about plastered her face tripping over a large stick in the way. Overall it was pretty good though."
Junior,4,"If you are a Christian and you want a quality education coupled with good opportunities for spiritual growth, this is the place to go."
Freshman,4,I have had an amazing experience getting my education through Bob Jones. The professors are awesome. They love what they do and it is shown in the way they teach and interact with the students.
Freshman,4,"I loved the atmosphere and academic standard that I found at Bob Jones. The professors want their students to learn and to grow not only academically but also spiritually. There are multiple social interaction and academic advancement opportunities offered on campus, and the beautiful city of Greenville is open to all students. I have truly enjoyed being a Bob Jones student."
Freshman,4,"I really like the university so far, the dress code is a bit strict and there are a lot of required meetings but overall the professors and fellow students are all great."
Sophomore,4,"The people are all very kind. The professors generally care about your well-being, academically, socially, and spiritually. You can make friends relatively easily. Like I said most of the students are genuine and the professors definitely are. The campus is beautiful. The food is better than most campus dining halls, and there is a Chick-fil-A on campus, which is always a plus. There aren't too many drunk parties and such, but there are plenty of wholesome opportunities to have a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,4,My admissions counselor was very helpful. I've heard that graduate students have a high success rate of getting jobs after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is required to join a society freshman year, so the ""Greeks vs. Non-Greeks"" is sort of irrelevant. You can opt out of society if you're older. We have society meetings every Friday and while society activity is encouraged outside of that, it's not really required. So while societies are a big part of campus life, at the same time, they're not. You can just get to know people for people no matter what society you're in. How much you do together as a society, or how well you're known, kind of depends on the society you join."
College Sophomore,4,"The BJU Bruins have gotten better over the last couple years. There is a bit of stigma on campus about the sports teams, but overall the spirit is pretty positive. Society sports you can get involved with as you choose, and those are fun because people of all types and talents can choose to play."
College Sophomore,4,"Almost all of the professors and staff I have encountered have been extremely helpful and very dedicated to seeing their students both learn and succeed. BJU is committed to delivering quality education with a Christ-centered focus. The student body is diverse and I have made a lot of friends and met some very unique, driven individuals; though campus does have its share of people you want to avoid. However, every school has that to some degree."
College Freshman,4,There is accountability everywhere and we are taken care of and there are rules and regulations in place.
College Freshman,4,There is a total of 3 of us in one dorm room and its great! We got plenty of room and there are college hacks to safe and make good usage of even more space. It is comfortable and clean! Of course we do do some cleaning ourselves.
College Freshman,4,"Anyone who is involved with it knows that it is good and useful. Again I personally haven't studied Greek, but so far my teachers are mentioning it even though my personal classes don't revolve around it."
College Freshman,4,I'm not personally into the sports here. So far though the people here are very skilled at what they do and the work they do is top grade training.
College Junior,4,Excellent academics by professors who are up to date and knowledgeable in their fields.  Spiritually healthy and uplifting atmosphere.  Balanced Christian world view
College Sophomore,4,"There are people from all over the world with every background imaginable. I often hear Asian students conversing in their own native languages throughout campus (although most of the students are American). The school year has a strong emp is on missions and so cultural diversity is celebrated, not repressed."
College Sophomore,4,"All freshmen are required to join a Greek society. I believe there are 26 different ones, each with different focuses and reputations. While there are few that couldn't care less about the society aspect, most students put a lot into making their society a special and a memorable group. Societies often compete in sports and other events throughout the year."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't met a professor who wouldn't make time for me if I asked. While I understandably do better with some professors more than others, all of the ones I have had are clearly well knowledgable and passionate about their work and challenge student to be the same."
College Sophomore,4,"As a freshman I have had little experience with these services, but I do know that the school does everything it can to help it's students. There are countless seminars related to the many different majors and many groups that are invited to campus for recruitment purposes."
College Junior,4,"I never worry about my personal safety on campus (unless I trip running up the stairs...don't do it, carpet burns will be a result)."
College Junior,4,It's a great school if you want to pursue an excellent education and not the party lifestyle.
College Sophomore,4,Whenever I need help the professors are always willing to help.
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt unsafe on campus, although I'm not a great test for that since I'm a man and don't know how the girls feel about it."
College Sophomore,4,All students must join a society. It all depends on which one you pick if you'll enjoy it.
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of intramural sports to play and the gym has a large variety of equipment.
College Sophomore,4,Good school with interesting classes and opportunities to meet new people.
Recent Alumnus,4,The career services are very helpful and friendly.
College Freshman,4,Bob Jones not only focuse on academics but also on you're walk with Christ. They help you be spiritually founded.
College Sophomore,4,While athletics are a part of the BJU atmosphere they will never be the focal point of the university. At BJU sports wisely always take a backseat to the Word of God.
College Freshman,4,Sports and the Athletics have a great system and are great to have it.
College Freshman,4,"The dorm rooms are very nice. Each room has three closets, two dressers, overhead cabinets, and a sink. While there is both a double and a triple bunk bed, the average number of people to a room is only three."
College Freshman,4,"Anyone can join a society team. Sports such as volleyball, soccer, water polo, and baseball are the most popular to play, but if you don't want to commit to that, groups will meet on the weekends for an informal time to hang out."
College Senior,4,The school seems to have a pretty high rate of seniors having a job lined up before graduation.
College Student,4,"BJU is very involved in the success of its students, and BJU students have access to the highest level jobs, both nationally and internationally."
College Student,4,"Although somewhat small, the dorm rooms are very comfortable, and you really get to know your roommates well."
College Student,4,"Although the student life groups are not referred to as Greeks, they are the same idea, and still a MASSIVE amount of good clean fun."
College Student,4,"Beautiful field house! Students are really encouraged to get involved in athletics, even if it's just to observe rather than participate."
Niche User,2,If you commit to studying you can get good grades. BJU does not treat you like an adult and it is very easy to get demerits for senseless things. Teachers are pretty good and you definitely get a good education.
College Freshman,2,"Think home-schooler partys. Having friends over for a disney movie and popcorn. Still, my friends and I have fun. On campus there are not many options; and classic partys are out of the options. Hall partys and The dorm christmas partys are fun."
College Freshman,2,BJU does not allow non-resident students to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"There is no real parties on campus, and probably never will be."
College Sophomore,2,"It's the same food nearly everyday. We can choose between pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salads, ""american"", or stir-fry. This wouldn't be nearly as bad if the options had more options but when the stir-fry is only meat and four other ingredients it starts to taste bland. If you don't have time for lunch you are not allowed to take from the commons themselves. You must go to the gym and pay for a brown bag lunch that for some reason costs the same amount as the commons buffet. And since we pay with ""swipes"" instead of money we don't have the off campus dining option that other schools have nor can we use these swipes in the campus snack shop."
College Junior,2,There is no night life because we have to be back before 10:30
College Freshman,2,"Basically, because not all students are eligible to live out of campus the options are limited. "
College Freshman,2,This is a very strict college. But it is all made to help you develop a Christlike character.
College Junior,2,Most students are not able to live off-campus due to the policies at Bob Jones University.
College Senior,2,"The food is pretty bad, but they are improving. They have brought in a lot more healthy options."
College Senior,2,"Persistence is the key. While there are much potential for financial aid, one must work hard to find it."
College Freshman,2,"Certain academic programs such as the biology program are excellent however, many programs are lacking good teachers and proper funding. Facilities on campus leave much to be desired. There is only one pool with separate times for guys and girls and the gym is in need of a renovation as much of the equipment is outdated."
College Sophomore,2,"BJU has a very diverse student body when it comes to Race, economics and background. In my circle of friends I have several friends from all over the earth from all different economic situations but all of us are heterosexual and Christian and Conservative just like the rest of the school"
College Senior,2,"If you are actually interested in going to BJU, then you probably already know that typical nightlife isn't high on a student's priority list here. And actually, there's not even much to do so far as ""good clean fun"" is concerned. But if you're creative, you can have some pretty fun times in downtown Greenville. For my friends and me, we don't even have to try. It's always a good time!"
College Senior,2,"The weather fluctuates a lot.  Early in the day and later in the evening tends to be almost 15-20 degrees different than the late morning/early afternoon period.

The only thing that seems to be consistent is the humidity."
College Freshman,2,It's very poor but you got to admit it's only the first year of actual Bruin's sports. They could be good in like a couple years but for now it's really a joke. But I really like the intramural teams here against society's. I like that ALOT!!
College Junior,2,"From my experience barge was not  helpful, but safety on campus is pretty good."
College Freshman,2,"It's actually fairly difficult to obtain off campus housing that is reasonable and close enough to make commuting an option. However, most housing that is found is safe and very easy to share with other roommates."
College Sophomore,2,"Bob Jones University was a pretty hard school to get used to. It seems like they have a rule for everything and it almost made you paranoid at times because you didn't know if you were breaking a rule or not. They were almost like a second parent to you at times, except stricter.
A couple of things that I liked about Bob Jones were the dorm life, friends I made there, and the academics. The main reason I'm trying to transfer is because of their insane rules, not because I didn't like the academics or fellow students."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty Strict – the places around campus are good. I guess you get kind of tired of eating at dining halls, the school is really strict in some areas but not horrible. You get used to it after you've been here for a while though."
Alum,1,"Substandard, out-of-date dorm rooms.  Small and cramped, and four girls to a room.  Bathrooms with 4-5 stalls and 4-5 showers are shared by more than 40 girls. 
Promotes a culture of fear, spying and betrayal.  Prayer groups are gossip sessions, and friendships are for keeping each other accountable.  Once a year, students are ranked by each other (in prayer groups).
Students are guilted into attending counselling sessions, told that the deans will tell their parents about their ""sins"" or that they will be expelled if they don't cooperate.  Deans/prayer captains hold meetings to talk about ""wayward"" peers, and are watched and monitored constantly.
Most of their ""professors"" obtain their ""degree"" from BJU."
Alum,1,I grew up at BJU.  I was born with a learning disability that their psychology department declarres as fake even though it is in the DSM-5. I never had friends and was treated as an outsider. The psychology department does not teach science. They make things up and claim that PTSD and other mental issues are made up or are “spiritual problems” and you have to get right with God and it will go a ay. There are no locks on dorm rooms. There are sexual assaults. It is not a safe place.
Alum,1,The only way I can summarize my experience here:  I never knew how awful people could be until I came to BJU.
College Freshman,1,"They treat everyone like children, and they do not really care about helping the students outside of looking better on paper."
College Freshman,1,There are no parties because the guys and the girls are not allowed in the same dorms. Otherwise it would be fun.
College Freshman,1,"No team spirit, and the teams are bad anyways."
College Senior,1,"Very little of a party scene. Strict rules and difficult academia make the school a good choice for a solid education, but a horrible place for partying in the sense of alcoholic typical college parties."
College Sophomore,1,Bob Jones does not allow undergrads to live off-campus unless they live with a close family member or have specific health needs that make dorm life difficult.
College Freshman,1,"The college is extremely strict. The internet shuts off at 12:05 every night, and when we are using the internet, what we access is monitored. There are very few places where we are even allowed to use our headphones. We are required to be in the dorms by 10:30 PM, every night. We are also required to attend chapel everyday at 11:00. If we are not there, and we are caught, then we get a lot of demerits. Basically, if you think about a very strict private high school, and then transfer that idea into a college, with adult students. However, there are good aspects to the college."
College Junior,1,I'm not going to Bob Jones University to party.  I'm glad the university is not a party school.
College Sophomore,1,"Since we have a 10:30 curfew, we're not allowed to be out past 10:30 without prior permission"
College Sophomore,1,Their are no parties. You have to have the lights out by 12.
College Senior,1,I don't know too much about night life where my school is. My school does not allow students to freely party at night. Such activities might lead to getting expelled from the school.
College Freshman,1,Students are required to be in their residence halls by 10:25 PM every night.
College Freshman,1,if your looking to going partying at night at clubs and such you have the wrong school
College Sophomore,1,the housing at Bob Jones University are not great! the dorms have mold in them and the bathrooms are crowded and tiny.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Strict – On Campus Restrictions: 
-dorms are not co-ed, girls are not allowed in the guys dorms ever and vise versa. 
-dating and chaperone restrictions on campus have loosened over the years, but still far too strict for many non-fundamentalist Christians.
-dorm student curfew of 10:30
-passes have to be made to go off campus, failure to make a pass means a prompt meeting with the Dean of Men or Women

Off Campus Restrictions
-all students enrolled in Bob Jones University are expected to enforce the school's dress code on and off campus. Girls are always supposed to wear shorts to the knee or loose fitting jeans. Guys must wear collared shirts and shorts are never acceptable off campus, on campus only near the athletic facilities.
-mixed groups must have an approved chaperone. 
-clubs, concerts, bars, and etc are not considered appropriate places for Bob Jones students to be seen"
College Sophomore,1,"Dorm Vs. Town Student – If you are less than 23, applying from out of state, and have no relatives living near the campus you are not allowed to be an off campus student."
College Sophomore,1,Fraternities and Sororeties are not allowed on campus. The Bob Jones equivalent is Society. There are men and women societies that meet once a week or once every other week. The main purpose is to talk and play a couple games. Societies will compete in intramural sports on a regular basis. No housing is available for Societies to live together.
College Sophomore,1,"I Can't Live Off Campus as an Undergrad Student. BJU is a very strict school. One of their rules clearly states that you have to either be married, live with a family member in town, or be over twenty-one years old to move off campus. Because of this, their students don't have very many housing options and usually stay in the dorms for most (if not all) of their college life."

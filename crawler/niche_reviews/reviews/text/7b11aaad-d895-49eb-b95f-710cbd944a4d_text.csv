Alum,5,The professors at Guilford College are very interested in each students success. They are very intune and responsive to all channels of digital communication.
Freshman,5,I truly love Guilford. I took a college tour and the people there seem so nice and it's truly a fun time and experience there. I have a feeling my classes will be even more fun and the next four years will be amazing!
Freshman,5,Very small and engaging community. The food at the grill is pretty good but it may be a little greasy for some people. they do have vegeterian/vegan options.
Freshman,5,I love guilford! THe people and the place are turly awesome! I would reccomend to anyone! Everyone there is so kind
Niche User,5,"I recently went to tour the campus and I felt very welcomed! I really like it, I met the soccer coaches and players and they all treated me very well."
Alum,5,I loved Guilford College. It's a close-nit campus with small class sizes where the professors can really focus on each individual student. I felt a lot more appreciated and cared for compared to a large university with 200+ students in a classroom. I could learn more and focus on what was most important to my major because more was expected of me. It was easier to network through this college as well.
Junior,5,"I love my advisor and the instructors there, they are always willing to help you when you have a question."
Senior,5,"Hello, my name is Candice Burch and I will be a 4th year student at Guilford College in the Fall of 2019. I am a Public Health major and a Philosophy minor. My experience at Guilford College has been amazing. I have not only learned about the real world, but about myself and what I want to do in life. Guilford taught me patience, time management and self care which then lead me to change my major from Health Science to Public Health. Being able to help others not only maintain their  physical health, but holistic health.  If it wasn’t for Guilford College I would have never discovered who I truly am and what I love to do."
Freshman,5,"The staff and students are extremely friendly and more close-knit than any school I have visited. They go out of the way to make sure you are as comfortable as you would be at home, and easily accessible for any questions you might have."
Freshman,5,"Guilford College is  the perfect example of a home away from home. I'm from Virginia, so the thought moving to a different state and going hours away from my family did scare me. However, after going on my first  visit  there  I fell in love with the people there and the campus. The campus is  the perfect environment where you can enjoy continuing your education while appreciating beautiful scenery around you. Even the people there were so welcoming and kind, without even  knowing me the girls soccer team there welcomed me with open arms like I was one of their own. I've never felt closer  to a group of girls that fast, it was relieving to know that leaving my first visit at  Guilford I already had friends to remind me of how great the college is. Guilford is truly a place where your education is valued and one where you are appreciated, there's no other college I'd see myself attending because it wouldn't offer the kind of welcoming, family feeling that Guilford does!"
Junior,5,"I love the opportunities Guilford College offers for students to get hands on experience in their field. The opportunity to receive scholarships while participating in community based work is especially valuable. I also love the professors and their eagerness to help you be successful as a students.  They truly invest in their students and care about the process just as much as the outcomes and that really shows throughout every minute of experience with them. The quality of the student experience is held as an important aspect of Guilford and you can see that value in every event and every meal. They offer great choices for all kinds of diet restrictions and preferences. They also offer a variety of celebrations and student events on campus, putting an emphasis on the beauty of diversity."
Niche User,5,"Tours have been great, staff are awesome to work with. Admission counselor is awesome love Jalen he and my mom are friends now. Made the best choice ever with this school. jfepfeoifoifaoifjoifuo hiufao rfiafuoifjiafvjgafpa[ vhvoya hjkdnv ao aihfu8 alkmv ap9gu ej a;diiu8a gjjbcagfiappb a a09a hf ;afoana 9teak vjv dpa sshvghgogue0e al"
Freshman,5,It’s been a wonderful experience. The faculty is very welcoming and helpful to all students. It’s a small college with a big heart
Alum,5,"Guilford was such a wonderful home for 4 years. I wish I could go back and/or be a lifer. The campus was beautiful, the professors were the best, and the knowledge and skills I gained were unmatched. The friendships I developed have been amazing. The campus culture is so diverse, open-minded, growth-centered, spiritual, and just an amazing place to live in your fullest expression."
Senior,5,"As a student-athlete at Guilford College I have been able to be a part of many activities on campus. I love that it is a small, close-knit community.  It has allowed me to connect with several classmates and professors in a way a huge university would not."
Sophomore,5,"Broad range of majors, content taught in all classes is relevant to subject,  life,  community and self.  Diverse student population with focus on academics and enhancing the community positively."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here. People are very nice and professors work with you. The classes are small, so you develop relationships with your classmates and professors easily. People are very accepting, and the campus is nice."
Alum,5,"I'm a single mom who returned to college to pursue my degree.  Guilford College was the best decision I've ever made.  The people in admissions, finance and especially advising were the best.  They helped me from beginning to end with any questions and concerns that I had.  I would recommend this college to any adult in a similar situation as mine."
Freshman,5,"Guilford is a really great place with wonderfully lovely people and a great, open and accepting atmosphere. The professors are great and the campus is beautiful."
Senior,5,"Guilford College is the type of school who will embrace you and your passions no matter what those are. It has a small campus, but you will rarely feel bored. The Guilford ""bubble"" has a lot to offer during the every single day of the week. The Campus Activities Board is always working to make the school more fun and to help students cope with stress and homesickness. Every spring semester, the spring festival called ""Serendipity"" is a big part of the school's tradition which is also very attached to quaker values. The liberal arts education is also a huge part of why I love this school so much and the professors are willing to help you achieve your goals whether they are around campus, Greensboro or the world. Guilford also has a great sense of social justice that has helped me understand different groups and people from other backgrounds and life experiences. I would recommend it to anyone who is open minded and would love to learn more about themselves and our society."
Freshman,5,"Guilford College, although very far from home, helped me feel at home my first year. I feel the professors did a very good job of helping with the transition from high school to college as well as my baseball coaches. Everyone is very helpful and committed to helping figure out how you can succeed."
Senior,5,"I enjoy the diversity and welcoming atmosphere at Guilford College. As a CCE student, I was worried I would feel out of place because I am ten years older than the traditional students. No one has ever made me feel out of place due to age or any other factor at Guilford. The environment is geared toward the success of every student. I love being on campus."
Freshman,5,"When I first got here at Guilford College I knew that I was in the right place. I love being here at Guilford!
I would like to see us as a school have cheerleaders and a band."
Recent Alumnus,5,I will intern while I am at Guilford college right now just freshman
Recent Alumnus,5,I absolutely love Guilford college.  no issues with them
Recent Alumnus,5,my rate choice is excellent  very happy with guilford
Recent Alumnus,5,atmosphere is good as far as I can tell from visiting the college
Recent Alumnus,5,school is great I am very happy I choose Guilford college and I play football there
College Freshman,5,A lot of people are different and we don't treat them any different.
College Junior,5,"I am so grateful that I found Guilford College.  I've never experienced anything like the community here.  You call professors by first their first names and you are truly part of a family here.  Not to mention, the history of the school itself and the community in which it is located is incredible.  One of the coolest things...the campus was a hub on the Underground Railroad.  Do yourself a favor an check this school out because there is no other place like Guilford College."
College Sophomore,5,"Guilford College is excellent. The classes are amazing, the professors are passionate about their subjects, there's so much to do on campus, the campus is beautiful... I could go on for days."
College Freshman,5,There are many public safety officers on campus.
College Junior,5,"Guilford College is the best place to be for diversity.  Diversity of faiths, ideas, ethnicities, cultures, and lifestyles is the main belief here.  Being a Quaker college, Guilford encourages diversity and tolerance of others, which is a very good thing and it creates a good and friendly environment where different beliefs and ideas can flourish and people can share their ideas and learn from each other.  However, there is always the possibility of a little prejudice from one or two people, but this college is in all a very accepting place."
College Junior,5,"If any school is a grade A example of diversity, it would be Guilford College! There are constant seminars on diversity and other cultures."
College Freshman,5,"I love my housing! I enjoy my hallmates we all get along very well and my RA is one of the best
"
College Junior,5,Our school contains just about anything you conuld ask for including a lake to hang by and the woods.
College Freshman,5,"if you play a sport and have decent grades you will get 15,000 a year here, no problem"
College Freshman,5,"This college offers a forensic biology major which most colleges don't. It is also a green school. They take extra measures to be environmentally friendly.There are recycling bins in each room and around the campus. Some of the buildings are also being renovated to be ""green"". The showers are heated using solar panels, and the water in the toilets is rain water."
College Freshman,5,"For such a small school, we have good parking. It's located pretty close to the dorms and the cost seems about average. Most people don't have a car, but having one makes it a lot easier to go out and do fun things in the city. There's always empty spaces in the parking lots, but we do get tickets if we park in the wrong lot."
College Junior,5,"My program makes me feel valued and assured. The professors are as equally passionate as myself. I hope to have my own therapy practice through Restorative Justice methods, this is rarely done and am a bit afraid. My Advisor has assured me that I will be okay."
Alum,4,"The atmosphere is extremely friendly and welcoming. The Quaker community is a safe space for learning. Professors are very interested in the learning experience each students recieves. Guilford College offeres a well-rounded, liberal education."
Freshman,4,"I've taken one online course at Guilford and it was really fun! We were learning how to create new ideas and to not be limited by what we're given, and expand our minds to truly get an understanding of what ideas we create."
Sophomore,4,I've been at Guilford College for the past two years and they do a decent job. Since I've began the school food has improved and renovations have been made to some of the dorms. They do strongly encourage people to voice they're opinions and try to handle student issues the best they can.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience with Guilford has been great this fall I will be officially attending guilford as a freshmen majoring in cyber security I have always liked this school and I've toured it many times with Crosby scholars. The people were all friendly and the campus was beautiful, Out of all the colleges that I toured guilford taught me the most and was the most fun."
Graduate Student,4,"loved the college and most of the professors. the academics are great and I have learned so much, however, the food here is horrible and the cost of attendance is very high, though it is a private college."
Senior,4,"It is a very inclusive community. I also appreciate the level of academic rigor. All the classes I have taken are very interesting. It is clear my professors care about me and are invested in my success. The farm on campus is an irreplaceable resource and space for learning. The college is experiencing a lot of change right now, specifically changing the curriculum."
Freshman,4,So far I am a freshman at Guilford College and my time here has been amazing. I recommend this campus to anyone who is looking for a close-knit community and a small campus environment. Party scene is pretty light the professors are always there for you. This is the type of campus where you make the experience.
Junior,4,I liked that Guilford College was quite accepting of all people and the fact that there were tons of opportunities to grow.
Junior,4,"I think Guilford College is a good school to attend if you go in knowing what you want to do.  Its faculty is fantastic, and the professors usually seem to know what they're talking about and care about their students' progress.  The administration, on the other hand, seems to be run by immature high schoolers.  Some terrible decisions have been made in the recent past despite overwhelming public outcry from both students and faculty.  Can't recommend if you're looking to find out what you want to do.  Just get in and get out as quickly as possible."
Freshman,4,"I like the sense of home here. Everywhere you walk on campus, you see someone you know. Its like you grew up here."
Niche User,4,IT WAS AMAZING. I love the campus and the administrators are amazing. The campus is safe for me to enjoy the college life and enjoy the way I can learned more about this college.
Junior,4,"Great professors, beautiful campus, friendly people. School board and administration has earned their reputation for being not very transparent and frankly a bit totalitarian."
Alum,4,"Guilford College was a great fit for me for college. It can be rather inconsistent--I had some horrible teachers and boring classes and I had some of the most amazing professors I could imagine. If you found the subjects with the good teachers, it can be a really phenomenal educational experience. There are some budget issues that seem to be causing questionable decisions by the administration, which worries me for the future of the school."
Junior,4,There is a great deal of diversity here at Guilford. That’s is awesome. It is very safe and the academics are great. This is a wonderful small class setting. It’s a great school.
Junior,4,"For the most part, I enjoy my classes at Guilford College. My professors are quite engaging and the campus life is great due to the organizations that exist for all varieties of students. My main problem with it is that discussion classes are often lacking, as people do not often contribute to class discussions. Lecture classes are excellent!"
Freshman,4,"Guilford has been a very welcoming community. It can be hard to meet new people if you are not active in groups or clubs but once you put your self out there, friends are everywhere. There are some issues on campus that do need to be addressed, but students are doing a good job of holding staff accountable for their education and safety."
Junior,4,Guilford College is a great community to be a part of. It is a safe-haven campus which means they protect students that are immigrants etc and they also have equally respect for all genders. The educational curriculum is overwhelming sometimes but you learn useful things.
Freshman,4,"I like the small college atmosphere.  The class sizes are perfect for participation and learning, and the teachers I've had are good."
Freshman,4,The professors were nice and helpful. Everyone is friendly.  You are expected to do your best and there is always someone to help you.
Recent Alumnus,4,positively happy with Guilford college and life there
Recent Alumnus,4,I have nothing to add beyond my rating.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I'm an adult student so I cannot comment on dorm conditions or anything like that. My experience with professors has been great! That's the key to success at Guilford and lots of other schools. Talk to advisors and other students to get a feel for various professors in whatever your major is, then take classes with the ones you feel you'll mesh well with. I would definitely choose this school again if I had it to do all over again. Class sizes are really small and we call professors by first names. Quakers are very unassuming people and don't go in much for flashiness or titles. I've learned so much in my time here and I can clearly see the difference in myself image and my entire thinking process since starting my college career here. They stress critical thinking and boy, do I think critically all the time now. This is a writing intensive school so if you don't like to write, or don't want to learn to write, you probably should go somewhere else!"
College Sophomore,4,"My professors are amazing. They know what they are talking about, and genuinely help the class if everyone is struggling. One of my professors even took what was going to be a pop quiz and turned it into a lecture to help the class since we were lagging behind."
College Sophomore,4,"I say its great, because it is great, if you're an athlete. If you're not, expect to be ignored by a lot of the administration, since most of the money this school gets goes towards athletics."
College Freshman,4,I love my professors. They really care about the students and are always available for 1 on 1
College Freshman,4,"Because so many people partake if something bad happens you will be well taken care of. If you don't smoke weed, it will be hard to make friends"
College Freshman,4,Not many people on campus have drugs. IF they do they are great about making sure they don't get caught
College Freshman,4,I like the class sizes. It helps me because If I have an issue I can confront the professor right away
College Freshman,4,They are very useful. Most of them are hard to get and it is only allowed to upperclassmen
College Sophomore,4,"I like my school because I have enjoyed the small class sizes, and getting to know everyone. The school is very unique and has a variety of class options."
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the staff! Faculty is only okay though.
College Junior,4,"My school offers many different degrees and encourages students in take classes in each discipline. There are always campus activities going on from athletic events, bingo, live music, to cookouts. The small size always you to meet many students and once you find other students in your major it's very easy to create lasting friendships. The only downside is the cost of attendance. However, there are many financial aid opportunities and many resources for you to take advantage of."
College Sophomore,4,It's a small school and everyone knows each other. It feels so homie and peaceful but if you need to get away you can always step out of campus and you're in the busy city of Greensboro.
College Freshman,4,Guilford is not a big campus which makes it easy to get around. The atmosphere is very vibrant and positive.
College Sophomore,4,"I wouldn't say great exactly but it definitely wasn't bad or just okay. I got the aid I needed, but I definitely could have used more. What I really don't like is seeing very well-off students who are also walking around with decent scholarships, that could be given to others (not necessarily myself at all) that really would need it more."
College Sophomore,4,"I say great because it is better than unhealthy food provided at other campuses. The food here is not always great, but at least they attempt to provide decent, wholesome meals daily. The Grill/Quakeria on the other hand really diminishes the overall look of the campus food options, most options are not very freshly prepared or healthy, and you get tired of them VERY quickly. Also the worst thing about dining options is that you CANNOT get anything on campus to eat after 11pm. I don't understand that, this college campus has a lot of people awake/hungry after that time still so something ought to be done."
College Sophomore,4,"Greensboro is a great town for college students because there are 4 or 5 college all close together. The airport is close, there are some great places to eat, and plenty of night life. The trick is to actually peel yourself and your friends out of the Guilford Bubble and get out/off campus as much as possible."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are a huge part of what makes the school a real college.
College Freshman,4,Public Safety does an outstanding job.
College Freshman,4,Good variety of housing for students.
College Freshman,4,Greensboro is an up and coming city.
College Freshman,4,Great variety of majors. It's very hard to choose!
College Freshman,4,Everybody else seems to be satisfied.
College Freshman,4,Guilford does an outstanding job with financial aid.
College Freshman,4,Very athletic student body. It's great.
College Junior,4,"I have had a superb experience with great classes and even greater professors.  Every class I've taken so far, I've enjoyed, and I left each of them having learned something new and interesting.  The teachers are all friendly, supportive, and easy to talk to, and I have been able to go to them for help even after I've passed their class.  The classes sizes are all just right, with not too many students and not too few."
College Junior,4,"There are many different student career prospects offered at Guilford, and while I have not investigated the job and internship possibilities, I have been told that they are vast and diverse."
College Junior,4,"The people at my college really want new students to be able to afford to attend, so they offer a lot of financial aid.  They also really admire good grades, so just having good grades will give you a better chance at financial aid.  But anyone can apply for financial aid, but you also want to apply for as many scholarships as you can to get a little extra money."
College Junior,4,"I am having fun in my program, though it requires very hard work and a lot of preparedness.  Since I am doing a double major (History and English), I have double the workload.  It also requires a lot of writing, and I mean pages and pages worth of writing.  I sometimes feel like I'm going to go insane with all the work I'm doing, and I was unsure of what to do at first.  But after asking the heads of the departments what I had to do, I became more confidant and I am enjoying it much more."
College Junior,4,"It's very hard work getting into any of the majors programs, but it is rewarding.  Just work very hard, ask a lot of questions, and be prepared."
College Junior,4,"Guilford College really knows how to have fun.  The college doesn't have any of the infamous college fraternity and sorority parties, but there are many extracurricular activities, clubs, sports, and events that give the students and even the staff a much deserved break after a long day of studying.  While I haven't been to all of the events, the ones I have been to make me want to attend more."
College Junior,4,"Most, but not all of my professors try hard to be inspiring and lead students to their passions. That being said though, it is necessary to apply yourself to your classes to get real results out of them aside from another credit and letter grade."
College Junior,4,"If you don't like writing, don't come to this school. I often end up with mounds of written work, especially around exam time, but most of it is doable if you just apply yourself."
College Junior,4,If you don't mind a little bit of grunge here and there most of Guilford facilities are fine. The only complaint I have would be the wifi - although it has gotten exponentially better as of 2014. The one thing that they really do need though is a pool.
College Junior,4,"Although some people have had some quite bad experiences with the schools housing, dorm life can be pretty awesome if you know what your doing at sign up and are proactive about it. Living in an LLC section in a Freshman dorm my first year was a great experience, especially given that the associated class and students in it were pretty awesome. My second year so far in Bryan hall was only saved by the fact that I had a suite with some of my best friends. If it wasn't for them, I would have had a much more unpleasant experience."
College Junior,4,If I could start  over I would still choose Guilford. Everyone is welcoming and eager to help you.
College Junior,4,I love all of the professors at Guilford! Especially in the Political science and English departments. Everyone is eager to help!
College Junior,4,"The work load is very heavy during midterms and finals. However, if you talk to your professors they will usually be lenient and move around deadlines for you."
College Freshman,4,The weather doesn't have a major impact.
College Freshman,4,The night life in Greensboro is amazing! There are a variety of options to do from the bar to the club to just walking around downtown. 
Freshman,2,Guilford College is not a school to go to if you want to find people like you. There is either athletes or people that smoke a lot.
College Sophomore,2,"It is bad. Really bad. The buildings are run down, some of them leak, and I'm pretty sure some of them are at risk for mold. The freshmen dorms don't even have internet plugs that work for Ethernet access. They have plugs, but they just don't work."
College Freshman,2,Parties happen within cliques in dorm rooms. Otherwise you have to hope a theme house or the Olds is down to do it.
College Freshman,2,Parties happen between friendgroups but never go over 7 people in their dorms
College Freshman,2,The student career center is very bad. They are not interactive with the students at all and barely try to offer opportunities to students and many never visit there their entire time at Guilford. The employees recruited on campus are a lot of the time only there to fill an empty void of someone let go - or just not there at all. Everyone is always leaving for one reason or another.
College Freshman,2,"It is extremely hard to get off campus housing. Housing is run down and very dirty, with small tight rooms that have not been updated for many years. Even though all students are forced to live on campus, there is little attention paid to the quality of already existing housing. They are cutting back on cleaning services - and there have been instances of rotting food in hallways or disgusting bathrooms for days. While this is the students responsibility, it would be nice if there was an effort by the school itself to keep up the dorms. The washing machines and toilets usually do not work."
College Sophomore,2,I don't think that our Safety services are being aimed at the areas of issues. Public safety focuses more on busting dorm gatherings and parking violations than things that are actually important and will keep out campus safer.
College Sophomore,2,I am not impressed with Guilford's housing at all. The best options are the apartments and they are so terribly expensive it's not worth it.
College Freshman,2,"Guilford College is one of the oldest co-educational institutions in the country, so the building's exteriors obviously show signs of aging and in some ways, restrained efforts of renovation. The interior of most of the buildings have been renovated and in some ways modified to mimic the authentic, antique feel of it's brick exterior counterpart."
College Freshman,2,"Guilford College is located along the outskirts of Greensboro, secluded from UNC Greensboro -- a much larger campus that actually feels like a college (although their acceptance rate is much lower than ours lol) -- and downtown Greensboro, which in my opinion, isn't an exemplary metropolitan area. I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so Downtown Greensboro might be the shit to those who have never really ventured out of the area, although most citizens seems to be reclusive to Greensboro. Clubs suck, food's decent, friendly people."
College Junior,2,"There are very limited programs at Guilford, because of the fact that it's a small liberal arts school. Many students transfer out once they realize that Guilford doesn't have the program that they want."
College Junior,2,"All of the dorms are old and worn down. Particularly Bryan Hall, which many students compare to a prison cell. In addition, the outdoor steps leading to the upper floors are rusted and beginning to cave in, which i'm pretty sure is a safety hazard."
College Junior,2,There are so many hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Greensboro that you would never even know about unless you randomly happened upon a shopping center and decided to try a new place. There are so many different ethnic options with authentic food that is also delicious. I recommend getting off-campus and exploring the dining options.
College Junior,2,There aren't many parties on campus. Most of the good ones happen off-campus with small groups of people. The ones on-campus usually get out of control b/c everyone tries to cram into a small old apartment.
College Junior,2,"the area surrounding campus is pretty ugly and they're putting a giant walmart in across the street, so as soon as you leave campus everything looks drab. fortunately, the campus itself is very beautiful."
College Junior,2,no one really cares about the sports on campus. I only ever went to one football games. the only people who care are the athletes.
College Freshman,2,The parties aren't actually very good. They get closed down super fast.
College Student,2,the food is not very good. 
College Student,2,There is a reason they allow freshman to have cars. 
College Student,2,The night life at Guilford is limited to the sports teams hosting the partys and usually they get blown up or shut down by one am. The night life is less about the big partys but more about some drinking or smoking with close friends. 
College Student,2,Most of the students live on campus and off campus housing is limited. 
College Student,2,The surrounding area does not have many options for food besides the local diner and most of the places are fast food and don't offer many vegan/ vegetarian options. 
College Junior,2,Because the school very rarely close due to weather conditions.
College Freshman,2,Bus is really unreliable. If you want to go to downtown or anywhere you need a car although the campus is walking distance from a good number of places
College Junior,2,"the cafeteria here is not at its best at all times but i can say there is always fresh vegetables from our garden and a variety of food for the vegetarians. We always have pasta, salad and fruit. My favorite spote is in the basement where they have thte grill and pizza area plus its the spot to hang at. "
College Junior,2,We are one of those schools who doesnt pertain in such activities by which I mean we dont have Greek life at our school but other colleges around our school does and I think we can apply for them.
College Junior,2,"I stay on campus so I am unsure about the off-house campus But one of my freinds stays off campus and I stayed there over the summer and it was really nice, close to campus and quiet."
College Junior,2,"I feel very safe on campus, even when I am walking late at night alone. The whole campus is well-lit and campus safety is usually out patrolling. Personal safety is great, campus crime isn't as good.

 For the most part the dorms are safe if you are smart. Basically, lock your room so you aren't asking for trouble. I knew someone who's computer was stolen, another person's camera was stolen and someone's room was cleared out of everything valuable. This was all in one year. There are also a lot of crimes with cars. Many cars last year had windows broken and one car was stolen off campus and was never recovered. The parking lots should really have cameras in them because this stuff is happening more and more. It doesn't seem like it is being done by students and since it's not a closed campus, it could just be outsiders targeting a school without security cameras in the parking lot."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not a lot of options. However food has improved in the past two years.
Recent Alumnus,2,Freshman dorms are getting run down. Housing selection process a hassle. If you can't find a roommate Campus life does not work with you and assigns you at random. Very unhelpful with housing concerns.
College Freshman,2,It's very repetitive and you'll find yourself not wanting to eat it because it's so greasy or poorly made.
College Freshman,2,"You can find it, i wouldn't say peer pressure is huge, i stay away from it because i don't need it in my life nor will it help me get to where i want to go. but if you want to find it, it isn't hard at all."
College Junior,2,"Didn't have any problem getting into my major, but no one sat down with me to discuss the requirements individually for the long term, what they might mean to me, or how to best handle the staged requirements (where you can't take one 300 course before you take an un-named 200 course ""pre-requisite""...lot's of that goes on.  If you want a good advisor, you have to ask other students, or Bill McCarver for help there, because anyone else will give you the politically correct response that all our advisors are wonderful."
College Student,2,Most of them have either a very hippie vibe to them and they're very friendly and accepting or they're closed minded and ignorant. There's very little inbetween.
College Sophomore,2,"There are countable numbers of international students at Guilford. Guilford claims to encourage diversity and accept more international studetns, but its outrageously ecpensive tuition prevents international students from even considering applying to the college, specially when they're not offered enough scholarships. However there are a fair amount of African American students mainly due to their athletic background, and so they get a full ride at Guilford."
College Freshman,2,No heat bus... No school transportation... GTA is sketch.
College Sophomore,2,it depends on day of the week when parking is good or bad. if you try to park in the parking lot on monday night you may have to park in another parking lot and walk to where you have to be because everyone is at school but if is friday no is there so you can park anywhere. also make sure you know the parking areas because they give out tickets for every little thing no lie
College Sophomore,2,"Football Team Sucks, Soccer Team Good – soccer team is the only good team here, no fan support for much anything, students are academically focused"
College Freshman,2,Just Not Enough – The scholarships based on merit are not in optimum stature because they don't even cover half of the tuition cost. They should at least cover half of the cost for deserving students.
Niche User,2,"reefer madness – there is weed everywhere here. anytime i go into the woods i always come across a group of kids smoking. however, harder drugs are a lot tougher to come by and alcohol is always a favourite of college students."
Senior,1,"If I was asked how I felt about Guilford a semester ago, I'd likely have said some overwhelmingly positive things, however this most recent semester has just been outright abysmal. I was on campus for all of about 3 days and had to leave because there was black mold in my room which maintainance said would likely not be cleared up by the end of the semester. In addition to this, the AC unit was not only broke but dripping water into my room. After leaving campus and doing classes online, the semester started to smooth out; that was until the Board of Trustees, in their infinite wisdom, decided that a plethora of classes would be discontinued. With these classes ending, a number of Guilfords best professors are now teaching their final classes before termination from the college. If a member of the board is happening to read this, let it be known that Im glad you kept the D3 football team instead of core classes like History, Poli Sci, anthropology, math, etc.Really doing a great job."
Sophomore,1,Basic—not what you would expect from a college . More like a really bad public school . Really backwards.
Sophomore,1,This is a very bad school. Guilford Edge is a marketing scheme. 40% graduation rate means they accept a bunch of athletes to get financial aid checks and then get rid of the students and bring in a new batch next year with the same promises. If you are a good student they find a way to trap you so you can’t transfer. It’s a really creepy place. A miserable school. The leadership is horrible. Lots of money is missing. They have had 3 ADs in 3 years. The classes are substandard—like high school.  Seriously Do Not Go Here!! It has a really bad reputation. Faculty is  good but completely controlled like a high school. Miserable place.  Very very dishonest place.
Sophomore,1,The dorms are horrendous. The only livable area is the East apartments. Classes feel like high school. They forget that diversity does not just mean white and black. You get a crap education for way too much money. Safety is a joke. There is no security in any of the buildings. Athletic teams become cliques and pretty preppy ones at that. The food is gross and the McDonald's on the corner has a better health rating. Partying is a joke unless you count hippies smoking weed in the woods as a party.
College Sophomore,1,Jesus Christ I swear half of this school smokes weed every day.
College Sophomore,1,"I honestly have no idea if this college even does anything to help. They say they do, but most people that go there end up working in jobs that aren't even in their field."
College Freshman,1,"Sexual assault if reported on campus to the college is a basically a 'peer review' process. You do not need proof that it happened to get expelled. Also, the 2 main people in charge of judicial procedures, specifically sexual assault, were fired this year because they could not answer very important questions during a student seminar on sexual assault. The athletes are not expected to go to the many sexual assault prevention seminars, but those in clubs are. Even though the highest number assailants are athletes. 

If you do not like someone, it would be very possible to get into a judicial hearing of sexual assault against a person, and make them seem much more of an assailant than what might of happened."
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life available because of Quaker values.
College Freshman,1,"I saw it is the worst because I do not fall into the student athlete niche. If you are not a student athlete, it is almost guaranteed you will never talk to an athlete throughout your 4 years here."
College Junior,1,"the administration has an extremely strict policy when it comes to drug and alcohol charges. basically, you just have to be smart and avoid getting caught by psafe."
College Junior,1,"Campus life rarely permits off-campus housing for students unless they are over 21, or they have a doctors note with some kind of medical issue that requires them to live off campus. it is completely ridiculous."
College Junior,1,Single students with no dependents that work full-time does not qualify for financial aid.
College Junior,1,No option to join the Greek Life at Guilford College.
College Junior,1,Plenty of parking all over campus and very reasonable fees ($70). Unfortunately the parking lots are not monitored very well and there are a lot of cars getting broken into and even some getting stolen. The school really needs to put up security cameras. What if a student was out walking to their car and came across a thief and it got violent? The school needs to do a better job with these areas that can be hot spots for crime.
Recent Alumnus,1,Students are strongly encouraged to live on campus. Furthermore most students rely on scholarships that require campus housing in order to pay the hefty tuition costs.
College Sophomore,1,Guilford College is poor on transportation. It is hard for students who are from up north or west coast who doesn't drive or own a car.
College Freshman,1,the gym is terrible. i know when i went of my tour they said it was a great gym but it is really really bad. it is tiny. the food is awful here. i don't eat here anymore. who wants lamb and red sauce? the meats are processed and usually uncook
College Freshman,1,"Parties come around every so often and unless you are in with the football team or lax team good luck getting in. It is usually pretty lame on friday and saturday nights. Most people just smoke a bowl and chill or have really lame dorm parties, how can you have fun with an ra around? Most of the people at Guilford are a joke. They are either tree hugging hippies, hipsters, or just really unintelligent people that only got in here because it was easy to get into"
College Freshman,1,"The freshman dorms are alright but the way that the school sets up the housing is awful. My RA told me that they intentionally put people in certain places to contain the ""party and drug scene"", so if you think you will be randomly placed, forget about it."
College Freshman,1,The parking here is very limited to upperclass students as well as Freshmen. When returning to campus from the weekend I often find myself and a few other vehicles behind me circling the student parking lots three times in desperate search of an empty spot. Otherwise we are forced to resort to the parking spaces closer to the woods in the back were mosquitoes call home and poison ivy grows.

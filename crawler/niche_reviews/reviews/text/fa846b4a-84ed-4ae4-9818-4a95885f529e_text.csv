Sophomore,5,"Moody has been a very valuable experience. I have been enrolled in their distance learning program and have found it very valuable. They have done a great job of deepening my knowledge and understanding of the Bible, while also balancing that out with growing my academic knowledge and skill. The professors are open and easy to communicate with, and the textbooks are quite valuable. They also encourage community between the students with online discussion boards that serve as a sort of miniature assignment that also results in discussion between the students. To top it all off the distance learning is almost as cheap as my local community college, but with all of the benefits and the degree of a four year university. It has been well worth it. I have definitely valued my time there and look forward to the future of my education."
Sophomore,5,"Much of what I said in the overall experience applies here as my experience has been online. I believe they have done a good job of ensuring that you learn everything you need to, even though you are not in an actual classroom. They also do a fantastic job of making sure they are giving students the best experience as they take a survey from each student about their experience with each class. At the moment they are even working on changing platforms for their online classes to give the student an even better online experience."
Sophomore,5,"Moody Bible Institute is a wonderful College looking to prepare you for ministry through academics as well as hands on work. Moody cares about your education and desire to see you flourish in any of the areas Moody offers. Through the help of amazing well qualified professors, any student will grow and thrive at Moody Bible Institute."
Sophomore,5,"Spending a semester with the First Year Online Program (FYOP) that Moody offers is a wonderful way to start your college degree without the need to move in the dorms. With the  weekly assignment due dates, you are able to succeeded in your academics without worrying about loss of income or additional worries. Professors are equipped with ways to help you succeeded at home and are always available to talk through assignment and projects you may need help with. If you're looking for a college where you can successful be equipped to follow your dreams at home, Moody Bible Institute's FYOP or First Year Online Program is for you."
Sophomore,5,"I am studying at Moody Aviation, a branch of MBI. I love it because of the high standards in education, student life, and pretty much every other area! The faculty are devoted to making it the best possible education and as affordable as possible. As a missionary training school, they are constantly helping us with internal and external scholarships and they even have volunteer professors!"
Sophomore,5,"As good as an online experience can be! Especially this last COVID semester, Moody did a great job adapting classes to Zoom and it worked out well."
Freshman,5,MBI is a wonderful college with godly people and amazing community. The professors here really care about the students and seek to help them grow in their relationship with God and thrive while at Moody.
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere. There is such a great community here. You feel welcomed and everyone has such a great heart. Moody is also in downtown Chicago so there is always something to do. From coffee shops, to art museums, to concerts, and do much more, you are always able to find something to do!"
Freshman,5,"Moody has been such a blessing with the low cost and amazing Friends and awesome classes.  I have learned so much from the professors, who all care about your academic, personal, and spiritual life. I have also grown much closer to God."

Freshman,5,"I have just started my first year as an FYOP student and my experience has been wonderful! The professors do their best to help you in the online setting. The students are wonderful, encouraging, and introduce other helpful ideas and thoughts from my own. I'm so excited to go to campus next year!"
Niche User,5,I loved visiting the community on campus and the fellowship. The teachers encourage and invest in students lives.
Alum,5,"Moody Bible Institute is challenging on both an academic and personal level if you allow it to be. Though they strive to push you in excellence in all things, they also provide help in every aspect whether it be counseling or academic advising. Moody sees their students not as the masses passing through to pay the bills but as individuals with potential."
Sophomore,5,"It has been such a growing experience, it has helped me as I have walked through a really dark time in life. It’s an honor to go to MBI"
Sophomore,5,"MBI is a Bible college focused on solid Theology which holds God in great respect. Because of this, the campus fosters an encouraging environment for its students. Professors truly do care about each person in their class, are mindful of their struggles, and are always open to meet and answer questions. I’m really benefiting from the education I’m getting here as well!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Moody Bible Institute because you can acquire an amazing, solid, biblical education without even causing a lot of money. Because of MBI's tuition-paid model, students can finish college debt-free. This is only just one benefit of this institution. At MBI, you have professors that really care about you and your spiritual health, so you never feel lonely. MBI is just a great institution."
Niche User,5,Moody has great opportunities and holds firm to their beliefs. The dorms need a little bit of an update but overall moody is fantastic.
Niche User,5,"I love the community at Moody. Everyone is so kind and willing to answer any questions. Moody's professors are so kind and funny. Being at moody made me feel like I was where I was supposed to be. Also, Moody is in such a diverse part of the world which makes it fun to explore the different communities and cultures of this world. They also have many restaurants and activities located near them."
Sophomore,5,"My Experience at Moody Bible Institute has been life changing. Moody Bible Institute has grown me in so many ways through the faith growing experiences, the encounters with God, and through this life giving community! And on top of that each one of the professors truly care and are passionate about what they teach allowing each student to be passionate as well."
Freshman,5,Amazing college! Great professors and community with others. Many degrees to choose from and great faculty. No regrets at all for studying here.
Sophomore,5,Moody Bible Institute is a great college for anyone who is going into the ministry field. There are professors who take the time to help the student be successful. Moody has great Christian values.
Junior,5,"Moody is a great place to prepare for ministry and not to get burdened down with an incredible amount of debt.  I have played soccer at Moody and been pushed and grown, learned life lessons, by the coaches and teammates that will be part of my life far beyond my four years.  Although the campus is in downtown Chicago, it is a beautiful, comfortable, safe setting.  There is so much to do and explore here on a budget-minded wallet!  I know that I will be sufficiently ready for the challenges that I will face in ministry and my career due to the outstanding education I received."
Niche User,5,"I love being taught Sound Biblical Doctrine in a loving online community that prides itself on truth, passion, hope and joy."
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at Moody Bible Institute.  The professors care about you and are open to meeting with you and desire for you to succeed. My friendships are encouraging and supportive and built on trust, truth and accountability.  It is 
 a great environment for growth and the education is not limited to academics, but is also very service oriented in the surrounding community.  The only thing that I would like to see changed is more palatable food options."
Alum,5,"Moody Bible Institute is a wonderful school if you are looking to get a solid understanding of the Bible as well as how to apply it to your everyday life. The professors are great, knowledgeable, and eager to help the students at the school, but they even take time to eat lunch and get together with them outside of a classroom environment. The atmosphere of the school is an uplifting,friendly environment. Finally, this school is located in downtown Chicago which allows for a lot of exploring, practical application of what you study, and a great environment."
Sophomore,5,I really like how Moody offers a study abroad program. I had the opportunity to study in Israel and I learned so much. The professors really care about their students and the community here is great. Living in the heart of Chicago really promotes great ministry opportunities as well.
Sophomore,5,"I have been having a great experience. Awesome community, professors love to engage with their students and help them out. Great campus in downtown Chicago. Excellent spiritual growth to those who want to grow spiritually close to the Lord."
Freshman,5,"Moody Bible Institute is located in the heart of Chicago. It's a bible college that has excellent education. They have bible courses and don't require one to take regular college course classes such as Math, Science or History during the first two years in college. The tuition is very affordable as it is about $16,000 a year. This is due to the fact that there are various generous donors that willing give because they value education and ministry. The professors are amazing because they desire to invest in students and want their students to succeed in school. Since MBI is in the heart of Chicago, it can get very busy! There's a lot of things students can do such as going to the lake (which is very close by!) to visiting China Town or even just going to the Pier. This school is very diverse with many students all over including international students too."
Sophomore,5,Moody has and continues to be a huge blessing in my life. Solid Bible courses with involved professors who truly care about you. Professors aren’t just concerned about acedemics but you as a person and your walk with God
Junior,5,"I have loved my schooling at Moody so much. Not only is the course work of a high level, but I feel spiritually challenged and motivated on a daily basis. The professors are of the highest quality and really know what they're teaching."
Freshman,5,Moody Bible Institute is a tremendous place.  The Christian atmosphere empowers students to go above and beyond in all areas of life. I am excited to spend the next few years here!
Junior,5,"I am an Online student so I cannot speak to the campus life. But Moody is a great institution! Online classes are great and the professors, for the most part, are great as well!"
Freshman,5,"I am an on-line student and I love the course that I am taking, I really enjoy working with my professor. I did take a trip to the Chicago campus. It was great. I had a tour of the campus and I was able to sit in on four classes and participate. So much fun. Wish the my circumstances allowed me to attend the campus full time."
Niche User,5,Moody has a great Christian enviroment for students and alumni to grow more in the faith and be able to use our God-given talents for his glory.
Freshman,5,"I love Moody, and I can't wait to be there this fall! Everything I've seen so far makes me very excited to be there."
Senior,5,"My time here has grown me in ways I could have never imagined. I came in as a naïve freshman girl, but my educational experience here has shown me how little I know, how much I can grow, and how many people are lovingly willing to help me.  An integral part of my educational career occurred when I went on Moody's Study Abroad Program in Israel. I spent eleven weeks living in Jerusalem and seeing the stories of the Bible come alive. This grew my faith. The opportunity for close relationships with professors also developed here as I realized how much of an impact class size can have on the learning experience. I also learned how to live in a very tight community with my classmates. It was incredible to grow with my peers in such an intimate setting."
Freshman,5,"Moody Bible Institute is amazing. The professors really care and they are here to teach students and prepare us for ministry. Moody is also in the heart of Chicago so, students can never really get bored unless the don't leave campus. We have student from all over the world wanting to come here and we really make them feel accepted and loved. Overall , it is a great education for a low price because the school really wants to see the students succeed."
Freshman,5,Moody Bible Institute is an encouraging environment. The community is driven to dive deeper into who God is and to live life with one another. Professors are intentional and will stop at nothing to work with students in attaining their dreams and goals.
Alum,5,"Moody was an incredible experience. Though, like every institution, there are some drawbacks, Moody's education and opportunities overshadowed it's liabilities. I wouldn't trade my experience and Biblical education for anything."
Senior,5,"Excellent school for going into ministry, with great teachers with first-hand experience. The professors are very personable and open to discuss matters with students most any time."
Alum,5,"Moody was an excellent school! Not only did I receive an excellent education, but I also grew spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, and socially. My professors were wonderful - they taught the content very well, and they were always available to help!"
Graduate Student,5,"I have found that the environment of Moody Bible Institute in invigorating and and a breath of fresh air, filled with people desiring to better themselves through educational and practical ministry in the help of others in the local community and places abroad, through the betterment and maturing of oneself spiritually.  All of these things done for the glory of God, and the betterment of humankind.  The Students there are friendly, and inviting always full of smiles and willingness to help one in need.  the Faculty and staff there are highly educated and masters in their various concentrations, yet apt and prone to developing the minds and hearts of their students, not by their own knowledge but the knowledge found in the Word of God.  In essence, the institution and definition of Moody is a place that has manifested the focal point of the Bible, which is Love, Grace, Mercy, and the invitation to understand and become apart of the family of God, in Christ."
Freshman,5,Awesome school. I'm excited to be studying there. It's considered the seminary of undergraduate schools.
Sophomore,5,"As a student who has completed her first year at the school, I have found it to be wonderful overall. The school has many different opportunities to build community. It's a smaller school, but there are many groups to be a part of, as well as simply making use of the open lounge and activity space. The professors, overall, have a heart for the students and their subject, and want to see students walk away from class having learned something of value, whether it came from the lecture or outside of it. The school needs to improve their communication on several fronts, as well as update some of their buildings. At times, it seems as if the voices of the students are not heard or consulted."
Freshman,5,"I loved my first year at Moody. Most of my classes were enjoyable and the professors were a hoot. I especially loved my new and old testament classes. Additionally, they have great study abroad and immersion programs... make sure to check both out when applying to moody."
Freshman,5,"My experience is that every person I have met or spoke with is sincerely kind. Each one has taken a personal interest in who I am and what I want for my future. They work hard to get me where I want to be, even if I don't quite know where thats at yet. I would love for Moody to improve by getting the word out about they're Spokane campus because of the level of high quality education, beautiful location, and genuine people."
Junior,5,"The professors are superbly qualified, but really love the students and want to see them grow in their relationship with God. If you are looking for a place to learn about the Bible, get to know God, be equipped to serve God and His Church, and receive a top-notch theological education, come to ""the seminary for undergraduates."""
Freshman,5,"Moody is a wonderful place where you can have meaningful fellowship and grow in your faith! Fixed in the middle of Chicago, there are many opportunities on and off campus to see new sights, meet new people, and have many new experiences!"
Freshman,5,"Moody Bible Institute is an amazing college where you daily study God's word to be further equipped to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations. Here at Moody, their number one goal or aim for every student is to leave here better equipped for serving God wherever he calls them and to be more in love with Christ when they leave than when they were when they came. Overall, each professor genuinely cares for each of their students' well being and helps each student whether spiritually, physically, or emotionally to their best ability."
Graduate Student,5,Moody is an amazing institution that has helped equip me both academically and spiritually for my vocation and the mission field. Moody has professors that genuinely take the time to get to know each student and invest in us with constructive feedback. I have had only pleasant interactions with the staff and advisors who have been so patient with me.
Sophomore,5,"Moody Bible Institute is such a wonderful place to study and be trained for ministry both locally and internationally. With a small campus, students have an enormous opportunity to know more about there fellow students and grow a community of witness for one another on their lives curve at the Institute. With increasing emphasis on diversity, the Institute has grown to a thriving home of international students. I would highly recommend Moody Bible Institute to anyone preparing for a life time of vocational ministry in the USa and around the world."
Junior,5,"MBI has been a great experience for me.  I've learned so much about God, myself, social aspects, life and what really matters, as well as the academics.  Understanding the Bible more has helped me understand God more and see why he is such a unique and special god, why he has done what he has done, and how to share that with others.
The professors that I've had are great at bringing real life into what we're learning.  Our faith is not separate from life--they are intertwined and I've seen that more and more through my profs.
Something I would change is that we would discuss tougher subjects more often, not just if an incident occurs.  Yes, spiritual growth is important, but so is how to help someone with trauma or the need to call wrongdoing what it is no matter how one feels about it."
Junior,5,"Moody Bible Institute is a great school to attend for learning of Jesus the Christ and getting connected with God. It is an awesome journey that you will never forget taking a class at this Bible based college. 

I encourage you to take a class and see what I am talking about for yourself."
College Student,5,"The work load is exhausting, but informative and good. The community is very loving and friendly. My RA is very available and approachable. She care for every person under her care."
College Junior,5,Moody Bible Institute is an amazing school to learn about theology and to be prepared for a lifetime of ministry.
College Freshman,5,"excellent, helpful professors and staff. really care about students"
College Junior,5,"I've met many alumni that are either now working for Moody or had ease in finding a job post graduation. Depending on the major students choose, finding a job after Moody should not be an issue."
College Junior,5,I love being at Moody.  From the community to academics and the professors it makes being a student here more than worth it.
College Junior,5,We have a very low from rate on campus and I fully believe that is because we are a drug and alcohol free campus.
Senior,4,"The online classes I took were good, but the 8-week accelerated format is very difficult and rigorous."
Senior,4,"Moody Bible Institute is a good school that runs on peoples' passion and desire to honor God in ministry. The professors are wonderful and caring and will provide a great learning experience. Your life will be changed here. However, the logistical departments - financial aid, ISO, Student accounts, etc. seem to be run by people more or less don't care about students as individuals. They have logistical jobs to do and will treat you as another number in their algorithm. The more you stay away from those departments, the more you'll like Moody."
Alum,4,I took the online classes and loved how flexible it was. I was able to work full time and take classes full time so that I could finish my degree on schedule.
Sophomore,4,"Overall great experience (4.5 stars). If you surround yourself with the right people you will have a great community and you will feel loved and cared for. Professors are amazing and genuinely care about the students and are very passionate in the classroom. Dorm life is pretty good, food is getting better, chapels are awesome, the conferences are some of my best memories from Moody, and Moody is in an amazing location. There is a lot of corruption in the board at Moody that almost everybody is aware of and talks about a lot, but these things are never publically addressed to Moody and its donors. Not everybody is in the same place spiritually and there is huge range of spiritual maturity within the student body. Communication is also a big issue within Moody as well. Overall Moody is an enriching and growing experience that will challenge you spiritually, academically, emotionally, and socially. Which I think makes Moody 100% worth it, even with all of the brokenness that Moody has."
Sophomore,4,"Love it here!! So many opportunities and a fantastic community, so welcoming to me and I came as a transfer student. Also, they are located in downtown Chicago meaning there is so much to see and do. Great places for jobs too."
Alum,4,"Moody was a wonderful stepping stone for me to dive into full-time ministry, and pursue my dreams of being a musician. I spent 1 1/2 years there, and in my time learned more about my Bible cumulatively than I have in my whole life. The professors genuinely loved the students and were always willing to help them out if they had time. The environment was positive and uplifting. The cafeteria was pretty bad, but considering how cheap it was to go to school there, it makes sense. The school strives to help its students achieve their goals and dreams and chase after the Lord while doing so. Students are given countless opportunities to serve in their major, others students, and the community. This school definitely sets students up for success."
Niche User,4,"I attend the Spokane satellite branch for the aviation program. It has been a good time. Different bumps along with the closing of the Biblical campus out here in Spokane, but the aviation still stands. I am pleased with my education and the thoroughness of the program."
Sophomore,4,"I took my freshmen year at Moody Bible Institute through their FYOP (First Year Online) program. I was grateful that though studying online, I connected to a lot of students and I felt the experience better prepared me for living on campus. The student body is joyful, encouraging, and up-lifting. 

The business aspect of Moody Bible Institute is not always the greatest. In my freshmen year, specifically, I felt that the Institute did not do well in guiding me through different aspects, such as the payment process and how to accurately access my online classes. 

Overall, I have thus far loved studying with Moody Bible Institute!"
Sophomore,4,"The best thing I've experienced at Moody is the community. Dorm life is incredibly uplifting because the majority of the system of residence is conducive to community--the dining room, brother/sister floors, even the lounges on each floor. The academics, too, are excellent. For over a century, Moody has offered some of the best Bible education available in the world, and it continues to. Though I believe Moody is truly one of the best schools in existence, I would like to see better communication between administration and students. Often, information is delayed or convoluted to a frustrating degree and students begin to feel disregarded or even disrespected. This is improving, but not the best it could be. I would like to see this issue remedied as I continue to enjoy the myriad of positive qualities Moody has."
Alum,4,"Moody Bible Institute is a great place for students who are called into ministry.  Whether it is pastoral, missionary, translation, music, education, biblical counseling, etc.  Moody equips students for full-time occupational ministry. I would not necessarily recommend this school if you are intending to pursue a non-ministry occupation as Moody exists to equip future ministers. Moody is racially diverse and is an open and accepting community.  The administration seeks to promote positive diversity on campus.  There are many opportunities for ministry in Chicago and thus, students are equipped to minister effectively in a variety of settings. I feel well in my current occupation because of Moody."
Senior,4,Profs are amazing and are very open to work one on one. some of the freshman course work is very simplistic and unnecessary.
Alum,4,"Moody Bible Institute is a great institution to receive an undergraduate degree with a solid biblical education. They have a great community of students who often have gatherings and faculty that are genuinely interested in students' well-being. Thanks to dedicated donors, students attend tuition-free, having to only pay for living and food expenses. Located in the heart of Chicago with a tight-knit campus, it is a short walk to Michigan Avenue, the Lake, and accessible on public transit, such as the Red and Brown Lines. Recent disturbances include the closing of their Spokane campus, the loss of 1/3 of the faculty starting Fall 2018, and interim President and Provost due to unconventional circumstances."
Freshman,4,"Moody is a great place to go to school to be prepared for a ministry career.  The professors are excellent and incredibly knowledgeable.  Most of them have experience in the field in which they teach.  For example, my professor for pastoral theology was a senior pastor for years before coming to teach at Moody.  I am very pleased with the campus, professors, and tuition assistance programs.  The one thing that I would like to see change about the school is the lack of diversity.  Most of the students and professors are white with a Calvinist theological view."
Freshman,4,"Moody Bible Institute is a place where education is highly valued, but even more so is the idea that as a Christian one should be prepared to expertly serve and teach the word of God in one's chosen occupation. The instructors here are committed to this vision and to the individual students they educate. They expose the class to the world through the lens of Christian living, and while they do hold to the teachings of Jesus Christ, the difficult questions asked are not avoided. Over all it is a place where excellence is sought in every area of education, and a safe place for those who have questions about the Bible and Christian living to give voice to them."
Freshman,4,Thai school has an outstanding staff full of professors who genuinely want to get to know and care for their students! An A1 education is provided through this institution and a lot of proffesors here are above and beyond the requirements to teach.
Freshman,4,"I think this college is a wonderful place for the students. Moody helps students to improve their academics. Also, Moody has a lot of programs that helps students to get involved in ministry."
Graduate Student,4,"Moody Bible Institute and Seminary is one of the greatest places to be formed for life and ministry, strongly based on the Biblical foundations. Besides amazing and godly professors, I am most blessed by an extremely diverse, international community of students coming from all over the world. It is like a taste of heaven to worship the Lord together and form friendships that will last for a lifetime."
Sophomore,4,"I am a full-time online student at Moody Bible Institute and, so far, I have been thoroughly impressed with their online forum and the quality of their education. Prior to my choosing MBI, I was nervous about earning 100% of my degree online. After I started my classes, I realized that, even though it was online, my professors were still very personal and they were all clearly excited to teach me and to help me grow as a learner and as a Christian. The classes are challenging, but not so much so that I feel like I can't accomplish it. I have learned a lot about myself and my purpose in life throughout my first year with MBI and I am now entering into the classes more closely related to my major."
Freshman,4,"The classes are challenging and the grading is very competitive. However, the professors are openly available for questions whenever we need it and they make every effort to help us succeed. Although there is not as much cultural and racial diversity as I had hoped, the school as a whole works to improve racial relations and understanding. Altogether, Moody is a fantastic school for ministry."
College Junior,4,"For the city of Chicago, I feel very safe while on campus property."
College Junior,4,"The school has great advisors in finding internships and is very well connected with missionary agencies and churches, which are the primary places to go for an internship. They often have booths on campus and it is not difficult to get in contact with such places."
College Junior,4,"Being here at school has been wonderful. As an international student, I feel accepted and cherished and truly part of a community centered on Christ. My professors care about us and want us to have the best outcomes. They invest in students and love answering questions. I wish I had more time to get to take all the professors."
College Senior,4,It is easy to get to classes and the buildings are ancient and beautiful.
College Senior,4,"Great school spirit when it comes to sports, students are interesteed in participating."
College Senior,4,It is unique to me because the professors live what they teach and I can tell that they fully believe it too. It is easy for me to build relationships with the professors because they are very aproachable.
College Sophomore,4,"Moody is super great and perfect fit if you want to go into ministry. I've only just completed my freshman year, and I already feel so equipped for certain types of ministry!"
College Junior,4,"In my experience, the dorm community is the best part of Moody.  We are more like sisters than anything else.  The dorms are small and seem like they are the size of matchboxes, but if you don't spend too much time in them it's ok."
College Junior,4,"My time at Moody has been challenging in so many ways, but it's been amazing.  The professors (particularly in the Elementary Education department) are genuine people that want students to succeed.  They are more than willing to meet with students to help one on one.  The community on campus is very rich and while there are some conflicts or issues, typically the administration addresses it immediately and effectively."
College Junior,4,I love the professors and their hearts for the students. They just want to see us all succeed and serve in whatever capacity possible for ministry.
College Junior,4,I love the floor community in my dorm! Living in a dorm on-campus has been great and I'll probably do it for the remainder of my time!
College Junior,4,Athletics is not one of Moody's top priorities. They focus more on the ministry aspect of sports rather then the sport itself or winning.
College Freshman,4,"Almost everyone is involved, whether that be in varsity soccer or intramural volleyball. I love the school spirit, but there definitely could be more. Also, most people utilize our school gym that is made available to us on a daily basis."
College Freshman,4,"Moody Bible Institute is incredible in that it is theologically sound and correct in all of its bible doctrine, which is the most important aspect of finding a school at which I'd like to study. MBI has an excellent community that always makes you feel welcome, and there are always people there to help you when you need it."
College Freshman,4,"Moody has good athletic programs for the sports that they do offer. There are only 5 varsity teams, but each one is competitive and is great for pushing yourself to be a better athlete."
College Senior,4,"For most fields, a degree from Moody goes a long way to recommend people for future jobs. Often, further education is pursued in order to make job hunting easier."
College Senior,4,Public safety works very hard to make sure the campus is secure and safe
College Sophomore,4,"For old buildings, it's good"
College Freshman,4,"Nothing in life is perfect. True as that is, I have no outstanding complaints. Just a few things here and there but nothing outrageous. Overall, it is a great school. I love it! There are just some minor bugs which everyone is aware of and constantly trying to improve, though there is the understanding of nothing ever able to be perfection this planet."
College Freshman,4,"There is no shortage on internship and career opportunities, and prospective employers are constantly trying to recruit. However, ministry is a rather thankless occupation and isn't exactly top dollar pay."
College Freshman,4,"The investor owned homes are very close to the school. The houses have their issues, varying from home to home, and range from cosmetic problems (carpeting, etc) to deeper issues (plumbing, etc). The houses are also pretty close to other Moody Investor Owned homes, making it easy to get along and visit other students for whatever purpose."
College Freshman,4,"The school is small, which can be both good and bad. Good whereby professors and staff can give more attention and energy to individual students and get to know the student body better. Bad in mostly in the fact that it is small and hardly heard of and resources sometimes have to be sought elsewhere. The environment is conducive for learning in many ways, all of which are practical to ministry. The classes, ministry requirements, and church and community and missions involvement present a wide of opportunities. Furthermore, opportunities given are applicable across all forms of ministry, respectively. It is not perfect, the systems of teaching etc., but no system is. I could not have picked a better school, and would have picked no other."
College Freshman,4,"The biggest part of why I love Moody is the quality of education. The classes are so practical to going into the field you want to. The professors are so helpful, and they are extremely educated in their fields. I will leave Moody with resources, tools, and knowledge that I would not be able to gain from almost any other college or university."
College Freshman,4,"Moody does an excellent job at giving students what they need to find a career in their field. Ministry comes in so many forms, and Moody prepares its students for all its areas."
College Freshman,4,"The housing process is incredibly simple and helpful. The dorms are great, and floor life and community is excellent. My experience has had very few negatives."
College Freshman,4,"Even though the athletics at Moody are not the biggest focus of student-life, they are still important to and loved by a majority of the student body and faculty members alike. Men's soccer rallies the most support, with women's volleyball at a close second. Though our division is small, our soccer team has one many national titles in the last few years, and were this past season's runner up. Volleyball also does well in the division. Women's cross country, though less noticed than other teams, also exceeds in the division, as it just one its third national title in just as many years. All these teams are well supported, and are quite important on the campus."
College Freshman,4,"My time so far attending Moody Bible Institute has been very good. I am experiencing the excitement of city life as well as the benefits of a close-knit student community. I already love most of my professors, and I have even built good relationships with a few. I am confident in the quality of the education I am receiving, and so pleased with my current studies and classes. My peers have been a source of comfort and companionship, and I already know I've made at least a handful of life-long friends."
College Freshman,4,"Moody Bible Institute has been the best school I could have asked for. I have such a great community here. The friends that I have made are ones that I know will stick. I would definitely pick this school again. Out of the Bible colleges out there, this one is by far the best in every criteria; you get a world class education, the professors are amazing, and it's right in downtown Chicago. Also, the people are the best part. I don't think I could have found better people in the world."
College Freshman,4,"I believe my college is the perfect place for me. It's not perfect, but for me, it's where I should be. I am being academically and spiritually challenged. I think most colleges promise things they can't uphold. This college is different, it's special. My college doesn't just care about the social, academic and physical well-being of their students, it cares about their souls too. That, to me, is more than any college student can ask for. Here, we have life!"
College Senior,4,I have really enjoyed the education at Moody Bible Institute. It has been really great so far beyond one or two classes tat I haven't liked
Recent Alumnus,4,The experience has been great because you are learning from a school with a good reputation and they strive to work with you and use technology to help you learn and keep up with you. One of the best things for me is that I travel a lot and I have been able to do my studied while abroad and the professors have worked with me to keep up with my classes.
College Sophomore,4,I love Moody because it is a place that I can build relationships that are firm and solid. Each friend in the dorms that i make are striving to walk the path that God has set out for us and we are all taking the trek together.
College Sophomore,4,"Moody Bible Institute is an excellent school to challenge your faith and understanding and to prepare you for ministry and Christian living. Tuition is paid by very generous donors, which is something for which I'm very appreciative, but there are several other fees that students must pay, including room and board (unmarried students are required to live on campus and pay for a meal plan. MBI is academically based and ministry-focused. The work load is heavy, but if you're serious about your relationship with God and serving Him, it is an excellent place to grow."
College Student,4,Chicago offers a wide variety of great options for a meal anytime of day. All it takes is a GPS and you can find pretty much anything you want.
College Student,4,"Although some people may not like the strictness of the enforcement of rules, I appreciate it in light of our Christian environment and safety in downtown Chicago."
College Student,4,"Moody provides you with a quality dorm where you will have a complementary dresser, desk, and drawers. Furthermore Moody offers an on campus dining area called the commons in addition to your average cafeteria. There is also an activities room filled with pool and ping pong tables. Overall, Moody offers a wide variety of ways to live out your days here on campus. I would recommend it to anyone."
College Sophomore,4,It's diverse. and depends on location
College Senior,4,"I haven't personally experienced the process for off-campus housing, but I have friends who have. It sounds like it's hard to get on the waiting list for off-campus housing, but once it's done, there are plenty of places to live in the city that can be more affordable  than living on-campus. Advertisements from students looking to move off-campus are posted in the elevators seeking roommates to keep costs low. There is even a Facebook page to help find people to live with too."
College Senior,4,"This campus is very safe because of strict policies against drinking and violence. We have many security officers, students and professionals, who work to make this campus safe and secure in the middle of a dangerous city. The policies that are enforced here are for the good of the students and, while some may complain they may be too strict, really aren't as legalistic as they seem initially."
College Freshman,4,"There is not Greek society at Moody to my knowledge, but there are other cultural groups."
College Freshman,4,It was great. Staff at Moody is very friendly and cooperative.
Freshman,2,"Before you come to Moody, make sure that you read their beliefs and Doctrinal Statements. If you do not agree with their beliefs, you will have a hard time here. They teach everything in their doctrinal statements as truth and do not allow much creativity in thoughts or questions beyond that. Im transferring out of Moody next year."
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't a ""traditional"" party scene."
College Freshman,2,My school does not have active athletics. I am a freshman and 2015 is my second semester but I have never heard about my school's athletics. I hope this improve in our school.
College Junior,2,"Our school is located right in downtown Chicago. In this part of town, housing is incredibly expensive and typically out of the average college student's price range. That being said, many students opt to live in surrounding neighborhoods where housing is typically more affordable and easily obtainable, but this leaves many students with a long commute downtown each day."
College Senior,2,"In Spokane, we don't have an athletics department."
College Senior,2,The rooms on campus are pretty much the same at every college
College Senior,2,"Sports at the school are pretty popular in it's season
"
College Senior,2,very few parking spots since it's in the heart of the city.
College Senior,2,The computers we have are pretty normal to your typical computer.
College Freshman,2,"Moody has a parking garage, but it is expensive to obtain a parking pass.  The parking garage is right across the street from school.  It is so much easier to ride the CTA than keep a car here."
College Junior,2,"Overall, Moody is strict about the right things. For example, there are no men allowed on women's floors, and vice versa. That is a great rule. Temptations, and falling into sin, are much avoided in that way. But other rules, such as no alcohol, are over the top. Alcohol is not inherently sinful, (although it can be) and students should be allowed to drink at their discretion while in the Holy Spirit's control. I understand no alcohol on campus, and I agree with that. But Moody students aren't even allowed to drink a sip of alcohol at home even on breaks, even summer break. That is very controlling, and quite wrong in my opinion."
College Freshman,2,My school does not encourage sports much. we only have two small sport teams. One basketball team and the other is volleyball.
College Freshman,2,Make sure you follow through with the Loan process. I didn't check my email as much as I should have and therefore suffered finacially. When in doubt ask questions and double check with your financial advisors to make sure your expenses are paid.
College Junior,2,No real meal plan options and the food in the student dinning room has an average assortment of options.
College Sophomore,2,"Chicago is a gorgeous big city, but an expensive one to live. Costs are very pricey, but they are well located and safety is guaranteed. It is worth living on campus, for Moody is locared at Chicago downtown, and the access is easier."
College Senior,2,"We're a Bible college, so... no real nightlife.  People always find safe ways to have fun in the city, though."
College Senior,2,This college is for arrogant boys who want to get a degree saying that they are wise men of God.
Recent Alumnus,2,little on campus parking.  Most students take public transit
College Senior,2,"We Have Sports? Since my students at my school are there mainly to study the Bible they do not even care or realize that we have sports teams. Sure they know that there are some type of sports but they have no idea what all teams we have. However, the people who do appreciate sports do support them well."
College Sophomore,2,"The School Is Inside the Fourth Memorial Church – Our campus doesn't really have much for the facility.  There's classrooms, the worship center (which doubles as a classroom and the gathering room for chapel), the student center (which is basically for answering questions), a very small library, a computer lab, a writing lab, and Hebrews (the coffee place).  Students are able to use the library at Gonzaga University, however, which is large and a great place to study.  The campus isn't much to look at, but there is nice student artwork around and nice flowers around the property.  There aren't that many campus activities, but the few ones that are put on are very good.  One example is a seminar about a Biblical view of sex put on by the local Christian counseling place.  Another is the Fall Retreat, which is in a gorgeous part of Spokane, and is an amazing experience!"

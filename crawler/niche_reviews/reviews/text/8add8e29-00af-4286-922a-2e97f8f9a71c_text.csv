Junior,5,I love Illinois state! Not only is the weather nice but the people on campus are so fun to be around! The professors that i have had have always been so understanding and willing to work with me when i have questions!
Sophomore,5,"My online education has been really good. All my professors were prepared, and they knew what they were doing."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Illinois State University has been amazing. They. have been extremely supportive since my first day here.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to Illinois State, the atmosphere is great and the campus is amazing. There's always a place you can find to catch up with friends or work on homework."
Sophomore,5,The online experience at ISU was super easy thanks to the teachers. They were always available to help if I got confused or needed assistance on homework.
Junior,5,Taking classes online at ISU has been an awesome experience. All the professors put hard work into their online lectures and they are fast with responses.
Junior,5,"Illinois state is like a second home. There are many people to meet, many new things to see and experience and ISU does a great job getting their students involved."
Sophomore,5,"The professors did a very nice job of making online classes do-able. They made a difficult situation much better by adjusting the rest of the course due to the outside circumstances. And I never had to worry about getting in contact with a professor if there were questions. I am thankful they were such kind and compassionate professors in those times, especially."
Sophomore,5,"Illinois State University has been truly one of the greatest things for me. Not only have they equipped me with whatever I may need to be the most successful student I can be, they have made school feel like home. They do everything they can do to make sure their students are feeling welcomed and ready to learn. In my one year of college, I have already learned and experienced more than I have in the past."
Senior,5,I love the people and the environment. Overall it is such a welcoming campus. I transferred to ISU and quickly made excellent friends. The professors care so much about you and your career after college. The campus is so stunning and always has activities for the students.
Sophomore,5,Worked hard and fast to bring every student their personal needs. Making sure all was met for trasitioning to online schooling.
Sophomore,5,I love it there and met so many friends during my freshman year. I also felt very welcome due to the presence of diversity advocacy. They do a lot to help diverse students feel welcome on campus by offering a variety of resources.
Sophomore,5,"The way my professors specifically set up online learning worked well for me. During the spring of 2020, all of my classes were set up so I could complete my work on my own time rather than attending a zoom lecture. My professors were also available if I ever had questions about assignments."
Sophomore,5,"College has been my home away from home and I truly miss it. The environment at ISU is amazing and so are the professors/staff that work there. For instance, if you're struggling in a class, there are office that you can attend and you can register for tutoring sessions.  I have really been on the outs since this pandemic happened because I thrive better on campus and I really miss my friends. Overall, I would definitely recommend students to attend here!"
Senior,5,I feel very safe when I’m on campus. The teachers and staff of the school are very kind and welcoming.
Senior,5,"When I took classes online, the teachers made sure the students had access to the materials we needed. It was an overall good experience and I don’t really have any complaints."
Sophomore,5,"I love the people, welcoming environment, large campus, helpful resources, and convenient bus system."
Alum,5,Attending Illinois State University gave me the most memorable years of my life. I received a great education and had the opportunity to meet great people. I will cherish the moments I had there forever!
Alum,5,Illinois State does a great job transferring potential in class materials to an online platform. I felt that I received a quality education while participating in online classes. Illinois State has great teachers who can adapt to both in person and online.
Freshman,5,"Online instruction was clear, straightforward, and, in my opinion, more efficient. Everyone was very understanding during this proses."
Freshman,5,Almost everything is online through the ReggieNet portal which is a really nice program as long as the professor uses it correctly and keeps it up to date. It really depends on the professor
Freshman,5,"At first I was a little apprehensive going to a school that I knew a lot of people from my high school were going to as well. But after my first year I'm so glad that it didn't hold me back because Illinois State is such a great school. You feel safe on campus and in the surrounding neighborhoods and everything is accessible either by foot or the free bus. I love studying in the Bone Student Center or in Milner Library when I wanted different scenery. If I had to change one thing, it would be having another dining hall or restaurant."
Freshman,5,I liked the campus itself there is a lot to do there and surrounding the university as well. All the classes are enjoyable and I like all my professors.
Sophomore,5,"What I liked most about Illinois State University was the environment and having an endless amount of resources. Our school has clubs and activities for just about anything you could imagine and if you want to create or start your own club it is not too hard to do. Everyone on campus from professors, other students, and any other staff members at ISU are some of the most kind and helpful people you will ever meet. What I wish there was more of is diversity among students but still we have a good student body. I have made so many amazing friends my first year that I know I will have for the rest of my life. The dorms are a great size and it is easy to make friends on the floor that you live on.     This is where I made some of my great friends."
Sophomore,5,Illinois State University is a very Divers school and is well known for its classes for future teachers.
Freshman,5,"I very much enjoyed my first year at ISU, the CoVid issues offered up some challenges but I believe ISU handled it as well as could be expected when reverting to online classes for the remainder of the school year ... I made many new friends and am looking forward to going back for my Sophomore year !"
Sophomore,5,"I love Illinois State University! Coming into college as a freshman, I was very nervous to move away from home and move into a dorm with people I did not know. My nerves went away very soon once I met my best friend in the dorm and went to welcome week activities! ISU provides so much to all students to welcome them and make sure they have fun. Not only are the professors on campus great people, but the classes are also enjoyable as well. I have had so much fun while being at Illinois State so far, and I cannot wait for the many adventures I will have later on. I have recommended ISU to many people because it feels like home here and many people on campus would agree. Included with tuition costs include many cool things like access the rec center, access to the buses, and many more incredible things. Illinois State University has become a second home to me and many others here."
Freshman,5,"I loved Illinois State when I visited, it felt like home and that is why I will be attending this school in the Fall of 2020."
Alum,5,"I attended Mennonite College of Nursing at ISU the last 2 years and general studies at ISU the first 2 years. I received an excellent education. The professors were very invested in their student’s education. The town is great also. There are many great restaurants and entertainment opportunities. There are many nice, new apartment complexes. The only negative comment I have is that student housing is fairly expensive."
Senior,5,"With Illinois State University, I do believe it is an excellent institution that strives for creating comfortable spaces for everyone. I do think that the close-knit campus is easily accessible. I do think that the people here are kind and my only real issue with campus is that it is so far from home."
Junior,5,"Everyone is willing to help you, both the students and the staff. There are lots of resources to help students succeed. Such as, tutoring, counseling services, and great academic advisers. There are lots of clubs and organizations at Illinois state, that give back to the community. This school is amazing I highly recommend going here. If you do I can almost guarantee you will be satisfied."
Freshman,5,"I love Illinois State! As a future Redbird, visiting the campus with lovely tour guides gave a glimpse into the amazing community at ISU. I immediately felt at home!"
Niche User,5,"Illinois state has not only a wide variety of students and staff but culture. There’s a little bit of everyone’s lifestyle, traditions, and hobbies clothed over the university. I can understand why the students can feel comfortable and so relaxed being somewhere that originally wasn’t their home."
Alum,5,"Made amazing memories while being pushed in my education.  I met amazing people here and made great relationships with my professors.  Overall, had the best time here."
Freshman,5,"I personally love ISU, this is my first year on campus and I am so happy with my decision. There is a wide range of diversity on campus and what's great about campus is that it has that small school feel by being able to walk to class and some of the class sizes are small. But at the same time has the bigger campus feel because there are so many people as well as there's so much to do on and around campus. I love how close uptown is, and all the different food places there are near campus. ISU has some great sporting events, it's so fun to see everyone come out wearing isu gear and cheering their team on. The only thing I would say I dislike on campus, is the food from the dining center , and I hate how small the dorms are especially when you come in not knowing your roommates. Other than that I love ISU and can't wait to finish my degree here."
Sophomore,5,"Illinois State University has a lot of opportunities for students seeking any degree. Regardless of interests or major, ISU has faculty and staff that want to help you and see you succeed as well as services that make it easy to."
Alum,5,Everything was great. Everyone was friendly. Get involved. Go out and meet new people. Walk around campus. Take advantage of the resources provided.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the atmosphere of Illinois State. If I could change on thing, it would be more diversity on campus."
Alum,5,"I like everything about it! There is so much to explore on campus and hopefully this will be the school at which i will continue my studies. I want to major in biology and they have a great biology program which then leads into medicine, which is what i want to do."
Niche User,5,I visited my friend who attends this university and it had a very nice campus. I really like the feel of it and I thought I could see myself at this college next semester. I could definitely feel that students were connected to each other and it seems very easy to make friends because everyone was so welcoming.
Freshman,5,"When visiting Illinois state University have enjoyed Every minute of it. The academics they offer range from a wide variety of things. The clubs, activities, and sports all have a great atmosphere when including the whole student body. The campus is set up super easy letting us be able to walk to school. Also the bus is super easy to access so some people don't have to bring a car. The time and effort Illinois state university has put into the students and staffs safety."
Junior,5,Transferring to university in Spring 2020. From the open house and transfer; I believe I will really enjoy my experience at the university.
Freshman,5,"The living quarters and bathrooms at Manchester Hall are of good quality, and the lounge is pretty much always available for use. The dining center and classrooms are a short distance away from the dorm, making transportation rather convenient. As of now, I would say that the faculty, food, and services are of good quality. I would say that the tuition is worth it."
Niche User,5,Boise State University is a great School for students who don't necessarily want to attend a small school but neither do they want to attend a ginormous School so you get Best of both worlds.maybe around the school is very safe and there's lots of activities and a community is a small town with lots of the commodities of a big town without the disadvantages of a Big Town like crime rate in traffic.is especially a good school for anyone looking to become a teacher in any subject due to it being originally a school for teachers. Food on campus is legendary for being exceptional and its campus is up to par with the latest of the latest. Illinois State University is a great School located in a great community and it is a good step for anybody looking to further their education.
Freshman,5,Illinois State has wonderful classes and Professors available to everyone. Very diverse and welcoming to all.
Senior,5,Exploring the internet and doing research and having made connections with teachers who have attended ISU has given me a good insight and intrigued me to attend ISU.
Freshman,5,"Illinois state university is diverse with many students. I'm currently Vice President of HMDC. Which the board connect diversity with other students. This school also offers many different fields of study for students to be apart of. Within each individual field of study, there are numerous opportunities to get more involved and further your knowledge in the are."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a transfer student at Illinois State University so this is my first year here. So far, its been amazing. I love the environment, all the professors are well-rounded human beings for the most part, the food is not nasty, the opportunities are endless here. There are so many connections you can make no matter what your major is."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at Illinois State University is so welcoming, friendly, and kind. Professors and other staff are happy to help you however you need, and will direct and refer you to useful resources around campus. The campus is small enough that it's easy to navigate, but you still get an awesome, quality four-year experience. I love it here!"
Sophomore,5,Illinois State is the perfect school! It is a large school with a small school feeling!  Ever single professor I've had wants me to succeed even in my lecture classes.
Freshman,5,"From the few times that I have been to Illinois State University, it has been a blast because of all the outgoing and wonderful people that are at the university. From the counselors to the students themselves the university is very welcoming. This combined with the Police on campus it allows for a very safe experience for everyone!"
Freshman,5,"I love the campus at Illinois State. The university is really welcoming. There is a lot of diversity. Which to me is something really important, as I am a minority. The staff there are really nice and always willing to help."
Freshman,5,"Illinois State University is a big campus. You can find a lot of things to do. The staff is nice. In my opinion the dorms could be better. I’ve lived in better dorms. The problem about the dorms is they are small and there isn’t a bathroom connected to each other. Also it was cold in the dorm and the heating system didn’t work. Overall, I had fun meeting new people and introducing myself to the staff."
Senior,5,"Illinois State is an excellent establishment to attend. The professors are friendly and genuinely care about your education. The campus is amazing, full of different activities and people. The college is extremely diverse and  caters to all types of ethnicity. The athletics are outstanding and exciting to watch. The city of Normal is a decent size town but it has lots to do and places to visit. Student life is great, you get to meet amazing people with the same goals as you. Lastly, at Illinois State safety is the top priority, they send out crime alerts to all students which is seldom and enforce all safety regulations with no exceptions because the students safety is the main concern."
Sophomore,5,"I like the fact that I was able to discover new things about myself while there. The environment is very nice, you could  always find something to do. I enjoy the fact that it is easy to meet new people and always run into close friends. The professors are friendly, for the most part they are willing to help as long as you are willing to be open with them."
Sophomore,5,I love Illinois state  University. I have made some friends and I am sure will be life long friends. I am going into my sophomore year and I am a part of the Gamma Phi Circus which is the best part about the school. Maybe some things I would change are the food options that have available on campus.
Junior,5,"Illinois State is an amazing place to go to school. To start, Illinois State has a beautiful campus in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. Not only is everything within walking distance, but the campus is also an arboretum, featuring dozens of different exotic and beautiful trees scattered across the quad. Illinois State also features many amazing schools and professors. The music program at Illinois State is phenomenal, featuring three auditioning wind ensembles, a non-major wind ensemble, two jazz bands, three jazz combos, a symphony orchestra, a men’s choir, two women’s choirs, a concert choir, and Madrigal singers. The music education program is also amazing that is led by amazing professors that care about the success of all students. Illinois State is also a great place for business majors. State Farm works with Illinois State and gets many students wonderful internship opportunities and careers. Overall, Illinois State is an amazing school that everyone should consider going to!"
Sophomore,5,I just finished my freshman year at ISU and I LOVE it!! The school is practically my second home! The people and professors here are kind and welcoming!
Freshman,5,"Like: student life and experience and it's close to home  
Change: food can be bland at times so change food"
Sophomore,5,"ISU is a big school with a small school feel. I love how involved everybody is, from the student to the professors and the facility."
Junior,4,"Good school, Nice campus where you everything is within walking distance. Some of the buildings could use some updates though."
Junior,4,"Most classes are online, it was an adjustment but it isn’t as bad as I expected. Less time is dedicated to classes so that allows me to put time into other things."
Junior,4,I love being at Illinois State University because the campus is wonderful and the professors want all their students to succeed.
Senior,4,There are a lot of great resources for professional development. You just have to know where to find them. My participation in RSOs was the highlight of my college experience. Some professors really want to get to know their students. I have 2 professors that I have a great relationship with.
Freshman,4,"The teachers do their best to adapt to an online environment and it works for the most part. However, all of my classes are held on Zoom meetings with 200+ participants. Part of the reason I chose ISU was because of its student-teacher ratio which is completely lost in this environment. It is a competition of 200 kids to get the teacher's attention which is not so great. I would prefer if the classes were atleast partially in person."
Senior,4,I really enjoy Illinois State University. I think there is a lot to do both on campus and off. There are so many clubs and activities to become apart of. All the teachers seem to really enjoy teaching and spending time making sure their students are learning.
Senior,4,My online experience has been average. I feel that all of my teachers are making sure that all their students are able to understand the material in this format.
Senior,4,I liked that Illinois State University tries to vary students learning ability by always offering new ways of learning.
Senior,4,"I took almost all of my classes online. Professors are nice about the new technology. My only in person situation would be dance, and being in the dance concert. Very big precautions are being taken in order for this to happen."
Senior,4,"My professors have done an incredible job going with the COVID-19 flow.  They have kept in great communication with us and really tried to make this a comfortable transition for us students.  I have just seen them all really trying to make this a positive experience and I really appreciate their efforts.   However, I feel like ISU in high authorities have not been very clear on the financial situation the students are facing by transitioning to online learning."
Senior,4,"Illinois State University is a GREAT school that has literally given me a place to explore all the interests and activities that are a part of who I am.  I have been able to feed both my creative side, academic side and religious side by the opportunities available to an ISU student.  I would recommend this college!"
Junior,4,"Once we had the transition to online due to COVID, my teachers did a pretty good job given the extreme circumstances. Class quality wasn't great at first, but by the end, the teachers got the hang of it all and did a great job."
Graduate Student,4,"The majority of the classes offered through the English Major, Secondary Education Sequence were in person, but had elements of the coursework through the online student portal. The portal was easy to understand, however would not always upload documents or quiz questions appropriately. 
If someone was seeking an online program, or even a mostly online program, this course sequence would not be recommended. It makes sense that teaching, a profession that depends so much upon face-to-face interaction would require in-person classes.
An area of improvement for the school in this regard would be increased opportunities to learn teaching methods implementing technology. Technology is the new way of the world and many of the teaching methods demonstrated when I was a student, were dependent on discussion based teaching. In order to be able to reach and make a true impact on kids today, increased fluency in the technology platforms used by kids  and visual learning would be of benefit."
Graduate Student,4,"Illinois State University was instrumental to my pathway. I received my B.A. in English, Secondary Education Sequence.  I enjoyed the campus, which was well maintained at all times. There was also an incredible library. The faculty challenged students to excellence. Of all the teachers I took classes with, almost all of them were very kind. Even the teachers that were not, were at least committed to excellence. I value the education I received at ISU. 
 An area of improvement for the school would be increased preparation for how to interact with schools to get a job after completing a degree, what it takes to become a substitute teacher to supplement income, and clear guidance on scholarships and grants available or resources to find them. I remember my time at ISU fondly. The degree I pursued had many courses, required and elective, that were not only challenging, but well-rounded. I would recommend this university, but be prepared to do your own homework on how to find employment."
Sophomore,4,"I understand that it was very hard on the professors due to the unexpected circumstances, but I feel as if they could have been more helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love this school, the students as well as the professors have both been amazing. The school is also very inclusive and helpful, especially during these times."
Senior,4,I only took some hybrid classes online. Until COVID-19 hit then we had all online classes. The online learning has been relatively easy and was formatted in an easy way to understand.
Sophomore,4,"I was taking one online class before to the pandemic and the sudden switch to all classes to an online format. For me, this transition was relatively smooth. My professors were accessible and helpful during this online learning process. I found each of my classes to be fair and the material was adapted for the sudden change in learning formats. I was able to maintain mostly As in my online classes.
    During the change to online learning, I was able to access other services such as student health services. My academic advisor was accessible and responded to inquiries and requests for assistance in a timely manner. Overall, I found the online learning to be a positive experience at this university."
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my freshman year at Illinois State University. The adjustment for the first semester started positively but then I had some difficulty staying on track. I found the student support services to be vital to helping me get back on track. The advisors and the student support services assisted with making a plan and following up with my progress. I was able to complete the year with 3.7 in the second semester. I am grateful for the supports the university has in place to help the students. 
    In addition to these student supports there were many social opportunities to build relationships with other students as well. I am excited to be able to continue to take advantage of the opportunities when I return this Fall."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and classmates all interact well with each other. A great social environment for anyone.
Sophomore,4,"ISU has on campus activities, clubs, and experiences for everyone. The area feels very safe, as it is mostly occupied by students. There are not many things to do outside of campus, as it is in a mostly rural area. My professors have been relatively good so far, but I've only had gen eds. The sporting events are fun and many students are very enthusiastic about being a redbird."
Niche User,4,"This university has a great downtown scene that is college town friendly. There are many great rooming options as well, with the new Waterson dorm available to all. There is a train that leads right into Chicago so the city is never far."
Niche User,4,The online learning experience was very good. Professors posted lectures and then assigned work along with them. The workload was manageable as well.
Sophomore,4,"Individually, I had professors who cared. But on an institutional level, it's nearly impossible to get ISU to consider the needs of its students. Workers are underpaid, financial aid is hard to access, the school fails to properly respond to their racism, and nonbinary students are given such minimal housing options that most just opt to misgender themselves for a better room. Now, the campus is great. Beautiful! And I find there's a lot of flexibility in my major. I love ISU. I found it to be the best option for me on nearly every front. I can't imagine myself anywhere else. But know that no matter how good an institution seems, they're not on your side. That includes ISU's friendly face. ISU would not be as good as it is without its students, faculty, and other workers. It's about time ISU gives us what we need. Without us, they're just a collection of old buildings."
Sophomore,4,"Illinois State is a good school with a very great education program. I love the school spirit and the medium campus. The sporting events are great and really make you feel like you are included and a part of the redbird family. I do wish the dining hall had better options if you are diet restricted. However, most professors are great and interested in you as a person."
Sophomore,4,"I took all of my classes online due to Covid-19. It was definitely a struggle. The professors were pretty understanding with recording class. I do wish all of my classes were recorded because some of the times were inconvenient being back home. Overall, the experience was okay. I definitely cannot wait to be back on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Towards the end of spring semester we switched to online courses and the transition was pretty smooth for the most part. There were lectures through zoom, online videos, and helpful resources to help us succeed."
Freshman,4,"Illinois State is great and has some amazing professors, especially at the heads of the departments! Like all things in life there are downsides to be found, but I have always found them outweighed."
Freshman,4,It was ok it was pretty difficult to adjust to having to do everything online but for the most part professors were very understanding about people's situations.
Sophomore,4,"For my freshman year I took one online class fall semester and one online class my spring semester. Then with the pandemic situation all my classes were made online. They aren't as bad as people think that they are. You just have to make sure that you are always keeping an eye on when assignments, quizzes, or tests are due. Both of my professors were very considerate about internet problems are technology difficulties. Assignments were always due on certain days of the week, same as tests and quizzes so that it is easy to remember what days things are due. Each professor was always easy to reach or get a hold of when I needed to help or to ask a question. I recommend taking at least one online class to get the experience."
Freshman,4,Honestly I enjoy being  an ISU student way more than I thought I would. The school is a good fit for me and I am doing great in my classes.
Graduate Student,4,"I came as a transfer student and everyone was very welcoming! I felt like I had been there since the beginning of college, and I came two and a half years late!"
Sophomore,4,Illinois State is an awesome school but meeting new people can be hard. The campus is very clean and the resources they have are awesome.
Niche User,4,The school was very nice and really fun . I was able to learn more about the world in front of me and parts that I didn't even know. I also had the chance to meet with people from all around the world which was pretty amazing .I was also able to learn in a very safe environment which is something that I appreciate very much and IM very thankful for having the opportunity to go to the school
Freshman,4,"Illinois State is pretty great. Depending on your program, some professors are better than others but generally all are good. The campus is nice, it isn't too big but it's also not to small. And it is in a rural area but with the right people you don't really care about it anymore!"
Niche User,4,I loved the green expanse and the wonderful welcoming nature of staff and lecturers were very helpful
Freshman,4,I like the size of the school and some of the people I have met. It is decently diverse and has cool people. The food is about average but definitely gets old after awhile. Professors are a definite hit or miss depending on who you get and the class difficulty varies depending on the professor you have.
Niche User,4,It was funudjdjdjdjidocicifjfjfnnfnfndhchcdoosisjdjdjdiosisidjdjjsjsjsjsjdjdjdjdjdjjdjdjdjdjdndjdjdjjdbjkdewbuicgewfgrwufggfbccboucuociewwehchwdoichbc
Senior,4,"I genuinely did have a great 4 year experience at Illinois State. Every class I attended was something I was interested in and I had the freedom to chose the type of studies I wanted to pursue. The advising was always helpful and so were most of the professors I had. I got involved in Greek life and a couple clubs that allowed me to network with so many other students. My overall college experience was a 4/5. My only complaint was the limited parking and the extra costs of parking. Other than that, I love how the school is renovating so much of the campus and updating many things. I cant wait to come back and visit as an Alumni and see all of the changes."
Senior,4,"I liked the professors, the people, and the campus. I was hesitant to go to school here, but it was the best decision of my life. When I came to school, I was also indecisive as to what I wanted to career-wise. Now, as a senior, I plan to attend graduate school at another university to become a librarian. Now, I have a whole life plan. Overall, I've gotten so much clarity on who I am as a person and what I want to do with my life through ISU."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the environment and the overall vibe that Illinois State University gave me. I plan on attending this coming fall.
Freshman,4,"Current freshman, education major. The atmosphere here is nice and the quad/ campus is beautiful. It has a small town feel even thought its not a small school."
Sophomore,4,I love the small campus atmosphere that this school has because the longest walk I have ever had to class on opposite sides of campus is never more than 15 minutes. I like that once you get out of gen eds and into your major classes they get smaller so the professors get to know you more personally.
Freshman,4,"This school is for those who are looking for a large community of people that are all so different from each other. The diversity here is slim, as sororities and fraternities are giant. The campus is a beautiful place to see vast amounts of architecture ranging from old stone castle-looking buildings, to newly renovated brick. There are always opportunities to get involved, and lots of people willing to help you. Teachers are great, give or take a few, but definitely a good place to call home for your 4 years."
Junior,4,"I transferred to ISU as a junior. The transferring process was very smooth, and all of the staff were so friendly and helpful. I love ISU because it is easy to meet people in some of my small classes, but I am also able to take big lectures if I want to as well. It is a pretty campus with a lot of good resources for a good price."
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and exciting year round! I love my professors and the coursework is tough, but rewarding!"
Senior,4,"I like Illinois State University for several reasons. Its location was very important; not too far from home but far enough to feel independent. The tuition was affordable, the faculty are friendly, there were many study abroad opportunities (I was fortunate to study in Mexico), and the class sizes were small."
Sophomore,4,"Very good school with a nice surrounding town. If you want to go there for the parties then you're good. If you want want to go there for the sports, you should because they are entertaining with good matches. The education is very under appreciated. It's a good school that prepares you for your career. You just have to pay attention and go to class to pass, not be a genius."
Senior,4,"Depending on your major, ISU has some reputable programs. I like the small class sizes and individualized attention, as the professors there are actually concerned for students' learning and success. The education is great, lots of opportunities to find internships, campus jobs, and join a club that exists for any interest one may have out there. but the campus is more of an eye-sore. The buildings are out-dated and the dorms are disgusting. Cheap rent for apartments, though. Nightlife mainly consists of going to downtown Bloomington for drinks, but otherwise people are mainly staying indoors during the cold winter between November-March. The local area seems to be dead, as there is not much to do around the area. But overall, a great place to go to school."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I have enjoyed my time at ISU so far. Everyone is very welcoming, and just wants to see me do my best."
Sophomore,4,Illinois state offers a campus of friendly and well informed staff. It feels that when help is needed a staff member is great at pointing you in the right direction.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus environment, most of the people are very nice. You can always find something to do with the hundreds of clubs offered."
Freshman,4,"What I like about ISU is that you get whatever you put in. If you put yourself out there and get involved, you will have a great time! One thing I would change would be the fact that we are not the best school when it comes to diversity. But there are RSOs and Greek life to supplement that!"
Junior,4,I transferred here from a different college and I am enjoying it so far. The campus is very pretty and there are a lot of activities to do and places around town to go. It is also very safe and the teaching staff push students a lot.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshmen at Illinois State.  So far I have not complaints.  I like the diversity it offers.  I also like my instructors.  They are very nice, they let you know what is expected up front in order to pass.  The campus is good, although I don't know a lot of people yet.  If I could change anything it would be the cafeteria's. The food is good, but you get tired of the same thing everyday. 
Overall, Illinois State is a nice university to attend."
Freshman,4,"I love the small school feel of Illinois State, but it has so many of the advantages of a large school.  The professors go out of their way to assist you with school work."
Freshman,4,"I like the quad at Illinois State University because there are so many trees and is so pretty when the leaves change color.  It is also nice that the campus is not too big, so walking to classes is easy."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the Uptown area at night as well as the many RSOs that you can potentially join. Not to mention the professors are there to help you in any way they can which is always a plus. Overall, I enjoy the entire atmosphere that the campus has to offer and I would highly recommend, at least a visit, to anyone that is interested."
Freshman,4,"The classes are big but for a big campus, not out of proportion. When you start getting into the major courses, the classes are smaller. A lot of redbird pride going on at the school and that was a huge thing for me and I'm glad to see students supporting ALL sports, not just a specific sport."
Sophomore,4,It is a very large public university with a city area that is very urban. But I am enjoying my time here.
Senior,2,"Online classes are super boring. I miss going to class. Some professors are pretty good about making class interesting, while others are just trying to get the lecture done. Asynchronous classes were not the move for me. Classes are definitely easier and I think the workload has been diminished for many classes, but it's still hard to find the motivation to even do the bare minimum like going to class."
Sophomore,2,"There are some professors who genuinely care about the students and do zoom meetings and multiple lecture videos per week, on top of their weekly office hours. But A lot of them treat their students like numbers and let the TA's slave away. An example of this was my psychology course last year it had no zoom meetings, no lecture videos, and she just posted her notes and told us to copy them down.There were also no assignments to check if we understood the notes that we were mindlessly copying down.Instead there were just the exams and the final.When talking to my peers from different colleges they talk about the several zoom meetings they have every week, but so far at ISU I can't relate to this at all. Out of the 2 semesters of classes that I have had completely online,I have only had 1 class out of  11 that had a mandatory zoom meeting.Lastly I want to talk about how much of a dumpster fire the school's website is.It legitimately feels like Reggienet was developed by 13 year olds."
Sophomore,2,"I am currently a sophomore at Illinois State University, during my first semester on campus, I wouldn't say that it was that bad, but things have really took a turn for the worst recently. I understand that we are in some tough times currently, but the way that Illinois State has handled this whole COVID situation has been terrible.  At the beginning of the semester this year, the school refused to give information about the number of COVID cases to the students in fear that they would leave after seeing the number. But after many many complaints they finally released the data, and it was really bad. As of 9/18/20, there are 1398 students who tested positive for covid who are on campus. With a 4.8% of the student body testing positive.And these are only the students who got tested. Also the school isn't handling the spreading well after class hours.Students are still partying and grouping up without masks not social distancing at all. Because there is no curfew set in place currently."
Sophomore,2,"I had a professor who was experienced with online work, bless her, love her. Can't say the same for my other professors. Some professors are so anti-technology they don't even use ReggieNet. Class felt disconnected. Some folks can learn online, but that's not what I signed up for, not what I paid for, and I certainly wasn't compensated properly. I paid way too much money for someone to tell me to read a passage and not even attempt to facilitate a discussion and for another to assign videos without closed captioning which created huge accessibility issues. ISU was not prepared."
Alum,2,"Not great for non-medical biology degrees.  Just not a lot of classes to choose from, and those are are offered do not have much hand on experience even in labs.  Good luck finding a job because you have little to no skills that are required for environmental positions."
Junior,2,The diversity in the school is good and how they try to push it. There aren’t a lot of places on campus to eat. I’m in athletics and they don’t care for the only team that was able to win a championship but almost all other sports were able to get new fields within the last 5 years. Academics aren’t that hard and it’s not ranked highly and won’t get you most jobs based on name recognition.
Freshman,2,"Need to Go Greek in order to have fun here. Freshman year was not a good experience. Not much to do on campus other than stay in your room. Not a ton of inviting ways to get involved. Girls usually have a great time at thi school but if you are a guy not interested in joining a fraternity, forget about going to any social functions. They do not exist."
Sophomore,2,I love the school itself. The professors I had were all amazing. The only problem for me as a black student is the demographic of the students. I have encounter far too many acts of racism.
Sophomore,2,nice quad...not too much life or color in the environment. affordable compared to other universities
College Senior,2,Alex Snowden is destroying ISU Greek Life.  That is all.
College Junior,2,"I think housing security could be tighter, and sexual assault needs to be treated more seriously. This often is related to Greek life."
College Sophomore,2,"I really don't like greek life in general, but this campus is not too bad for it."
Recent Alumnus,2,People talk about going to the clubs all the time.  I also hear stories about them blacking out.  It makes me sad.  There are definitely people on campus who don't drink but its hard to see at times.
College Freshman,2,"I currently reside in Watterson Towers, and it's a mess. There is trash in the stairwells and the elevators go out of order at least once a month. The room and lobby renovations are lackluster but a nice attempt by housing. I think Manchester-Hewett is much cleaner and nicer."
College Freshman,2,Greek life at ISU is very low key. Not very many people find interest in it.
College Freshman,2,Greeks are only welcoming for those who are looking to join them. Most have a very douchey attitude and are extremely cliquey as well. Then again a lot of them are very nice but they exclude those who are not in their fraternity from all social gatherings unless you have a pair of boobs. The larger influence that I have to join one is just so that I have the ability to have more plans throughout the year.
College Senior,2,"Like I said, I regret attending ISU. If I could do it all over again, I would."
College Senior,2,"ISU does not have your best interest at heart. All ISU wants is your money and they will get it any way they can. They will throw random out of no where ""university wide electives"" at you. Your major may only require 23 senior level courses but ISU requires 30 so you need to take additional classes that do not pertain to your major for no real reason. Some of the instructors are great, but some are awful and refuse to help or answer emails. If I could do it all over again, I would not go to ISU."
College Freshman,2,"The school is just not a great fit for me. Security is way too strict, and everything you do costs an arm and a leg. The people aren't that friendly and the dorms aren't that nice."
College Junior,2,the whole town feeds on negativity and the tragedies that happen there gives you awful vibes.
College Freshman,2,Be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars on drinking tickets. this school just wants to rackin the money rather than caring about students safety.
College Freshman,2,"Not much selection, same stuff everyday."
College Sophomore,2,"My mother  suffers from Multiple Sclerosis, and was diagnosed when I was eight. When I was sixteen, she had a cancerous tumor removed from her head, and I worked three jobs to put myself through community college to transfer here. According to FAFSA, my parents make ""too much"" and I am not eligible for any type of grants. I think that is unreasonable because quite frankly, my parents have little assisted me with financial needs in college. Unless I am unaware of any services here, I am basically 'on my own' to pay for schooling; which puts a lot of stress on me and my grades suffer."
College Freshman,2,"School spirit involving sports is not big, especially since tailgating is rarely permitted."
College Sophomore,2,"We have the worst school spirit here. I wish we would have more but we just don't. It isn't like our sport's teams are bad, nobody just never goes which is sad."
College Freshman,2,"Checking into the dorms and checking peoples bags seems a little extreme. I get the point, but as adults it just seems a little too strict."
College Freshman,2,"There are not many options for parking. Parking garages get way to expensive, and there is not really anywhere near to park for free."
College Freshman,2,It was very confusing and not too easy to receive help
College Freshman,2,Cops don't keep us safe they just drain our banks
College Sophomore,2,They don't really give out very many or put them out there for students to see easily
College Junior,2,Sporting events are poor because Illinois State is rarely ever good at the more popular sports such as basketball and football so most people go to the games just to tailgate/consume alcohol.
College Junior,2,"There are so many students on campus, I prefer a low key type scene which is hard to find around ISU."
College Sophomore,2,It's to cliquey around this school
College Sophomore,2,The administration is to hard on students who already have a stressful life on campus
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the housing is out of date and not sufficient for students to perform well
College Senior,2,"Crap. You will be in a tiny box, in a very, very crowded building, unless you live in Cardinal Court, but that is so far away from campus that you will either need a car, and parking is awkward and expensive on campus, or to take the shuttle, which is reliable but might mean you have to set your schedule around it."
College Junior,2,"There are quite a few options, but nothing is really so good that I look forward to eating it. My meal plan freshman year was pretty much a waste, I just kept the fridge in my dorm stocked."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid has been pretty hit or miss for me at ISU. My freshman year I received not financial aid at all, then by my sophomore year I received about $8,000 in financial aid. Now I'm on to my junior year and once again received no financial aid."
College Freshman,2,Security in the dorms suck. If you come in after midnight you'll have to check in. You have to check in any guest you bring in after midnight. If you don't have a cool RA you're going to end up with a lot of tickets.
College Junior,2,"Because the college is located near so many high school and, middle schools, and preschools, the police are very strict.  The school is also very strict on their policies.  It is best to follow the rules and if you are going to drink underage, do so safely and not so flamboyantly."
College Junior,2,It was easy to get into.
College Junior,2,I am going to be in a lot of debt.
College Sophomore,2,"Cops are SO bad, they have made me regret my decision. if you can make it to 21 without a ticket/arrest you should be very proud."
College Sophomore,2,I think that ISU could enforce drug and drinking laws much better and have never heard of a parking ticket being issued despite common violations.
College Freshman,2,The internet has been bad this semester.
College Freshman,2,It is absolutely dumb and absurb to pay for friends but if thats what people want to do then so be it! its about 8% of our campus not a big deal at all.
College Freshman,2,We had 5 days worth of snow days not to mention late start days.
College Freshman,2,Two people died this year because of drinking. The parties need to be more controlled.
College Junior,2,It will cost you an arm and a leg to live off-campus at a decent apartment. Look for places as early as possible
College Freshman,2,You pay for friends and they act so exclusive like they're the coolest kids on campus
College Freshman,2,Public university so you don't get much.
College Junior,2,"There is a bus system that runs through town, but is not easily used. Most students walk to campus. The bus also takes students to Target and other shopping centers, but most of the people I know just get a ride because it is more convenient."
College Junior,2,"The first few months of school are always the best because they are warm. Most students walk to campus because there is not a lot of parking availability. Because we are in Illinois, the winter are rough. The school does not shut down unless there is a more than enough snow or the winds are considered dangerously cold. For the most part, walking to class is one of the worst parts about school."
College Sophomore,2,"It stinks, there is always snow and rain. If you plan on coming to ISU you need to have rain boots, an umbrella, a jacket and gloves. But once that bad weather stops and the sun comes out, it's beautiful and everyone is on the quad. The campus is so pretty in the sun, putting everyone in a good mood."
College Sophomore,2,The athletic teams are not that great and the school spirit is terrible. We did just get a new football stadium so maybe that will help.
College Sophomore,2,"I cannot wait to move into an apartment in order to have control over the foods I eat. The dining center serves the same entrees every week, and have a hard time making sure that all the food is stocked and clean. They often run out of food, or the workers decide not to refill drink dispensers. Not many allergy-conscious options, or vegan options. Uninteresting. Tasteless. Very processed."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally, I do not enjoy Greek life. Here it revolves around drinking, hazing, drugs, partying, and getting into trouble. Very few frats are professional and academic."
College Freshman,2,"the school does not care if you are underaged and drinking or doing drugs. they do issue drinking tickets but that is mainly if you are being beligerent and it is too obvious that you had been drinking. the front desk is ridiculous. often times, a fight would break out on the floor with students being beaten to blood and furntiure being destroyed. you call the front desk and it takes them 2 hours plus 2 more phone calls for someone to actually come up. even when they do come up, they will just politely ask people to quiet down and then go about their way... pathetic"
College Freshman,2,"EVERY single person here drinks. and goes out. Now, don't get me wrong, I like going out myself, but unfortunately, many students here do not know how to balance academics and social life. People go out here on weekdays, almost everyday. People also smoke a lot, especially in their dorm rooms. It smells like weed almost all the time in the dorms. I have seen poeple doing cocaine inside my own dorm. And yes, many students end up skipping class, with their grades slipping. There honestly isnt much to look forward to in this town, so i guess everything gets tired and boring and the students only have one thing to really turn to, which is sadly alcohol and partying. as long as you have a grip and a pretty strong handle on controlling yourself, you wont lose focus of your academics. "
College Freshman,2,Freshman wanting to drive their car have to pay to get a parking pass. Freshman are only allowed to park on the top level of the parking garages leaving your car unprotected from any severe weather. Also the the campus parking available is located far away from dorms and is an inconvenience.
Graduate Student,1,"I'd rather to rate it like 0.1 star but there is no option like this anyway. This is such a terrible school. I never care about the school ranking but now I believe it that there is still some reasons why the ranking of it is LOW and not worthy to study. Especially you cannot get anything after study here! I have a good and comfy life outside of campus, but I am so shocked that the music professors are so unprofessional, and the whole program is just like a bullshit. Especially the graduate program just NOTHING. Students should be dumb or stupid, then you could be treated like a gold. But if you are a 
assertive students they will think you are out of controlled. PLEASE DO NOT COME. I would say every school has pros and cons but this one is ridiculous awfully."
Niche User,1,"School website lists Individual attention as one of their values, indicating that the school provides a supportive environment.  This was not my son's experience.  
In fact, because we requested Individual Attention; it was suggested that my son seek an education elsewhere.
Talk about Hypocrisy!!!"
Freshman,1,"The future of teaching is in bad hands.  I am literally retaking my high school precalc class for $25,000.  The food is high school cafeteria food and the staff fails to recognize the need for clean tables.  You have to choose between dirty and less dirty.  As the old joke goes, ISU; I screwed up."
Sophomore,1,"Honestly don't like this university at all. It's terrible. The dorms are very small, not very well taken care of, and sometimes difficult to get through. Along with that the campus is very small there really isn't much to do as far as entertainment. You really have to make your own fun otherwise you'll get bored very fast. The dining centers here are just awful. Don't get a lot of food choices, and the food isn't that great"
College Freshman,1,to many police they dont let you have fun
College Freshman,1,"we're in college so drinking shouldn't be that big of a deal, but the cops give out underage drinking tickets left and right."
College Senior,1,"Not even worth joining. All of the chapters are getting kicked off of campus. The people that are in Greek life tend to not have friends outside of it and they think that they all are the center of the universe. I used to be involved in Greek life but I shortly recieved Alumni status. Greek life is great at any other university, just not ISU."
College Senior,1,No one really cares about athletics at ISU. No one really goes to any sporting events or even tailgates for them.
College Junior,1,"There are hardly scholarship options for students with parents who have jobs, even if they don't make a lot of money."
College Freshman,1,Cops...Cops...Cops.  all you need to know.
College Freshman,1,Just a mess. Did not get any money even though i was well above the average.
College Freshman,1,Watterson is very antisocial and you will be fined for anything. you have to watch your back because you will get in trouble for any thing you do.
College Freshman,1,"You'll get caught, don't do it."
College Freshman,1,If you're under 21 expect a drinking ticket!!!
College Freshman,1,Didn't enjoy it. It's not complete freedom.
College Freshman,1,I recieved no financial aid and basically no loans. Had to take out loans from second & third party places.
College Freshman,1,I wasn't receiving somethings i never signed to but it was because the deadline was after i decided to attend.
College Sophomore,1,Sometimes I wonder why I am here
College Sophomore,1,Off campus housing is awful
College Sophomore,1,I wish varsity sports were bigger around here. It would really bring the students together
College Freshman,1,need more scholarships. Some students pay way more than others and are just as deserving.
College Sophomore,1,"It's very expensive and, as a vegetarian who enjoys eating healthy meals including fresh vegetables and fruits, the dining options are extremely poor. For example, there is a sign that says ""only 2 pieces of fruit per student"" near the pitiful little fruit stand. I often eat many, many more than that in one sitting--fruit salad for breakfast or a part of lunch/dinner is amazing! Fruits and veggies are the main part of my diet, and there are not many options to choose from at all. This is unfortunate; during the summer (away from the dining center), I eat only salad for dinner and it's absolutely delicious--that's why I can eat it for months on end without tiring of it. This would be an easy option for vegetarians stuck in the precarious situation of dining centers, but the salad bar is severely lacking. It often uses slots that should be used for veggies for cheeses, leftover meats, pasta salads, and other items that are definitely not going in my salad! In fact, only a handful of veggies are even offered...the ones that are available every day? Lettuce and tomatoes. <-----I can't go about my busy college day eating that!"
College Sophomore,1,"It's good for Greeks, but not for non-Greeks."
College Sophomore,1,"Notorious for being one of the worst in the country. Officers are demeaning, known for embellishing police reports, and constantly out to get underage students. Typically put ears against doors to hear incriminating word (ie. ""beer"") before knocking and entering to make multiple arrests or issue multiple citations. Ranked 1406-1406 on this site for good reason. FAIR WARNING"
College Sophomore,1,"I continue to search for financial aid as my mother is a single parent, but haven't received any outside help. She is depleting her retirement fund to put me through college."
College Freshman,1,"I have gotten NO HELP WHATSOEVER. Many people say its because i am undeclared but yet i am on the Deans List and still nothing, zip, zero, zilch. Ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid process is terrible, I have yet to receive what I need and am constantly struggling every day trying to afford for school. I just don't get it."
College Sophomore,1,I did not get any help paying for college. 
College Freshman,1,"I would rather live in an on-campus apartment. My dorm could get really nasty some days. I feel like there are too many students in one dorm, which could get really frustrating while waiting on elevators. Some residents are really rude and loud. Also, the community bathrooms is always a big problem for me."
College Sophomore,1,"I think the campus police are pretty strict. I had a few friends get drinking tickets and they were not even breathalyzed, and had not been drinking. They just came out of a house that had a party and were stopped questioned and ticketed. They were also lied too. I understand they want to do their jobs and underage drinking is illegal. I believe if you are drinking and are under 21 you should get a ticket, but ticketing without having proof is wrong."
College Senior,1,"normal and bloomington police department are always looking to bust students than keeping the town safe. The police will roam around dorm hallways, once I was walking in my towel  from the bathroom and I was face to face with an officer aimlessly looking for people drinking in their dorm rooms. Raiding parties, undercovers, etc all in effect. Even in the bars, they will double card anyone they want to. The fines for first time offences are a nightmare, they contact the university and you have to pay additional fines, meet with the CRR, and take additional online classes, write papers, etc. Even for big weeks on campus, the school will send newsletters home and not allow guests in the dorms. Every night we have to check in our school ids and keys and for anyone we have stay the night has to also wait in line to get their picture taken. I just want to go to bed damn it!"
College Junior,1,"Sports not that popular because not good.Wish more school spirit, and tailgating."
College Sophomore,1,"It is usually very nice, but the wind on campus is horrible. Especially right by Watterson Towers because they are so tall."
College Senior,1,"When I applied to the Psychology program, I was not able to be admitted due to having more than 75 credits.  It was like I was overqualified. I would have still had to take about the same amount of credits as I will for my ""new"" major, so it's not like they'll be losing any money. It was a frustrating experience."
College Freshman,1,Police are pretty strict here. They will not hesitate to write you a ticket. If you are caught you must complete classes and essays. Even after doing that the ticket stays up your periment record. If you are going to become a teacher you can't get your degree with a drinking ticket.
College Freshman,1,Everyone here at ISU drinks on  a regular basis. It is very hard to go out without finding a bunch of drunk students acting up.
College Sophomore,1,So Far Not Good – I'm a graduate student and so grants aren't possible.  We need graduate assistantships to help us pay tuition.  I have applied to all I qualify for 6 months and still don't have one.  I have noticed if you are from out of country or minority group you have a better chance.
College Senior,1,"Not Much Color – There are not many minorities at ISU and we need more and those minorities need to be reached out to by the school because they do need direction and help financially, they need educational assistance."
College Senior,1,The school is primarily white. Posters and flyers try and make it seem like we're a very diverse school but it really is not at all.
College Freshman,1,"My parents are divorced and remarried to other people, but the financial aid at Illinois State is based on the household income. My step dad makes significantly more than my mother, but is not responsible for paying for any of my college tuition. Because of this, I was not able to receive financial aid since the household income is above $50000 a year. My mother and father split my college expenses, but many times my father is late on payments, making my mother have to pay all at once. This causes huge financial difficulty for my family."
College Freshman,1,"Predominantly White – Illinois State is a mostly white school, so they lose students who are looking for more diversity. Because of this, students do not get the opportunity to experience many new cultures and backgrounds."
College Freshman,1,"Police Hunt for Violations – The law enforcement here at ISU can really screw you over if your ever wind up getting caught even doing something remotely wrong.  The police usually try and hunt for students who may possibly violate any of the school policies.  Personally I would say that the strictness is over emphasized by police here at ISU, and sometimes winds up hurting more students than actually helping."
College Freshman,1,"Personally, I don't like fraternities or sororities. I think that they're all about partying, drinking, getting wasted, and having one night stands. I hear about it and see this happen all the time during the weekend. It disgusts me because there's just too much going on and being in college is more about the academics, not about partying. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to party too, but there are limits. I like to have fun too and I think having a great time is a part of the college experience, but I know there are other ways to have fun without underage drinking, the chaotic Rush week, and being consumed in the Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,"Oh D-D-D-Dear – Well this is something to hide from one's parents. Underage drinking is a huge issue on campus, and most people have gotten a drinking ticket who drank illegally here. Marijuana is another drug that has a pretty large influence in the campus and some people even smoke it in the residence halls where there is very little ventilation. The cops are really trying to crack down on it though."
College Freshman,1,only 10% of students are involved in greek life.  Greeks think it is a huge thing and look down and the majority that does not rush/pledge.  Houses and living-in is available for people who want to rush
College Freshman,1,VERY BAD. not enough spots.  If you are a freshman don't event think about bringing a car.  Fines are about 100 bucks and cops check the meters and spots religiously.
College Freshman,1,"Inconsistent and Windy – The weather here seems to change on daily basis, regardless of season. One day it could be sixty degrees and sunny, the next day it could be snowing. Another issue is the wind. Illinois State is by far the windiest place that I have ever visited, even more so than Chicago. This leads to miserably cold winters and dry summers. The weather is certainly one of my least favorite aspects of ISU."
College Sophomore,1,General Campus Aesthetics Are Below Average – Illinois State University has such great potential to look fantastic. They most definitly have the space and basics to look beautiful. The biggest problem is upkeep. Aesthetic brick decor along the sidewalks have been falling apart and many buildings are in desperate need of repair. A lecture hall in the Center for Visual Arts has debris falling from the ceiling and ISU's solution is to stick a garbage can underneath the hole. THe tuition is way too high for there to be this many problems.
College Junior,1,"Strict but Not Effective – Yes, they are strict but there are many crime alerts that happened around campus. Just this year, I got about 10 e mails on crime alerts. It can be dangerous. Don't walk alone especially late at night."
College Freshman,1,O Boy! Police! Normal police officers absolutely hate you if you are anywhere from 14 to 26 years of age. Drinking tickets are handed out very frequently.
College Senior,1,"Landlords at the Major Realty Companies Suck – The landlords only care about money and don't treat students like real tenants. They make ridiculous accusations and charge for random things like a burnt out lightbulb. If at all possible, don't rent from one of them."
College Sophomore,1,"Winters Suck – The winter is always freezing since this is the midwest. It lasts from about November to March, but after that it starts to get warm again."
College Junior,1,"There are some streets that allow for free parking, but they fill up quickly. You can park on meters but they get checked often and you will get a ticket if you let the time run out."
Recent Alumnus,1,Landlords Are Difficult – You need to stay away from certain landlords like Young America and Redbird realty. They honestly suck!
College Senior,1,"Not diverse at all – While most ISU students are open-minded, the fact is like 95% or more are from either the suburbs of Chicago or rural Illinois.  There are some student organizations promoting different types of diversity, but overall it's just incredibly homogenous."
College Senior,1,"Coming from Chicago, I thought I could handle cold.  Especially given that ISU is 100 miles south of the city.  However, on the plains the wind is just 30MPH all the time.  The wind chill is frequently in the -10 range in the winter.  The worst I've seen is -38 wind chill.  The winters are harsh from late October-early March.  It gets pretty ok for like a month in the spring before getting brutally hot. Overall this might be the worst climate on the planet."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking officials are always out and if you are parked on the street longer than 24 hours, you WILL get ticketed. Tickets are $20 and gets turned over to the university if you don't pay it."
College Senior,1,"Dorm Had Cockroaches – I only lived on campus for one year because I had the worst experience. We lived near the garbage room and got cockroaches. I was freaked out and didn't want to live there anymore. Most of the perks were good, but that experience ruined it for me."
College Freshman,1,"Only Bars – There are only bars for people who are 21 or older. There are a lot of house parties, but you always suffer the consequence of getting caught and getting a ticket. The underage drinking tickets are $250 and you have to attend an alcohol abuse class. There isn't that much to do that doesn't include alcohol on or off campus."
College Freshman,1,"Drinking Tickets Are $250 – If you are caught with a beer in you hand and you are underage. You get a drinking ticket for $250. The police are very strict and are always looking to break up the fun, even if you are not bother anybody else."

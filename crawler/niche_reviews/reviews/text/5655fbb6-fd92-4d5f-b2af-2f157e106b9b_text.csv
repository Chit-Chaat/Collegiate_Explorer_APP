Sophomore,5,Thus far the online platform has been very well laid out. I think that it relies on how the professor takes to online courses. My professors have done such a fantastic job and did a great job of communicating with me when I was lost.
Sophomore,5,"This university is fantastic and has all the marketing tools  for students to utilize and the education is solid. I was lead to expect from college. My only complaint is that it is quite an expensive place. I know  it will be worth the price one day though, when I get my bachelors degree in hand."
Sophomore,5,"Michigan Tech is a school where everyone helps everyone else. You don't even have to ask for additional resources; faculty and students alike are always sharing ways to make school less stressful. Join a club or seven, and you'll have so many study buddies. The surrounding area is gorgeous, especially if you like hiking, fishing, winter sports, and anything else outdoors!"
Sophomore,5,"Nobody was prepared to switch to online courses due to the pandemic, but Michigan Tech did everything in their power to help their students succeed. It was challenging but they still offered online learning centers and support programs for free. As well, the professors were understanding and adapted quickly to the new change of teaching. I am not fond of online learning but Michigan Tech was able to keep me grasped and still ended with good grades."
Sophomore,5,"Michigan Technological University is by far the best choice that I made going into college. It is really far from home but everyone is in the same boat as you traveling 9+ hours to get to college. There are 200+ clubs on campus to choose from all welcoming and and up feeling like a true family. The education system is challenging and pushes its student to the next level. The staff and faculty care deeply for the students at Michigan Tech and are always there to point you in the right direction. The resources that are appointed to the students while attending are incredible, they want to see you succeed in college and your future. Lastly, you're never bored the campus is one of a kind and there is always something to do on the weekends."
Junior,5,The professors were very helpful and understanding with the transition to online learning. Canvas was well formatted during the online time.
Junior,5,Michigan Tech has a wonderful community with unique and fun opportunities.  The campus is very welcoming and easy to maneuver.
Junior,5,"Michigan Tech is an amazing college! It is located in a beautiful little historic town called Houghton. The college itself has a ""small town"" feel to it but has an excellent education program! Michigan Tech is not just a college for engineers so don't let that scare you away! The people here are super friendly and there are endless activities that you can do outside! I love this college!"
Freshman,5,The atmosphere at Michigan Tech is amazing. Everyone is helpful and friendly. It is one big family. The area is amazing too. There is so much to do and so much beauty. I saw the northern lights my fifth night on campus!
Junior,5,It has a small-town atmosphere and offers a great variety of outdoor activities. The locals are all friendly and the campus feels safe.
Freshman,5,"I love Michigan Tech. I love the area, it is gorgeous. I love that the school is not too big but also not too small. I feel that I get the right amount of attention on my education and life from the staff and professors. The classes are tough but the job placement is great in the end. A degree from Michigan Tech is an amazing thing to have."
Junior,5,This is a fantastic school for engineering. The courses and instructors do a fantastic job at preparing students for careers and professional employment. The town of Houghton is a great place to live!
Sophomore,5,"I love Michigan Tech! I have transferred twice already but once I got to Michigan Tech it felt like home. There is quite nothing like it, it is absolutely beautiful up here. Winter carnival is a must to attend!"
Niche User,5,"Michigan Tech has a beautiful campus located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. On my visit I was immediately impressed. They have a wide variety of opportunities, including study abroad programs and internships."
Niche User,5,"I'm currently looking at Michigan Tech as a high school senior. As of now, Michigan Tech seems like a great school. All of their staff members that have connected to have been super helpful. From their regional advisor to their civil engineer professor, they both have been great. They have either guided me in the right direction when I needed help and have given me great advice."
Junior,5,Small little community fill with people that are friendly and can relate to you. They have amazing engineering programs and have the tools to help you learn it. For the chemical engineering program they have a small chemical plant at the school for you to learn from
Sophomore,5,"I love the programs offered at the school. Granted, it's not an easy school and it's not for everyone but I love a good challenge. The classes aren't anything to sleep on. As a student, you're constantly being pushed to to better. But, if you are struggling to keep up there are so many opportunities for help. You just have to ask!"
Freshman,5,The community here is welcoming and full of students who are always looking out for each other. The professors are eager to teach and help out those who seek more help.
Alum,5,"Great school, great environment and great people. Got a lot of research experience which then helped me land a job when I graduated."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. The culture that surrounds it is amazing, with everyone looking out for each other. Probably because most of us have moved from at least a few hours away to attend. The school spirit is strong, and the academics and clubs all work together to make a great college experience."
Niche User,5,An amazing place with lots to do and many many people to meet. its one of the most active places in the UP and very well deserves every star I have given it
Niche User,5,I like how the campus is small and everyone is well involved within the clubs and organizations. It is also a well known engineering college that is acknowledged by major companies and the college provides multiple opportunities to get internships with these companies.
Freshman,5,"I love that Michigan Technological School is located in such a beautiful area of Michigan. The staff is great to answer all questions and there is always a place to relax, hike, swim or ski on the weekends. It truly is the best of both worlds to go to college at."
Junior,5,"I love being here! They provide so many more opportunities than I expected. Because of their support, I am able to go on co-op and study abroad, and come back to exactly where I left off!"
Junior,5,"Michigan Tech is an incredible school located in the Keweenaw Peninsula, that focuses on STEM mostly, but has great programs in humanities and business as well. Tech is beautiful 100% of the year, and all the students are incredibly happy to be here (except maybe the week before final exams). The faculty is interested and eager to interact with students and help them succeed, in the classroom and outside with internships, co-ops, or full time jobs. Residential Life is definitely one of the highlights of this University, with the great integration of public safety into that."
Alum,5,"Michigan Tech is a fun and challenging school surrounded by the incredible Keweenaw Peninsula. You can earn a highly respected degree and enjoy fishing, snowmobiling, world class mountain biking, countless waterfalls, and the locally famous Jampot. In addition, the annual Winter Carnival in unique all its own with snow statues that require scaffolding they are so big!"
Sophomore,5,"Northern Michigan is absolutely beautiful.  If you enjoy all the seasons, mainly winter, you will love it here.  There are many trails for hiking, biking, and running.  Beautiful waterways for boating, fishing, and kayaking.  Free downhill skiing at Mt. Ripley across from campus or north at Mr. Bohemia.  The college is academically excellent with top professors and employment opportunities."
Junior,5,Fantastic community and great school. I would recommend this school to anyone looking to further their education in a STEM field.
Sophomore,5,The education system is a challenging curriculum that forces students to be proactive and learn. The opportunities for involvement and entertainment are also abundant.
Junior,5,"Michigan tech is a great school, once you get into your major classes the professors are so much better. The small campus is a huge plus with the good student facility ratio. Many different clubs are also available. The only true downside in my mind is housing and dining services. Housing isn't too bad just expensive to live in the dorms, but dining services is terrible, the workers are nice enough but the food sucks and they arent consistent with anything. Just get off campus ASAP and youll be fine."
Sophomore,5,"Great School. Wonderful people, small, yet friendly college town. Professors are excellent, and the campus is beautiful."
Senior,5,"Michigan Tech is a beautiful, welcoming place where everyone is welcome! There is an overwhelming sense of community to be found by anyone from any background, and academics are challenging and prepare you for anything you may want to pursue after college. The atmosphere and school spirit are always lively, and it's an overall great place to be."
Senior,5,The resources available are sufficient for a top ranked university. The classes are organized well and help with experience and not just in classroom learning. There are also many amenities to make use.
Freshman,5,"Michigan Tech is an amazing school with an amazing staff. If you ever end up going, you must go see a hockey game in the Student Development Complex."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Michigan Tech so far has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. It is no doubt very tough academic wise, but all of the people who come together to help one another is just amazing. At Michigan Tech, we are all part of a community that seeks to provide nothing but the best to each and every one."
Niche User,5,"I will be attending in the fall. The smiling faces from the staff to students create a welcoming environment that all want to be a part of. The academics are outstanding. Which made me want to go to the university. The challenging curriculum allows each student to have one thing in common, and the support for the challenging curriculum is fantastic. Overall, clean campus and beautiful location."
Niche User,5,"The reason I like Michigan Tech is because of its engineering program and location. The school is in the Keweenaw Peninsula in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I love the long winters, the small campus, and the outdoors are being 2 miles outside of town. There are many lakes around as many forests that surround the campus. In addition, the sports are D2 and are very competitive, making it fun to watch. Although, hockey is D1 and is actually more entertaining. Outside of school and sports, the school is also known for winter carnival and broom ball. Being at winter carnival is very unique with the different snow sculptures and events."
Freshman,5,Michigan Tech has a very friendly atmosphere that is generally welcoming to everyone.  I would recommend to any engineering or science majors.
Freshman,5,I am a member of the Husky pep band and wind symphony.  The teachers really care about students success and go out of their way to help.  I’m so glad I chose MTU!
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Michigan Tech! I was there from 2007-2011, learned a ton and met my wife there as well!"
Freshman,5,"MTU is full of places to experience nature from the river to the hiking trail. The students here are passionate about learning and diving deeper into engineering.  I have made many friends, and my teachers are frequently very lovely. The grad students seem to know what is go on when they teach the classes, and my dorm ""Summit"" is full of energy."
Junior,5,My experience so far at Michigan Tech has been awesome! All of the things to do and explore outside is outstanding.  The people and teachers at Tech are so nice and welcoming.  Have met some of my best friends there.  Great place to go to school and experience.
Freshman,5,"Great school!  You live in beautiful landscapes, that offer adventure and serenity.  The college faculty and students go out of their way to help support you for success; while keeping the courses challenging so you can keep expanding academically.  There are also all kinds of groups to join and things to do on campus for networking, fun, greek life, outdoor ventures, honor societies, and anything you can imagine.  (Food plans are great, too!)"
Sophomore,5,"My favorite thing about Michigan Technological University is its location. Being in the U.P., there are tons of outdoor recreation possibilities. The skiing is great, the biking is awesome, the hiking is superb, and the scenery is wonderful. Great to be away from big cities. The classes are challenging, and some of the professors are fantastic."
Senior,5,"1st - BEAUTIFUL campus/area, 2nd - professors that genuinely care about students success in life, classes and personal. 3rd - great opportunity to explore your interests in academia, lots of research in each aspect of study."
Alum,5,Michigan Tech is the best school I could have picked.  Went to Michigan for grad and felt Tech was a better engineering school overall.
Freshman,5,"In my opinion, Michigan Tech is an amazing school. My first year there I thought it would be difficult for me to settle in, but in just a week I found myself enjoying it. The food was always good and there was a lot of variety. Classes weren’t easy but my professors helped and made sure that I understood the material. The campus was a bit small but that made it easy to walk to classes every day. If you don’t mind the cold too much I would recommend this college to anyone pursuing an engineering degree."
Alum,5,"I spent more than 7 years here as an undergraduate and then a graduate student, and badly miss MTU, the area, the people, and the love and attention given to education and research.  If you are looking to major in psychology or accounting you are best going elsewhere, but there is nowhere better to become an engineer.  You will learn from the best; you will be worked hard; you meet, struggle alongside, and drink beer with great people; and you will become the better technical professional for it.  100% job placement for classmates in my undergraduate degree program speaks for itself, and I signed a letter of employment about 4 months before finishing my PhD.  Go Huskies!"
Freshman,5,from just the small amount of time being here I have had a blast up at Tech!  the classes can be challenging and I'm sure they just get harder but there are tons of ways to get help. the many learning centers or the study groups help a lot. there really is not anything that i wold change about campus. its a decent size and there is tons of groups or enterprises top get involved in. just in my first two semesters I have learned so much . the campus is within walking distance from a nice small town and there is  lots of nice yoopers up at tech. it is a very nice and safe campus.
Freshman,5,"Michigan Tech has been a great experience so far. At first, I thought that coming to college and moving out of my parents house for the first time would be intimidating and scary, but the Tech experience really welcomed me. They start off by having all first year students come a week ahead of all other students, and then they pair you up with a group of your major and have tons of activities planned. This was a great way for me to meet new people and become comfortable at this school before any classes even started. After Orientation week, the big school with new people became less daunting and I've grown to love every bit of it!"
Freshman,5,Michigan Tech is able to give me the University degree in a small town. MTU is located in a beautiful area that allows me to enjoy the outdoors while also obtaining a first rate engineering degree.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the atmosphere the staff and administration create at Michigan Tech, any professor that I've come in contact with has been very helpful and willing to work you through any problems you may be having with the course they're teaching. The campus is small and easy to navigate, once you know your way around things will be a breeze."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere of Michigan Tech is definitely one of the best parts. Everyone has a goal in mind and wants to succeed not only in college but in life.
Freshman,5,"I love Michigan Tech and I am proud to be a Husky. I am currently a first-year student here, therefore I have yet to experience the massive amount of snow this school gets, yet I am confident that I am attending the right school for me. This place already feels like home, I love that such a high ranking school can be located in such a small and beautiful town."
Freshman,5,"I love how easy it is to apply for scholarships. This website is saving me hundreds of hours. I appreciate the time the creators put into this to make it the best possible experience for customers. I hope that I can receive a scholarship for my academic awards, but I will find out soon. To improve, I would add a quick apply menu so students can just press apply to multiple scholarships and it does it automatically. "
Alum,5,"I had an amazing time here. The school is very isolated and that can be tough. If you are willing to embrace the winters, outdoor activities, and the intense school work, you will have a great experience. MTU is a winter wonderland. Every winter out door activity is at your finger tips. Hockey, down hill skiing, xc skiing, snowshoeing. I never did most of those before Tech, but I got the opportunity to at tech. I continue to do most of those to this day! The summers are second to none. MTU also has world class mountain biking (see copper harbor too). KBC is world class beer! I didn't know how good I had it up there until I moved to other parts of the country. As I mentioned before, the school work is intense. It takes a crazy/smart person to survive at tech.  Right out of college, I made $50k. 8 years out, I make $90k. My civil engineering degree has given me the opportunity to live and work all over the country. MI, LA, FL, PA. My job also requires me to travel all over the country!"
College Sophomore,5,You can't go wrong with a degree from MTU. Companies go after MTU engineers over UofM engineers (I actually spoke to a recruiter about this) and you WILL get a great paying job from attending this amazing school.
College Sophomore,5,"All of the greek life is amazing. Everyone works together and campus organizations are usually run by or have an overwhelming greek population. They are not cliquey, just fun."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel that everything I have learned here will help me be the best engineer I can be. Although very difficult, the courses are very interesting and I can see the need for them in the real world. There are endless opportunities at MTU for success, in both the job market and in different courses."
College Freshman,5,"We have career fairs twice a year on campus and over 500+ companies send representatives and hold interviews with students. Including companies like: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, etc.!"
Senior,4,Michigan Tech offers a very challenging and amazing college experience. The campus is located in a rural town called Houghton. There are plenty of outdoor activities to do year round. Tech offers a wide variety of tutors and helping centers for students who need extra help. The professors are very friendly and helpful.
Senior,4,"Michigan Tech is an amazing university located in Houghton, MI. It may be a 9.5 hour drive, but it is surrounded by Porcupine Mountains and The Keweenaw Peninsula. Tech operates ski hill, golf course and even bike trails. In the winter, frozen natural sites are even more amazing. 

Michigan Tech's orientation program takes place one week before the start of the semester, which seems very logical for being located in such a remote place. 

As for classes, especially for engineering courses, some may be challenging. The faculty and other students all share information and resources to make them easier. However, you must make time to learn and lots of hard work to improve."
Sophomore,4,"I took one class online. My professor mostly used Michigan Tech's online learning platform for course materials, which really helped because most courses use it. Navigating wasn't at all difficult."
Freshman,4,"I am challenged and engaged in my classes. Some professors care more than others, but most are easily approachable."
Freshman,4,I love this school. It is small enough but not too small to not meet new people. I think some of the professors don't want to teacher they just want to be here for research though.
Freshman,4,"The staff at Michigan Tech truly care about the students’ success during their time at Tech. They may challenge us to our breaking points, but there are multiple resources on campus to handle the pressure. They do there best to make Tech your second home since majority of the students come from places that are hours away."
Freshman,4,It really is a home like feeling and the education is fantastic and gives great return in the future
Sophomore,4,I love the classes and professors. The dining hall food is not very good. It is a great place with many opportunities for internships and jobs. Career fair is held twice a year giving students a lot of exposure to what industry's are looking for with I terms and hiring employees.
Junior,4,The teachers are really good at their job most of the time and as you move up in your program the class sizes get smaller and smaller. Most of the time I feel like I could create a real bond with my professor. The only complaints I have is the dining hall food and the lack of good food to buy around campus.
Freshman,4,"I love the sense of community present on campus.  I enjoy the resources available for use. Classes are straightforward and enjoyable. Options and opportunities are vast, allowing for freedom of expression."
Freshman,4,"So far my time at Michigan Tech has been great! Everything is very well thought out. For example, we don't have orientation during the summer. Instead, all freshmen come to school and attend an orientation a week before classes start. This makes sense for a lot of reasons: you're able to remember people and places better, you don't have to come up here in the summer, and you'll be able to hit the ground running. 

Further, the outdoor area surrounding Tech is superb. Tech operates its own ski hill (Mt Ripley), golf course, and bike trails. In the warmer months, you can swim at Prince's Point. As the fall comes, the trees look incredible. And in the winter you can climb a frozen waterfall if you want. You can even see the Milky Way at Brockway Mountain, and if you're lucky, the Aurora Borealis!

One last thing: We get a lot of snow here, so keep that in mind. However, the buildings are very close together and some are connected."
Senior,4,"MTU is overall a great school, it's a lot of hard work to succeed but its full of wonderful people, and its located in the beautiful keeweenaw peninsula. There's all sorts of opportunities to join clubs for whatever you may be interested in, everything from cooking to robotics and video gaming, to medieval role playing sports, MTU has it all. The only downfalls of MTU are the price, its a very expensive school to attend, and the fact that due to how jam packed the major audits are, it is very difficult to get a four year degree in four years without taking 18+ credit semesters every semester."
Junior,4,"At MTU there are struggles about getting to classes through the snow and the pressure of midterms and finals. However, these are worth the experience that is gained through the institution, with professors invested in your growth and so many clubs to join MTU sets students up for future success."
Junior,4,"If you're looking for a smaller campus with a bit more interaction with your professors, Tech is the place to go. Most of them are also very good at connecting with the students as well."
Sophomore,4,"I like how engaging the school is in terms of classes. It was very easy for me here to begin a research career, and have gotten to know the faculty of my respective department quite well in a surprisingly fast time. I would like to see the college invest more into the community, perhaps. It is a harsh winter this far North, and I would also like to see more addressed to that, perhaps."
Niche User,4,"Tech feels like home to me. The faculty members are masters of their craft, the campus and surrounding region is ethereal, and the students are individuals with tact, grit, and of course, tenacity."
Junior,4,"MTU is an awesome place to go to college! They challenge you in so many ways, and the area is a beautiful area with a lot of outdoor experiences that widen your college experience."
Sophomore,4,"As a female I received the best of care, welcoming mugs and food and clothes, this school has a low female:male ratio but I was on the benefiting side so I don't mind at all."
Senior,4,"I love attending Michigan Tech, the are in Houghton is amazing and there is a lot of hiking, exploring, and water sports that I can take part in being right off the Portage. Being an engineering school, it has so many opportunities to be creative, not only in class, but also in events with friends and dorm halls like the cardboard boat races for example. There are only two things that I wish I could change about Michigan Tech is the Diversity and the parking. I'm used to a very diverse group of people from where I grew up and its kind of weird moving to a place that doesn't have that. The parking is also a bit of a pain, being that a majority of the parking for residents and for commuters is up a huge hill and there simply just is not enough room for all the students in a day."
Junior,4,"I have found that the staff members at Michigan Tech are exceptional! They are wonderful people who only want to see you succeed. Granted, it is not an easy school to succeed it, it tests your ability to be tenacious. I do believe that the weather up there makes it even harder to get through the school year, but I do enjoy going skiing and snowboarding on our ski hill every once in a while. I think that some of the classrooms and building could use some updating. But we have a great education and community and what more could you ask for?"
Junior,4,"Michigan Tech is an outstanding school for people interested in engineering, forestry, or any other major you're interested in. It's hard. It's far away. It's definitely cold at times. But the location, professors, large greek life, smaller class sizes and fantastic community all outweigh everything listed prior. I would recommended it to anyone!"
Senior,4,"There are many things at Tech that make you feel welcomed. The professors actually care about your learning and encourage you to go to their office hours. The work load can be a bit much at times, but most professors are understanding."
Alum,4,"It's a big engineering school, so being a psych major made me feel as though I wasn't getting quite as many opportunities as possible. Nevertheless, the classes were good preparation for grad school and there were a lot of research opportunities."
Junior,4,"Great area, very respectable university. The upper peninsula is a great place to live as there is tons of stuff to see and do. Everyone at the university seems to accept each other which makes it very easy to get up and go to class each day."
Freshman,4,Michigan Tech is a great University with high quality education. It is located in a beautiful town called Houghton that has many places to enjoy nature.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see some change in athletics. How coaches treat people when they want to go for Co-ops and also, a change with the health insurance."
Alum,4,"If you can handle the snow, it's a great school to learn independence and really be involved in cutting edge technology programs. There isn't a lot around the school unless you like outdoors activities but the culture and environment in the school is just fantastic!"
Junior,4,"Michigan Tech is a fantastic school. While the local life may not be as bustling as other colleges, the picturesque area and fantastic teachers more than make up for it. The learning environment is truly unique. While other schools tend to have more memorization than anything else, at tech they teach you how to problem solve so that in the end you can work your way through anything that is thrown at you. In addition to the in-class problem solving, you are also presented with hands-on experience. From the clubs, labs, learning centers, volunteer opportunities, and recruiters on campus, you are guaranteed to be able to walk away with the ability to get a job anywhere, that is if you don't have one already."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Michigan Technological University has been very good so far. I like the small city life, and the university is close to many outdoor activities that you choose. The academics are hard however, but if you do your homework you will be fine. Overall, a very good experience so far."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the course rigor and how well it prepares me for a career in my field; the faculty is very inclined to help and they genuinely want you to succeed. I'm not exactly thrilled on how much time and energy you have to dedicate in order to excel, but I'm sure it pays off in the end. I will say the on campus dining services are extremely sub par. I also am not a huge fan of the lack of clear skies for weeks on end; however, the abundance of awesome outdoor activities is a huge plus. The people, students and locals, are also generally very nice and fun to be around."
Sophomore,4,"Michigan Tech has been an overall positive educational experience. It is a relatively small campus so it is a close community and there is a lot of help involved for students on campus(learning center).  Courses here are very rigorous and prepare students for exams and intense work loads and time management. There are a lot of student organizations as well. The one I joined is the outdoor venture club where we go explore different nature places in the upper peninsula. Another unique aspect is the fact Tech has a ski hill that students can go to during the winter. I learned how to ski by going there which is a skill I can carry for life.  Overall, it has been a great experience here at Michigan tech. I have learned many new skills and have made many great friends for life."
Freshman,4,"I was a first year student at Michigan Technological University from 2016-2017. There are very many student groups to be involved in and very many places to visit on and near campus. The academic rigor is high, but there are very many resources for success. I recommend that the school would do more to enforce no under aged drinking and to emphasize greater the results of the studies done on drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and sex before marriage."
Senior,4,"My experience at Michigan Tech is next to impossible to sum up in a short explanation but I will do my best. This school and the people I have met here have made me who I am today. It has shaped me, molded me, into an individual who is capable of thinking on my own and has given me skills that I can take with me to whatever will be the next step in my life. Michigan Tech and all of the experiences that  came from going to school here have been a pivotal time moment. I now have the chance to follow my dreams."
Sophomore,4,"Michigan Tech as an institution boasts some of the best engineering programs in the nation, with high-quality facilities and experienced faculty and staff. Because of this quality, the coursework becomes proportionately more difficult; but by graduation, you'll have enough experience and resources to make applying these subjects to a real-world position a cakewalk. The biggest downsides are probably cost of attendance for out-of-state students without scholarships; the dorm living conditions during years of high attendance; actual versus expected length of education; and the fact that not every professor that you'll run across is going to be a gem. Michigan Tech as a whole is a quality university that makes a conscious effort to prepare future graduates with the information and skills that they need to leverage their degree in the job market to great success. The best way to learn how to take advantage of all that Tech has to offer is to come and find out for yourself."
Graduate Student,4,"Michigan Tech is a hub for nerdy, intelligent people who are passionate about science, and the outdoors.  It is also very far removed from neighboring cities, so you quickly become part of a community on campus."
Alum,4,"Michigan Tech is probably the best bang for your buck in all of Michigan. Their engineering programs are much more reasonably priced than their main competitors, with a good ROI rolling in immediately after graduation. The biggest downsides are the location, the campus life (you'll want to move off campus ASAP), and the professors. I don't believe professors being jerks is unique to Tech, but it's something you'll have to deal with at every engineering school."
Sophomore,4,"I have only spent a year at Michigan Tech, but I have found it to be quite enjoyable. The surrounding historic and natural sites only add to this. The campus itself is rather small, which I prefer. The faculty are mostly foreign, but they most all speak understandable English, which helps."
Junior,4,"Awesome school. Experience tech makes the tech experience amazing since it allows you into almost everything free of charge at the university. Great professors, and an over awesome overall environment. Extremely happy that I chose Tech over Michigan State."
Freshman,4,"I love Michigan Tech. It's a great time being a student here. If there is only one complaint it is that the academics are extremely grueling and professors do not have a problem with failing up to half of their class at times. That said, eventually, all the effort will definitely be worth it, and like I said before, this place is an absolute blast overall."
Niche User,4,"Faculty was all great, and most classes were relatively small, allowing for good communication between professor and student. Many resources were available, however the geography of the college can be challenging for some"
Junior,4,This school is amazing for anyone looking for a career in engineering or STEM related fields. There are amazing opportunities in research that are provided by the university! It may not be near a city but the natural scenery out here is beautiful!
Sophomore,4,"It's a very good academic school in the upper peninsula of Michigan. Sometimes there's not much to do if you dont like the outdoors, but Houghton is a beautiful place."
Freshman,4,It has many great majors and activities to offer. There are so many opportunities for growth and all of my professors are engaging or eager to help. The only change I wish is that there was more equal gender diversity.
Sophomore,4,"I liked how challenging it was, the opportunities available, and the job placement after college. I liked the clubs offered and found myself easy to fitting in. The courses at times are a bit too challenging for what's necessary. I also find having foreign professors, which is likely here, can be make or break."
Niche User,4,"Tech is an amazing engineering school. This place is a great investment for your future because once you graduate, you will seriously be hired. This place produces some amazing engineers in the middle of the upper peninsula. "
Junior,4,"I like Michigan Tech a lot. The community is very accepting, and people let you do your own thing. I never feel judged for my choices. The classes can be difficult but everyone is in it together, it does not feel like we are pitted against each other. "
College Sophomore,4,"The professor to student ratio is great.  I am able to ask questions easily during class and get the most out of my time in class.  The professors also hold office hours, which is helpful if I have a question or need help on homework."
College Sophomore,4,"Students that attend here, have a high acceptance rate in getting jobs and internships."
College Sophomore,4,I feel comfortable and safe walking to class by myself.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not prefer to participate in Greek life at my school, but there is houses for each fraternity and sorority.  Some houses need to be redone and painted, while others look great and taken care of."
College Sophomore,4,The most popular sport to watch is hockey at Michigan Tech.  The fan support for each game great.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is in a very interesting location.  There is the ability to participate in sports like broomball, snowboarding, and skiing, which are unusual at other universities.  Also, the student to professor ratio is great.  There is not too many students to one professor, so the classrooms are more involved."
College Sophomore,4,"If people want to do drugs, they will. There are little to no hard drugs on campus, but alcohol and weed are definitely abundant, as they are on any campus. The school does a great job making sure we are safe, but students will still do it in private."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are very helpful and willing to do whatever they can to help. Students just need to be smart enough to actually use these resources. I have only had one professor that was awful, but he is known to be a bad professor, you always know of the professors to avoid by talking to other students, a majority of them are great professors, though."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a school that has a majority male population, I have never felt more safe. I walk around campus (going to the library, home, or to a friends house) alone at night rather often and have felt more safe and relaxed when doing so than anything else. Granted, there are a few individuals (all males) I know of that have sexually assaulted females, the number of people that are extremely against it is high and campus is very helpful with changing your schedule, housing, or getting therapy for you if you are a victim."
College Sophomore,4,"The SDC has great opportunities, including a full pool, a shooting range, a rock climbing wall and endless opportunities to play sports and take classes."
College Freshman,4,Police officers are always available to help you walk to/from class and generally all of the students are well behaved!
College Freshman,4,The hockey is where it is at! Football = Highscool
College Sophomore,4,"There was a recent post of a ""joke shooting threat"" someone did on social media, the university with local law enforcement took care of the situation quickly and properly."
College Sophomore,4,I like the hands-on approach that most classes have. It's so cool to be around cutting edge research.
Senior,2,"The academics are average, the professors are average, the  lectures are decent. One good thing about the electrical engineering program is having a lab for most core classes, giving you a technical advantage over other grads.  Also, this school does the traditional senior design project in your senior year, but also has Enterprise programs and some (not enough) of undergrad research opportunities to get some lab experience. 
THE PROBLEMS are that the school is in the middle of nowhere, Houghton, MI and that the school is small. This means you have very little access to co ops, internships, and networking. The nearest internship is over 400 miles away, so if you're parents aren't paying your way, good luck relocating. Most career fair employers are small Michigan companies, a lot of  LLCs, nothing to write home about. 
Other problems are: No girls, and people here are kind of weird; not in a good way. You're going to have to put your social life on hold for a few years up here."
Senior,2,"this is a highly demanding collage, the instructors are great but the overall workload is straining. If you graduate your odds of job placement are fairly good. If you graduate."
College Freshman,2,"Michigan Tech is a drinking school, not a partying school. Even though the campus is smoke and tobacco free, I see a lot of people still smoking. It is pretty bad by how many people use drugs on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors are often not there to teach.  They are required to teach while there to research.  This means many of the classes are boring and generic, and the homework and test are all graded by the TA, who is usually a foreign graduate student."
College Freshman,2,They stick some of the later applicants of the Freshmen class into 2 person rooms with 3 people and housing is not very nice to the residents.
College Freshman,2,"McNair's nickname isn't McNasty for no reason. There's almost no privacy with the showers, the rooms are too small, and they're constantly fixing the hot water. The hill makes McNair even worse. If you're living in a residence hall, you're overpaying for everything."
College Freshman,2,"It feels like I'm wasting money. If you aren't an engineer or in forestry, there is nothing for you."
College Freshman,2,I think this school is only helpful for engineering students. There is very little help for students. Teachers are either really great or unhelpful. I've had great teachers and some that are difficult for no discernible reason. The general education classes are pointless. Classes are made to be very hard and they seem to delight in having students struggle.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, you will probably only go off campus to eat very few times. The stuff downtown is within walking distance, but it's somewhat expensive. There are some chain restaurants by Walmart but you have to get there first and it gets repetitive going to Applebee's all the time for half off apps."
College Freshman,2,"Realistically, the dining hall food is probably just below average for a university. No dining hall is going to serve a five star meal every night. But our food can be pretty awful. A lot of times I end up just getting cereal and eating snacks back in my dorm. One thing that they do very well is gluten free options. They have a little kitchen in the side of the Wads Dining hall that any gluten allergy students are welcome to use to make their meals. Having a few friends with allergies, they say it has a really good selection."
College Student,2,Rent is crazy high because there are only a few landlords in town so there isn't much competition. The town itself is tiny so everything is decently close no matter where you live. Houses are old for the most part except for the apartments that are going up right now.
College Senior,2,There are no healthy options. The least healthy foods are always on sale.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There aren't a lot of places, and it's better to just not spend the money if you have a meal plan."
Recent Alumnus,2,A lot of Paper works...
College Freshman,2,It's pretty much just only Domino's and a couple local places.
College Freshman,2,Most of the frats and sororities are okay but one or two of them are generally hated by the everyone because they act like children. Their parties suck. No one really cares about the Greeks.
College Junior,2,"Simply put, it's really not that good at all......"
College Sophomore,2,Very few restaurants in the area
College Freshman,2,"Athletics are not a very big part of student life which is a little disappointing for someone being very into sports. The facilities are nice and open to student, but the only varsity that anyone sort of cares about is hockey."
College Freshman,2,The professors at Michigan Tech are very bad. Most of them are foreigners and can be very difficult to understand. Which can be extremely frustrating when you are trying to learn topics that are already hard enough with good teachers.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall food quality could be greatly improved, but the biggest issue is how early the halls close. For example, the major dining hall closes at 6pm, when most people begin to eat."
College Freshman,2,"The ratio of guys to girls isn't the greatest, although it is improving. There are a lot of girls that I am not interested in and every guy here is very aware of the ratio. "
Recent Alumnus,2,Financial aid is rare. Have to struggle at first
College Freshman,2,It usually tastes pretty bad and there aren't usually a lot of options. 
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know anything about the drugs on campus. At all. There's nothing as far as I'm aware. The drinking, however.... it happens. We sing ""No Beer."" Our school song says we can drink ALL OF FORTY BEERS. So drinking is a thing. But you never have to drink. Ever. No one will pressure you. If they do, they're assholes and not relevant."
College Sophomore,2,"Houghton housing prices are super cheap! And usually the houses aren't too bad. And Houghton in general isn't too big, so you're never too far from campus. Unless you move to Hancock in which case you'll want a car."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty average here. There are things to do, like Humans vs. Zombies! And the library is pretty good. When they're not trying to cram everyone into it. And the cafes on campus are cool."
College Sophomore,2,There are fast food restaurants. There are some nice places downtown. I'm not sure about discounts to students.
College Sophomore,2,"Classes are good and there's a lot of work, but it's just that: A lot of work. Some of the professors are hard to understand because of their accents but otherwise good."
College Sophomore,2,"Great weather in the summer/fall. Be prepared for 300+ inches of snow once January hits though. Classes WILL NOT be cancelled for any kind of weather, for dont get your hopes up. It's always at least slightly windy. Classes are within a 10minute walk of the dorms though, so there isn't really an excuse for classes to be cancelled."
College Senior,2,The student parking is too far from campus and in the winter that is really a problem for students.
College Freshman,2,"The sun hardly ever shines during the winter months, it snows everyday, but it snows everyday it depends on your perception."
College Freshman,2,permits cost a lot and parking lots are far from dorms
College Junior,2,"Terrible guy to girl ratio, about 3 to 1. Overall most people aren't too attractive but it is sort of to be expected in a technological school"
College Sophomore,2,Food is always readily available but the quality is rather low. The dining halls in general are great but the quality and variety of food is not the best.
College Freshman,2,Boys are average some are really hot and some are not.
College Sophomore,2,Nerdy Guys Stuck up Girls – Tech lacks women and the women we do have tend to be sorority sluts who think they're the most attractive thing since Jennifer Aniston...nice guys finish last here.
College Student,2,"There's a Ton of Snow – There are massive amounts of snow but plenty of stuff to do even when the weathers not so nice. Ski hills, snowmobiling, broomball, or if you prefer inside theres a lot inside too."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Safety is pretty strict on where you park. If you dont want a parking ticket, only park in your assigned lot unless its the weekend."
College Freshman,2,"The food is usually average as far as quality is concerned. However on the weekends there is only the main dining hall open, and they have very limited selections. Every weekend there is the same choice of mushy and soggy scrambled eggs and hashbrowns which are generally pretty terrible tasting."
Junior,1,Many of my professors couldn't figure out how to switch up their syllabus when COVID-19 hit.. They thought that they could get the same information and projects done over the internet which was very stressful.
Freshman,1,"There a lot to say about MTU. Snow starts in mid-OCT, and it goes to the end of April.  But you should have known that- The dorms are way backward. the food, give it a D.  The Faculties are there to do their research and do not care about Undergraduate. I left after 2 Quarters, back home and went to a 2 years college, where you can talk to your teacher after class and not be called. Then after 2 years, I went to V-Tech in Virginia, now I am in Graduate school. Make sure you are happy where you are."
Freshman,1,The professors  and university don't care about the students.  They accept you in to the school and then they don't help you succeed.  I have felt that the university only wants my tuition money and they could care less whether I am learning or succeeding in any way.
College Senior,1,Landlords are crooked because they have no competition. The prices are sky high because they can be.
College Senior,1,The workers are not helpful and they are crabby at the students. They blame students for their mistakes.
College Sophomore,1,It's remote and depression inducing.
College Freshman,1,Wait...there's a nightlife here? Winter Carnival is the bomb though.
College Freshman,1,The food is not good at all. I tend to order food from Jimmy Johns a lot just because i do not want to eat the dorm food.
College Freshman,1,"I already covered this in the last page, but the parking alone is enough to drive you to another school. "
Recent Alumnus,1,Too much Cold.. Snow storms during Winter.
College Sophomore,1,"A lot of labs are being replaced with ""wireless lounges"" and students are expected to use the library when they need certain programs. It's stupid."
College Sophomore,1,Lots are super far away. Like. Super far. Beware owning a car your first year.
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife doesn't quite exist at Michigan Tech during the weekdays because every student is preparing for the next day; ""Funtime"" ends around 8pm and essentially every student is asleep by 2am. Weekends are different though with some fun expected Friday and Saturday, but not much goes on because Michigan Tech is very much isolated from a metropolitan area, allowing few opportunities for having fun individually or a couple of friends. Most people just hit the bars for a few drinks with the majority of campus. Since the university population makes up a significant fraction of the city population, you can expect to mostly see other Michigan Tech students along with professors from time-to-time. The nightlife truly doesn't get really good unless there is some grand occasion like the week before classes in fall or Winter Carnival, an annual event where students stay up all-night with a huge on-campus party. 

You basically get only 1 day in the year for a spectacular nightlife party scene so I had to rate the nightlife a ""D-""."
College Sophomore,1,"An ""A"" would be given for a university in the south like University of Arizona or Southern Cal and a ""F"" for university up in Fairbanks, Alaska. 

That said, you should see that the weather conditions are going to evidently be tough for students who live in a mild climate (see below). You should expect to see it snow from early October until the first week of May!!!! The summer is truncated between late May/June until mid-August. It snows nearly everyday from November until late March so skies are constantly cloudy; the few days the skies are clear it is very cold. If you can handle or especially if you enjoy cold temperatures and snow, you will not have any problems. The quality of education generally outweighs the trouble of dealing with treacherous winter conditions. This, in fact, actually toughens students up and makes them more marketable in the workforce. Employers love the fact that these students show the perseverance in weathering such conditions day-in-and-day-out in going to classes.  

Mild Climate, in my opinion, refers to the following locations: West or South Europe, Midwest and Plains states south of Wisconsin, the South, or along the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines of the USA. Obviously, this also includes anybody from the Caribbean or equatorial regions."
College Senior,1,"While there are many students that need to park on campus, Tech does not do a good job of having parking spaces at a reasonable distance from campus.  All of the undergraduate parking is a 5-10 minute walk from the campus and it is up a large and steep hill that is hard to walk during the harsh winters."
College Sophomore,1,Lack an Efficient Bus System – Bus system is inefficient and costly per ride.  Definitely easier to purchase a bike or bum a ride.
College Junior,1,What Night Life? I live in a very very tiny town with an engineering campus that towers over the local population.  Night life is generally restricted to dorm rooms where 19 year old boys play world of warcraft.
College Junior,1,Eat at Home to Eat Healthy – This small town has a co-op that provides food other than the typical local fair of overpriced gfs grade microwavables.  My advice to anyone that moves here is to eat at home.
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible Food on Campus – The campus dining options are WAY overpriced. Dorm students are required to purchase an unlimited plan for the year at almost 2000 per semester (18 dollars a day!). The food quality is extremely low, and there isn't much variety. The cooks are friendly though, and they provide good service. In all, the dining services at Michigan Tech is awful"
College Junior,1,"In some of the buildings, certain floors don't have women's restrooms."

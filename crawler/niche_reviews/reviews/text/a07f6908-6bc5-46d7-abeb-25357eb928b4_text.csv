Freshman,5,"Oklahoma Christian University is such a great place to build relationships and be supported by everyone there while you are getting you education. All the faculty really care about you, your academics, and your personal life. Overall, OC is a very welcoming, supporting, and safe learning environment."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any online classes through Oklahoma Christian University, but I did love the set up of their website and how they give so many options to get my education."
Freshman,5,What I liked about Oklahoma Christian University is the campus life and their way of recruiting. I also got to experience an in person and online tour of the college.
Niche User,5,"It was an amazing college to tour, very friendly people. Kind and helpful staff. Very advanced labs."
Freshman,5,I have been welcomed and uplifted since day one. The professors are so encouraging and class sizes are perfect.  I get to connect with others and expand my personal relationship with God.  I am part of an extended family here and I am excited for my future!
Freshman,5,"Oklahoma Christian is a school where you can learn a lot about your faith and find people to help you get closer to God. It provides opportunities for students to strengthen their walk with God, get a degree, and find life time friends. It is a school that gives kids chances and connects them to their future. It is a very hands on school and the professors are very nice and understanding. The university is a great university. I recommend it to anyone looking to pursue a degree and get closer to God."
Freshman,5,Oklahoma Christian University is geared not only towards your education but your relationship with God.
Freshman,5,For me Oklahoma Christian has been home to me and it is filled with so many amazing people who are almost like a family. They way they love and support me has truly helped me through a lot and on top of that it is also very affordable and awards the most scholarships. The spiritual life is also a great thing about this school and I actually got baptized too by my friend that I met at thus school. Overall great place if you are looking for higher education and spiritual growth. OC is home!
Senior,5,The engineering program is challenging and focused in the appropriate areas.  The professors have both real life job experience and academic experience.  They also care deeply about the student and their futures.  Their caring translates into their commitment to the student and the graduate.
Sophomore,5,I really like how friendly everyone is. It feels just like home and all of the faculty love their jobs and helping students.
Freshman,5,An amazing University that is Christ-centered and caring.  The Faculty does everything in their power to help you and the fellow students are extremely nice!
Freshman,5,"As an upcoming freshmen, I cannot wait to enter enrollment this fall. So far, I have made many valuable connections on campus and I believe it is a great college for christian adults looking to gain a valuable perspective on future education. The campus is very pretty as well as progressive in development. The programs seem complete and valuable to students. I look forward to getting my degree."
Niche User,5,"OC is a place where they strive to make everyone who steps on campus feel at home, and I believe they really succeed at that"
Sophomore,5,I have been here for two years and love it. The professors invest in students and do everything to help them succeed. The campus life is wonderful and there are people in place to help with any need academic or otherwise.
Freshman,5,"I love Oklahoma Christian University. Everyone is super friendly and helpful, and makes it feel like home. It is difficult to get an on campus job. I would make that process easier on students if I was in charge of that."
Niche User,5,"Sooo fun!! The atmosphere in Edmond, can only be described as amazing. The campus, simply breathtaking with amazing pieces that share amazing stories."
Sophomore,5,I graduated with a Bachelors in Finance in the 90's. I'm now back for a second degree. The campus has grown. New buildings and degrees have been added. Professors are excellent!
Sophomore,5,"Oklahoma Christian is a fantastic school. Now I know people say that about their school regardless of the fact but serious. Here at Oklahoma Christian the teachers care about you. The are willing to meet you on campus and help you with whatever the case may be. If you are sick and have not been in class for several days they will come to your dorm room and check on you. They do not do this out of being upset or trying to get you into trouble. They just want to make sure you are doing okay. Also, during finals week they have a ton of study groups and the teachers are on campus until 8pm during finals week in case you might need them. Oklahoma Christian is truly an amazing college. They have may activities and social clubs that do tons of  community service projects, which is fantastic. This college is definitely something to check out or even schedule a visit."
Junior,5,"I decided to attend Oklahoma Christian University at the last minute, and it is a decision that I have never regretted. For a school whose motto is "" OC is home"", it really does feel like home. It is a loving environment where you are constantly surrounded by like-minded Christians who, for the most part, share similar beliefs. College is a time where you meet life long friends, and I believe that I have done that. The professors are also amazing. They care so deeply about their students, and desire to know them on a personal level, and that is such a wonderful thing. It helps you to feel at home at Oklahoma Christian."
Sophomore,5,OC is truly Home. I'm a Marketing Major and the business department is phenomenal! All of the professors are there to help you succeed in your school work but they are also there to see you grow in your faith. I have loved the experience I have had so far and I look forward to more!
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. While the Church Of Christ basis can be intimidating for a non-COC student, I have never felt personally attacked or excluded because of my different beliefs."
Niche User,5,I have lived across the street from OC my whole life and I'm excited to embark on my own journey on campus over the next four years.
Freshman,5,"This school really cares about the success of their students, the genuine love goes around and you can feel it!"
Sophomore,5,Oklahoma Christian is Home! I love that the campus is small. You feel like you belong to family rather than an University. The professors care about you and your success. I have always felt comfortable approaching professors with concerns and questions. Class sizes are perfect and the students are friendly.  Oklahoma Christian University has impacted my life with rich blessings of friendships and a great Christian atmosphere.
Freshman,5,I like the most about Oklahoma Christian is that everyone is nice and talk to you and all the professors were understood. And everyone says hi to ya and the safety around the campus was nice.
College Junior,5,"I'm a member of the the greatest Frat on campus, Delta Gamma Sigma, and we have tons of fun. I'd say the most fun part about OC's greek life is the intermurals. that's where friendships live and die."
College Student,5,I love OC because the campus is so alive and very God loving and you not only learn your major but also personal and life lessons/.
College Junior,5,"I just finished Sophomore year, and I already have an internship this summer. It is with Space Noodle Studios and I am excited to see where the future takes me!"
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus. The only thing that I do not feel safe about is the weather at times.
College Junior,5,"The school is probably most prestigious in the state of oklahoma in my degree, which is biology."
College Sophomore,5,"Whatever negative qualities some professors embody, the ones that embody ample good characteristics far outweigh the bad ones. It is just hard when you have such a small campus to get more than one professor in some areas."
College Sophomore,5,There are tons of students that have internships. OKC is just an opportune place to be--all the activities and work opportunities are fabulous. Workplaces love OC kids.
College Sophomore,5,"The dorm life is a huge part of students' lives. Partly because freshmen and sophomores live in gender-exclusive housing, it really fosters relationships that turn into best friendships your entire life."
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek life is different at OC. It is considered ""clubs"" instead of sororities and fraternities. These clubs are very focused on how much good they can bring to campus--they are social service clubs. Greek in name, but not greek in their cliches."
College Sophomore,5,"My school is unique in that if there are any complaints, there is always a positive outlook. No one ever complains to the point where they want to leave, because the good far outweighs the bad at OC. Where else can you have dinner with your school President, start a social service club, and have good relationships with your professors? At OC, your voice can be heard."
College Freshman,5,We have student classes to prevent sexual assault.
College Freshman,5,Christian environment and great professors.
College Freshman,5,Oklahoma Christian University invites students to pursue a greater education in an environment where your success is a priority of every faculty member and pursue a deeper relationship with God on a Christ-centered campus full of many opportunities to grow in your faith.
College Junior,5,"The school doesn't call it fraternity's and sorority's and hazing is absolutely not allowed. They are called social clubs on campus and there are still different personalities for each club and it's super easy to find the right fit for you. I love club and would encourage everyone who can to join one and take part! Spring Sing is the best thing ever!! It is in the spring semester of the school year and it is a huge choreographed show put on by each club with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place rewarded. Its the best!"
College Junior,5,"The school just got added to the NCAA ranking. We just got a new gym called ""The Dub,"" which has been updated with all kinds of new equipment. Students have easy access most times of the day and there is a track field and a 3 mile trail around the school. There are intramural fields where almost everyone will be out watching the club sports games at some point during the year. There are also baseball and softball fields."
College Junior,5,The school provides an environment that is warm and welcoming and truly makes you feel at home. The professors are amazing and truly do their best to get you through their programs successfully and get a job. All the programs have a high rate of employment after graduation for their alumni.
College Senior,5,I have the best professors. They are available at all times and help every single one of us. They are so kind and care about us all.
College Senior,5,This school helps every student get a job and internships. They want to see us excel.
College Senior,5,"I'm very pleased with my University. I feel loved and I am not just a number, I'm known by name."
College Freshman,5,Campus is very safe at all times. I have never felt anything but safe while being on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The freshman dorms are the smallest, which is understandable; however, even the smallest dorm rooms are spacious enough, clean, and generally a nice place to live."
College Freshman,5,"Oklahoma Christian doesn't have ""fraternities"" or ""sororities"", it has ""social service clubs"". However, these clubs are very involved, and it's really great. Even people who choose not to be in a club can participate in intramurals, and while being in a club is a fantastic way to get more involved, those who don't join are not looked down upon or treated differently. Everyone has friends who are not in a club or who are in clubs other than their own. It's great."
College Freshman,5,"Oklahoma Christian University is an extremely positive environment to learn in. Staff and students there are helpful and they truly care about your success; however, professors have no problem with challenging you because they see your potential. The motto rings true: OC is home.

I moved 14 hours away from my hometown, but after one semester I can't wait to go back for another semester. The academic challenges, the student life, and the overall Christian love and care shared by all on campus make it a worthy place to attend college."
College Sophomore,5,"Very safe, small campus in a safe, small town in a small state."
College Freshman,5,"This college was probably the best choice I made. It's pretty small and it's easy for people to see everyone. It's not big and it's a private school. It's several states away from home, which I enjoy."
College Freshman,5,I love how caring everyone is from the professors to the other students to even the cleaning staff! It definitely has a community vibe and everyone genuinely wants to see you succeed.
College Senior,5,I have had the absolute best experience at Oklahoma Christian University.  I couldn't be happier about my decision to attend this university. The faculty and staff are phenomenal!  They genuinely care about each student as an individual and want them to succeed.
College Junior,5,"Though financially it is sometimes a struggle to attend this school and some of the bible classes are irritating because I am not Church of Christ, overall the education quality is wonderful, the professors are incredible, and the overall atmosphere of the college is an amazing experience as an incoming freshman and every year after!"
College Junior,5,"OC has a great community and lots of activities for students who want to get involved. There are so many supportive staff and faculty at OC, the academics are appropriately challenging, and the campus is beautiful."
College Sophomore,5,My first experience is wonderful.
College Sophomore,5,The food that you can have is deliscious.
College Sophomore,5,It's always a good time
College Freshman,5,"Its not the greek system, but social clubs."
College Freshman,5,I love OC! The teachers and staff are there to help
College Senior,5,"Surrounded by cities with tons of dining options,."
Freshman,4,"The online classes I've taken have been very easy to understand and work through. I haven't really done many online classes yet, but so far they're great."
Senior,4,"Some classes where better than others, but given how engineering classes are supposed to me more hands on, it makes sense that those classes would have a harder time adjusting to online learning."
Senior,4,"I love the very interpersonal environment of the campus. It is very small, so it is easy to run into a lot of your friends very frequently. The professors want to get to know you and help you if you ever need it. The main thing I would like to see change is some software updates on the site, especially when trying to input time for work-study. Also, though it is nice to have washers and dryers in the dorms, they break down so frequently and never actually get fixed, just reset. The some of the dorms have a slight mold issue, but it got a lot better this year. Overall, good experience, but in a few areas it is lacking."
Freshman,4,"At first Oklahoma Christian can seem like a place for extroverted, overly positive, and spouse-seeking individuals. This describes a portion of the OC community. Unfortunately, I have witnessed and been bullied at OC and met my share of fake ppl. But God turned that around for good. I found my niche in the honors program. I have been challenged academically and have made my closest friends who I can call family.

So my advice for you: It is okay if you don’t fit in the first week- I never did. It’s okay if you are not Church of Christ (I’m Baptist) bc we are all one body for Christ. If you choose to go to OC, find beauty wherever God places you. Never once have I said OC is home or had a Ring by Spring, but I still enjoy it here. Remember that you have an opportunity to change lives and be different. The most beautiful ppl at OC chose to stand out and truly reflect our Lord and Savior. ❤️"
Sophomore,4,I liked the campus itself and how everyone was so welcoming. I enjoyed the campus experience in Edmond OK.
Freshman,4,"Oklahoma Christian is defined by its caring staff and faculty. Everyone you encounter wants to see you succeed. Like any college there are unpleasant classes and things that need improvement. The dorms and the cafeteria both need to be revamped, but the latter is currently underway. Overall, the college is reasonably priced and greatly rewarding."
Freshman,4,The atmosphere and staff are so willing to help and the professors really want you to succeed. OC has many opportunities to reach out to fellow students and to reach out to the community.
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma Christian University is a wonderful place to further your education and grow as an individual. The professors care about your academic success, and they support you through your spiritual journey. However cliche it may sound to others, ""OC is Home"" truly represents how I feel about my school."
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma Christian is a great school with many great areas to study and learn. Student and  campus life is great, and you will see many different groups having activities across campus. Bible classes help draw students in to the Christian atmosphere."
Junior,4,Oklahoma Christian has a wonderful Christian environment and the low student/teacher ratio allows the professors to work closely with each student individually and get them the help they need.
Sophomore,4,"the community is great. However, the freshman dorms are a wreak and had many issues throughout the year. The University needs to take a step back and change their priorities on what needs to be changed."
Sophomore,4,"The vast majority of the teachers here genuinely care about their students. Most of the staff are friendly. Most courses are well planned and taught. It is a comfortable and positive environment. However, like most schools. there are some teachers that either don't care, are too lazy, or get so caught up in their own interests that other course material is skipped. The school is focused on spiritual and academic growth, so there isn't much of a sports scene there."
Sophomore,4,"The school is small, which allows me to always feel connected. The professors genuinely care about us and want us to be successful."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Oklahoma Christian University! I'm currently a freshman and transitioning was fairly easy due to the atmosphere--everyone is like family! One thing I don't like about OC is the price, I do feel like it could be cheaper. On the other hand, you definitely get what you pay for here. All of the professors, faculty, and staff are loving and supportive."
Senior,4,"If you are looking for a small school to offer good one on one opportunities with professors who care about their students OC is the right place for you. Academics is where OC excels, but bein a small private school it lacks in some areas that larger colleges might be better suited to provide"
Junior,4,"Oklahoma Christian University attracted me because of their highly rated engineering program and post-graduation placement rates. I enjoy the diversity of views and opinions among the student population. I also enjoy the focus on morality (it is a religiously based institution), which encourages me in making good life decisions. The religious setting is encouraging and I do not feel that it is overburdensome, as with some religiously based institutions. As far as negative aspects go, I would say that the food is mediocre (3/5) and the campus and student population are both rather small."
Freshman,4,"I currently attend Oklahoma Christian and am a member of the Honors program. The school offers a wide variety of majors, and is well-known for its engineering and biology programs. The professors are well-versed in their field of study and care about their students, making an effort to get to know them."
Niche User,4,"At Oklahoma Christian University everyone is like a big happy family. Students from all over the country move to Edmond Oklahoma to study at Oklahoma Christian University. You get your money's worth because the classroom environment is smaller so there's more one on one with the professor. They have recently added a Chick Fil A and Alfredo's Tex-Mex to the food facility, and will soon have a coffee shop and a new cafeteria.   During labs students are able to do hands-on work instead of having a TA demonstrate the procedure. OC is truly home."
Senior,4,"I like the small class sizes, because it allows the professors to take time to help students and get to know students better. I don't necessarily like having to go to chapel so often. I don't believe anyone can earn their way to heaven, and I think that's what the school seems to let on."
Sophomore,4,"I am a Sophomore at OC. So far I have really enjoyed my time here. The professors are helpful and involved. The only downside to OC is that you tend to get drawn into ""an OC bubble"". It's hard to get outside of all the homework and school events....even church seems like it's still at OC since Memorial Road COC is right next to campus. I personally go to downtown OKC for church just to have time away from everything. Other than that though, a really good experience so far."
Niche User,4,Oklahoma Christian is an incredible university; all of the faculty I interacted with were helpful and friendly. The classes are small and the professors are exceptionally well-versed in the subjects they teach. Campus is beautiful as well. The only downside is the cafeteria food.
College Sophomore,4,"So far in my college career, I have made a lot of friends and have kept decent grades thanks to the amazing teachers. Great school"
College Junior,4,"most of the professors I've had have been fantastic, but as always there are exceptions"
College Junior,4,"OC's engineering program has deals with lots of major corporations allowing them to get first pick of graduates, OC's Computer Science program was rated by Forbes a few years ago as one of the top 10 in america."
College Junior,4,"There was a bike thief like 6 years ago, and I think a dude got robbed in is dorm at gunpoint, but that was a long time ago too. Over all, it's not a criminally exciting campus"
College Junior,4,"Socially, the school is fantastic, however, I'm not a fan of some of the requirements for being a student of OC. Mandatory Bible classes means if you wish to transfer past freshman year, you're losing a lot of credit hours. On top of that, being forced to go to Chapel every day really breaks any roll you be having that day."
College Student,4,The campus has call buttons every few feet so if you are scared you can have someone walk with you.
College Student,4,The housing is really close to all classes for your first two years and in the girl dorms they have living rooms where you can have movie nights and gam nights to just hang out.
College Student,4,"My school is amazing, the people there are really nice and God loving. My president is awesome he is such a great person and the way he makes us students feel is quite special he had a tragedy and now uses that to help people."
College Junior,4,"I was originally in mechanical engineering and decided to change majors. That was easy, and I love my new major (Gaming and animation). Jeff Price is literally amazing, and will help with whatever he can. Oh, did I mention that big companies are always coming to campus to hire us at inters?!? Thats Freaking Awesome!!!!!"
College Junior,4,"I am a cheap guy. I don't want to pay for the apartments (even the cheap ones are expensive {And have no ethernet}), and I don't want to live in the freshman dorms. So the choices are U-house, Wilson West, and Wilson East. Wilson East is my favorite. It just got new wifi, updated rooms, and lots of space!!! Wilson West has alright space, trash for wifi, and is outdated. U-house is expensive, has decent wifi (when the whole dorm isn't on), and has some nice places to study!"
College Junior,4,"I would choose my school again simply because I love the environment. Great teachers, good people, great fun."
College Freshman,4,"Drugs aren't very big at our school. Yes there are people that use drugs here at OC, but it's a very small percent of students. The drug policy here, is pretty strict and watched carefully."
College Junior,4,The housing is nice and the rules are fair. It is a little bit more expensive than i think it should be but I have never ran a college so I may be mistaken
College Junior,4,The curriculum is very challenging but it sets you up for success after college. The professors do their best to be available and it appears they do their best to challenge us students to make us better students. The campus is beautiful and the people are great.
College Freshman,4,OC is one of the safest places in the area. The campus is very protected.
College Freshman,4,The courses and professors at this school are good quality. Professors are passionate about their subject and care for their students' future.
College Freshman,4,"The career services at this school are very helpful, and are always putting up new job postings. OC is good at preparing your for life after college."
College Freshman,4,Housing at OC is a big part of campus life especially for freshman students. The dorm halls for freshman is where a lot of people make their greatest friends.
College Freshman,4,The athletics department at OC continues to get better every year. The athletes here are very competitive and strive for the best.
College Freshman,4,"I have absolutely LOVED my time at OC. I have made so many memories and great friendships that I wish to last a lifetime. I pray God will provide a way for me to go back next year, because it is petty much my second home. What makes my school unique is the environment. It isn't too big, but is big enough to where you are always meeting new people. Yet it is small enough to grow close to a lot of people."
College Sophomore,4,"Recently, the student-athlete association has made great efforts to get more of campus involved. We do not have a football team, so the big sport is basketball, which is less universally enjoyed than football, so they are working really hard to show the students some love! It is just hard because at such a small school, everyone knows everyone. At huge public universities not everyone knows everyone, or even some people, so it is easy to have the athletes be ""recognizable and familiar faces"" around camps. Unfortunately, at a small school where almost everyone knows or has heard of everyone, athletes are less of a phenomenon."
College Freshman,4,Love my professors and the school.
College Freshman,4,The school does their best to help students get jobs.
College Freshman,4,"I don't participate, but others seem to like them."
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere is fun but the dorms are pretty outdated
College Freshman,4,"I am in one of the freshman boys' dorms and our dorms are decent.  There are three people to about 400 square feet, so there is plenty of room in each dorm.  They are not exactly close to most buildings on campus, but the cost is reasonable."
College Freshman,4,"I'm an engineering student and I don't have time to regularly work out, but the trail I run on is very well maintained and our gym is brand new and in great shape."
College Junior,4,"It's all pretty great! The social atmosphere and resident community are so great! Freshmen and Sophomore have to live in dorms. Juniors and seniors have the opportunity to live in on-campus apartments. Teal Ridge is a new-vamped retirement home that has been slowly converting to student housing. It's an incredible opportunity to live with retirees, married families/families with children, and at the moment, female junior and senior students. I live there currently and it is a fantastic experience and a very unique opportunity you don't get at many other universities!"
College Senior,4,I loved housing. I made so many friends.
College Senior,4,All games are fun. I enjoy going.
College Freshman,4,"Students love attending varsity games, but intramurals are even more popular! The spirit of fun competition is alive at Oklahoma Christian, and it's fabulous."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of alumni will hire OC students, the advisers know a lot about internships."
College Sophomore,4,"OC is a great school, like any other school you have to make the most of it!"
College Freshman,4,The professors are helpful and I've learned a lot. Sometimes it's difficult to get done with everything that is expected of me and I'm worried about my finances and grades but other than that it's been a really nice school.
College Junior,4,"My school is a great school. i learned a lot about college life, american culture, and life in general. my school is unique, in a way that my professors care about me, not just my name on a piece of paper. however, after attending this school for 2,5 years, i found that as an international student, my opportunities are very limited at this school. that being said, i would probably choose a different school if i were to do it all over again."
College Sophomore,4,The professors and staff really do care about the students. There are a few problems with the buildings and stuff but they are older buildings so this is expected. All around a great campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is great, the freshmen dorms can be big."
College Sophomore,4,The off-campus dorms are beautiful and very close.
College Sophomore,4,Great restarunts Oklahoma City has to offer.
Freshman,2,"If you dont have a group by the end of orientation week, expect to be a loner. Most people who go there are rich and if you want to do any art classes, it'll be a lot easier to get resources you need if you're rich.  Student worker program is nice, at least in my experience. I worked in the library. The food is mediocre, and while most teachers are really nice and care about you, there are some who need a reality check. If you dont go to chapel enough you have to pay a fine or can get suspended. Freshman experience staff have access to your grades, and they have no reason to. If you aren't a naturally happy and perky person, dont go here."
College Junior,2,"While the academic buildings are kept up-to-date, The dorms and apartments are terrible. In my suite of 4 rooms Sophomore year (8 people total), we had one working shower. and it was gross and moldy. The guy's dorms don't have a dorm kitchen so if you want to cook something, you're out of luck."
College Sophomore,2,Not many people come to games and there is not much focus on athletics.
College Senior,2,No variety from day to day.
College Junior,2,"Are Greek clubs are called ""Social Clubs"". We don't have sororities or fraternities. But I've heard that being in a social club is like gaining a new family."
College Junior,2,"OC is a school that is against dancing and what most people call partying. So if you want to party you have to go to another school like UCO. The type of parties that are allowed are kind of like your elementary parties. There's games, food, possibly a movie."
College Sophomore,2,"It would be a lot cheaper for me to live off campus than what I am having to pay now. I am not allowed to live off campus unless I have family with in 50 miles of campus, married, or certain amount of credited college hours."
College Junior,2,"I feel for the price that we pay, and that we are required to get a meal plan, the variety and the quality of the food should be much better"
College Senior,2,Most people just hang out in their dorms and apartments. Not too many people go out.
College Senior,2,Probably the worst policy is that members of the opposite sex aren't even allowed to use the bathroom in your apartment on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Most people are rich and Church of Christ
College Junior,2,There is a lot of on campus parking available so there is very little need to park off campus. 
College Junior,2,"I myself do not participate in the Fraternities, but many of the students do and they seem to enjoy the many activities they participate in on campus. "
College Junior,2,Although I don't live off campus the students I know that do say that the cost is relatively cheap but of a fairly decent quality.
College Junior,2,There are a variety of places to eat from fast food to nice dine in restaraunts.
College Junior,2,Oklahoma weather can be strange at times depending on the time of year. For a couple months out of the year you have to watch out and be alert for tornado's in the surrounding cities. The college campus never seems to be affected by them though.
College Junior,2,Athletics are a big area for many students on campus
College Senior,2,"There is a Sonic, Mcdonalds, and Braums close to campus. The best place and the closest is a Jimmy Johns, and they have great sandwiches."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many apartments right around campus so its hard to live off of campus. They also discourage you to live off campus even if its cheaper.
College Sophomore,2,"In reality this is a college still so there will be drinking and drugs, but since it is a Christian school it's done more in secret. I do have friends that drink and do drugs, however I don't take part in any of it but I know it exist."
College Freshman,1,A positive party go to rush events and the student center or just find a good group of friends and hang out in the pavilion. Stay clear of the drinking parties. They do exist and they are bad news for everyone.
College Freshman,1,Financial aid is nonexistent if your family income is decent and your test scores are mediocre.
College Freshman,1,Majority of the food is unhealthy or has not nutritional value to even be worth eating if you just go for a salad. The dining hall is always a huge disaster to find seating and to get around to get food. The menus for a person with food allergies is extremely sparse and the value for what is mandatory to pay for a meal plan is awful for the quality of the food.
College Freshman,1,I wasn't given much information and my question weren't answered thoroughly. I wish that they had been more clear since I was doing it all on my own without help of my mom
College Junior,1,We are not allowed to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,Too strict the R.D.'s invade your privacy
College Sophomore,1,Its so hard to find a spot and we aren't allowed to park anywhere besides all the way one one random side of campus away from everything.
College Junior,1,"OC is located in Edmond, OK, which has been described as the ""best place to raise a family."" To say the least, there isn't much going on. Additionally, OC doesn't allow you to have alcohol on campus and can put you on probation for any sort of substance use. For transportation, you will need to rely on taxis or your friends - there is not really any public transportation. While nearby Oklahoma City does offer some semblance of nightlife, OC doesn't really have  a bunch going on in that category."
College Sophomore,1,The majority of the time the food just isn't good unless it's a holiday or a good day for U-Dining. I feel they feed visitors better than they feed their own students.
College Freshman,1,"There are few shopping malls, not so much to do during the weekend."
College Freshman,1,There are quite a few buses and they are not safe to go in.
College Freshman,1,"There's good cereal. That's about all. The food from the cafeteria is usually not very appetizing. I've gotten raw chicken and other raw meat several times. On campus, the cafeteria is the only option besides the grill. The grill stays open later than the cafeteria but basically serves the same food."
College Sophomore,1,"At Oklahoma Christian University, we do not have buses to take us where we to go.  The campus is small, and most people live on or near campus, so getting to class is not hard.  However, if a student ever needed to leave campus, and he or she did not have a car, the only option would be to find someone to drive them.  Luckily, there are such great people at OC that finding transportation when you are in need is not difficult."
College Sophomore,1,Basketball coach hides his players dr ug use from dean.
College Freshman,1,"WE have on campus apartments, but most students are encouraged to live on campus."
College Sophomore,1,The cost to attend a private school like Oklahoma Christian University is ridiculous. I don't know what the money goes to but for people to be paying a lot of money students should be able to have a nice dorm on campus. The dorm rooms are very old and should be upgraded. The food could also be a lot better.
College Sophomore,1,"There are so many rules that they dont tell you. As a Freshmen: You have to attend chapel everyday. You have curfew. You can't drive to class.
Everybody: only one cafeteria, the student center is small, there is a grill that is open late, you have to take a bible class every semester, in the dorms girls and guys can't be in the opposite sex's rooms only the designated lobby area, you have to buy a meal plan no matter what
You can not live in the apartments until you are a junior. You cannot live off campus unless you are living with your parents.

You have all those rules and its so expensive.

School is unorganized in my opinion."
College Sophomore,1,Freshmen can't park anywhere except in the dorm parking lots

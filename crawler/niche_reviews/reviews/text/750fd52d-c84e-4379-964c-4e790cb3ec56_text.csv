Junior,5,"I am very pleased with my experience at Rockford University. I am receiving a high quality education, close to home. I have completed one semester of classes at Rockford University after transferring with my associates degree last semester. Every professor/advisor I have met so far has been very helpful and they want nothing more than for their students to succeed."
Junior,5,"I took 2 classes online my first semester at Rockford University and the teachers were fantastic with the online community. Mid-way through the semester, all classes were forced to go online. While it was a challenge for some, my professors tried their best to ensure their students still felt heard and understood the material they were learning."
Freshman,5,"Everyone there is super friendly and helpful, they answer your question within hours, and help your transition from high school to college a lot easier."
Junior,5,"I love Rockford. It is such a great school. The student life is so diverse and involved. They have a culture fest where everyone gets celebrated. The academics are great too. The support they give us students is phenomenal. A person would have to try hard if they wanted to fail. The teacher, academic advisor and our tutoring program all brought to involvement if a student is failing and they hound the student to get help. There is no excuse for a person to fail. The classes are small, which means the professor can get to know each student during the semester on a personal basis and be more willing to help them if they are struggling. Rockford University is also great about including commuter students in activities on campus. This college is all about inclusion in all aspects and offers so many great things for students."
Junior,5,"This will be my second semester here and already I have had such a different experience from my community college. You have an advisor who works with you every step of the way for all of the years that you are a student. They work with you on things such as registering, advice, withdrawing, degrees/degree changes, planning ahead, and more. The campus itself is a bit older but still very nice, though some classrooms can get pretty cold, and almost everything is within a 5-minute walking distance from each other. The campus grounds are beautiful, the staff are very helpful and friendly, the students are nice, and the college itself is great. Loving it and would recommend it to others."
Junior,5,"My first day that I went into Rockford University I had signs saying ""welcome Kelsey"" in my parking spot as well as on the marquee as soon as I walked in the door. Everyone was very helpful in getting me accepted and ready for classes in a very short amount of time due to the fact that the other school I was planning on attending could not help me and sent me away. My professors are amazing and always willing to help. Every since starting RU, my grades have gone tremendously from my previous school. I would like to see some opportunities for online classes so that it is easier to work around school and work."
Junior,5,This is my third semester at Rockford University and so far I’m having the time of my life. I’m incredibly passionate about art and the art department is the best I have ever encountered. They continuously push me to become a better version of myself and I’m eternally grateful. Besides the art department I love how intimate the classrooms are. The professors always know your name and you never feel like you’re just a number.
Works Here,5,The emphasis on student success is what I love the most about Rockford University. It truly is all about the student! I particularly appreciate how hands-on the business program is.
Sophomore,5,This is an amazing School. There are great faculty and staff. The food amazing. The academics are great. I love every second of it! Living on campus makes my life so much simpler.
Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is very friendly and you can't help but feel welcomed by everyone here. This school opens up opportunities for anyone willing to get out of their comfort zone and that's what the college experience is all about, that and making new friends!"
Senior,5,"I love the teacher-student ratio: the department that aligns with your major is like a second family! You can develop great relationships with professors and peers, it's a wonderful atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,The university went out of their way to make me feel very wanted and special. They put my name on a reserved parking spot when I came to sign up for classes. Also had my name on a welcome marquee upon arrival.
College Junior,5,The faculty is amazing and helpful.
College Sophomore,5,We have a lot of options from McDonald's to steakhouses
College Sophomore,5,We have a lot of majors offered at Rockford and plenty of progams that students can apply for
College Junior,5,I enjoy our education program because they set us up for the future
Recent Alumnus,5,"The parking is free.  It is close to all of the buildings on campus. Unless you need a vehicle to get to work, there is no need for a car on campus.  There is always a parking spot available on campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Because of the campus location, geographically speaking, the campus experiences all seasons of the year.  When it is summer, there is a lot of room outside to run around and have fun.  But, if a student likes to be indoors and not outside during this weather, the dormitories are cool enough to be inside.  The winter season is beautiful because it is located next to a forest so one can see all of the snow on the tree branches.  And, often times, students make snowmen while enjoying a day away from classes during a ""snowed-in"" period."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The library is an excellent place to study if you are looking for an extremely quite place.  The recreational center is an excellent place to study if you are looking for a loud place to study.  Different people have different preference of studying areas, so this campus accommodates both.  There is plenty of green space on this campus to run around and play games and feel free.  Several days per week there were activities on campus that students could be a part of.  There was never a dull week."
Recent Alumnus,5,"All of the teachers are the same when it comes to caring for the student.  Each teacher, regardless of the department they work in, pays attention to students' achievements or lack thereof.  If a student is lagging behind on a subject matter, teachers speak to the students in a respectful manner and help them improve.  The teachers have this philosophy that really is admirable in which they believe that every student has a purpose.  And, the goal of each teacher is to help the student realize their purpose and help them achieve it, while setting high curriculum standards."
Senior,4,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Rockford University. I love the small class sizes and in turn the closer bonds with classmates and faculty. There are a lot of international students, which is a big plus for me.

However, I am a commuter student that is able to come and go as I please. For residential students, there are often issues with the very old dorms - flooding, power issues, etc. And there is not much for them to do on-campus, or in the area of Rockford."
Freshman,4,I like that it's not far from my Mother and that it is close to stores and other things(restaurants etc). I like the dorms except for the nonworking kitchen items. professors are cool. My football coaches are cool. Lacks help/resources for Homeless who want to attend college.
Sophomore,4,I have meant a lot of great people here at Rockford University. The staff here will go out of their way to help you with whatever you need. I would like to see the food get better here on campus as well as some fixing up with the dorm rooms.
Niche User,4,The students and staff are very welcoming and the campus is very safe due to the fact that you have to have a key card to go everywhere there.
Freshman,4,Rockford is a small University in Northern Illinois.  Coming from the warmth of the south the weather here has taken a little getting used to but otherwise I'm enjoying my college experience here in Rockford.  The area has all the best foods and shopping.  The local sports are great must see the Hockey team.  My professors are the best they are easy to talk to and willing to work with you to help you succeed.  So Far it's been a great and I can't wait to see what will come next year.  Go Regents
Senior,4,"The science department (chemistry, biology) and education department are very good if you want to major in those. The science professors have a strong lineup of professors and will help you succeed if you are willing to put in work. The education department is very friendly and will help you learn about what it takes to be a educator."
Sophomore,4,Rockford University has a great learning atmosphere and provides a more personal experience for learning with your professors.
Freshman,4,"The teachers take the time to answer the questions you have. If you need help outside of class they are more than willing to help you. Most professors have ""walk in"" hours aside from their regular hours. The students that attend Rockford University are so welcoming. It is easy to make friends. The dorms are average as well as the food, but the overall environment of the school makes up for it."
Junior,4,"It's a great school, small classes and very friendly professors who genuinely want you to succeed. The only reason I took of a star is because of the forums we are forced to attend and the cost of the college itself. It's very expensive, hence the reason I am applying to this scholarship."
College Freshman,4,The professors are all very helpful. My advisor went out of her way researching what classes would be best for me with my interest in a major.
College Freshman,4,The university is very helpful/proactive with career placement upon graduation.
College Freshman,4,There doesn't seem to be a problem. University is very proactive on prevention.
College Freshman,4,"New experience, being away from mom, dad, and brothers. Very excited for this next chapter in my life."
College Freshman,4,Rockford is very small and it is very easy to get along with most of the students that go there. The professors are very easy to talk to and very understanding. I am an athlete and my professors were very understanding with that and were willing to work with me for the most part.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are in a rebuilding stage, which is going towards positive side."
College Freshman,4,Overall experience is positive. Classes are small and size of campus isn't overwhelming.
College Junior,4,Nice location. Lots of trees
College Junior,4,The teachers are knowledgeable and approachable. Classmates are nice and supportive. Nice campus.
College Student,4,So far everyone is very friendly. Overall it is a small community school
College Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere here at Rockford University. I've made some great friends, the teachers actually care about you and your success, and the campus up here doesn't make you feel like you're in the city. The campus is very secluded. I don't think I could change my mind to not going here if I had to do it all over again."
College Junior,4,I like the small atmosphere and the variety of people on campus. There are activities to do that the school supplies which are fun.  I've met some great people here. People I would say that are going to be best friends for life.
College Senior,4,"Since I do not live on campus, I feel like I am not getting the whole college life experience. But I enjoy being on campus at my university. The staff and professors are very approachable and helpful. They are genuinely concerned about your success as a student. If i could do it all over, I would have applied to schools more far away from home, so I could live on campus and feel more apart of the school community. I live about an hour from campus so it is difficult for me to do much extracurricular activities at school."
College Sophomore,4,"I really like the school there are plenty of jobs available for students both on and off campus, everyone is friendly, and the teachers are their looking out for your best interests"
College Sophomore,4,I have never heard of or had any issues with health or safety. I feel relatively safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I do think a majority of students here are participating in the few sports we offer. I know many athletes, and they're all like family to each other."
College Senior,4,"there's a vast diversity amongst the student body. You'll meet people from all walks of life, political/ religious positions and different origins. Holistically, the student body is very friendly and welcoming towards all."
College Sophomore,4,I have always felt safe on campus
College Sophomore,4,I live with my parents
College Sophomore,4,"The school is nearby a mall so there is plenty to do and good for shopping , there Re plenty of restaurants nearby to so that  student doesn't only have a place to dine but also have job opportunities, there is also a bowling alley nearby and a movie theathre"
College Sophomore,4,Rockford has a lot of diversity and most people are open and Accepting
College Junior,4,"Small campus feel, everyone knows everyone but costs alot of money that is why I need scholarships to attend the school, Please Help!"
College Junior,4,Lots of fun things to do. The people are very nice and they are extremely helpful. They make you feel like you are at home.
College Junior,4,"Great, everyone know one another, feels like home."
College Junior,4,It's free and is always available for students to use. It is helpful especially for students who do not love close to home.
College Senior,4,"This school is a great place to learn. There are great opportunities for diverse learning experiences along with the opportunity to participate in community activities and trips. Also, there is a wide amount of scholarships and financial assistance programs that greatly help students attending this school."
College Senior,4,"The campus is very orderly, clean, and has a great social atmosphere.  All the dorms are very well kept. There have been some issues with heating and air conditioning, but were taken care of fairly quickly."
College Senior,4,"Campus strictness is very good overall. There is a good security presence and there are strict policies regarding several important matters to college life. The security officers are very pleasant and helpful, but do a good job of patrolling the large campus."
College Freshman,4,"Being apart of an athletic team on campus I think the athletics here are great. We have great coaches, great gym facilities and not to mention, our fans are the best!"
College Freshman,4,"We have three computer labs, which is amazing for a community college. Printing is free amd copying is free or 10 cents per page, depending on which lab you go to. Also our tech support office is extremely helpful ."
College Freshman,4,"The people on campus are very accepting to minorities. Personally, I haven't witness anything that would argue otherwise. "
College Freshman,4,Its very unique because there are people who share the same major hang out together and the programs allow students to visits professor's office hours and many tutoring and help opportunities if needed.
College Freshman,4,"For a small college, there are many hands-on opportunities for students. For example, nursing or pre-med students have a chance to work in the health center. Students with business majors may work in the cafeteria or business office. So wherever you see an opportunity to get a close experience to what you want to do in the future, you'll get a possible taste here."
College Freshman,4,"The guys and girls on campus get along well. There are many different styles and personalities that come together. Since most of the guys are friendly and laid back its easy to talk and have fun with us girls because we're the same way. The student population isnt extremely diverse but that never presented a problem. Everyone dresses relaxed, like sweat pants and hoodies. Rarely you'll see people dressed professionally, like the theatre students. "
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is wonderful to have been at a school that was strict when it comes to drug use, underage drinking, and visitations in dorms.  I think that school should have order and keep their campus safe.  I believe that this is one of the reasons why I felt so safe on campus.  The police and safety officers work hard to keep their students safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus is located on state street in Rockford, which is the busiest street in Rockford.  In fact, it is the street that has the most restaurant on it.  The different types of restaurants are sit-down, fast food, buffet, and more.  Unfortunately, however, it is rare for a restaurant to distribute discounts to students."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are few amenities on campus, which some students believe is a bad thing.  And, that is fine.  But, I think of it as a good thing, because it allows students to spend time with one another in person.  A lot of times, especially now with social media, people do not engage in conversations with one another in a physical presence.  The ease of the housing process is wonderful.  Students with a higher number of credit hours completed choose housing first.  Even so, there is a wide availability of dorm rooms.  And, if a student chooses to change dorm rooms, this is welcome."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are several computer labs spread throughout campus.  There is a high level of network reliability.  Though, sometimes, the speed is not often extremely fast.  There is no need to purchase a printer, because there is no cost to print.  I transferred to the university after my sophomore year of college.  During my junior year there, I did not own a laptop or printer."
College Freshman,4,"I live on campus but I have been looking around apartments and the cost is so cheap like 550 a month including everything. I just don't have a job and I heard the people are real picky on who they choose. But the estates themselves are very kept up and only blocks from campus it is just nice.
"
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a psychology major I enjoy my classes and the professors are really helpful and willing to give one-on-one time when you need it. Unfortunately most of the classes are theory based with little skill development or application outside of possibly getting an internship. Even then it is hard to get one in the area you want to work in. Overall, however, the program is a good one for giving a solid foundation."
College Senior,4,My intersnhip is doing almost everything for the local park distric in theraputic recreation.
College Senior,4,I really enjoy this major. The work load is just right.  There are many opportunities for employment after graduation because of internships.
College Junior,4,"It snows in the winter, it rains, it's windy, and it can be very warm. It's pretty much the best of all worlds when it comes to weather."
College Junior,4,"Rockford College, I believe, is an all-around good school. The proffesors are great and there are lots of things to get involved in. Even though the sports teams aren't the best, it is a fun way to stay in shape and make friends. Most of the Rockford College definitely needs to be remodeled, classrooms and bathrooms are old and worn out. A facelift would be great."
College Junior,4,"I'm a double major, Graphic Design and Art History. The professors are great! I have the opportunity to have internships on campus in my graphic design field there is also an on campus work study job for an art history student. The workload is challenging but not an overload, professors are very helpful. I'm very happy with my choice of school."
College Junior,4,Something is always going on campus as well as off campus activities involving the community.
College Junior,4,"professors are great, very personal make an effort to get to know me. I feel the university is preparing me for the workforce and future graduate studies. The campus is great, however I do feel it is time for an update in class room settings and building renovations."
College Junior,4,Designated parking area with permit fee of $30.00 only per year. Plenty of parking. Need to add 5-10 minutes to get to classes from lot.
College Sophomore,4,Sports are a big deal for rockford college all the sports are equally good. most people love to see the basketball games. the football at rockford college hasnt been good for a while now but will hopefully change.
College Junior,4,The libraries are kept vaery clean and quiet. It is a nice atmosphere to be in when doing research.
College Freshman,4,Love It Here! Rockford College is a good school. The small classes are great for that personal one-on-one teaching. Social fun is readily available along with many clubs and on campus activities. My first choice and a great choice it was! Very good school if you're from a small town. It is very homey!
Sophomore,2,"Rockford University is a small Private liberal arts university in Rockford, Illinois. I found out about Rockford University because they recruited me to play basketball  there. Before this I have never heard of this school. I've been going here for almost 2 years now and what I like about it is that it is small and you can get a lot of 1 on 1 time with professors and create a good relationship with them. Also with it being small its feels more like home because I come from a small town and school. The first thing I would say that I don't like about this school is the high cost of tuition and for how high it is I feel like the school should be a lot nicer."
College Freshman,2,"Burpee food can be better, with more food options."
College Senior,2,"coming from a social services major, it is really hard to find internships locally."
College Junior,2,Only have one campus car
College Freshman,2,"Living near Lake Michigan, the temperatures drop very low and we also get alot of snow, and chilly rain."
College Sophomore,2,"Rockford College needs to be more open to the United Negro College Fund for its African American Students. This particular organization has loads and loads of scholarships, however they do not apply to Rockford College at all. Bummer!!"
College Freshman,2,"I am a chemistry major, I love my chemistry classes and the experiments we do. However, I did have a hard time last semester with my grades. I barely passed three of my classes last semester with nothing but Cs. If I could I would love to have been ready for school ahead of time and do things on time and get A's. My goal is to find a career in pharmaceuticals such as Walgreens or other bigger pharmacy companies such as Fisher Pharmaceuticals. As for finding a job I have no concerns with all of the opportunities being offered at my school, especially job opportunies."
College Junior,2,"The Athletics is not a very important factor at our school, we all try our best to be good fans, and participate, but it is more fun than competitive."
College Junior,2,"Well first, if you don't have a car and walking is your only option then you are going to get well accuainted with the McDonald's menu because it is right across the street. If you have a car then there are a couple of good places to eat down the road about less then ten to fifteen minutes away. Chinese food, Philly cheese steak, hamburgers, wings, pasta, southwest food, you name it and it's all within driving distance."
College Junior,2,Campus Police – They are very strict with parking sticker and giving tickets. They are no spots to park and the tickets are too costly for minor students.
College Freshman,2,"We have  a lot of rain and snow and classes are far from some dorms. They don't always get cancelled when the weather is bad either. Its a little dangerous walking to and from classes sometimes. When the weather is great, you can see all the campus residents having a blast outside."
College Junior,2,"Depends on the Day – Some days you can find a parking spot easily, but other days you have to weave in and out of cars parked in the grass to find a spot."
College Junior,2,"Apartments Are Not Cheap – While the apartments are not cheap, they are not terribly expensive, but you do need a full time job to support yourself. This in and of itself is difficult with work and school, but on top of that there are almost no full time jobs in Rockford. The freedom is probably worth it if you can swing it, but there is also the problem of the cheaper the apartment, the worse the neighborhood it is in."
College Freshman,2,This Review Is Extremely Average. The campus security isn't bad but it isn't great either. They take a while to come when you need them. The crime is small and quite childish. Rockford college campus is large and on a foresty area do keep your doors closed to avoid animals and pranks!
College Sophomore,2,"Although finding housing near campus can be a little tedious, some are available. The housing that is within a reasonable distance seems to be substantially more expensive than in other areas. In housing near campus, you get less for your money than you would in other places."
College Freshman,1,nonexistent unless you are an athlete. the school is expensive one scholarship is not enough.
College Freshman,1,"Many of the administration do leave and look for other work, just as the kids transfer and drop-out."
College Junior,1,We dont have a greek life
College Senior,1,There always seems to be a problem when it comes to financial aid. They never seem to get it 100% correct.
College Junior,1,"The security on campus act as if they are getting paid big bucks. They write out tickets for every little thing. If you don't stay stopped at a stop sign for more than two seconds then that is considered running through a stop sign. Then the security cars like to flash there lights as if they police officers. Some of the RAs act the same way when we try to throw parties in the dorms. They get their pad and paper and start writing people up for being in a room that has alcohol in it. The definition for this campus security is ""BUZZ KILL""."
College Junior,1,"There are people of many different races and religions at RC, but they are just numbers. The dominant race here at RC is white. You can see that there are still a lot of people here that stereo type others and at times can be a bit racist, but you either put up with it and laugh or transfer out to another college."
College Junior,1,"Buses Only – Buses are the only mode of public transportation in Rockford, and they don't always have the most desirable people accompanying you on them. You really don't want to ride alone or after dark. Or really at all if you can swing it. Having personal transportation is really a must at Rockford."
College Freshman,1,"Mediocre Food – After freshman year, buy a smaller meal plan. The food around campus is great and plentiful. The Lions Den is great for snacks in between classes. Plus the dining hall opens at 7 and close at 7 which is convenient for early and late classes."
College Sophomore,1,"Parties are limited on-campus because campus security and RA's are too uptight about noise and such. When parties are possible, they usually just get people into trouble. The bar/club scene is a little better, many bars are in the area. The underage nightlife is very limited, if you are not of legal drinking age, there is nothing to do past about 11:00 PM. Transportation is very good. A bus stop is located directly outside of campus."

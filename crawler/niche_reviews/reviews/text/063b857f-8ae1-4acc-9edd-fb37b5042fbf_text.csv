Niche User,5,It was an overall good experience. I'm being recruited for basketball so I experience all of this on my visit. The campus is small though which I like.
Senior,5,"This college is a special and purposed place, but it isn't for the faint of heart. The people who thrive here are those who are diligent in their academic and spiritual life, and those who do not extend effort to either (and quick to complain) will feel buried.
My experience was overwhelmingly positive as my interaction with professors and students here have sharpened the way I think in all subject areas, not just relating to religion."
Senior,5,Very easy to understand the way of doing things and completing assignments online. I have enjoyed my time of learning with this school. I am excited about graduating soon and look forward to what lies ahead in the future.
Freshman,5,Barclay provides amazing intellectual courses. The teaching is very personal and you get plenty of help with anything you need. I would suggest this college to anyone who wants a great education and it's tuition free.
Niche User,5,Barclay is a great college to get you ready to become a missionary.  Barclay shows you how to grow closer to God. It has amazing friendships between professors and students. The professors care a lot about the students.
Senior,5,"Great experience! The professors really want you to succeed and make learning intriguing and not monotony. Surrounded by many like minded people and out is easy to fit in and make friends. Chapels are great and encourage spiritual formation. (Becoming more like Christ for the sake of others.) Very good school, 100% recommend!"
College Senior,5,"We have certain events every year- retreat weekend, banquet, harvest party, graduation, etc."
College Senior,5,Being a Christian school that isn't about drinking and being a non-Christian in a Christian life.
College Senior,5,Fast and easy to get everything you need!
College Senior,5,Great little dining place for a great price!
College Senior,5,"The closest walmart is 20 minutes, which has other simple shopping, but the closest town is 10 minutes which has a lot of small town shopping which I love."
Recent Alumnus,5,Most school policies are common sense and mature students would hardly notice them.  Dorm hours do bother a few people but they are reasonable and exceptions can be made if students plan ahead.
College Junior,5,"The teachers and staff are amazing, they are always there for you no matter what. They are always askign about school and your personal life."
College Sophomore,5,"I am in a Christian college so most of the major are focused around christianity. The teachers are very helpful and push you to your highest potential. Most of people on campus have an on campus job but if you really want one, you need to get one fast. At this college teachers are not always giving home work but certain assignment do account for larger chunks of your grade."
College Sophomore,5,"Barclay College is located in a beautiful small town. It allows students to focus on there studies and get to know most people on campus. This kind of setting makes it easier to make lasting friendships and relationships. One of the best place to hangout after dinner is in the Bears Den where you can grab some good food, ice cream, and other things."
College Freshman,5,Who Needs a Car – Everything is in walking distance so vehicles are not much needed to get from place to place. It would take longer for you to get in a start it than it would to just walk.
College Sophomore,5,If you give an A for not letting it happen then that's what you give it. If not It's a for sure F!
College Sophomore,5,Itty Bitty but Together – The town is about 700 people with kids its 920. There is not a whole lot to do. But there is always someone to talk to. They will listen and talk back to you. It will always be he best community ever.
College Sophomore,5,The diveersity on campus is pretty high. There are very few challanges and many have same beliefes and religion.
Freshman,4,Barclay college Is a great college. It is small and that allows for the professors to be more available to the students. The students are very welcoming to new students. While they are lacking in a strong sports program they have a decent soccer team and a good volleyball and basketball team. The area around the school is lacking in things to do but there are always people doing things in the dorms.
Senior,4,"The most I would love to see change, conversation between the students and the staff/faculty. The students only know what they want us to know with changes within the college. Example, how do we know that Barclay is struggling with finances or anything, if not told? How can the Students be praying for the college, if we don't have any information on what is going on behind the scenes."
College Junior,4,I feel safe nearly 100% of the time on campus. Colds and flu spread quickly because of our general close proximity but other than that I think we stay relatively healthy and safe.
College Junior,4,No drugs or alcohol at all. No matter the age. You are capable to be kicked out if you so much as do either.
College Junior,4,It's in the middle of no where Kansas. There is literally next to no crime what so ever. It's awesome.
College Senior,4,"It's basically a bridal college, so you go there to find your significant other."
College Senior,4,"Fans and school spirit is awesome, almost everyone in the community comes to games. Facilities could use some work though."
College Senior,4,"We usually have class no matter the weather, which sucks sometimes but it's nice to get done the 1st of May."
College Senior,4,"The Youth Ministry program is awesome, the adviser is also really great. He is there to answer any questions and help you get on track with things. I wouldn't change Barclay for anything... academics wise."
College Senior,4,"Professors are awesome! They are like a friend but also give you structure. The workload is more in some classes over others which is nice. I tend to study in my dorm room, but the library is very popular to study and it's very welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,You find all types of people in different parts of life. The people on campus are very friendly and inclusive.
College Sophomore,4,"Barclay College is unique from the face of it.  First of all, we are a Christian community taking classes out of a building that was originally built back in the early part of the 1900s.  We are a Bible college that prepares men and women for leadership in the Church, whether it be out in the field working with those in Africa spreading the Gospel or within your own local community serving dinner to the homeless.  Barclay teaches the students how to develop a servant's heart and offers applicable classes in which you can gain the hands on experience needed."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in Kansas the most you will experience is a little wind.  The weather is fair all year round.  There has been hardly any moisture in this area since the Spring which tends to place a little tension among the farmers in this town, but all in all the weather is very cooperative."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Safety – I had never thought about this aspect of campus life until I was asked this question. Interestingly enough, the campus is located in a small Christian community with members who care for each other and support one another so that anywhere you are in town you feel safe. Barclay College does not have the traditional or formal 'campus police' that some major universities do.  At 200 students enrolled, we employ one individual to wander around campus around curfew hours and lock all of the doors and make sure the campus is secure.  Currenty this individual is enrolled in the school as a student as well.  Beyond this, the student handbook lines rules out in a way that is clear that students should follow and obey otherwise applicable punishments may ensue.  Most students are responsible enough in character that I have never seen or have heard of a single problem while attending Barclay College. I feel more than safe at this school."
College Freshman,4,"We have a coffee place in town where a lot of people hang out. It is owned by one of the teachers of the school and once in a while we will get discounts. Also, you will find your teachers in the hang out areas around or asking if a group of friends would like to come play  at their house with their families."
College Freshman,4,Good Experience – Living at Barclay was a great experience. I am excited for another year to be with all my friends and continue making memories. Everyone is like family and you will grow close to them sooner or later.
College Freshman,4,"Always Changing – Weather doesn't affect us much. Everything is a few feet away so you can make it to all your classes. If it would cause a problem, they move it."
College Freshman,4,The food is very good and you never have to worry about running out. There is always just enough for everyone. The price is included with your tuition and so you never have to worry about running out on your food ticket! You just eat when you want to eat
College Freshman,4,"Everyone Is Family – Off campus living is very rare. Since the school is smaller than normal, if you live in the town, you live by the school. Therefore, most people live in dorms unless married!"
College Freshman,4,Everyone Is Your Friend – Living on the Barclay campus is like having your family around all school year. Everyone if friendly to whoever they see and they are willing to invite them in an activities that are going on. You're never left out and there is always someone to hangout with when you need them.
College Junior,2,"The food isn't good, the classes, professors, and administration are disorganized and have no idea what they are doing. The faculty fail to address any problems that are raised, money is spent on nonsense while issues that need fixing are blatantly ignored."
College Junior,2,We have one restaurant within a 15 mile radius.
Recent Alumnus,2,"On campus there is no need of a vehicle, however if a person chooses to leave campus to go shopping they will need a vehicle."
Alum,1,"Barclay College is your typical private, republican, evangelical, Midwest, Christian college. Most of the professors are wonderful people and the problems of the college are not their fault, they just work there. Everyone on the admin side of things has their heads so far up there own butts it’s a miracle they can even “read their bibles”. 

The culture of the school is a drama breeding machine, it’s like a high school version of college. Homeschool nerds hating the popular kids, dumb jocks that the school won’t kick out because they bring in the money, holier than thou losers that get their kicks out of judging every action of everyone around them.

Pretty sure Barclay is responsible for 5% of global deforestation with the amount of useless mail they constantly send to alums."
Sophomore,1,"Food is extremely terrible except Mexican day (decent), nothing in town, school gives you 7 hours a week max for work so the most you can make is 200 a month, you have to leave campus for fall break, Thanksgiving, and Christmas so if you don't live close you'll have to fly or drive home every time or stay with a teacher. They force you to go to chapel twice a week. No food around town at all and this school is a QUAKER/FRIENDS school so if you're looking for a true biblical school this is not the place. They have forced school activities that you must attend or you will be fined money, There are some nice teachers, but a lot of the staff have terrible people skills. Ran out of characters, but could say more."
Senior,1,"Faculty that look out for themselves and the image of the college before they look out for the majority of their students. Horrible cafeteria food. School is full of small town ""who's in and who's out"" drama. The expectation to be ""open"" with everyone about everything breeds a toxic environment. They also lie about their level of accreditation to get more people to come. Credits don't transfer well. The teachers are the only thing that is redeeming about the institution."
Junior,1,"Staff show favoritism towards family and athletes. Academic quality is mediocre, no activities in town. Dorms are crowded and have many problems, but the administration would rather waste money than fix the problems. Internet is slow and bad quality, sometimes making it impossible to perform homework and projects. The library is ancient, sparse and outdated."
College Freshman,1,"Barclay is a very strict school. I didn't agree with most of the rules. The PDA rules were bogus!! Not being able to have free choice in clothing and music was weird because we are all adults and should be the ones to make the desicion! We had to wear shoes in the lunch room, WEIRD."
College Freshman,1,"At Barclay, it is extreamly diverse in dealing with personalities. Therefore, everyone connected. They are all there for the same reason and it was easy to make friends. Although my intentions were completely different from the rest, I totally seen the love in the hearts of those students. The only problem was the judgemental attitudes of few."
College Sophomore,1,"Well Deserved – You do it, you get caught. Uh oh! Its very strict and rightfully so. WE aren't a party school. You come to learn and if you get in trouble then bye bye."

Freshman,5,"Amidst all the uncertainty, Marymount provided above and beyond quality of service over the course of switching the online classes."
Freshman,5,"The quality of staff, wide ranging coursework, and community connectedness at this school, is truly unparalleled. In one of the busiest cuties in the world it easy to feel lost or unnoticed - but not here. No matter your major, advisors (and professors) spend time getting to know YOU, your goals, and your capabilities as a student. They prioritize helping you discover your strengths and develope a course schedule that both challenges and expands your understanding of your interests. 

The students here, each bring their own unique and diverse talents which definitely creates a safe and creative space to explore academic, artistic, and personal interests.

Without hesitation I recommend this university to anyone looking for a close community and unparalleled educational experience in New York City."
Alum,5,"I transferred to MMC after one semester at a different college. I was a double major in business and communications. Marymount was my saving grace. I met the best people, the best faculty members, and staff that I am still in touch with to this day. I am so thankful for my time at MMC and hope that students who are unsure about MMC get the opportunity to visit campus and see what the school is all about. You can read every single thing online about a school, but don't make a choice until you actually get to go in person. MMC is a magical place, don't let what is said online deter you from giving it a chance. It's not the school for everyone, but it may be the school for YOU!"
Freshman,5,Marymount Manhattan College is filled with students from all over the country and has a great community within itself. Everyone is kind to one another and no one is left out. They are very open to different ideas and accept all kinds of students into their school.
Niche User,5,Overall great programs and staff. Brilliant students with so much talent being brought to the table everyday.
Freshman,5,"I applied for the 2019-2020 school year at Marymount Manhattan College. So far my application process and acceptance to the school has been great. I've had a great experience with the admission counselors, talking with the teachers, and getting in touch with the student life. My application process and course selection weren't hard to go through. Thanks to Niche I found a school that matched what I was looking for.
If you're looking for the best New York City experience, this school is just what you need.  Although it doesn't have sports programs you still can enjoy a variety of clubs and activities on and off campus. The school has a great diversity in the student community, is good to get in touch with so many nationalities, cultures, and more."
Niche User,5,They are so welcoming and make me feel like I am part of the family all the way from TX!  I can't wait to see where my journey takes me and this school cares about my success!
Junior,5,"I am a junior at MMC and this is definitely the place for me!  With such a diverse and talented group of individuals you can't go wrong with this school.  Financial aid and academic advisement are exceptional and are always willing to answer and help with any issues you may run into.  The dance and theater programs are elite level and prepare you for the real working world.  A great, well-rounded private college!"
Freshman,5,"I just began to study here as a freshman. It has been great, I wouldn't change anything. It's a great school and has a great environment. Love it!"
Sophomore,5,"MMC is an amazing community filled with passionate, driven students. The professors truly want you to succeed. This school allows for endless opportunities and real world exposure. Would highly recommend."
Niche User,5,"My experience with Marymount has been great so far, i'm an incoming freshman to the school and every contact i've had with the school and staff has been amazing, everyone is amazing, I recommend Marymount for those who want a hands on experience as well as a campus filled with adventure."
Sophomore,5,"I can't imagine being anywhere other than Marymount, but many dislike it because it isn't for them. Personally I LOVE small class sizes. I'm a communications major with a minor is business management and law and ethics. I get minimal homework and have straight As on the deans list just for participating. I came to Marymount a 2.8 GPA student and now have a 3.6. I love all my professors and really made strong relationships with them. Being in New York has endless possibilities. Comm classes are easy and class options are great. If you want to be a comm major, COME TO MARYMOUNT! Corey Liberman is the gem of the school and the best professor a student could ask for.  It's not right for everyone because it's a small school and it's a city campus. The school is very cliquey but If you're outgoing you'll have no problems making friends. last thing is if you want party life you need a fake ID but can still have fun without one just not as much. Any time I can gas up my school I do 100%"
Freshman,5,Marymount Manhattan is such an amazing school. Not only is it in the heart of NYC but it's the heart of NYC. This campus is so involved in the city life and the environment is amazing. Not only the faculty and staff rock but so do the students. I can't wait to attend this fall.
Sophomore,5,"great school, small classes, very diverse and accepting; located in NYC, close to central park, museums, etc."
Freshman,5,"Could have more rehearsal space, but, for a small liberal arts college, I've had an incredible experience."
College Freshman,5,So many job and internship opportunities it is NYC
College Sophomore,5,It's a really safe place considering the fact that it's in new york. A lot of it comes down to personal knowledge.
College Sophomore,5,Marymount is definitely what you make it. You either could have the time of your life or the worst time ever. Living in New York is harder than you think.
College Freshman,5,They really care about students and support students no matter what
College Freshman,5,I love the school! I love it's environment and I love the acceptance there is at the school!
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe going to my school. I have no doubt that as long as I'm there I should be safe
College Freshman,5,I visited the dorms when I first went to the visit the school and they are amazing! Although I am commuting I would recommend dorming
College Freshman,5,Seriously so diverse and everyone is very welcoming of basically anything.
College Freshman,5,"locations, locations, locations - everythng close by; from museums to Bed, Bath and Beyond to Whole Foods, restaurants, Theater District.  The Best Location for campus!"
College Freshman,5,they really carred about who you are!
College Freshman,5,"Go, go, go Marymount Griffins!!!!

Marymount is a small private liberal arts colege on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and everyone is an actor or dancer. So, the only real athletic facility at the school are the dance studios and theater which are phenomenal. The main dance studios are spacious and beautiful, and additional smaller studios, even though smaller in size still allow us to take class effectively!"
College Freshman,5,"The only real athletic facility at our school are the dance studios and theater which are superb. The main dance studios are spacious and beautiful, and the other smaller studios are smaller in size but allow us to take a class effectively."
College Freshman,5,"I feel great on campus since it's so small everyone can see what each person is doing. People stand up for one another when they see something going on and correct it. We are given a health and sexual assault rally when incoming freshman have their orientation week and are constantly getting emails about campus safety and new york city safety in general. The only thing I don't feel safe about would be the guards being discriminatory towards checking ID's, they will not check everyone who is white but will check for every single student of color, happens to be on a regular basis but not my friends."
College Junior,5,The internships are amazing here! One of the main reasons I chose this school.
College Freshman,5,The diversity and acceptance at Marymount Manhattan College is out of this world and amazing.
College Freshman,5,"The academics at Marymount Manhattan College are amazing. You can a combination of any major or minors you want at this school. They encourage you to study multiple things and I think this is amazing. For example, I am a BA Theatre Arts major with a concentration in Directing with a double minor in Psychology and Sociology. The opportunities at this school are endless."
College Freshman,5,Marymount Manhattan College has security on the main campus and at the dorms. This makes me feel safe around campus. This school is safe and that is thanks to the security.
College Freshman,5,I am currently a BA Theatre Arts major with a concentration in Directing at Marymount Manhattan College. The Theatre Arts alumni at this school are currently working on Broadway and all over television. This shows that a degree at this school is worth it and that alumni have been successful in their respected fields.
College Freshman,5,"The courses and professors at Marymount Manhattan College are amazing. The professors are passionate and knowledgeable about their fields. They desire for their students to succeed and this is shown in the classroom. The class sizes at this school are small and the professors know your name. Overall, I have enjoyed the classes I have taken at this school."
College Freshman,5,Marymount Manhattan College is the best college. I have enjoyed my first semester of college here greatly. I highly recommend this college to all. Thank you.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my college. The professors here have given me the opportunity to become a better version of myself. The best parts of the school are the dance program and the small campus community.
College Freshman,5,I love Marymount! I love Marymount! I love Marymount!
College Sophomore,5,Love the college I got too! Great for Performing Arts Majors!
College Freshman,5,"To get a degree in theater performing arts there is no better plance to go to than NYC scools, but being away just few block from a theater district, even better.  Before I chose where I want to go for my education I visited many colleges and review ther classes they offer.  marymount's unique approach to a students and their abilities giving me a comfort and belief that they will help me to prepare for successful theater carier."
College Sophomore,5,Received the Dean's Transfer Scholarship
College Freshman,5,"Since I go to college in New York City, my dorm is actually set up like an apartment. It offers the students bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen to each room. Additionally, on the lower levels of our 32 floor dorm (which is, in fact, named the highest dorm in the country), there is a fitness center, lounges, and even a convenience store. All of these aspects make living in campus housing very comfortable. I truly couldn't imagine being in any other type of space for my first year in the city. The dorm is a twenty minute walk from the school, but there is nothing wrong with that because it allows me to take a small detour of the city. I truly have wonderful living conditions through my school."
College Freshman,5,the dance department is the best thing about this school.  very enjoyable and an overall great program. so many opportunities are offered and the concentrations offered give everyone exactly what they want.  a program for every dancer
College Freshman,5,dance major. loving every minute of it. studios are great and the classes are amazing. the workload is necessary. internships and jobs are offered to all students
College Freshman,5,i have loved all the professors i have had so far.  they all really love what they teach and have their students best interests at heart.  the courses are challenging but in a good way.
College Freshman,5,"security is always at the desk, both at the dorms and at the school. the school takes safety very seriously."
College Freshman,5,I always feel extremely safe on campus and have not witnessed and form of sexual assault amongst the student body at MMC. However we are in NYC so you must always keep an eye open when out and about the city. Overall the college is very safe.
College Freshman,5,For my theatre arts major and minor in musical theatre MMC has one of the best programs out there for it. All of the professors are active in the theatre society and share their experiences with the students.
College Freshman,5,"NYC is the best location for education, entertainment, and growth. Love living here."
College Freshman,5,Wonderful opportunities available. Great training/education.
College Freshman,5,THERE'S FOOD EVERYWHERE YOU TURN! And you do so much walking that the freshman 15 isn't a problem.
College Freshman,5,All teachers motivate you to be the best you can be. I haven't had a truly terrible teacher yet!
College Freshman,5,"Most performing artists come to Marymount for two things: the training, and the name. Marymount has a GREAT reputation in the professional world, especially in theatre. Students will often get recruited right out of college or get the training they need to pick up work quickly."
College Freshman,5,"There aren't any parties in the Marymount dorms, but there are always some going on somewhere. The options are endless: bars, clubs, or other colleges in the area like NYU, Hunter, and Pace."
College Sophomore,5,NYC is amazing. Dosent really have to do with the school tho
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. It's easy to make friends and feel comfortable.
College Freshman,5,Try to live off campus
College Freshman,5,Both the school and dorms have a great and safe security system.
College Freshman,5,They are very detailed and always available to help!
College Freshman,5,There are a lot good of restaurants around the dorms and the school.
College Junior,5,I love Marymount everyone is very welcoming and the professors love to help.
Alum,4,"There is more of a concern about the arts/theater program, which is a given considering it is primarily a theater school. At the same time, they should give more recognition to the political science programs because Geraldine Ferrero did go there. Ultimately, it does strive to express the diversity and inclusion that they tout but there is still much for them to learn. Especially because there is no Jewish life at all there"
Alum,4,I’ll fill this out later. I promise. I want my response to be well thought out and not some banal response that spew forth like I am doing right this moment.
Freshman,4,I absolutely love the community created by faculty and students at Marymount. Everyone is so welcoming and encouraging which gives me the motivation to go to class everyday and makes me excited about learning new things everyday. One thing that I wish was improved at MMC would be communication throughout the whole community.
Freshman,4,"My experience thus far at Marymount has been nothing like what I expected. I had always planned to be on a campus with a very basic college scene. This is the exact opposite from that, having classes around NYC with a majority of focus on school. I learned to love the city and use it to my advantage. I have made amazing friends and connections with my teachers. I feel as if I am welcomed into the community that Marymount has built. I am a Musical Theatre major with a Business minor and am a member of the Honors College. The intensity of each program is amazing and perfectly balanced. I love this school. If I had to change some things I would expand it a bit since it is smaller than expected, but that is what makes everyone in the school so close. I would also love for the dining hall to be opened on the weekends so I can eat. In this situation, the goods totally outweigh the bad and I am so glad I chose to attend this college!"
Sophomore,4,I love it here. I am able to express myself . I have met some of my closest friends here at this school. My classes are small and I really get to know my professors. I was able to meet faculty members who truly care for me and who encourage me to do my best.
Senior,4,"Great school, staff, and resources. Claims to be diverse but is not. Very expensive if you don't get scholarships or financial aid."
Niche User,4,"Marymount Manhattan College is located in the heart of New York City. This makes your overall college experience so much more unique. Everything is close and at your fingertips. All of the programs are excellent. The put a really strong emphasis on their art programs like Dance and Musical Theatre. If you are interested in the arts or would like to go to college in the Big Apple, this is the school for you."
Sophomore,4,"MMC is a pretty good school. General Education professors are one of the downfalls, but the theatre department is pretty great and so are other departments like Communications and Biology. Do not recommend if you intend on getting a business degree."
Freshman,4,"So far it’s great, love the campus atmosphere and the diversity there. It feels good to be around people who understand and look like you."
Freshman,4,This college offers many internship opportunities and professors are very passionate and well educated in their fields. The staff and students are very welcoming and keep you motivated and on track for graduation.
Senior,4,"The location provides a great opportunity for students to bevy very familiar with  New York City.
Students in the performance majors have access to many venues to explore art fields.
The school will be more effective if there is an expansion on the facilities including more studios for dance, and voice lessons.
Students have to travel to different locations within the New York cities to attend dance and voice classes.
The college will be more comfortable for the students if the threre is an expansion of the facilities, It is over crowded. There are to many students in one building."
Alum,4,"This is a small college that is very dedicated to their arts programs. Located in the heart of NYC, there is nothing you can't do or experience here."
Junior,4,The school is very intimate which is great for teacher-student relationships. They do not offer many academic majors that other colleges would have because they are mostly an arts school.
Sophomore,4,Martmount Manhattan College is great as far as academics and professors.  It is also diverse and promotes all types of students to pursue their course of study with openness to their identity.
Senior,4,"The theatre program is excellent. If you like small schools, this is for you - there are only two buildings and a small student body. There isn’t really a campus, so if you want a traditional college experience it may not be the best choice."
Niche User,4,"Overall, this school is nice. I only attended one semester due to financial circumstances because it was too expensive. The classes were small and if you’re a person that’s serious about learning you can receive a lot more feedback and communicate well with your professors. Life as a student outside the classroom was okay for me. There aren’t any sports which was a downfall for me but they had a lot of activities that were worthwhile. Dorm life was nice and making friends was natural. If you’re thinking of attending this school I would suggest applying for scholarships/grants ahead of time and apply for work study - it’ll really help the cost of tuition if not given extensive financial aid. All in all, just being in New York City was a plus and Marymount served me well as a student even for just the short amount of time I was there."
Junior,4,"The school is very small, the professors are good. Marymount is lacking in the diversity of student life aspect. The food isn’t that great, but the classes are interesting, professors care for their students, and being in nyc, everything is within walking distance."
Sophomore,4,Fall 2017 was my first semester at Marymount Manhattan College as a transfer student. I love this school from all the diversity and groups of people i have met in my first four months. My professors were all very nice and dedicated to their students and their passion for teaching. I study communication arts and i love the program that Marymount has to offer here! My first 3 communication classes here has taught me a lot about the depths of interpersonal relationships and how to communicate effectively according to the dynamic of the relationship. I have made a best friend already and will hope to strive with good grades for my following semesters!
Junior,4,"So far I have enjoyed my time at Marymount Manhattan College. While the department I am in is small, I love that I am able to get to know my professors and peers on a personal level. Office hours are not necessary because the classes are small enough for everyone to ask questions in class. Also, the fact that the school in located in Manhattan helps me get amazing internships. I want to be a journalist and NYC is definitely the place to be. The lack of journalism classes at my school is balanced with the great location that allows infinite possibilities to network."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very supportive but idk yet
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe but it is NYC
College Freshman,4,The dorms are pretty good but the atmosphere is :)
College Freshman,4,I love the environment and staff but it is not me.
College Sophomore,4,It could definitely improve on some things but marymount is kind of like a really ugly dog thats so ugly its cute.
College Sophomore,4,many students stay  in the city after graduating
College Sophomore,4,great variety of the arts and plenty of museums to visit
College Freshman,4,"I haven't officially started going to Marymount yet, I'm starting in September as a Freshman but the overall energy of the school is amazing and very gay friendly! I feel safe there"
College Freshman,4,The variety of courses is great. It gives the students enough options to feel comfortable with their courses.
College Freshman,4,The career center is good.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,It is fun and very different from California schools and I am really enjoying my time here.
College Sophomore,4,"Though I originally preferred to live on a campus where dorms were within five minutes of class, being in the dorms here give you access to all of NYC and its boroughs, which truly outweighs the hassle of a twenty minute walk uptown. Security and RAs made me feel very safe and supported."
College Sophomore,4,"Almost every class I've taken thus far has provided an opportunity for me outside of the classroom, which is truly an test to the amazing faculty. Each one is so caring and ready to hear issues that students are having in order to effectively tackle them."
College Sophomore,4,Dorms were spacious but far from the school.
College Junior,4,I learn a lot from my professors!
College Junior,4,A very different experience for me. Smaller class sizes and students are very friendly.
College Sophomore,4,The only safety concerns would be anything that could potentially happen to any New Yorker.
College Sophomore,4,I hope to make connections in the dance world through Marymount.
College Sophomore,4,My program which I am majoring is the only reason I attend Marymount.
College Freshman,4,No crazy at the dorms which is great because we don't have to worry about noise problems. Off campus fun is very convenient and easy to find/get to
College Freshman,4,"Security is pretty strict both on campus and at the dorms. I have never felt unsafe at school or in the dorms, and have never witnessed any crime or assault between students."
College Freshman,4,"Although the tuition is very expensive, with enough scholarship money and financial aid, it is some what affordable. The dance department is great and the teachers are really amazing. Students at this school are very cliquey and I only consider a small handful of them to be my friends."
College Freshman,4,"The dance department really helps upperclassmen, especially seniors, go to auditions and find a job after graduation (or so it says on their website, I am only a freshmen and do not have first hand experience or proof of this)"
College Freshman,4,The school is located in a very nice area. The dance department is pretty great and the department staff are amazing.
College Freshman,4,"My interaction with professors have been amazing, they are kind and for the most part really care about teaching. If you can take a course with something that is specially specialized, these professors tend to have more passion for it and can make the classes way easier since they're structured. Something broad like writing 101, the professor can change whatever she feels like, take about whatever, and give you a grade solely based if she likes you or not. Since class sizes are no more than an average of 15 students it is very easy to stand out."
College Freshman,4,"Getting an internship at Marymount is beyond easy, since professors know you and depending on the lasting impression you leave on them, when the time comes and an opportunity for an internship is given to the professor you will be the first one to come to mind. Then there's also the career services center, Paul can help you find a great internship, help with your application and cover letter but the chances of getting those type of internships are slim. Here you need to have connections in order to get something good."
College Freshman,4,My experience at Marymount so far have been great. The courses and professors are very interested in learning from and teaching their students.
College Freshman,4,If you are in the Performing Arts majors or minors it is a great place to receive a degree. Marymount is known for their theatre training
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience has been great! Although the school itself is very expensive being that its a private school on the Upper East Side, I love the environment, the people, and the talent."
College Junior,4,Student to teacher ratio is great. It's easy to get along with professors. They are very knowledgeable about their respective subjects.
College Junior,4,I feel like going to the open house and introducing myself definitely helped with the admission decision. the school is very small so they do really care about you.
College Freshman,4,"I do not live in the dorms at Marymount Manhattan College. I live in my own place. Although I do not live in the dorms, I am at the 55th street dorms enough to give them a review. I have friends that live at the 55th street dorms and I hang out in their dorms sometimes. I have not been to the Cooper Sqaure dorms before. I enjoy the 55th street dorms and think there is a great social community at them."
College Freshman,4,"My professors were all skilled at what they were teaching. I had a total of 5 classes and I would say that 2 of them I didn't enjoy because 1 was boring (the NYC seminar that they require for freshmen) and the other I was confused on what assignments had to be turned in. The school focuses on the theatre and dance majors heavily (most of the students who attend are in those majors). I am a psychology major, but I didn't find my department to be lacking in anything. I was only able to take one major course requirement so I can't speak much on how good the psych department is yet because I am still at the beginning. The workload can be heavy if you don't have good time management skills. I had many books and articles to read for my classes, but I got through them with a high overall GPA. I would say that workload depends on who your professors are and how good they are. The registration process for classes wasn't the best in my opinion. The seniors got the register first which means classes will fill up before freshmen get to them. There was one course I was eager to take but all of the seats were taken by the time it was freshmen register day. Do not take winter courses here: I registered for an online course that was nearly $3,000...I quickly dropped the course. Financial aid and scholarships do not cover the winter courses at all. Consider taking courses at a CUNY throughout the year if you can to cut the costs and graduate early. Overall I found the curriculum to be challenging and thought provoking (this may have to do with the professors I had)."
College Freshman,4,Campus housing has 24 hour security that can assist students. The housing also comes with its own health center.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is great with caring teachers, however, it is really small. While this can create intimate relationships with teachers it can also limit opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"Marymount Manhattan is alright, it can be quite cliqy"
College Freshman,4,"I am an International Student majoring in Dance. Living in a huge city such as New York, has been the best part of my college experience. There is always something to do, and I am surrounded by culture and art. There are also amazing internship and working opportunities, and walking around the city is just a treat by itself. My favourite experiences include being able to meet and connect with professionals in the dance world. 

My school is a small community with no more than 2,000 students. This allows me to have a close family and be part of a secure, accepting community, at the same time I explore on of the biggest cities in the world. 

Furthermore, the dance and theatre programs are very professional, and I have learned so much just by being surrounded by the love of art.

If I could do it all over, I would not do anything differently. Sure, dorm life and being away from home and my culture is hard, but I wouldn't trade anything for the opportunity of being a dancer in New York."
College Freshman,4,"The schools class sizes are ridiculously small & I find that I learn better that way as opposed to a giant lecture hall. Most classes are about 2 hours & 40-50 mins so it can get a little exhausting but those classes only meet once a week & the shorter ones which are about an hour and 20 minutes meet twice a week, the scheduling is pretty lax. You can feel a sense of community, everyone thats there is paying a lot of money to go there so they're really making the best out of it. There are not only New Yorkers such as myself attending either which gives such a new perspective in the classroom. There are kids from all over the world, from every continent, as well as close to home like Connecticut and New Jersey. It looks like a chic art gallery as well which is nice to walk into especially if you have an 8:30 like me haha. Musical theatre kids have the time of their lives here, theres raffles for free broadway tickets and they have Broadway at their disposal as well as Off-Broadway productions and tons of private shows of many different varieties as well."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy eating off campus and although it isn't worth screaming about, its usually easy and tastes pretty good."
College Freshman,4,"I like living on campus because everything is easily accessible and I can make the most out of my experience. Its hard to dorm sometimes because it seems very crowded and overwhelming, but you get used to this very easily."
Freshman,2,"I had some professors that were very on top of everything and were always holding zoom classes and I had other professors (mostly the adjuncts) who just dropped off the map and sent us an email maybe once every two weeks to tell us an assignment was due. The communication from the administration was there but its didn't feel like enough. Many of the student services were doing their all to support us which I really appreciated. Between the games, quizzes, and meetings it was a lot of fun in that regard, but the academics felt like a hugewaste of my time and money."
Freshman,2,"After touring MMC during my junior year of high school I fell head over heels in love with every aspect of the school and just knew it was where I needed to be. I applied and committed a week after getting my acceptance. I was a Public Relations major but I adore all things musical theatre so I expected to find my people here. Much to my surprise, just a few weeks into my first semester everything fell apart. The school is so full of cliques that if you don't meet people during welcome week or you're not in a performing arts major it becomes impossible to make friends, there's hardly any clubs and many of them won't email you even if you put your name on their lists, and the classes are SO easy. I wasn't great academically in high school, but I didn't do bad, and every class I took at MMC required me to put in no effort to do well. I do think this is a great place if you're going into the performing arts, but otherwise it isn't worth the money for a lackluster experience and faculty."
Freshman,2,Social scene is reminiscent of High School. Don’t go unless you are white and gay and want to be a working actor in NYC. No bueno.
Sophomore,2,"I love my program at Marymount. If you're a dance, theatre, or communication major, chances are you are going to have a good academic experience here. A lot of the teachers here are adjunct, so some of them care a lot, and some of them don't care at all. The professors here, however, are amazing. The student body is probably what would get me to transfer, though. If you're a straight white male, then chances are you will be discriminated against by other students. The college brags about diversity but in terms of financial and race diversity, I would say it's mostly middle class white people. The diversity comes in with how they are willing to talk about events, and in LGBTQ diversity. Overall it's the classes that are keeping me here, and the students that are driving me away."
Freshman,2,"I attended Marymount for the 2018-2019 school year, before successfully transferring out. While I would be remiss to omit positive aspects of the school, the year was marred with poor experiences with professors, below-average classes, and an overall toxic school culture. I would avoid this institution if: 1) You do not consider yourself a ""Type-A"" personality. 2) You do not plan on majoring in Musical Theater, Acting, or Dance. 3) You want to attend college with the goal of bettering yourself and gaining knowledge."
Sophomore,2,"This college really just does not care about its students.... Seriously. We have a shortage of classes, not enough support/resources, and a faculty full of by the book, uninterested, and lazy professors. The students here are shallow, rude, and frankly untalented. Ever since day one, I knew that I hated it here. Don't worry though, once you drop out and do anything notable, they'll make sure to take full and exclusive credit for your accomplishments."
Junior,2,"Yes, diversity is very strong but only surface level. EVERYONE accept one person i met out of the 2 semesters is a hard core democrat that will witch hunt you if you have different views. It's a very strong ""safe space"" place which makes me feel like I'm in high school and I have to watch out for everyone's feelings even though we are all adults. Very cliquey, very superficial, very high school."
Niche User,2,"I liked the walk to my classes.  I liked all the places I could get food in town.  I did not like the dorm.  I had horrible roommates, which were messy and sloppy.  The survey to find a roommate was horrible because they matched me up with horrible people, who ended up getting kicked out for doing marijuana and drinking."
Sophomore,2,"The professors were unreliable, and hard to communicate with. Four out of my five professors in my first year at MMC did not follow with their grading policies, were incredibly vague about assignments, and gave tests that included information we had not yet learned. Most professors are very strict about attendence, and openly play favorites. I had a professor who spoke harshly behind the backs of every student who had missed class that day, and was openly rude to them when they came back. I appreciate that the school has a strong theater and dance department,  but if you are not associated with either theater or dance, you are belittled by other students, even some faculty and not taken seriously. The classes are not too difficult, most professors tend to lecture and get off topic quickly, but exams, essays and projects tend to be detailed and require a lot of preparation that you most likely will not have recieved from the class itself."
Sophomore,2,"The tuition is too high for the quality of education and the lack of activities offered. I'm a commuter to the school & I received two in school scholarships this semester and still had $10,000 in loans from just ONE semester & I come from a low income household.  Other people have complained that the academics are weak, but I believe the academics are fine where they are. Some professors make the work more manageable. There are no sports teams or greek life. I love the small class sizes and the overall small size of the school because I get more time with professors and attention in class. The location is great. There is a strong lack of racial diversity as the vast majority of the school is white & female (I often the only male and person of color in my classes). Its pretty much a performing arts school and I am a psychology major. Its also fairly cliquey and not what I expected college to be like at all. Theres no dating scene. This will be my last semester here."
Freshman,2,"This is the most unaccepting place I have ever been. The amount of disrespect at this school is astounding. Yes, we have a diverse community but most of the people here are rude and disrespectful. Unless you are a bratty, over privileged white girl or gay guy, you won't fit in. There are cliques and judgement everywhere you turn on this campus. I thought I would love it here, I toured and thought ""Yes! This is my place."" I was wrong. The people here are awful."
College Freshman,2,"So far from what I have noticed, there is no greek life"
College Freshman,2,"The living situations at Marymount are very poor, the commute to school can take on average about a 20-40 minute walk depending on weather, foot traffic, and lights stopping you on every block. The dorms itself are very old and nasty looking, definitely needs some renovations. The dorms are even more expensive then your average New York apartment (1,600$ a month average for dorms). The only bright side of living in the dorms is the view, gotta love a great view of the city."
College Freshman,2,"The school is highly accepting of the gay, lesbian, LGBTQ community; the school largely fits into this category, making it not so much a minority. Political beliefs seem to majorly be liberal. Little diversity, most students make up stereotypical minorities, making them the majority at this school."
College Freshman,2,"The school is in a good location for prospective internships/jobs, however the school's action in this is unclear."
College Freshman,2,"Most professors are adjunct and not distinguished in their respective fields. Courses are extremely easy and hardly challenging. Most academic focus is on the performing arts sector, other fields are considered minorities. Class sizes are small, which is nice. There are a wide variety of courses, however many don't seem relevant."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, this school is meant for a very specific type of person. I wouldn't choose this school again due to its lack of diversity and opportunity. Unless you fit into a specific mold, which makes this the dream school, the experience here is very unsatisfying. Although the school preaches diversity, it promotes one area over all others, theatre and performing arts."
College Freshman,2,I enjoyed my classes and the professors I had for this past semester. I found my classes challenging and thought provoking. Really what I enjoy about the school are the small class sizes and opportunities for personal attention. The tuition and housing is far too much money which is why I had to settle for commuting to cut the overall cost down. The dorms are about 20 blocks from the school. The school grant they gave me was horrible and my financial aid was not anywhere near enough to take the cost weight off of me. I wish the school had more clubs available for students to really socialize and get together. Sports teams would've been a plus. There's no racial diversity amongst the students body and the school is almost like an all girls school. Most of the attention is given to the performing arts majors. I wouldn't choose Marymount to attend if I could go back in time. It was my safety school and last option.
College Freshman,2,I thought I would enjoy a small school that doesn't give you the full college experience but I don't.
College Freshman,2,"Based on my experience with the school, the performing arts majors are the only ones that seem to have courses that are fairly difficult. Everyone else has classes that are simply too easy to be taken seriously."
College Freshman,2,"This school offers students with many exciting opportunities to take advantage of - whether it be tickets to a hit Broadway show or an internship at The Tonight Show. Most professors are well-trained in their respected fields, frequently hold office hours, and offer assistance to any struggling student. The campus is equipped with several classrooms, studios, and laboratories - as well as it's own theater. The school boasts one of the best dance and musical theater programs in New York City. 

   With that being said, do not go to this school if you are looking for a non-performing arts degree. The school focuses its attention on performing arts programs almost entirely. As a first-year student, I had no idea what to expect from the school - let alone college. After a few weeks, my honeymoon phase with the college began to wear off. After a month, I came to the grinding realization that my first year in college simply felt like just another grade of high school. 

   Many classes (that aren't performing arts) offer courseloads that are easy - suspiciously easy, I should say. As much as I loved my writing seminar professor, the class was simply a reiteration of what I had learned in my high school English class last year. There's a reason why the transfer rate is so high - and unfortunately, it's only taken me until a few days ago to figure out why. If you're looking for a school that will stimulate you mentally and socially, please look further."
College Freshman,2,This school does not have a wide variety of academics and all classes are way too easy.
College Freshman,2,The boosts of it's notable alumni but the alumni are just a few lucky celebrities. Everyone in the city knows a degree from Marymount Manhattan is a joke.
College Freshman,2,"I can't see this school being a good fit for anyone who isn't a musical theater major. I'm in the comm arts program and there are only a limited number of full-time professors there. Most are very helpful and kind. General education classes are a joke. They're way too easy and it's almost insulting. Very few professors seem to actually care about their students or simply dismiss them as being ""artsy"" and unable to learn scientific or mathematical material. Speaking of, Marymount should not be considered a ""liberal arts education"" because their courses do not allow you to be well rounded. As for the students that go here, most are cliquey and annoying. Most are very superficial and only want to talk about celebrity sitings or musical theater. Don't come here if you enjoy deep and substantial conversations with your class mates. All genuine people usually transfer out the first year. The dorms are bad and extremely strict. Additionally, there is no party scene. Don't come here if you expect to learn or socialize. This school is only a good fit for very few."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not much of a partier any more because I the school kinda ruined it for me, which has its ups and downs."
College Freshman,2,I get sick of eating here sometimes and I think that speaks for itself.
College Freshman,2,you are on your own.
College Freshman,2,"the resident life is the worst thing about this school.  the strictness is unbelievable.  you cant breathe without them saying its okay.(thats a joke) but in all seriousness they are very strict.  visitation and overnight guests are strictly monitored and the drug/ alcohol policy is zero tolerance.  if you are caught with either you are fined and threatened with eviction.  if you forget to fill out the overnight guest form they will throw your guest out, regardless of whether or not they have somewhere else to go.  safety is one thing, but mmc's policies are too strict."
College Freshman,2,"The only nightlife at mmc is outside of the dorms. i.e bars, clubs, hookah bars, etc.  The dorms have a zero tolerance policy."
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes I feel like the Residence Advisors treat us like kids instead of the grown ups we should be treated as, since we are already in college."
College Freshman,2,It's not that focused on sports. It's a performing arts school.
College Freshman,2,"This school is focused on the arts. The school has some athletic clubs, like soccer and football, but those are more like hobbies than anything else."
College Freshman,2,It's New York City. Off campus housing is going to be expensive. Although on campus housing costs about the same. We have one of the highest room and board rates here at the mount.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't really a ""campus"", so there isn't really campus security. The college is just two buildings in Manhattan, so you're kind of on your own. The school's security people are very nice, but the dorm security workers are generally rude and off-putting. The extent of our ""security"" is someone checking our ID when entering a building or yelling at us when we forget our room key."
College Freshman,2,"It's very strict and limiting - it feels like you're at sleep-away camp because you have very little freedom (both in personal life, academic course of action, etc. etc.). However, the administration is also oddly disorganized and inconsistent, making it difficult to follow their rules. Ultimately, they're very disorganized and very strict."
College Freshman,2,"To be honest, the academics at this school are greatly lacking. The theater classes are adequate, but general education classes/other programs are truly awful. Do not come to this school for the academics - the 80% acceptance rate (which is rising) should show you that it's not a school for intellectuals. I assumed it would compensate with theater classes, internships, and other opportunities, but the extremely low level of the education is honestly despicable. It feels like you're in eighth grade. Additionally, they're constantly cutting programs and even entire majors with little warning - for instance, they recently cut the Theater Education Major, leaving many students unsure of what to do with their unfinished degrees and unaccredited courses. The academics are truly awful - definitely below average, as shown by test scores and the general intellect  and lack of academic acumen of the student body. This is not a school that smart students go to - the intellectuals who go here generally transfer out within their first year."
College Freshman,2,"The process of getting into the theater program is relatively easy - it's similar to an acting class (you get feedback and are expected to work with it). However, the professors are generally very intimidating and cold during the process - one specifically even made two students cry during my audition. Additionally, the process is confusing and disorganized - both regarding scheduling and execution. They probably accept more people than they should - in fact, they admitted to doing that last year, so they're now compensating by accepting VERY FEW people into theater programs for the coming year. All in all, it's very stressful and very disorganized."
College Sophomore,2,"They only focus on the arts. They are cutting academic programs, while students are still in them."
College Freshman,2,"It's been a struggle.  I have no family support and work full time, but I still don't qualify for the help I need."
College Junior,2,Um  there is no athletic's on campus. but you could always play some stuff at central park.
College Freshman,2,We only have 2 place to eat off campus. One is very pricey and they other is very diverse.
College Sophomore,2,I cannot find a language program!
College Sophomore,2,We need more discounts because eating at one place all of the time is tiring
College Sophomore,2,I have seen students reeking of alcohol and weed falling over in the elevators and acting crazy.
College Freshman,2,there are no straight guys -___-
College Senior,2,Way overpriced to live near-by. Better off commuting.
College Senior,2,Not much to do around campus at all.
College Freshman,2,very poor tech support and wifi.
College Freshman,2,very overpriced and poor quality / servings.
College Freshman,2,they're not very helpful or supportive and the services are very slow and confusing.
College Freshman,2,city living at its finest
College Sophomore,2,Drugs and Alcohol are not permitted in the residence hall.
College Sophomore,2,Food is decent however very expensive. It is easy to use the meal plan.
College Sophomore,2,I am an intenational student and received minimal scholarships and no FAFSA financial aid. It was easy to receive the minimum however it is an expensive school and am in the process of looking for more ways to receive aid.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know what the qualifications are to get a serious scholarship at this school is. I've only heard of a couple of kids receiving small scholarships to this school, and they were theatre students."
College Sophomore,2,"There is NO nightlife at Marymont whatsoever. No dorm parties, no house parties, no student club activities, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. However, if you know kids at other schools in the city, you can have fun with them. And if you look really hard, you'll find fun clubs, hookah bars, and bars that don't card. Unfortunately, you have to go off campus to have fun 90% of the time."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at Marymount are not even dorms, they're more like apartments. You'll usually have 3-7 people (including yourself) in a suite. There's one bathroom and a kitchen with a stove, microwave, refrigerator, freezer, cabinets, and a sink. They're not traditional college dorms.
Dorming at Marymount pretty much sucks. The rules are BEYOND strict. If you want to have an overnight guest they have to be 18 or over and you have to get a form that provides the RA office with your overnight guest's personal info, and you have to get signatures from your roommates on the form that signifies they're okay with your guest staying over. Once or twice a semester your RA is required to search your rooms for anything ""dangerous"" (meaning drugs or alcohol) and this is seriously inconvenient. Honestly, dorming is good for meeting people and that's it, there are no dorm parties or anything. This place is a fortress."
College Sophomore,2,"Marymount is mostly made up of white people. However, its diverse in the sense that there are a lot of gay people that go to the school. I am an African-American person, and I was one of the few at Marymount. My best guess is that Marymount is like 6% Black, maybe somewhere around 68% white, and 13% Hispanic. Hispanics are the second largest race population at Marymount. In terms of skin-color, Marymount isn't diverse at all. In terms of personality, you'll find many different kinds of people at Marymount, interesting people. Most of them are theatre junkies, but once you see past that, there are other interesting sorts that are here."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of Marymount's clubs and organizations are not exciting and they're not active enough. There's also no school spirit whatsoever. The lack of student involvement is for some reason, very bothersome to me. Many of the students here go to other schools like NYU or Fordham, and other schools to join in their events. Though I do like going to other schools, meeting new people, and even being apart of their events, I would like to do the same at my school, but MMC fails to do so.  I do however like the fact that Marymount is a small school and that the class sizes are small. The professors are great and helpful, there are good internship opportunities, and the fact that its in NYC. All of these factors are what initially attracted me to the school, but now that I'm here I realize that's all the school has going for it. There's no true sense of community."
College Sophomore,2,Very difficult to receive financial aid and scholarships combined with an expensive school
Niche User,1,"is basically a pyramid scheme to take all your money, promises a lot up front but delivers on almost nothing. clearly does not care about students or student success. Just want your money."
Freshman,1,"mmc was my dream school for theatre since sophomore year of high school. I was super excited to attend because I had a great experience auditioning/touring. when I actually got to school, the environment felt so different than the touring/auditioning environment. this school is one big clique and if you were pretty and popular in high school, you’ll fit right in. if not, you won’t. I was not one of those people in high school so my experience was so terrible that I’m transferring this spring after my first semester. most of my professors were full of themselves and were rude and condescending. the student body is prissy and uptight and privileged white girls. I genuinely cannot believe how rude some of the faculty were towards me and I really should have paid attention to their graduation rate. no wonder so many people transfer."
Freshman,1,Horrible mean people go here.  I cannot believe how terrible the environment is at MMC. Transferring to a different school with normal nice students
Freshman,1,Don't waste your money. Spent my freshman year here and will not be returning in September. You can never get a hold of a person in financial aid and if you are not in one the theare or dance program you will not get the same treatment.
Freshman,1,"To start, this school has outrageous tuition for a school that can't provide adequate dorms and other facilities. The dorms are so ugly and rundown (specific to 55th Street) and feel extremely untidy (dusty, musty, etc). The main campus is of the same degree,  it's all just very disappointing, you are paying for the city itself--not the school. Secondly, the students here are a different breed of annoying and entitled. Some of them carry themselves with such a high degree of superiority which can be unnerving if you are a POC like myself. Most of the students I've interacted with were loud, rude and inconsiderate; they love to take every chance they get to demonstrate how much better they are at everything than you are, again, very unnerving if you are POC as most of the students here are not. Could go on and on but character limits say otherwise."
Freshman,1,"awful school, was tempted to write N/A for academics, as every class I took was one I had taken in middle school. An absolute waste of money, I learnt nothing, paid 30,000 dollars to relive middle school, fron the social scene to the classes. 0/10, would not recommend"
Freshman,1,"If you are a wealthy, white female or a white gay guy who is a performer and loves belittling people then this is the school for you. I could not keep up with disgraceful pace of hate and ignorance to real world problems. The lack of community and shared space seemed to damper the mood at any lame school event. When withdrawing, I went through five people working at the school who all gave me different answers on how to withdraw. When I finally got home, I had to call three times, not including the times I called with no answer, for someone to explain to me how to request transcripts. Also for such high tuition the library computers are always full, the wifi does not work well and there is limited lounge area at the school. You would think that because the school has such a high rate of students transferring out that the credits would be easy to transfer but unfortunately they aren't. Now I have to pick up extra classes at my new college just to catch up on such a waste of time."
College Sophomore,1,There are sororities and fraternities in the city of new york but there aren't any dedicated to specifically marymount. Some of the majors themselves act similarly to Greek life but it just depends.
College Sophomore,1,If you actually expect any sort of sports theres a soccer club that somehow exists and then there's a flag football game in the fall and a volleyball game in the spring. That's it.
College Sophomore,1,My school does not have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,My school does not have sports.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have any type of greek life and the college is too small to do so.
College Sophomore,1,There are no athletics at Marymount and there is only a soccer club.
College Freshman,1,"There is no party scene at this school, and if this is important, you will severely lack in this area. Most nightlife occurs outside of the school and is difficult to access."
College Freshman,1,"There is a dry campus, so there is no nightlife on campus. It is hard to integrate into other college scenes unless you know someone. If you plan on partying it is necessary to have a fake ID in order to access the ""party scene"" of NYC. Public transportation makes it very easy."
College Freshman,1,The school is very liberal and accepting of LGBT students. There is hardly any racial diversity going on here. Most of the students are white and the school is 80% female. On my first day of orientation I felt like I was at an all-white all-girls school. There is a lot to be done about the lack of racial diversity which is odd for a school located in NYC.
College Freshman,1,"The campus housing is so overpriced. I was looking to dorm even though I live in NYC just to experience the social aspect of college. I am told that there are at least 4 people living in a single dorm, having guests over is difficult, and the policies are strict. If you want to save money you should just commute or rent an apartment."
College Freshman,1,"There is no party scene here, but I'm sure you can find parties to attending at other colleges/universities nearby and it is NYC so there are places to head over to. From what I hear, the dorms are pretty much on lockdown when it comes to allowing guests over and having parties."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene available at the school. You'd have to head to a different school to find one.
College Freshman,1,There are no sports teams. There is a coed soccer team and one flag football game during the semester. The school is really just a performing arts school. I'm not sure whether or not they would benefit so much adding sports teams because this is a small school and most of the students are dance/theatre majors. Not having sports teams here is a con for me.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,"The school has many clubs and organizations you can ""pledge to"". Otherwise, there's no room for Greek Life."
College Freshman,1,Athletics is to Marymount Manhattan what low confidence is to Kayne West. It doesn't exist.
College Freshman,1,"This school is way to easy. If you have half a brain and want to learn, don't come here. Most of the students are lazy and don't want to put in any effort to their studies. It's extremely discouraging to see. Worst of all, none of the professors seem to care."
College Freshman,1,"Housing is awful. The minimum amount of people to a dorm is four and you can have up to eight. You never get time to yourself. Additionally, because almost everyone is a musical theater major, you can always count on hearing at least one person on your floor singing to the top of their lungs. The building itself is in the worst area for young people. There is nothing to do in Midtown East. The bathrooms and floors are gross and the dorm policies are ridiculously strict. The process of getting an overnight guest approved is such a headache. Moving in and out of the dorms is also a nightmare."
College Freshman,1,We have absolutely no athletics department. The only thing we have that's close is a club soccer team that really no one participates in. There's nothing.
College Freshman,1,"Since Marymount is a small liberal arts school, it really has no parties.If I want to go out for a night, it's because I found something myself and it does not even regard my school. This has made me feel like my college experience is not as fun as it could have been if I went to another school. I really feel like I'm missing out on the nightlife scene because my school lacks connections."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have sports at Marymount. We have a soccer ""team"" that competes with the New School, but it's kind of lame."
College Freshman,1,Very strict penalties for underage drinking and drug use. Sometimes innocent roommates have gotten in trouble even after telling their roommates not to bring paraphernalia into the dorms.
College Freshman,1,"It is very difficult to party here. The RA's and the rules are very strict. Many people party in the dorms but need to be super careful, but most go out. It's especially hard in the winter, because most of the time it isn't guaranteed that bars will let students in. That's when it's most frustrating."
College Freshman,1,no sports at all.  definitely not the school for sports.
College Freshman,1,there is no Greek Life in Marymount Manhattan College. At least none that I know of.
College Freshman,1,"NO PARTIES. It sucks. I mean, you could try to find a bar that doesn't card, go to an upperclassman's tiny apartment, or go ALL THE WAY DOWNTOWN to an NYU Party, but it's just not the same. It kind of sucks - it's so bad that some people literally go to New Jersey for parties."
College Freshman,1,"There is literally no Greek Life - the school does not have frats or sororities (or any clubs, student bonding experiences, etc. etc.). Do not come to this school if you're looking for the traditional college experience - Greek Life included."
College Freshman,1,"The school provides no off-campus housing, nor does it help students to find it. This is hugely unfortunate given how expensive, competitive, complicated, and difficult Manhattan real-estate can be."
College Sophomore,1,You can't do anything in the dorms drinking or drug use will get you fined or removed from the dorms. RA's do nightly rounds to check on you. Most students won't go out during the week/ won't party at all.
College Junior,1,"No Greek life, this is an liberal arts school that mostly focuses on the arts, if you want a Greek school go to Rutgers."
College Junior,1,"What scholarships?  MMC has the worst finical aid because it's such a small school and it's private on top of that so the government doesn't fund it. I had to commute because the dorm was too expensive and the finical aid people did not care that i couldn't pay the money. so my advice to you is that, don't even bother dorming, just get an apartment it's much damn cheaper anyways."
College Junior,1,"Well it's NYC people. What do you expect? its the upper east side Manhattan. There is never any parking and if you really want to park then you have to pay 15.00 bucks, so i would recommend using the subway or riding your bike."
College Freshman,1,The school has no nightlife scene at all. If you want to party you must go else where. Its also hard to find parties because we do not have close relations to many other colleges around us.
College Freshman,1,We dont have off campus housing. If you want to live off campus thats all on your part.
College Freshman,1,Because we are in the city we do not have special parking
College Sophomore,1,There are not enough scholarships and grants available....EVERYTHING IS A STUPID CONTEST....THAT IS NOT FAIR AT ALL!!
College Sophomore,1,This doesn't apply to me.
College Freshman,1,We have no greek life. It's non-existent
College Freshman,1,We have no sports or even a decent gym!
College Senior,1,"Talent scholarships are a joke as they are given during the admittance audition. And an academic scholarship is appallingly small. Coming from a relatively normal, middle class background, I got VERY little financial support from Marymount. Financial Aid/Student Services offices are rarely helpful. "
College Sophomore,1,No nightlife exists on campus. Must go around the city.
College Sophomore,1,Affects the walking commute to school. Not fun when it is raining or snowing.
College Sophomore,1,There's no parking here. There are parking lots that don't belong to the school. Parking is ridiculously expensive and time consuming if you're parking on the streets. Don't bring your car here. Public Transportation is the way to go for sure.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no sports going on at Marymount, and if there are sports, i've never heard of them."
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties at the dorms. It sucks. However, if you look hard enough, you'll find some bars and pubs across town that don't card."
College Freshman,1,"The RAs are really strict at the 55th Street Residence Hall. No parties, quiet hours are always taken seriously... yawn. You pay an awful lot of money to be treated like children at Marymount...."
College Junior,1,Marymount Manhattan College does not have a gym so there are no sports teams. If you are interested in doing a sport you can start a club and go to a gym off campus. There are a few weight rooms on campus though.
College Sophomore,1,There Is None – there is none. SORRY GUYS. .......................
College Sophomore,1,Not So Great – I have not had a good experience at Marymount. I was told I was going to be able to get dance classes and I was never allowed to take them. You can only take classes in your major which is very frustrating and limiting. The academic classes are not challenging or inspiring. I hate the rule that you can only miss two classes without lowering a grade especially when classes are such a joke. I would have rather taken dance classes in the city and just show up to class when we had a test. The student body does not care much about school. Clubs and activities have few participants because they are competing with the city. I took honors classes and was in leadership groups and even those students really did not seem to care.
College Sophomore,1,New York City – You can park in garages on the city or try to find a place on the street the school itself does not have any parking just for students. You do not need a car if you live in the city
College Sophomore,1,Marymount academics are not challenging. If you are looking for a school with intensive training in dance and theater and easy academics then Marymount is for you. Most students do not care about academics and do not try very hard. There have been days when I have gone into class and I was the only one who did the reading so we could not even have a discussion. I found this very frustrating but if that is what you are looking for in a college experience then Marymount would be a great choice. I took a lecture psychology 101 class that I enjoyed. Class sizes are small which would be nice for discussions if students do the work. The ballroom class was a fun academic class. It combines history with dance and you get to make up a scene to present your history and dance skills. The atmosphere reminds me of high school.
College Sophomore,1,No Sports – We have some sports clubs but that's it. Like most clubs on campus I doubt many people go

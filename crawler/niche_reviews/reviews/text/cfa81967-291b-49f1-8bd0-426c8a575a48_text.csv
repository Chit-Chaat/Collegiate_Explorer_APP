Sophomore,5,"Concordia is my home away from home. It is such a welcoming community. I've met so many new friends here that are so kind, caring, and helpful. The class sizes are small enough that you get to know each and every one of your professors. The professors strive to create relationships with every one of their students. By doing so, they are able to create a classroom environment where the most effective learning can take place. Concordia truly is my second home!"
Junior,5,"I have taken classes online and I enjoyed them. They're nice because most of them I can do at my own pace, which is really great."
Sophomore,5,I love my school! There is something about having a small campus and Christian attitude and view that makes the school feel like home and you have a second family. I have made some of my best friends here and I wouldn't change my experience for anything. The professors are all reasonable and want to work with you to help you succeed. The town helps support the college students and you can still find things to do even though it's a relatively small town.
Graduate Student,5,I love my online program for Graduate School. It is easy to follow and the professors have all been fantastic!
Graduate Student,5,All of my classes are online. It has been a great experience and it has flown by. I am currently two classes away from my Master’s degree!
Alum,5,I transferred to Concordia from a larger University and really made a wonderful choice as the classes where smaller which meant that I did not get lost in a sea of faces. Plus I really grew as a person and Christian.
Sophomore,5,The professors really care about how well you do and want you to succeed. The ability to worship Christ on a daily basis is a wonderful opportunity and one that should not be taken for granted
Freshman,5,Concordia is a smaller school which is what I love about it.  Smaller class sizes allows me to get to know my professors better and allows me to be better academically.
Niche User,5,My experience at Concordia University was beyond terrific. Their football is newly done and looks excellent. They were very friendly and outgoing with information. Their campus is absolutely gorgeous from the creek that runs right through it to the new science building it a terrific place. I can't explain how nice the grass is it looks like a million dollar golf course. This place is just beyond excellent.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere here is very welcoming and everyone is friendly. It's a very beautiful campus especially during the fall months. The classes are challenging, but the professor are always willing to give you a helping hand."
Freshman,5,It is very family oriented and religious. They carry on the values which I was raised and are deeply important to me and my spiritual growth. They also have an excellent academic program. I want to get into coaching/teaching and I feel that this school has the perfect curriculum for that.
Freshman,5,"It is the best college in the world. NO CAP! You will not regret going to this university. The academics are outstanding and the campus is beautiful. Also, the students are very kind, helpful, and diverse."
Freshman,5,I really like the size of the school and the class size. It's a small school with a BIG campus atmosphere!
Freshman,5,"What I like about Concordia is the community that surrounds the school in Seward, Nebraska. All of the employees at the shops around town are so welcoming, creating a very homey environment for those students who are looking at studying out of state. In addition, the faculty at Concordia Nebraska are all so amazing and personable, each student will feel loved and appreciated in the classroom, no matter the subject or the academic performance of the student."
Freshman,5,Friendly students and professors have your back just need recognize when to ask for help. Food is pretty good but no much variety until spring when more potential students are visiting the campus.
Freshman,5,I love Concordia.  I value a Lutheran perspective as well as a first class education.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful.
Niche User,5,"I am about to visit Concordia University, Nebraska in about two weeks because of athletics. I talked to the coach over the phone  and he was genuinely very nice and I learned a lot of information on the school. I am personally wanting to major in chemistry to eventually get my master's and go in to the field of forensic science. I learned that the Chemistry  professor is/was (I'm not sure) in the FBI which would help me personally be able to get my bachelor's in chemistry but also learn specifically about forensic science to be more successful. One thing I love about the school generally is that there are small class sizes. Small class sizes make for an easier environment to get extra personal help from teachers during class time. Huge classes are more for people who can do everything mostly individually because it would be harder to get one on one help from the teacher."
Niche User,5,"All around the college is very great. The professors are open to questions or concerns and with the smaller class sizes it makes it easier to connect with them. The food, housing and campus is very upscale and has a very positive feeling. While keeping it upscale and modern, the university keeps some of its very original buildings to accent the modern interior. It is obvious that the college and faculty care about the students and are committed to helping them learn."
Niche User,5,I loved Concordia University in Nebraska. Very nice people and a very clean state and area around the college. I liked that the area the university is in is one of the top safest towns in Nebraska. I don't think anything needs to change
Junior,5,"Concordia has an absolutely amazing atmosphere with teachers and staff that truly care. I am able to get a great education while surrounding myself with kind, caring, driven students. Concordia is a home away from home!"
Freshman,5,"I play football there and the team is great, campus is okay, and everyone there is friendly. What really made my first semester there good were my friends, they helped me get through a lot. Being it was only about 15 black people there we stuck together but they made it fun for me. one of the best experiences of my life. college will bring out the best and the worst of you."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Concordia, and my freshman year was amazing. Concordia has a strong Christ-centered community, and Professors who get to know you on a personal level. The campus has all the resources you need, and people who care about your success as much as you do."
Freshman,5,It has a great sense of community and wonderful people.  The professors really make sure you are not just a number.  There are a bunch of different activities to participate in or even watch.
Freshman,5,"Concordia University - Seward is one place where you always feel at home. The atmosphere created by the staff and students on campus is one that rivals nearly all top schools in the country. The academics here are top notch and the faculty is always willing to put in extra hours to assist you on your journey. Also, the community is extremely supportive and safe. Seward has one of the lowest crime rates for a city in the entire state. Many of the people in admissions are always trying to help you find ways to pay for college and assist you along your path to success. I am very proud to say I am a Bulldog. There is no place like Concordia."
Freshman,5,"The community of Concordia and Seward Nebraska is amazing and the professors are engaged in your success.  As a Christ-centered University, Concordia is a great place for those who wish to advance there faith life and grow in their relationship with Christ.  I am a graphic design major and spend a great deal of time in the art building.  Again, the sense of community is phenomenal, especially in the art department.  I never want to leave the art building with such great support and constructive criticism from the freshman to the upperclassmen.  The art professors art approachable and want you to become the best artist you can.  There is even an annual student art show.  All art majors have the opportunity to have work in the show."
Freshman,5,"It is the friendliest campus I have ever been a part of. The professors have more one on one time with students and care about the students, not only absorbing the material, but understanding it. It's also a small campus, so there is not as much walking and students are familiar with a lot of people who attend the university."
Junior,5,I love this school! The professors and students are loving and kind. Someone always has a kind word. The campus is beautiful and is an easy walk from the farthest point to the main building.
Senior,5,"The professors are very knowledgeable and get to know their students individually. Great facilities! The food is fairly good. The theater department is underfunded, though. Great athletic department!"
Sophomore,5,"I really like Concordia University in Seward, NE because it is such a loving place. Everyone cares for each other and shows their support to you through everything and anything. The power of God works daily through everyone there and you can just feel His presence as you walk around the campus. I am truly blessed to be able to attend Concordia in NE. The only thing I would like to be changed is curfew. I believe that since we are all adults that attend college, we should be able to make our own decisions and have more freedom. We are all old enough to make the right choices. Other than that, this is a great school to go to. I cannot wait for my second year to start!"
Junior,5,The art department is very caring and open to new ideas and change. Something to improve on would be to make healthier school lunches.
Graduate Student,5,Concordia University provides a great education and Christian community for those looking to pursure higher education.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere is very warm and friendly- a nurturing place that encourages growth as an individual, student, and professional. :) 
They have really caring teachers and an AMAZING music program."
Senior,5,"The smaller campus has given me a chance to get to know my professors, work on communication, and really develop friendships over the course of hard classes. After all, a support system is exactly what is needed when things get tough, and the academic standards at Concordia can be tough but the support system exists to buffer some of the hard things. Overall, it is an amazing campus to study, learn, and build friendships that really care."
College Junior,5,I feel this school is actively trying to achieve safety and taking actions to prevent serious safety and health risks/events.
College Freshman,5,The safety and security on campus makes sure that the students feel safe when they are on campus ground.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus helps everyone get to know each other.
College Freshman,5,The Greek life is an amazing thing at the school.
College Freshman,5,The athletics at the school make sure that your academics comes first and then sports come after.
College Freshman,5,The school makes sure that you succeed and find a job right after college.
College Junior,5,"At Concordia, there are rules in place for dorm hours. There are cameras all over campus. Security is always making rounds. I feel very safe on campus and in the surrounding area. Security is always available by phone with their number on the outside of every dorm and hall. When safety services are alerted they are very prompt in answering."
College Senior,5,The professors are great and give any help possible
College Senior,5,They are great with providing opportunities to experience future employment such as the career fair
College Senior,5,"I had a friend be reported 7 times just because she called her boyfriend a name at lunch and was overheard, that shows the amount of support the students have for one another and the seriousness of the school to respond"
College Senior,5,"I live off campus, but spend all of my time there visiting friends because it is so great"
College Senior,5,I could never want more out of a school
College Senior,5,I could never want more out of a school
College Sophomore,5,Great! I've made many lasting relationships here!
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Concordia. The professors, faculty and students make up a community that is like a family. Everyone knows everybody and says hi as they walk past."
College Junior,5,Have not seen any type of crime in or off campus
College Junior,5,I believe I can work anywhere with a degree from here
College Junior,5,Concordia has been the best choice I have made
Recent Alumnus,5,Within my major and many other 100% placement rate so long as you are too picky (i.e. Down to the exact town) of where you want to end up.
College Sophomore,5,Concordia is a school unlike any other. It is the friendliest place and everyone knows everybody. It is the best place to make a friend because everyone is open and willing to get to know you. I have made lifelong friends and can't wait to go back in the fall. Please visit Concordia if you want a school that will challenge you both academically and spiritually. I promise CUNE is the place you want to be!
College Freshman,5,They are strict on the subjects that need to be and lenient on the subjects that can be.
College Freshman,5,"I have had no issues whatsoever, and neither have my friends."
College Sophomore,5,"I have never felt unsafe on campus, even walking alone at night."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not had an internship, but I plan to have one and anticipate it being a fairly easy process."
College Sophomore,5,"Concordia is not very exclusive about anything. If you want to get in, you can get in."
College Junior,5,It is wonderful. I am an education major and they really do a great job of getting us experience teaching at the schools in our area starting even as early as the first semester we are here.
College Student,5,Profs are great! Very good academic areas.
Sophomore,4,"Due to Covid19, my spring semester of freshman year was abruptly changed to an online learning format. This was an adjustment not only for students but for faculty as well. I feel that my professors all handled this really well and used many different resources to make sure we were still getting the content we needed for the class. We used BlackBoard Collaborate to meet online as a group which worked really well. And then we used this online tool to turn in homework as well. It was super easy to navigate and adapt to during that time of uncertainty."
Junior,4,"I like Concordia for the really atmosphere, as well as the classes. Almost all of the professors I've had have been really great and helpful throughout my time there. You can tell they really care about their students. I think the one thing I would change is the fact that we have a ""quiet time"" and the fact that people can't be over later than like 10 pm. That part isn't cool at all because if there's people in my dorm at 11, I'll get a fine."
Sophomore,4,"I only took classes online for a bit second semester when the campus closed for Covid19. I myself struggled a bit with the transition, but my professors were Very understanding and helped me through it. I had some classes through video and some just through online assignments. All of the professors did their best to adapt quickly and they did a great job!"
Senior,4,"Concordia is a great small private college, especially if you want to grow in your faith. The entire campus has a community feel and the students are supportive of each other. I could not have imagined going anywhere else!"
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my time here at Concordia Nebraska so far! I like the close knit community and small class sizes. With small class sizes you really get to know your professor.
Freshman,4,"Concordia University Nebraska is such a good school. Their academics are amazing and they have so many different activities to be a part of. Although it is in a town that doesn't have much, you really don't even notice because of how busy the campus always is. You get to make so many friends because everyone is so close knit. The professors are amazing at what they do, and each and every one of them cares about you individually. The faith aspect of the school is strong. The people are amazing. The campus is small enough that you don't have to walk a long ways to your buildings, and they just put in new sidewalks to make the walk even shorter. They care about your future an are invested on getting you into the real world fully prepared."
Freshman,4,"Concordia a very family like atmosphere, with a lot of community involvement. They take the time to make sure you receive a friendly welcome; surprising you by saying hello to one another, bringing you in, and you're always guaranteed a 'Bless you' when you sneeze. Everyone is willing to help no matter what, and no one sits alone."
Niche User,4,"My parents both attended Concordia and the staff is very welcoming, they continue to help me with my college decision. The campus is one of my favorites that I have visited so far. My admissions counselor has been very helpful and has provided me with plenty of scholarship opportunities, even if I don't end up at Concordia."
Sophomore,4,"Most professors are great at taking time to sit down and talk with you about future plans, answering questions from class, and are genuinely interested in your life outside class. The campus has a great sense of community and is a beautiful place to live. It would be better however if the city of Seward had more activities."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community atmosphere that this school provides. However, I would like to see more on campus activities for students to participate in."
Freshman,4,"I love Concordia’s ability to make all students feel welcomed and wanted. Whether that’s through freshman activities, great professors, or just awesome, nice people, Concordia is extremely welcoming to everyone and anyone. Oh and I can’t forget to mention how awesome free parking at the university is! 
I would, however, change the policies pertaining to the hours that boys/girls can be in each other’s dorms. I think that this policy should be different because by the time we get to college, we are adults. We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. 
The smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives. It is a good thing because of how easy it is to know your fellow students, athletes, faculty, and even the president of the university. The negative of the smallness of the school is that everyone knows everything, word travels very fast."
Freshman,4,I like the small personal campus.   The professors are helpful and care about their students.  I have met some great people and plan to continue my relationships with them.
Sophomore,4,Concordia has completely changed my life and my way of looking at the world. My professors have shared valuable wisdom both in and out of the classroom. I know that my college experience will continue to shape my future years after I graduate.
Niche User,4,Concordia University is around a small and safe environment. Teachers are very close and freiendy to students.
College Junior,4,I wish students not in the art department were able to take a variety of different art classes. I feel like we shut them out.
College Junior,4,I love living in David but its very costly to live on campus.
College Junior,4,A ton of School spirit for almost all teams. Not a lot of opportunity for non athletic kids to get involved that I have seen
College Junior,4,"I love Concordia, there is a lot of opportunities to get involved in groups or events. However, I feel there is a lack of cross over between departments."
College Junior,4,"Most of the professors are good at balancing helpfulness and allowing the students to be responsible. The class sizes are small enough for my voice to be heard, but large enough to incorporate a variety of opinions. Most professors encourage conversation and discussion style teaching mixed with lecture. The courses are packed with helpful and new information."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus at Concordia has been a very good experience for me. The dorm options are diverse and they are all kept clean and updated. There is, by far, enough room for two people per room in the average dorm rooms. They do a great job of matching roommates when a specific roommate is not requested. The dorms are set up in a way that allows a good amount of privacy but still promotes social activity. The dorms are all an appropriate distance from academic and athletic buildings."
College Junior,4,The athletes are dedicated to both their sports and their academics. The coaches and athletic department promote good grades and good work ethic. The people in the community support Bulldog athletics as much as if their own children were the athletes. The facilities are very nice and are a source of pride for the athletes. The athletes are taken care of very well by the athletic department and the athletic trainers.
College Junior,4,"This school has helped me grow and taught me a great deal of discipline and organization. I feel as though I can really thrive and learn my topic of study best in this environment. It's as though Concordia Nebraska is a moist Petri dish and I am the bacteria. The conditions are just right, and I know that I'll be ready for whatever career awaits me."
College Senior,4,I'm happy to be part of such a strong program
College Sophomore,4,My school is small and mostly filled with like-minded and driven students. My qualm is that most of those students are not passionate about my particular field of study and I am often alone.
College Freshman,4,"It is a great environment to learn in and you are not overwhelmed with the amount of people who attend, you have small classes which gives you more opportunities to talk with your professor."
College Sophomore,4,I love my music professors and I keep learning!
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on our campus.
College Sophomore,4,I like the dorms and everything is close.
College Freshman,4,It is a family like atmosphere with all of the students and faculty. Everyone does what they can to help you succeed and everyone cares about one another.
College Sophomore,4,Love the campus. Love the dorms I have lived in.
College Sophomore,4,"Love being a part of the games, as a member of the dance team it's a great opportunity to perform in front of the student body."
College Sophomore,4,We have great career services on campus. They are very helpful and easy to access. A degree from here would be very valuable.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall I've good experiences with professors. Most all of my professors have been very kind and understanding. However, I've had some that aren't good teachers and some classes that weren't worth taking. I love class sizes."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a wide variety of athletic teams. Everyone is very supportive and proud of them too. However, I feel like we put too much emphasis on them sometimes. I would like to have a separate weight room for non-athletes because the athlete usually take over the weight room."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the size and community that makes up this school. I'm grateful for all the different opportunities and clubs there are to be part of. It's very easy to meet new people here, including professors. All the relationships with teachers are very personal. I would choose this school again because of the small, Christ-centered atmosphere, but I dislike the housing rules here. I feel like were treated like children because we can't live off campus until our last year."
College Junior,4,Residential life is great an easy to adapt to
College Junior,4,Our training facilities are among the best in the region
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, and security is always available."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very good in all these aspects.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors are very easy to contact out of class, and they are very good at teaching their courses. There are a few teachers, however, that make their classes not enjoyable at all. There are times when it feels like they could care less about the students in their classes."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are a very big part of campus life. The majority of the student body are athletes. The teams are very close, and the coaches are awesome. A big part of the student body shows up to games and meets to support their fellow students. The athletic facilities are very nice for all athletes, and everyone is welcome in them."
College Freshman,4,"My experience so far has been great. I love the small campus, I love the Christ-centered environment, and I love the community. It's beautiful, and all the professors are very helpful outside of class. I would definitely choose this school if I had to do it over again, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a small, loving campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors know each individual and take personal inter st in them, often inviting the class to their home. They want you to excel but will also challenge you."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Seward is a very safe town and going on long walks around campus or off campus at night is completely safe. There is some drug issues on campus, especially among male athletes, but the resident assistants do a great job keeping it in check."
Recent Alumnus,4,I really enjoy being here and it's like a home any from home. I know my profs care for me and so does the community of people I am involved with. I also appreciate the concordia exchange where you can take up to two semesters at a different Concordia (there's ten in the U.S.) which allowed me to explore more.
Recent Alumnus,4,"David, which is the freshman & sophomore girls dorm is one of the nicest dorms on campus. Johnathan, a co-Ed upperclassmen is the nicest dorm apartments on campus. the other dorms are nice, but a little outdated. Overall though they've been make renovations (all dorms now have ac or will by 2016) and they do a good job keeping them clean. They also plan a lot of hall activities and encourage activities between floors, etc to help get to know one another."
Recent Alumnus,4,"While it may be in a smaller town, the community is welcoming to college students and gets involved with them. The campus itself is full of amazing people that build lasting and family-like relationships with. They care about you, your faith, and you spend quality time with them quite frequently. Your faith is continually encouraged and supported by all those around you, at chapel, and at the student led evening praise!"
College Freshman,4,They have helped me complete the financial processes at school.
College Junior,4,It was simple and quick process.
College Junior,4,There doesn't seem too much judging at this school.  People treat people as people not by Greek or not Greek.
College Junior,4,"I live in Strieter, one of the oldest and not rendered dorm on campus.  It does not have heat and air condition and the instillation isn't too good, but the comfort is great and just about everyone in the building make the best of what we have.  The cost is the same as the other dorms besides Jonathan which is a suite style apartment.  It is very clean and orderly inside, but the nicer the buildings are, the more costly they become."
College Junior,4,"Although we may not have many restaurants in Seward, the ones we do have focus on quality and satisfaction from to the customers.  I was surprised when my parents came to visit and to treat her we went to café on the square.  Since it was her birthday she got a free dessert!  As for the variety, there is not much to look at, the menus generally contain about the same kind of meals."
College Junior,4,there is a pretty good selection of off campus housing
College Junior,4,They are good but not the best.
College Junior,4,they work with you and make sure you understand everything.
College Junior,4,This college campus is great! I love living on campus because I am able to be close to all of my friends and the classrooms are not very far away which makes it so I can sleep in longer before going to class.
College Junior,4,"There are not a lot of options of housing close to college, but the options that they give you are amazing!   They are not very costly if you know where to look.  There is one that is the farthest away from school, but the price range is decent.  Parking is directly outside where it is convenient to go without shoving much of a sidewalk."
College Freshman,4,"We are safe, and incidents are very rare"
College Freshman,4,"We have amazing facilities, but our teams are sub-par as far as performing"
College Freshman,4,"It's a completely dry campus. Even if you come back to campus having ANY alcohol in your system, you're screwed."
College Freshman,2,The only option past 10 pm is McDonalds.
College Freshman,2,Getting financial aid taken care of is a pain at any school.
College Freshman,2,Its a small town with limited dining and almost no entertainment for college kids
College Freshman,2,If you know the right people there are good parties. But often times the cops are called in a small town.
College Freshman,2,"Many houses are just run down, trashy, college town houses"
College Sophomore,2,"You have to be 21 to live off campus, and there really aren't many options, plus, who wants to have to drive into school every day if you could just live on campus and walk a little?"
College Sophomore,2,"There is a café and maybe two other restaurants, including McDonalds and Dairy Queen. There is a great Mexican restaurant, though, outside of town."
College Junior,2,They are WAY to expensive for what we get.
College Junior,2,There is really nothing to do here except drive a half hour to the next closest city or get drunk at the upper clansmen's houses. There isn't anything in town and the school doesn't do a good job of providing things on campus to do.
College Junior,2,I have never seen campus police. I honestly don't think that we have them. It is a small school so I guess they think it isn't necessary but its still a large campus with no security as far as I know.
College Junior,2,There is very little diversity at my university. There is only 2 racial backgrounds mostly and one is clearly the minority.
College Student,2,"People are open to hearing other perspectives (mostly up for friendly debate), there just aren't really any other perspectives."
College Freshman,2,the cafeteria doesn't offer many healthy options and doesn't stay open later than 7:30 pm
College Freshman,2,When you find it consider yourself the luckiest person on campus.
College Junior,2,The cost of living on campus is horrendous.  I don't like that the dorms are segregated by gender because it takes away from the college experience.  The dorms are a little bit aged except for one or two buildings so they could use some renovations and upgrades.
College Junior,2,"the majority of the students on campus are white lutherans. we have a percentage of african americans but not a whole lot. the religious backgrounds vary, but Concordia IS an LCMS lutheran college, so obviously that's going to be the majority of the students.  although the out-of-state compared to the in-state students is almost more."
College Sophomore,2,Obtaining off campus housing is only allowed by the university after the student has been on campus three years or is 21 years of age.
College Senior,2,"very basic technology, labs are small, only 2 out of 4 have printers, and their database system is basic at that"
College Freshman,2,Campus Center – The campus center is fine when you need to eat and check your mail or a comon meeting place. Other than that there is really nothing to offer there. I would enjoy to be able to spend more time there and have something to do.
College Freshman,2,"Nebraska's weather is very unpredictable the winters are harsh and summers are hot, but we do get a few nice days."
Alum,1,"If you are not from Nebraska, I highly recommend not to come here. If you want a real college experience, I highly recommend to not come here. It costs about $40k a year without scholarships and you get maybe $5k worth of it. The dorms are atrocious, with community bathrooms that barely get cleaning and maintenance, tile flooring in the rooms, just an old and dirty place. The food was god awful. For $40k a year you get the same food pretty much every day, no variety. Maybe once or twice a week there would be different foods to eat but it is an embarrassment compared to how much we pay for it. If you want to come for a college experience there are pretty much no parties, no drinking, the majority of students are religious and celibate. The baseball field itself is not even on campus and it is shared with a high school on a subpar field. Paying $40k is the biggest rip off in history. I would maybe pay $5k max to go here. Overall awful and if you go there, God have mercy on your soul."
College Junior,1,We have no greek life but you made me fill out these questions anyway
College Freshman,1,"There are like three restaurants, the only one that's affordable? McDonalds."
College Sophomore,1,"Partying is weak on campus if not dead, don't come here if you want to have fun."
College Sophomore,1,Very few restaurants in town
College Junior,1,They are overly strict about everything and people still do all of the things that they aren't supposed to do because the rules are really ridiculous.
College Junior,1,It's a small town so we don't really have anything. We only have one real sit down restaurant.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life isn't very prevalent in my particular college
College Freshman,1,"The strictness on our campus is absolutely rediculous. There is no lenience for any fun or mistakes what so ever. I feel like I am in high school again but worse because these rules not only exist at school but all of the time because I live on campus. One thing that I believe is over the top is the fact that if I went out of the country to a place where it was legal for me to drink and I consumed alcohol and the school found out about it, I would get in trouble with the school. I feel like that is none of their business especially if it is not durring school and not on campus."
College Freshman,1,Strict Policies – If a boy or girl is caught in the opposite sex dorm past curfew you are given six points and placed on probatation. The second offence the points is doubled and once given 30 points you must go to the board whether you can stay in school or not.

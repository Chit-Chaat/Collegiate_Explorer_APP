Senior,5,"Caldwell University is a small school with lots to offer. Besides parking being free, there is so much support within the school and with lots of potential for the future."
Sophomore,5,It was very well. The teachers were always ready to help. Hopped on zoom and  teachers were always emailing to help and get work in. Very well learned i learned a lot.
Sophomore,5,Caldwell University is a great institution for people who want to go to school and gain valuable knowledge that they'll need for any path they choose to take. I am very happy with my classes and what i've learned so far.
Sophomore,5,I like attending Caldwell University because the campus is somewhat small so it's very welcoming. The faculty and students I have met so far have all been very nice and helpful. All of my professors I have had so far were very nice and made transitioning from high school to college life easy. The only flaw about Caldwell is our bookstore should be expanded and there should be better and more school pride merchandise.
Sophomore,5,When I first stepped onto Caldwell University as an aspiring Nursing student I immediately fell in love with the campus and the welcoming atmosphere. It was the college of my dreams and something that I though only exsist in movies.
Freshman,5,Walking around caldwell university really put me in a head space i needed to be in. Everything was so welcoming and the vibe it gave me was.. out of this world amazing.
Junior,5,"Almost every professor is attentive to their students and they encourage students to do best and are willing to spend extra help with them.  It is about the love they show in academics.  Caldwell has Hall of Flag that honors students from each country who enroll the school.  They will have ceremony to rise a flag when a new student from a new country comes.  Most stuff will go out of their way to help students and treat us like family.  Once a semester, they will have a party for all commute students.  School will send out emails to notify students when events are up.  Although I am not in any sport team, the school teams are strong that I always receive announcement about their successful games.  Most important reason of everyone being happy on campus is that they make us feel like home with love."
Junior,5,"I love the professors they are very helpful, if you ever have any questions they always offer extra help. Eveyone on campus is very nice and you can walk at night feeling safe."
Junior,5,"My experience at Caldwell University has in all been an incredibly positive one. Being a small school, it gives the teachers and students a chance to have a better relationship as well as with fellow peers. Our school spirit in good and bad times is definitely one to take note of."
Junior,5,"I love caldwell, the campus the environment ,the support system at the school. The convenience of taking online classes helps with flexibility as well"
Niche User,5,"It was great! The campus looks amazing, the students are smart and full of energy,  so many majors to choose from, and the insides of the building is like a wonderland of creativity. Not only that but the professors in the school have  worked with many famous figures and had quite a had on many of the schools current materials that they use now."
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled as a student. They have been helpful and have made me feel accommodated as possible.
Sophomore,5,"When I think of Caldwell University, I think of a family environment. While on campus, it feels like you're apart of a community that supports you and wants to see you thrive to your fullest potential. The staff, faculty and students are all very welcoming and friendly. It is also a stigma free campus, so no one is judged based on race, religion, color or sexuality. We all get along as one. There are also plenty of resources on campus. I was really surprised by how much assistance you get in finding a job, graduate school, internships, research opportunities etc. There are also plenty of fun activities to do there as well. There is always some event being kept. I could go on and on about the greatness of Caldwell University. If I were to do it all over again, I would still choose Caldwell University. They have provided me with opportunities that I don't think I could get so easily at any other institution."
Freshman,5,"I've had a wonderful experience at Caldwell University. Every student is recognized and is not considered a number. You get undivided attention from your professors, the campus is safe, and the atmosphere is welcoming. There are many activities to be apart of, clubs and sports to join, and off campus trips. The classroom sizes are very small which is great, and the professors do whatever it takes to make sure you are doing well."
College Sophomore,5,The athletics department is outstanding. The coaches are the best and the players are always working hard.
College Senior,5,i always feel safe on campus even at night
College Senior,5,i have yet to look into internships yet but i know the career development office is always open and helpful
College Senior,5,"as an adult undergrad i still feel as if i am a part of their school community. its a small campus and i felt at home the first day i attended classes, it is the best university!"
College Senior,5,"I am very proud to be a member of Caldwell's Greek Life. Unfortunately, since we are a small school they're only two sororities and one frat on campus but we work with what we have. We host as many events and fundraisers as possible to raise money for our philanthropies.  Although many see us as fake that's because they've never actually gotten to know us.  If people see us fighting it's not because we don't like each other it's because we have different opinions on decorations for events.  That's what happens when you're in an organization.  So I encourage everyone to come out and be part of Greek Life  because it has truly changed my life for the better! I love it!  Even if you don't want to join just come to the events and support a cause. (:"
College Sophomore,5,There are many security guards whom constantly watch over their students and make us feel safe. Everyone on the campus is extremely friendly and everyone knows just about everyone. I never feel like I'm in danger on campus.
College Sophomore,5,THE BEST I DONT EVEN PLAY SPORTS AND I KNOW THIS
College Junior,5,My school is welcoming because everyone is very helpful and caring. They all want to help in any way they can.
College Sophomore,5,The Caldwell Cougars are the best. My school's basketball team is wonderful
College Sophomore,5,"Of all of the financial aid, CU gave me the best package deal, and if you contact their admissions they will personally sit down with you and review your scholarship with you. When I sat down with them they found me an extra 5,500 dollars. They personally care about you as a student."
College Freshman,5,Follow the rules or find a way not to get caught
College Freshman,5,I like the food its really good
College Freshman,5,As long as you are cool with people there will always be a party to go to.
College Senior,5,You can feel safe walking on campus at any time of day or night.
Recent Alumnus,5,They get everything they want which I think is unfair.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love the nursing program besides its extra expenses. My career goal is to become a successful Pediatric Nurse Practionor. Though we always need nurses in the world, I am still worried about finding a job once I graduate because it seems to be hard for everyone at the moment. My main concern is being able to pay to finish going to college though. After I obtain my BSN, I must go back for my Masters. And its just getting harder and harder to afford school."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I absolutely love being a nursing major even though it is a lot of work and extremely hard. The only thing I hate is how much extra money we have to pay to stay in this program. The books get more and more expensive each semester, let alone all the other things we have to pay for."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I've had the most amazing professors, other than the few bad ones I had. They mostly all are extremely helpful, know what they are teaching, and care about your learning experience. Work load I assume is just as heavy as any other college. There are plenty of nice quiet places to study, and a lot of resources to help us learn more effectively such as the Student Center for Success."
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel more safe on my campus than I do in my own home. No more explanation is needed.
College Freshman,5,Everything is maintained clean and the quality is good
College Freshman,5,"There are no crimes committed, the crime rate is very low and they take safety seriously"
College Freshman,5,The criminal justice program have good connections for internship opportunities
College Senior,5,"The psychology program is taken very seriously, it consists of professionals who wish to see you grow and encourage you in all endeavors. If I had to opportunity to do it all over again, I definitely would. Due to the fact that my major is a broad one, there are many branches that one could specialize in. However, keep in mind that if you choose to be a psychology major, you must pursue a Master's and/or PhD."
College Senior,5,"Many internship postings are offered at Caldwell University and if an appointment is made with Career Services, someone will help you find an internships that fits your wants and needs."
College Senior,5,"I don't believe in ""looks"", everyone is unique in their own way. Many of Caldwell's students are serious about attending college and do not ""play"" or ""fool"" around when it comes to their grades."
College Senior,5,"I would recommend Caldwell University to any student who is mature and truly interested in becoming a professional in the field they choose. Caldwell University consists of a small campus, small to average student body, and helpful staff and faculty. It was everything that I was looking for as an undergraduate student and I love it so much that I am continuing my studies to earn a Master's degree from Caldwell University."
College Senior,5,"Professor's truly care about their students, they remember you by your name, and want the best for you. Most of them help you in any way they possible can. The registration process is fairly easy, simple to comprehend and complete, but like any institution, remember that you are an adult and you are responsible for the classes you do or do not register for; therefore, they are not responsible for a mistake that you make."
College Senior,5,"I was a psychology major at Caldwell University and I must admit that I learned more here than in my previous college. Professor's at Caldwell challenge you to think critically and teach you to question everything. This tool helps you, the student, in so many aspects and it is an important one to have, especially for any employment opportunities."
College Junior,5,The transportation to and from is very easy for students.  There are bus shuttles that takes you from place to place.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is from all over and has very different beliefs

College Junior,5,I love the fact that there is extreme diversity.

The teachers are awesome and bring their real word experience into the classroom.  They go beyond the text book and it is refreshing."
College Senior,5,"For my major, I have worked on real world projects. Teachers bring their experience into the classroom and go beyond the text book.  The career and development department is always posting internships and all business majors are encouraged to take one."
College Sophomore,5,As a mental health major in the graduate program I am very satisfied. I am hoping to become a LPC (Licensed Professor Counselor) and to one day to open a private practice.
College Sophomore,5,I am in a masters program for Counseling Specializing in Mental Health and I've been very satisfied about the uniqueness of this program. It is CACREP certified which allows the students to become a licensed professional counselor for the state of New Jersey because Caldwell College offers courses required for licensure. All of my professors are very helpful thus far and I am looking forward to this journey as a grad student trying to pursue her dreams!
College Junior,5,"There are a lot of different people from all over the world and everyone gets along, especially on campus."
College Senior,5,"I am very pleased with my major because it helped me think out of the box. I feel that this major was very helpful to me and whateva company that i will work for because i will be prepared educationally and mentally for whatever challenges i come across. My career goal is to be a social worker, i want to work with at risk teens and the developmentally disabled. The only concern that i have is that a lot of these jobs require your msw."
College Senior,5,"Caldwel college have a very strong soccer team, basket ball team and baseball team."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is on Bloomfield Ave. There are many restaurants and fine dining around a two mile radius of the school. If students have the money, they can go to Calandras, Fortes, Cuban Petes, or any of the nice restaurants around the campus. There are also many diners in the area for good late night dining, along with fast food options, and convenience stores."
College Junior,5,Programs offered a lot of hands on experiences outside of the college.
College Junior,5,"Academics at Caldwell college are excellent, professors are always willing to help if you do not understand something and the academic support center is always available to study and tutoring."

College Senior,5,I drive my car to colloge but i always see public transportation available for those that use it
Recent Alumnus,5,SAFE AS SAFE CAN BE – Local police and security constantly moniyor the campus
College Sophomore,5,Majority of the professors are concerned about the students academics and willing to help them when they are having trouble. The students usually schedule appointments with them oor go to their office hours.
Alum,4,It is a beautiful campus and the student body was very helpful and nice. Some professors and faculty are absolutely amazing and really go out of their way to help the students so i was extremely grateful for that. The school does have a very large commuter population but overall it is easy to make friends and there are opportunities to be involved on campus.
Sophomore,4,It’s a good learning school. You meet lots of new people. A very small campus so you meet people fast. Very beautiful and welled builds. Although some things can be fixed it’s a good school to learn and meet people at.
Sophomore,4,"Caldwell University is a small school, so the professors and staff have time for students and you feel more cared for than in a larger school. I transferred from a larger university and I do not regret it. There is also plenty of opportunities given from internships to volunteer work. The only problem I have is the meal plan system for commuters. The only we can apply for one is on a slip of paper and we have to pay out of pocket. We cannot have it added in our tuition and we cannot pay with our student account."
Freshman,4,"I was delighted to see how international students shine in this small college; they are involved in lot of activities.

Students might have extreme opinions about the university - some will want to escape from it while some will find opportunity through the college. 

It's to keep in mind that resources in Caldwell can be limited but it's not unreachable; there are exemplary students out here and that you should be an active student to get the best out of it."
Freshman,4,"I'm in my freshman year and I feel pretty good so far. I was scared on how strict my professors were gonna be but so far so good. The school offers 'free' tutoring but to be honest you're paying for it. The tuition may be on the more expensive side but the university gives a lot of scholarships and grants. In addition, the campus is really safe compared to others. The only down side is the food..."
Junior,4,It is a small school which limits the party scenes and social life but its easier I’m a classroom setting because the professors get the time to know their students on a personal level.
Sophomore,4,"I appreciate professors who are willing to listen to students and work with them, as well as staff members who make sure that students from all backgrounds and groups are heard. Professors are welcoming and accommodating."
Senior,4,"As a biology major, I felt that most of my professors truly cared about their students. Since this college is much smaller than most universities, this allowed the students to have a close relationship to their professors. Whenever I had any questions or needed any help, they were there for me. Only issue at this moment is that they are yet to find an organic professor that will continue teaching long-term. They are currently changing organic professors every semester over the past year because they have yet to find one that is qualified to stay."
Alum,4,"Caldwell University is a wonderful place to learn. The professors were their greatest asset. They managed to hire some of the best and most caring professors I've ever come into contact with, especially in the Criminal Justice and Sociology departments. The biggest con about this university is its religiosity, so a student should make sure they're agreeable to taking at least four religion-based courses on top of the core and major requirements. But the campus is small, everything is easily accessible, the students are very friendly, the surrounding area is safe and upscale and the all the buildings are small and cozy. I'd recommend this university."
Sophomore,4,"I like going to Caldwell University because it is a small school and I get the chance to be one on one with teachers, and they know you better than if it were bigger classes.  What I would change are the student events, where I wish they had more activities I would be interested in participating in.  I also live on campus and I would also change the food options they have on the meal plan because at the moment the cafeteria is not a great place to eat."
Junior,4,Small campus community with very hospitable community. A lot of diversity with people from different cultures and backgrounds.
Freshman,4,The Caldwell University is very peaceful a college that really focuses on the student. You can find help almost everywhere you turn form your rap to your own free tutors. I have personally taken advantage of it’s resources.
Freshman,4,So far I like it but the communication here is not so good. I like the small class sizes but some teachers speed through the class which doesn't really help students. Teachers need to just take their time when teaching their students
Sophomore,4,"I like that Caldwell has such great classes, teachers, and students. I would like to see nothing change."
Junior,4,I am currently attending Caldwell University. The things that I love about CU is its size. It is a smaller sized campus that is easy to get around. It does not take too long to get from Point A to Point B. What is also a benefit of the size is that it has smaller class sizes. I really love that you can get to know most of your classmates on a first names basis. You are also able to connect with the professors. They are able to give more attention to each student and really assist you if needed. It creates an overall comfortable environment.
Freshman,4,"Really am enjoying myself, and the teachers here aren't bad. Everyone here wants to help you with what ever it is you need. The food isn't that good but there is a cook that tries to make the food good! Academics are really important here and the sports teams are good. But its fune and its a small personal campus."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is very helpful and friendly.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are very clean and well organized.
College Sophomore,4,Caldwell is a great school to attend. The people and the atmosphere are both amazing.
College Senior,4,the sports teams are great
College Senior,4,The school's very diverse. Everyone seems to get along.
College Senior,4,Never had a problem. Always felt safe!
College Senior,4,We have great teams with students who put their all into each sport but unfortunately athletes believe they own the campus. It's a small school so athletes take up majority of it.
College Senior,4,"This school is a wonderful place to make all sorts of friends. Although not everyone talks to each other all the time, they make an effort to try. I've had nothing but great experiences at Caldwell."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I genuinely like my school. The teachers are the main reason I enjoy my school so much because the truly care about every student and their journeys."
College Sophomore,4,I have not sought an internship yet.
College Sophomore,4,I love the school in which i chose. It is a tiny school that is very involved in their students and very focused on helping each individual.
College Senior,4,Everyone is very dedicated and enthusiastic.
College Senior,4,Caldwell has a small campus that I love. It's easy to move between classes and great professors.
College Freshman,4,I recommend people to be residents because you have so many resources in hand
College Freshman,4,Caldwell is a division 2 school but I believe they have a great chance to be division 1.
College Freshman,4,Caldwell is unique because it's a small positive community. Everyone there is happy and helpful. All the resources are there for you and the students are a great support system.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus consists of a body of students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, with diverse viewpoints."
College Sophomore,4,The school is pretty big on eradicating and preventing drug use and excessive alcohol use.
College Sophomore,4,The housing is great. The halls are kept really clean. The rooms are alright. There are lounges that will suit the needs of students.
College Sophomore,4,"Crime? There is never crime. The biggest crime on campus is someone sneaking into the cafe. I feel totally safe on campus and in the general area of the college. in some of the neighboring towns its more dangerous. The campus police are very present. I see them around campus frequently. 

As to the health part? I've never been there myself but I have heard they are not amazing. They have limited hours and if its anything serious they call and ambulance to take you to a nearby hospital."
College Sophomore,4,"Well, you get the typical furniture; a bed, a dresser, and a desk and chair. Some rooms are bigger than others and you can request a room but there is no guarantee that you will get it. Some rooms have private bathrooms others do not. The buildings are convenient to get to, and the campus is small so you only need ten minutes to get to any part of the campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I was well prepared with what I was getting into. My school is very small so everyone knows each other. It's not good for the party scene. However, you will make quality friends that you can go out partying with and they will last all throughout the years."
College Freshman,4,Caldwell University is a fairly safe campus. It is unusual to hear about campus crimes like sexual harassment or battery. The campus security team takes their jobs seriously and are present in many places on campus. I do not usually feel nervous about crime on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I have a high respect for a majority of the professors at Caldwell University. They are very considerate and kind to the students. They can be busy, but are willing to meet you if you ever need any help. The class sizes are small as well, making it easier for students to get to know each other and the teacher."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy living on campus very much. The price is not too bad, and the space is not too small neither. It is very comfortable to live there because the social atmosphere is very friendly. In addition, the perks, like free laundry, are very convenient for the students."
College Freshman,4,"So far I really enjoy studying at Caldwell University. There are so many different classes that you can take. There is constantly a large amount of activities to do around campus, especially because there are so many fun clubs to join. I also love how there are many opportunities to do community service offered by the school. It simply feels like home when I'm on campus."
College Junior,4,"The campus feels generally safe and secure. I prefer to walk with a group of people, but have no problem walking across campus by myself. The campus security petrol the campus throughout the day and night."
College Junior,4,"The career services on campus are very helpful. The career counselor I've talked with goes above and beyond my expectations as a career counselor and has, on her own time, forwarded internship opportunities to me after a meeting."
College Junior,4,I have seldom not enjoyed a class at this university. All of my professors have cared about their students' success and personal growth within a subject.
College Junior,4,Greek life enhances school and community spirit around campus. Members of Greek life hold events on campus that are cheerful and fun.
College Junior,4,I am glad I chose to attend this university. I have been given many opportunities to further my career and be an active member of my university's and the university's town's communities.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is safe. During my stay, I have not heard of any assault cases. The campus is secure and serene. Plus, The Caldwell city police officers often patrol the campus."
College Sophomore,4,The career services department is extremely helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Caldwell University is an excellent university. It comprises of a friendly bunch of students and staff included. The food is good. The campus housing is great. The advisors are extremely helpful. The available services on the campus ensure the comfort of the students. The professors are easily approachable. The activities on-campus are awesome. The only problem is that student participation is low. Plus, the financial aid is very helpful. I would recommend Caldwell University to anyone."
College Sophomore,4,Caldwell does not have any crime or sexual assaults it is a pretty safe environment.
College Sophomore,4,Classes may get difficult but we have the programs to help us.
College Sophomore,4,The career center always host Job Fairs for the students
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is convenient, everything is close including classes."
College Sophomore,4,My school is unique because it is very small and caring. My advisor is very caring she makes sure that I have everything I need to succeed.
College Freshman,4,"We don't have sexual assault on campus. In our community is very well secured and have given us many events to attend to realize what to do when it happens, tips on how to prevent it, and seek medical attention/ call the police as quickly as possible."
College Freshman,4,The experience of class sizes are very limited but highly recommend register as soon as possible. Many courses from decide from that gives a great variety for your intended major. Professor are very open and great to communicate with sometimes.
College Freshman,4,"Many students have been doing internships so they can get a feeling of the major they plan to do in the future. Given lots of opportunities but very limited as well. First come, first serve is how I see it."
College Freshman,4,"My school is very unique, we are a small university, but very large in kindness and heart. Its very easy to get to all your classes without talking long walks like big universities do. Great programs that will help you reach your next step to success and tutoring/ working opportunities."
College Junior,4,"Restaurants, fast food & coffee shops are all within walking distance of campus. & alot of spots offer delivery service as well & go right to the dorms"
College Sophomore,2,I don't really pay attention to the Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,Horrible food. Too much money. FOR SPORTS STUDENTS
College Sophomore,2,"There are two sororities and one frat. The girls don't like each other. They only seem to do the minimum. they try to promote but the sororities are in constant competition. I feel if they were more dedicated to their cause they'd have a better turn out of girls. Also the girls in them are very fake, even to each other, which is unfortunate. The frat is pretty exclusive so it's small, and I do not know a lot about it."
College Sophomore,2,There is no co-ed over nights.
College Sophomore,2,Our school is full of cliques
College Senior,2,"Everything that is considered a ""party"" from the student government association starts too late and it usually quite lame."
College Junior,2,Sometimes we go to Bloomfield college but otherwise we're isolated
College Freshman,2,The scholarships mainly go to the athletic students
College Freshman,2,It seems like if you are not an athlete there aren't many parties you can attend
College Sophomore,2,There's absolutely nothing to do in this town!!!!!
College Freshman,2,Students barely get penalized when drugs are used in the dorm life.
College Freshman,2,There are no shuttle buses on our campus to take us anywhere.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much of any Greek life for Caldwell College. There is only one frat this school represents, along with three Sororities. Although the frat does well in terms of community service and school events, i do recommend they have more options in joining Greek life. Just having one makes the students obligated to join the one because there is no others."
College Junior,2,as long as you don't get caught nothing will happen  to you. GPA standings are important to the school so if you go below the required you are on probation and if it doesnt go up you get kicked out
Recent Alumnus,2,Police do not check on handicap accessible parking.
College Junior,2,There's pretty much nothing either going on around school.
College Senior,2,"Not Very Many – Not very many available, I apply to all I can find but so is everyone else. If I don't get a scholarship soon then I will need to drop out because I just can't afford the school."
College Senior,2,"It's Average Compared to the Other Colleges That I Have Attended – It is comparable to the other colleges in regards to education nothing outstanding, but the price is extrememly high and they don't seem to have that many scholarships. If Montclair had the nursing program I would return to them because I have too much debt with Caldwell."
College Junior,2,For the Money I Expected Better – Forthe money paid in meal plans the food sucks. Insteadof renovating the caf what they should have sone is renovate the food. Its disgusting and a waste of my money
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Food and Dining – Over the summer Caldwell reconstructed the campus cafeteria, the dining area is amazing; it reminds me of a restaurant atmosphere. The food I personally think could be better, I always try to eat healthy coming to school but the meals that the school serves are always unpleasent. I currently know two people who have gotten food poisoning from the schools food. It makes me causious of what I can and cant eat."
Freshman,1,"I had an issue with a roommate.  She was doing drugs in our dorm. Guys walked in on me nude because she thought I was asleep. Went to my RA, she wasn't there, so I went to the GRA. She didn't return any of my emails. It took three weeks. Whenever I went for progress on the issue, she said  I should be patient. I emailed the VP of Student Life and 15 minutes later got my own room, which I had to pay $500 for or I got kicked out of housing. Everyone is all high on weed. Its the most disorganized campus I've ever seen. The RAs are zero help, as they usually only do it for the perks. If you're in the Education Program, you have to pay for EVERYTHING, and nobody respects or cares about you. If you don't do things the way they want it, you fail. English classes fill up because they only offer one class of each type with only ten to fifteen spots, and if you don't get a spot, you're SOL. They might do a trip to a game or Six Flags once a month, but that's about it. Don't bother coming here."
Freshman,1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Don't be fooled by the scholarships given to you...everybody gets money...EVERYBODY. The school is just too much like a high school...most of the students here are too immature to be called college students. If you're not part of a certain ethnic group, you are ignored. Parties rarely happen and when they do they're shut down, overcrowded, or just trash. The ""mojo"" dorm has no such thing as quiet hours...students are running, screaming, yelling, banging, and playing loud music until 4am ON SCHOOL NIGHTS. In addition, the school doesn't do anything about it, despite having known about these issues FOR OVER A SEMESTER. Many professors don't know how to do their jobs. I've had professors who don't show up without notice, don't know how to use technology, I've even had a professor admit she took a sick day to get drunk. If you got a 1200+ on the SAT or 25+ on the ACT: DON'T GO HERE. Save your money, time, and intelligence. Its a last minute school for kids who don't care."
Niche User,1,"I have PTSD, which was filed with the University. Ellina Chernobilsky, Thompson Ling, and Sister Kathleen Tuite, discriminated against me for having PTSD, and the university's response was to try to force me out of the school. They told me as someone with PTSD, I wasn't ""fit enough"" to be attending their program or school, or going after what I wanted because a ""disability like that tells me you don't know how to achieve what you want."" They also told me I would never make a ""good contribution to society"" because of my disability. 

Academics - way too easy; not challenging enough.
Return on Investment - CU says they'll ""work with you,"" but they don't."
College Senior,1,You can just smell it nothing crazy.
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible school. No social events. Clubs aren't active. The food=horrible. On campus you only get to chose between the commuters food (pay in cash) or the residents ""all you can eat"". Same food every single day even for commuters. The only good thing about this school was the parking. 

Such a small school, everybody knows your business. It reminds me of high school with the ""cliques""."
College Senior,1,The faculty in the nursing department is very rude to students. They say they will meet with you and then tell you they are too busy to meet. They tell you numerous times to think about changing your major and that maybe your not cut out for this major. They should be ashamed to call themselves nurses.
College Junior,1,I get tired of eating chinese & pizza everyday
Recent Alumnus,1,They're pretty strict with everything. But what do you expect? It is a private Catholic college.
Recent Alumnus,1,I GET NOTHING. IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. PAYING FOR THIS SCHOOL IS A NIGHTMARE.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no off-campus housing that I am aware of.
College Sophomore,1,only two sororities that are boring
College Sophomore,1,There are no camera's in commuters parking lot :[
College Freshman,1,the public buses are the worst ( NJ Transit) 
College Senior,1,"The technology sucks. The computers are super slow and need to be updated. There's one Mac lab and those computers are under lock and key and not available to everyone. Overall, Caldwell needs to step up its IT."
College Junior,1,the dorm everyone calls mojo is deplorable bathroom and shower rooms are kinda unsanitary until the cleaning ladies come. if its really bad the cleaning ladies refuse to clean them and people in the wing get fined. the newer building everyone calls domo is very updated and taken care of better where mainly athletes and upperclassmen live.
College Junior,1,"Yes they spent a lot of money on remodeling it but the food has gotten worse. Like getting chicken from the grill and parts still raw, same goes for the burgers but it depends who is working that station. To take food out of there you need a to-go-container which you have to pay for and you can't eat and then take food back to your dorm or you'll get screamed at and have to throw your food out of the container."
College Junior,1,"since I've been going to this college there have been about two-three drug ""busts"". if a person gets caught with it in their room by an RA they dont get in much trouble since paperwork is involved. a good amount of dorm rooms have alcohol and drink it too so its b.s about no alcohol here in the dorms.  once the police came during the day because a student had weed in his room where he was selling it out of...residence life had no clue about the drugs in the room"
College Junior,1,"WAY Too Much! If you want to live in Caldwell, you will be spending way too much money. Much better to just live on campus or live outside Caldwell."
College Junior,1,It Sucks – Caldwell sucks. There is nothing to do in the town and only a few events on campus. None of which i see becaue i work full time.
College Sophomore,1,"Just Awful – It's truly abysmal.  There are very few parties and when they do finally occur, people get so excited it either gets shut down or overcrowded.  Since is mostly a commuter school, a majority of 'fun' social activities happen off campus.  Obviously if you are 21 your opportunities for a nightlife greatly increase (just like everywhere else)."

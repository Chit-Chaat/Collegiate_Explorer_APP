Alum,5,I did not have any online learning through Roanoke College. I was strictly on campus this was way before the time of COVID-19 and online learning.
Sophomore,5,I currently have just finished my first year at Roanoke College and have loved every minute of it. It is a place that feels like home. The campus is very warm and welcoming and has a certain community feel to it. The professors are also amazing with having personal connections with the students and making time to help further their education.
Sophomore,5,I recommend attending Roanoke College because they try to help make college as affordable as possible. I am a research assistant in the Biology department on campus and I love how the professors push me to perform my best academically.
Freshman,5,Roanoke college is a happy environment with so much diversity and opportunities to thrive as a person.
Sophomore,5,"The professors really care about each student here. The classes are not easy, but college is not supposed to be that way. There is access to help for any subject at any level. The people here are very nice too!"
Sophomore,5,"Roanoke College has a beautiful campus and only around 2,500 students. Anytime you walk to class, or go to commons for dinner, you’re guaranteed to see a familiar face! The community is so close and the academics are unmatched!"
Freshman,5,I enjoyed Roanoke College because it owns a fantastic campus that offered amazing majors as well as a great athletics team.
Alum,5,"Going to Roanoke was one of the best decisions I ever made. It was a wonderful education that prepared me well for graduate school and life. I made amazing friends there that I am still very close to. I loved going to a small school and getting super close to a lot of great people. The mountains and atmosphere are exhilarating to be around. I would very highly recommend this school to anyone that loves good people, a great education and a wonderful environment."
Sophomore,5,Beautiful school in a great little town. I love everything about it. Great social life; easy to make lifelong friendships; tough but fair academics. I knew from the minute I visited campus I belonged here
Freshman,5,"I love the small-town community, the fact that you are surrounded by nature, and the fact that even before you are on campus the facility cares so greatly about you and your education. My advisor answered all my questions and what I needed. This was even before I showed up for my orientation or even decided to place my deposit."
Freshman,5,I really love the environment and how open the place feels. It has wonderful food and so many friendly people. It's also one of the most beautiful campuses I've seen.
Sophomore,5,"This college is so artsy, personal, and full of life. The professors are incredible, and many hold class outside a lot of the time! The campus is stunning and full of trees, the food is phenomenal, and the curriculum is unique and engaging. I waited for 5 years to attend school, because no college seemed worth the price. Once I found Roanoke, I didn't hesitate for a moment. It really is a family here, and full of the best people. I have grown so much in my first year here, and I am so excited for the growth ahead. Going to Roanoke College will be the best decision that you could make."
Sophomore,5,"I love Roanoke College, whole heartedly. This campus makes me feel so much at home. The professors are so easy to talk to you and make you feel extremely comfortable. I would not change anything about this College!"
Freshman,5,Wonderful staff that care about you exceeding in and outside of the classroom. Beautiful campus and amazing facilities.
Freshman,5,It’s a small school in a beautiful city. You won’t regret going here and meeting your lifelong friends
Junior,5,I love Roanoke College! My professors really put time into seeing me succeed as an individual. The campus is gorgeous and the food is amazing.
Freshman,5,"By attending a small school, there is a very strong feeling of community. It's great having professors who actually know your name and want to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,The campus is very beautiful and welcoming. The staff and students have open arms for new students and are always smiling. The atmosphere is one that not many schools have because it puts out a wonderful feeling to anyone new who visits the school.
Freshman,5,"I am an upcoming freshman at Roanoke College, and I have already fell in love with it. I have visited the campus a few times before I applied for Lutheran events and the atmosphere is just wonderful. All of the faculty and students are nice, plus it is not too far from home."
Freshman,5,"Roanoke college is a small private school that has an amazing academic program. Professors will always work with you although to get an A is hard,professors will for sure teach you and prepare you for your future. Also the food is amazing"
Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is so kind and they have a great community. Events are fun to go to like the President's Ball and it is remarkably easy to be involved on campus. The college takes students seriously with great representatives in Student Government and a genuine interest in students from faculty and staff. Food is better than most and you will never go hungry. In the beginning of the year they hold Friday on the Quad for a few weeks and everyone eats out on the back quad. There are tuns of study abroad opportunities here too! It has been an amazing experience here but invest in rain boots and a good umbrella  because it rains a lot.
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Roanoke College! The school is small, but everyone is very close and it feels like one big family! The professors are extremely supportive and only want what is best for the students and are flexible and understanding."
Sophomore,5,"Roanoke College is a well academically inclined atmosphere to be immersed in. With all of the positivity by the professors, faulty, and students, there is not a doubt that students will feel like an outcast while attending this specific college. It is important to feel cared about when trying to battle difficult assignments and tasks, and that is why Roanoke College is the perfect school for getting the appropriate help."
Alum,5,I had great experiences with the professors here and I commuted to this school part-time (while attending another college) for the interesting class options. I did learn from my classmates that being a member of Greek Life is considered fairly essential if you want to participate in the social life of this school.
Sophomore,5,"Roanoke College is one of those rare places that have the ability to make any person feel at home. It’s a small campus school with an even closer knit student body, which allows an individual to make connections with their peers and professors. The President and his First Lady come and eat dinner with the students roughly once a week. Instead of meeting during office hours, the professors have lunches with their students on occasion. The staff at RC are always available for their students and make the startling experiences of the abrupt adulthood most college students deal with much less frightening. They allow for these changes in the individuals social norm to be more of a learning, trial-and-error experience instead of new and terrifying. Roanoke is great for a student who doesn’t want to blend into their surrounding, but make a lasting impression and a beneficial impact on the world as a whole."
Sophomore,5,"The quaint environment of the college not only adds a strong sense of community to the students, but it allows for them to also easily explore their own interest and goals in a personally tailored fashion. While the surrounding college town is simple and doesn't offer what most large university towns do, the mountain range and nature parks in close proximity to the college easily make up for the lack of strong urban presence."
Sophomore,5,I love the beauty of the campus and mountains surrounding it. The professors are tough but the classes are very rewarding. I have never felt threatened or uncomfortable on campus.
Niche User,5,What I like about Roanoke College is how they stress preparing their students for whatever field of work they want to go into once they graduate.
Freshman,5,"I personally love how small the college is. I have made some of my best friends here, and it's only been a few short months. It is, however, very hard to maintain a very high GPA here. The classes here are very difficult, but I enjoy the small sized classes."
Freshman,5,Roanoke is a very welcoming college. There is no amount of words that I can say to speak to my utter joy in being at this college. When I got my college acceptance letter I cried because this is my top college.
Junior,5,"Great campus... great professors...great curriculum...overall, a great school! I came into this school having no direction or plan and it wasn't long before Roanoke helped me discover my passion. Small class sizes make it so easy to develop connections with both your classmates and professors. You aren't just a number here, and, personally, these connections have helped me grow and recognize my strengths and talents. In return, I have been given so many wonderful opportunities at this school that have truly prepared me for life after graduation. I would recommend Roanoke College in a heartbeat."
Freshman,5,"Roanoke College is a great school to go to if you want to be challenged academically. The professors truly care about your education, they are there to help you and to challenge you so that you graduate having gained as much from your experience here as possible. Attending this school is the best decision I've ever made in my life."
Alum,5,"Currently in medical school, and I was well prepared for the amount of work that I now face on a daily basis. Higher work load/more writing intensive than many other undergraduate programs, but well worth it if planning to go on to other graduate/professional programs. Campus life is above average but location on the Blue Ridge parkway allows for many outdoor adventures and makes up for the smaller campus size."
Alum,5,"I am a 2014 graduate of Roanoke College and I can honestly say attending Roanoke was one of the best choices I have made.  The classes are challenging and your professors expect a lot of you but you learn so much and your professors are there for you every step of the way.  There is so much to do on campus.  The opportunities are abundant all you have to do is take advantage of everything that's at your finger tips!  If you're looking at colleges definitely tour Roanoke.  It's a beautiful campus and will not disappoint, there is a little something for everyone there!"
Sophomore,5,"Professors genuinely care about my quality of life because the student body is so small. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the faculty are some of the happiest people I know. Opportunities for research, community engagement, and other interesting personal opportunities are bountiful."
Freshman,5,"Roanoke College is a stunning campus located in the heart of Salem, Virginia.  With downtown Roanoke nearby, Roanoke College is positioned near rolling hills and country back roads, along with city streets and night life, without excluding the beautiful nature that the location has to offer-including mountains and lakes.  The college itself is bustling with genuinely nice people and caring professors.  There is a great sense of comradery  among students and staff.  The food is fantastic, however I do wish there were more options- especially late-night food options.  Overall, Roanoke College provides a great education by using knowledgeable staff, as well as provides students with a diverse college life by offering various activities for any interests."
Freshman,5,"At Roanoke College I have been able to explore my interests and build a plan to land my dream job. The Intellectual Inquiry Curriculum (Roanoke's general education curriculum) is designed to help students learn the skills needed to succeed in college, but also gives valuable life skills. Roanoke excels in giving students a well rounded Liberal Arts education while allowing them to focus on their major starting their first semester if they choose."
Niche User,5,"Amazing performance overall, great academics, athletics, and professors. received much needed help through enrollment process extremely friendly zone awesome atmosphere and extremely diverse!"
Senior,5,Roanoke College has allowed me to reach beyond my goals. I have had a great college experience and would not change anything about it. The school allows you to become a lifelong learner and intellectual thinker.
Freshman,5,"Roanoke College has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life! I'm only a freshman and its felt like home since day one. With one of the friendliest student bodies around, small class sizes, passionate professors who care about their students, and one of the most beautiful campuses in the country, Roanoke is a perfect fit for anyone looking for a small"

Junior,5,"I've loved Roanoke College. The opportunities on campus are numerous. The only thing is, you have to put yourself out there to find them. I have a job on campus that relates to what I want to do in life. I've joined a Greek organization that I've met some of my life long friends from. As for academics, you better come prepared to go to class and study hard. The classes and professors aren't easy but it makes you for the better. They encourage you to work hard because that's what you have to do in real life. "
College Junior,5,I play Varsity Lacrosse and it has been a great experience on all levels.
College Junior,5,My school feel like a community. Everyone is friendly and helpful and I feel very safe being away from home.
College Junior,5,I wouldnt want to go anywhere else. Best decision I have ever made!
College Junior,5,"Competitive, academically challenging, prestigious school. Great internship and job opportunities are offered."
College Junior,5,great resources and health services!
College Junior,5,"I love Roanoke College. It has become apart of me and my life. I dread leaving every May, and look forward to coming back every August. Roanoke is my home away from home, and I am so blessed to have the opportunity to attend school there."
College Freshman,5,"Roanoke is a caring free opinion school, it was my top choice of colleges when I went searching for a school my senior year. I highly recommend Roanoke college to rising high school seniors."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is a great way to become more social at school.  Greek life really made me enjoy school so much more.  Greek life does great work throughout the community around Roanoke College and throughout the Roanoke College community.
College Junior,5,If you have an issue you will not have a problem receiving help.
College Junior,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and the food is amazing! The campus always has activities for the students to get involved in even if you are not into sports.
College Freshman,5,"The professors take an interest in seeing students succeed, and are accessible after classes. They are also very knowledgeable in their field's. There are a wide variety of classes to take as well as what the college refers to as intellectual inquiries."
College Freshman,5,"Roanoke College was not my first choice, but I'm glad that I was accepted and decided to attend college there. The campus is beautiful, the professors are accessible and engaging, class size is small, usually under twenty students, and the staff are welcoming and very interested in helping and seeing students succeed. The college is small, and has around twenty two hundred students, and it's easy to make friends and find others with the same interest that you have.There are opportunities to study abroad, do research, and participate in many activities on campus; soccer and lacrosse are big on campus, as well as many activities nearby off campus. The college and surrounding area is steeped in history and traditions, and the town of Salem is small and quaint, and Roanoke in ten minutes from the college. My dad suggested that I apply to Roanoke after reading the college guides and reviews, and I think that it turned out to be the best choice for me."
College Junior,5,"I am in a comunication studies major, I  love it, interships are awsome, Roanoke College have graeate options!"
College Junior,5,"All profesors are awsome, they are very professional and if you have some problems they will always help you. If you are a good student, they will always help you."
College Junior,5,"Dorms are very clean, actually the whole campus is wondefull, very clean, the mountains help you to feel free, the dorms are new and we have lots of facilities inside, like refrigerator, some dishes, the badrooms are clean, and the speciality of Roanoke College is to provide their students with a lot of food. The gym is awsome, you will have all that you need."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus safety officers clearly demonstrate that the safety of the students is their number one priority. At the same time, all of the officers are very kind to the students."
College Sophomore,5,Roanoke College constantly encourages students to apply for internships. The institution is also very helpful in finding on-campus jobs for students who are interested in holding one.
College Sophomore,5,"I have never received so much help and attention from my professors in all of my years as a student. The classes are extremely interesting. It is obvious that the professors are very dedicated to their fields of study, which makes me more engaged during the classes."
Senior,4,"Roanoke has a lot of things to offer in terms of a good connection with your professors and access to the campus's utilities. I never had any problem with any of my teachers for the most part though the amount of diversity on campus can be a little uncomfortable at times. However, I think the faculty and study body does a good job at combating some of the awkwardness through organizations like the BSA and different talks on campus."
Alum,4,"Faculty and staff are dedicated to the success of students, the school is academically focused and willing to help you succeed. The college could improve it's inclusion and diversity initiatives."
Alum,4,"Roanoke has an excellent setting, as it is nestled into downtown Salem and only a few minutes drive from downtown Roanoke. Additionally, it has several excellent humanities and social sciences programs, along with a number of praiseworthy faculty in the natural sciences. Faculty typically cover a broad swath of subject interests, allowing students to find very specific study opportunities. This imbues core curriculum courses with a specificity and intrigue that is rarely offered by larger universities. Additionally, its student to faculty ratio is commendable, as students are able to have meaningful interactions with instructors and receive helpful counseling."
Alum,4,"My online experience with Roanoke was quite brief, as it was only for the last month and a half of instruction due to the pandemic, yet I received thorough instruction from professors despite the extreme time crunch that they were put into."
Freshman,4,"I was hoping for Roanoke to be more diverse, but that was not the case. There are many groups that were based on minorities, and that was nice. Other than that, Roanoke was a nice school. Different clubs, people, and things to do."
Sophomore,4,I love the beautiful campus and the people are wonderful. I wish there were more food options on campus
Freshman,4,I like how understanding and supportive all the professors are especially during this pandemic. Roanoke College is very welcoming and different from a lot of the schools I visited. I felt at home as soon as I stepped on campus
Sophomore,4,"Roanoke College helped me grow a lot, specifically the incredible faculty and staff that are always there to support their students, at least within the humanities department. Although campus culture was kind of dull, lacked a lot of diversity, and was predominately althelete driven, I felt like it was an incredible place to get an education. The INQ Curriculum really opens up your eyes to different paths for careers that you otherwise would not have exposure to."
Sophomore,4,"I love Roanoke College! I didn't ever expect to go here and it sort of just happened. It was originally my backup school, but I loved it so much and everything fell into place. The size of the college is wonderful-- you'll never have a professor who doesn't know who you are. It's big enough that you see new people every day, and small enough that you'll wave hi to at least one person you know walking across campus. The environment is welcoming, and campus safety does a great job in their dealings with students and with the more serious issues that occur on all college campuses. Academics at Roanoke are no joke! Don't expect to come here and not do any work... the low retention rate is because of freshman who either drop out mid-year or they don't come back for sophomore year. But don't let that scare you-- if you find something that you love to do, that studying and work all ties together and the payoff is amazing!"
Sophomore,4,"The only problem I’ve found with this school is the amount of money you have to pay to be able to attend. It’s highly unaffordable for lower-income families like my own, but outside of the financial problems, the school is amazing. Well worth the money."
Senior,4,"I love how the college feels like a home away from home. Because it is small, there tends to be drama and a lot of people will know your business, but everyone is very kind and there is rarely any issues with fellow classmates. They have great athletics and really take care of their students and ensure they have the best 4 years."
Sophomore,4,"The school itself is beautiful. Over a few short months, I rapidly made the school my home, and the people within a new family of my own. It's small enough where the longest walk is 10 minutes across campus, which is nice when it's raining and you aren't faced with a 25 minute walk across a miles-wide campus. The classes are small and the teachers interact with every student, so absences are deterred. The president himself interacts with students, so it's nice to feel recognized in an establishment. Kids in the STEM field are a little worse off than humanities majors, but not by much. I'm a biochem major and I'm doing alright. The professors are lovely and the school is amazing"
Niche User,4,I've only visited Roanoke College. So far everyone is nice and truly wants my experience to be great.
Sophomore,4,Almost everything about beautiful Roanoke has been excellent since I've been here. Some things I would change are updates in South Side dorms and more food options for students.
Freshman,4,Roanoke college is a very beautiful campus with great professors. You will find how open the people are and how kind they can be. The safety is good and will give free rides if you need it.
Junior,4,"Roanoke College is a good liberal arts school. It has a nice, but very small campus, the professors are all passionate about what they teach, and the food is delicious."
Junior,4,"It’s lovely for a small liberal arts school, but if you are more STEM-oriented and have no interest in sports, this isn’t the place for you. The professors are wonderful, but the variety of classes could be much better."
Freshman,4,Roanoke College is a well rounded school and an excellent place for those experiencing their first time away from home.  Freshman and their parents are assisting in finding their rooms and moving their belongings from their vehicles I side the dorm.  The surrounding business are interesting and diverse as well as student friendly.
Freshman,4,"I love Roanoke College. This college campus is truly an amazing place to get my education. The campus is beautiful (18th most beautiful), the professors are always more than willing to go out of their way to help you, the athletic experience is amazing (Cheerleader), the dorms are kept clean and nice and the older dorms are being renovated, Campus Safety is always so helpful and friendly, the food is amazing, and the student life just allows so much coed and student/faculty interaction it creates an awesome tight-knit community.  The only downside is the dormitory housing costs, they are high, but other than that it is truly an amazing college and worth every penny thus far. Overall, I could not ask for a better college education and experience."
Niche User,4,"While visiting Roanoke College, I found out that they are very diverse academic and ethnicity wise even thought they may not seem like it just by looking."
Sophomore,4,I love Roanoke College! It has been a great experience! Everyone here is nice no matter where yoh go including students and staff. I love the environment and atmosphere.
Freshman,4,"Roanoke College is a place that I can call home. I remember in the beginning I was very hesitant to go to Roanoke college, mainly because of the bad stories I heard about Virginia such as 'Virginia is pretty racist', 'Virginia is very polluted with coal, among many others. But based on my experience so far, Roanoke college community is a very friendly and caring community. Individuals are willing to go out of their ways to help each other and unlike how many students thinks that in college  professors don't care about what students do, I'm 100% speaking truth when I say professors at Roanoke college are willing to extra mile to help their students in any way."
Senior,4,"I love my time at Roanoke College. The professors and the environment are wonderful. I think we pay a lot of money to go here and that it is not always appreciated, because some things seem to be excessive and/or unnecessary. I would recommend Roanoke to other students, but  there are things and ways to make it better for current and incoming students."
Alum,4,"Attended Roanoke in the 2000's. Overall, the academic experience was a mixture of extremely challenging and sometimes easy. But what was taught - critical thinking, reason, open discussion - was something that has stood apart for me after leaving college and meeting colleagues and people who attended other small colleges and large universities.

For all the reviews mentioning the buildings, parties (which I attended every weekend), and other superficial aspects of their college experience, the academic experience has proven to be the one thing that stuck with me. It wasn't ideological (liberal or conservative), the education was a classic education in the sense that they teach their students to be individuals who can clearly express their thoughts, reason with other people, and work towards projects and other challenging tasks. After leaving Roanoke, I felt like I was at an advantage over all the other recent college graduates in my work."
College Junior,4,I have been able to live in Blue Ridge which is a great dorm. There are some older dorms that are in need of rehab.
College Junior,4,"Greek life is a positive thing on campus, helping with many community projects."
College Junior,4,"I am in a sorority myself- Chi Omega. I love it, I love what my organization stands for, and I love the windows of opportunity it has opened for me. Do I ever wonder what life would be like if I didn't rush? Yes..do I regret rushing? Not necessarily. It has become apart of my life, and I am grateful for that."
College Junior,4,"There is no football team which is a turn off to most people. However, you get used to it once you are there. Soccer and Lacrosse are so big that it doesn't even matter anymore that we don't have football. It becomes normal and not missed."
College Freshman,4,"Small, but a great room to live in for the school year."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is very outgoing and a great impact on campus
College Freshman,4,The varsity sport teams are well put together and show tremendous sportsmenship for each team mate.
College Sophomore,4,Roanoke requires students to participate in May-term which gives them the opportunity to travel and take courses related to their future job or major.
College Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed all of my professors, but each of them differently.  I enjoyed my very difficult professors because they really challenged me during my first year so that I was better prepared for all my other courses.  I also enjoyed my more laid back professors because they were easier to relate to and I enjoyed their classes a lot more because the environment they provided.  One selling point about Roanoke for me was the class size and the expectations they have for students."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics are a big part of the school.  The school does a good job of trying to get a big crowd to come out and support the teams.  If you aren't able to find something to do on campus, you can always count on there being an athletic vent happening just around the corner."
College Sophomore,4,"At first, I had a hard time with interacting with the types of students there were (I found them to be unfriendly).  I then joined a sorority and felt much more at home.  The classes are very challenging and broaden my horizons and I think I will be very prepared when it comes time to take the next step in furthering my education and finding a job.  Roanoke has a small student body and very passionate professors.  I like the class sizes at Roanoke and how no TAs are used in the classroom."
College Sophomore,4,"Perhaps it is because I have just finished my second year, but it seems as though there is little crime on campus and few incidents of personal damage. Campus police are very visible, so there is a sense of security on campus, and students feel like they have resources to help them in a time of need. There are constant meetings and seminars regarding health and personal welfare that are either run by students or by visiting specialists. There is also a helpline for students to call in times of need, and the health department is also a phone call or a few blocks away, and the faculty in both resources are empathetic and caring."
College Sophomore,4,Most places in VA know that Roanoke is a hard school so the diploma means more than a place like Radford
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are super small and professors are always helpful!
College Sophomore,4,There are some run down buildings but most of the housing is really nice.
College Sophomore,4,There's not a ton of choices like other schools but we have a pretty solid Greek life.
College Sophomore,4,Roanoke has a beautiful campus and great staff but is very challenging.
College Junior,4,It's a great college and getting a job after graduation shouldn't be too difficult.
College Freshman,4,"In campus there is a highly mixed opinion on the quality of housing in school. On one hand you have people who either live in very old buildings with low quality or are not in good terms with their dorm mates/roommate or dorm life in general. Then there are those who live in higher quality buildings and have less grievances. Personally I feel like I fall into the latter group. I live in Sections, and there are some who would say these buildings are in low quality, and while there are indeed some negative aspects, I still prefer my dorm building over others that I have visited. Despite my personal preferences, the best buildings are, naturally, the newest suites that hold honors and scholar students, and Market Street. The catch is these buildings are expensive to live in, with housing costing quite a bit. Older buildings cost less, so really it's all about a balance between quality and your wallet. One thing that I do not like at all about the housing process is the website for choosing a roommate. The idea of sending a request to a person online (without even seeing a picture) just because of a short profile on the website is difficult for people like me who prefer to meet people face to face. I just had my roommate randomly chosen, but unfortunately they transferred, so now I don't know who I will room with."
College Freshman,4,"I have little experience with Greek life, but it looks like most of the Greek organizations seek to focus on improving the campus and participating in important events. I have more knowledge on sororities than fraternities, and the girls that I know that are in sororities are all very nice and aren't the snobbish type. One negative aspect that I've heard about Greek life is the ""underground fraternities"" that I've heard about, yet I have never seen them for myself."
College Freshman,4,"So far my experiences have been very positive. My school has a beautiful campus and is located in a cozy small town. The students are friendly and the professors and advisors want their students to succeed in their education. There are quite a few interesting activities and clubs, though sometimes participation and spirit is lacking. Nonetheless, I have more positive than negative experiences with Roanoke and I am grateful that I was chosen to be a student in such a good school. I am looking forward to my next year, and I have a good feeling that my experience will only get better over time."
College Junior,4,It's quiet here not much goes on.
College Junior,4,I love the Dorms! Crawford however need serious attention and it's very upsetting to see.
College Junior,4,Learning is a great experience but if you're not guided correctly you may not take full advantage to make yourself stand out.
College Sophomore,4,My teachers have set goals for me in order to set me up for success in the future career I want.
College Sophomore,4,I love all of my teachers but grading is intense and workload can be too much. Teachers want you to work hard.
College Sophomore,4,"My first positive experience was during what my school calls a SIM day. It is where you have decided to go to the school and you get to meet with other students who will be part of your class. I met some really great people, people I am still friends with today. Orientation was a whirl-wind and I've been having fun ever since then."
College Sophomore,4,The classes are great and most of the professors I have had are amazing. I like the INQ courses because they helped me decided the direction I wanted to go in for my major. One thing I don't like about this school is the lack of school spirit.
College Freshman,4,A wide variety of classes and majors are offered. Most students pursue double majors.
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus. Campus security is visible, dorms have keyed access for students that are living in them, the campus is well lit at night, and the town of Salem takes an interest in security and safety in and around campus. You can walk from campus to downtown in Salem. The police department is also near the campus."
College Freshman,4,"Roanoke is all about seeing students succeed and have successful lives after college, and preparing student's to make a difference in their communities."
College Freshman,4,"Move in went great, there were students to help freshman move in, and my roommate and I are good friends. My dorm is one of the older ones on campus, and the rooms are small, however I have adjusted and feel at home there. There are newer dorms that I toured during orientation, that are nicer."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman I haven't decided on joining a Greek club, and have not been to any meetings or social events.

I may consider it at a later time."
College Freshman,4,"I am not an athlete, but there are facilities for students to exercise and stay healthy. Soccer and lacrosse are big on campus. The college is building a new sports facility that is scheduled to open in 2016."
College Junior,4,"The academics are cool, there are lots of good classes is very interestng."
College Junior,4,"When you enter to campus, it is mandatory to fill an activity thatt taks about those themes, it  is very reflective, and also very useful."
Alum,2,"Long story short:  Re-consider your options if you're planning to pursue a science major with the goal of getting into a graduate program.  Roanoke Professors make it A LOT harder than it needs to be. Plus, the equipment and classrooms are outdated.  Fortunately, everything turned out okay for me. I have a career as a clinical research associate for a well known Pharmaceutical company but I don't attribute my success to Roanoke College professors whatsoever."
College Junior,2,Not for me. Sororities seem to be more professional and mature than fraternities on this campus.
College Freshman,2,There are not enough emergency lights
College Sophomore,2,A good friend of mine was raped last year and the guy that did it still goes here. She had to go through multiple trials and the verdict was still not guilty. There needs to be security cameras installed outside of residence halls and there should be a blue light system so people feel safer on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Students don't really get into sports here, the athletes are the only ones that have any involvement. There is little fan support and the amount of school spirit that is shown towards sports teams is way below what I had hoped for."
College Freshman,2,Professors treat each student like we are still in high school. Nothing is really unique about the school except that it has been around since the mid 1800s. The campus is pretty but definitely not worth all of the money. Small liberal arts colleges are overrated. I definitely would not choose this school again because tuition is so expensive and I've learned absolutely nothing.
College Freshman,2,There are only a couple options for off campus housing and they aren't that great. Campus housing will be your best bet
College Freshman,2,"Our school doesn't give much in scholarship, but they provide a great facade of the aid they will give. They give aid, but it's never nearly enough to cover the full growing cost."
College Junior,2,"Its only bad because we are grossly over charged to live on campus, and cannot move off campus until senior year."
College Freshman,2,limited off campus housing.  School must release you
College Sophomore,2,"Even the so called ""cool frats"" here throw worse parties than what I used to go to in high school lol"
College Sophomore,2,"Credits don't transfer out of here,  so even if you decide you don't like Roanoke your stuck here!"
College Sophomore,2,"Parties are lame if it wasnt for the free beer, id rather stay in the dorms"
College Senior,2,There's generally an imbalance of guy to girl ratio at parties. I think if freshman go to parties their academic life is going to slip. Go with friends if you want to have fun.
College Senior,2,The school is 60% girls. Majority of girls and guys are Greek. Majority of students are upper/upper middle class.
College Sophomore,2,"You can't live off campus until you are an upperclassmen, but even as an upperclassmen the housing options are very limited. It is hard to be allowed by the school to live off campus before you are a senior."
College Sophomore,2,Most students are very obvious with their drug abuse and don't think to much about what they are doing before they do it.
College Freshman,2,"At Roanoke college it's really not that bad until you get caught, then there's a target on your back"
College Freshman,2,School cares very little about their athletes.  There's a fee to play on the teams and the school is very stingy in spending money on any sport other than lacrosse.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people are not able to live off campus. The college only lets a few seniors off, so a majority of people live on campus"
College Freshman,2,"Greek life takes over campus.

They all dress up together certain days of the week and sit together in the dining halls.  You feel really left out if youre not in one."
College Freshman,2,"Roanoke College is located in Salem, Va.  Salem, VA is a suffering town with nothing to do.  Roanoke (the city) is about 20-30 minutes away, as is the mall.  That being said, if you do not have a car, there is NOTHING to do."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from a household with a chef as a parent, I was not happy with many aspects of Roanoke's dining hall. 

I wish they served hormone free, grass-fed, free-range meat.

I would be happier if they switched up the toppings in the salad bar. 

I am upset with the quality of pasta at the pasta bar.  The lack of consistency is frustrating, sometimes the pasta is undercooked sometimes it is overcooked.  

I wish they had healthy options like quinoa more often."
College Freshman,2,"I would of chosen another school for several reasons. The first being that Salem, Virginia is a poor and decrepit town with little nightlife, attractions, or shopping. It is a functioning town because of the school, but I would be pressed to say it's a ""college town"". Secondly, the school is very small which creates the atmosphere of high school. I attended a very small high school and I can find many similarities in the social functioning here compared to my high school. You will know everyone you probably will ever meet at this college after 3 months and they will know you, as well as your personal life. Rumors still exist at this school and reputation is important to keep up. If you do not get into the Greek Fraternity or Sorority that you wanted to get into, you're social life will be greatly effected. Thirdly, the Campus Police ""Campo"" unlike past years, has become very strict. In the past 2 months, 8 of my close friends have been written up more than once. They are allowed to room search or enter any room at any time if they are ""suspicious"". This suspicion can be anything from food burning in a room, having more than 3 people in your room, as well as ""Campos"" habit of stalking out areas where they believe people will smoke weed. If you believe they don't want to get you in trouble, you are very wrong, if there is anything they can find to write up - they will. Many people I know want to transfer because of its strictness and general high school atmosphere. Unfortunately transferring is very difficult here because many of the courses don't transfer as a credit. If you can avoid the unfortunate situation of being stuck that I am currently in, then I would suggest you do so."
College Sophomore,2,Alcohol visibility is present after a weekend when there are beer cans and solo cups laying around. Most students do take part in the party scene. Drug usage is not as present as alcohol though. 
College Sophomore,2,Parking is very limited. The parking lots are overcrowded except for one lot. Parking is strictly enforced as well 
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is very present on campus. Although Greek can have its plus sides, it is very cliquey, Greek life tends to keep to themselves in most situations. It causes a very evident division of Greeks and non- Greeks. "
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus dining is very limited if you do not have a car on campus. Without a car, there are only 4 or 5 restaurants that someone could go to. The quality and price of theses restaurants are good,  but the better restaurants are farther away from campus.  "
College Sophomore,2,"While there are computer labs available, it is best to have your own laptop with you. Many times professors will encourage the use of electronic devices in order to access the materials they are using. The school gives each student a $50 printing allotment per year. This is what they have deemed as average printing cost and more can be purchased by the student based on need. "
College Sophomore,2,"Transportation is through a bus, ""Maroon Express."" It's only available on weekends and takes you downtown, the mall and to the dorms off campus. Not bad I think. But I would have to say that the bar and club scenes aren't crazy exciting. They do offer different bar locations downtown but nothing big. Parties aren't really my thing but I'm sure they aren't too bad. Well at least from what I hear."
College Junior,2,"Usually as long as you're not an idiot about things, you don't have to worry about campo. There are definitely some power trippers, though. It's not hard to stay out of trouble."
College Freshman,2,If your looking you can find but drinking is more available.
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot of diversity at Roanoke. Coming from a very diverse high school and city, it was a shock to see the lack of diversity at Roanoke. There isn't a complete lack of diversity, however its not as diverse as I would've liked it to be."
College Junior,2,The school provides no transportation. You need to have a car or know someone with a car to get around
College Freshman,2,"RoCo off-campus dining is pretty bare.  Within walking distance there is Mac & Bob's, Elberberry's and Mill Mtn. Coffee.  A few miles down the road there's a Chick-fil-a, Applebee's, Sheetz (a staple), Subway, K&W Cafeteria, a mexican place, Burger King, etc.  Not much to choose from if you're accustomed to countless fast-food places.  It takes some getting used to and it definitely helps to have a friend with a car."
College Freshman,2,"College is not too diverse, but it draws many from other countries and the Northeast part of the United States."
College Sophomore,2,"Could Be Better – Unless you have your own car on campus, I think it's tough to get around off-campus. The college should offer a shuttle to and from the airport, which is only about 5 miles away, so students don't have to spend so much on cab fare."
College Sophomore,2,"What You'd Expect for Division III – We're a D3 school, so we don't have a huge fan base. Men's basketball and lacrosse get the most fans, but sometimes people will go to soccer games. Our teams are okay, sometimes we win, sometimes we don't. People usually have better things to do than go to games, but they're nice to watch from the terrace of the cavern if you're eating dinner while a game is on."
College Freshman,2,"If Needed, Bus Shuttle – Campus is very small, so students walk everywhere. However, if you need to go somewhere off campus, there usually is a bus that will take you to and from places, but hours are an inconvience. A taxi would work better."
College Freshman,2,"Campo Stinks – Campo (campus security) is notorious for screwing kids over. For a first time offence of underage possession of alcohol, it is a fifty dollar fine and six months of probation. If you get caught again, you're out."
Alum,1,"Academics are greatly lacking for the amount bragging this school presents. Most teachers lacked structure or even passion for teaching students and social  depends if you are rich or not and if you are willing to pay for the frat and sororities. Also, the sexual misconduct for such a small school is frustrating to see. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION."
Niche User,1,If you love your child DO NOT SEND THEM HERE. Roanoke college is a terrible institution. The bloated administrators have zero care for their students and the campus is filled with violence and sexual assault. The faculty at this school is atrocious and backwards. Campus Police are more focused on arresting students for minor marijuana/alcohol offenses than they are protecting the students. Please take my advice and DON’T GO HERE!!!!
Sophomore,1,"I promise you if you aren’t planning on joining a sport or greek life, you won’t enjoy this school. Every friend I made ended up transferring by the second semester. I didn’t return for a second year either. I still know a couple people there that are miserable and simply unable to transfer anywhere. The core classes they require you to take don’t transfer to any other colleges. Thats how you end up stuck there."
Freshman,1,"Not a great experience. If you come from lots of money and are white you will do well here. No diversity at all. Classes are okay, people suck. Lots of racism. Dorm that is predominantly black kids (called Crawford) is refereed to as the ""craw-jects"" to sound like projects... Take a guess as to why. Like I said, racism is strong at this school. Half of the kids don't even realize how ignorant they are. This school is a bunch of privileged white kids in sororities/fraternities doing coke with their parents money and not giving a shit about classes. I am transferring, thank god."
College Freshman,1,It is nearly impossible to get an apartment.
College Freshman,1,"The housing process is very poor and unfair to underclassman, they don't really have a chance to get the nice dormitories. Instead, the underclassman are left to pick up the scraps that the upperclassman didn't want."
College Freshman,1,"The beer is cheap, the guys are disgusting, rude, and perverts and the girls don't help each other out either"
College Freshman,1,They need to prepare more fresh meals and make real food for the students
College Freshman,1,"The bathrooms are terrible and the stairs are so tiring to walk up, they need to do something with just having communal showers or at least install an elevator"
College Sophomore,1,"Campo here is the worst, they go after kids all day for drinking and smoking, they searched my room on two occasions with no other reason than simply that they could,  then they charge you in criminal court,   one time I came back from a sorority party at 3 am and Campo was waiting for me with a breathilizer outside of my room, and then they charged me in court again for it.  SCREW THOSE BITCHES"
College Sophomore,1,"If you sign up late for housing as a freshman they throw you in crawford, its a desolate, gross, dirty place. There was a colony of ants living in the water fountain next to my room? wtf, the showers were horribly gross, I felt dirtier after I showered than before, and by the end of the weekend the trashcans are overflowed and trash fills the bathroom floors"
College Sophomore,1,"Academics are very sub par here, at best"
College Sophomore,1,The school barely lets anyone off campus and you can only get off campus senior year. The school doesn't help us find housing off-campus either
College Junior,1,"There's a shuttle that goes into Roanoke on the weekends, but that's it. Nothing that you need (Walmart, Kroger, Starbucks...) is in walking distance. Either bring your car or make friends with someone who did because you will get stuck if you don't."
College Sophomore,1,"I want to major in music and go into music education. As a freshman (going to be sophomore) while registering for classes, there were no available spaces left in EDU 101. So I can't take it. How am I supposed to declare a major with something I can't get into a class for? Well, I can't. I don't know many people that can."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are a partier this is the school for you. However if you are anything like me this school is not the place for you. I have friends... who all party on the weekends. I sit in my dorm room and watch movie by myself waiting for my friends to call saying they forgot their key and can't get back in or other mishaps like that. All of my friends get extremely drunk on the weekend which is personally not my scene. So while there are people around on the week nights and days you can forget the weekends. They go to bed at around 3 am and wake up at 2 pm. So again, if you are a party person this could be your school. It just isn't mine."
College Sophomore,1,The transportation offered only takes place on Friday or Saturday and they are never on time.  They also only go to the Mall and Wal-mart and the movie theater.  It is a lot easier to just have your own car.
College Sophomore,1,the school doses not let you live off campus - you are required to stay on.  Therefore there are not many options close by although in Roanoke City there are a lot of good and cheap apartment complexes.
College Sophomore,1,"There are very few options for students who want to live off campus at Roanoke. Students must sign up for a very selective waiting list with very few spots available. For students who find it important to live off campus, Roanoke College is probably not the place for you."
College Freshman,1,The guys and girls seem like stuck up snobs that have money and they KNOW IT.

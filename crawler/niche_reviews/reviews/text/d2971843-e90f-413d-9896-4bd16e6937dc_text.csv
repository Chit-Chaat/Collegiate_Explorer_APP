Junior,5,They have been very active with keeping us all up to date and you can tell how hard the professors are working to make this as effective as possible.
Freshman,5,"I moved all the way across the country to go to Towson University to play softball from Chandler, Arizona. This was an extremely hard move, but Towson has made me feel at home here. They are extremely helpful and amazing people. The food is good and even the students on campus are extremely nice."
Freshman,5,The professors have been super awesome communicating with their students. I know all of the things that I need and they always respond quickly if you have a question.
Junior,5,"Students can easily recognize the University's efforts for diversity and inclusion. This is one of Towson University's core values. They are accepting of everyone of various ethnicities, races, cultures, and identity. Towson University staff acknowledges everyone by pronouns to ensure every student and staff feels safe and included. There are many clubs and organizations on campus and there is a place for everyone. The campus is big but not overwhelming. Students can walk the campus in about 20 minutes. The University offers classes in a variety of subjects so even science majors can take dance classes. There is great versatility in food options."
Junior,5,Towson has an interesting social aspect and a great campus to explore with new people on the horizon. Their academic program is top notch for various people.
Junior,5,"Towson professors adapted nicely to the online learning environment, and it helped me in making a smoother adjustment as well."

Junior,5,"Great experience, parties are fun. Greek life is a great community. The academics are exceptional and there are plenty of opportunities to further one's career."
Junior,5,Group projects were a little challenging but everything else was adapted for a seamless online experience.
Sophomore,5,"Towson University has so much too offer for a variety of people. Every person can find something that they love to do on and off campus. It is in such close proximity to restaurants, the movies, and other forms of intertainment that you will never be bored. I would like to see more on campus activities though. The weekends can be very boring, forcing you to go off campus to enjoy life. Towson University is consistently making improvements and changes to the campus to benefit the students living there and studying there."
Freshman,5,"Towson is a great university, it's very diverse, the campus is beautiful and has lots of daily activities that students can partake in. During the spring sadly we were not on campus but the university is very lively during the warmer times of the year. It's a really cool experience to see thousands of students all doing different things whether it be studying, exercising, conversating etc."
Sophomore,5,"I took a music class online. It was my first experience and I absolutely loved it! All of the course was clear and organized through every detail. There was absolutely nothing I was confused about. If i had any questions and asked, answers were given right away. I would do it all over again!"
Sophomore,5,"Towson welcomed me with a warm heart. There is so much diversity that you meet new people. You would never have to worry about not making friends. The professors are really attentive to students needs in the classroom. The support is wonderful. Whenever you need help from anyone, a staff in any department can assist. I love Towson!"
Sophomore,5,"Towson University is a great school. Not just saying that because I go there but honestly because it is. The people are great, theyâ€™re really friendly. The education is amazing honestly , 5 stars."
Sophomore,5,"Perfect sized campus not to big not to small. Love the diversity, bars,clubs, and Greek life are great. Academics are also strong, book worm or party goer you'll love it here !"
Junior,5,"Towson University was the only college I applied to when I decided I wanted to transfer from my community college. Not only was I looking for the right school to pursue my major to the fullest, I was also craving the campus experience. I am happy to say that Towson has exceeded my expectations in both fields and I am proud to be a Towson tiger! Everything from the quality of education, the accessibility of academic resources, and the diversity and atmosphere found throughout the campus are everything I expected and more from this institution."
Freshman,5,I love the environment and how everyone can find their people. so many clubs to choose from! the teachers are always willing to help and are open to questions!
Sophomore,5,"Im a sophomore at TU and so far my experience has been okay. I would probably complain about the food options, as there are not many. Since the school is expanding there is a lot of construction so you will have to detour and hike a lot to your classes."
Junior,5,"When it comes to the atmosphere at Towson University, I can tell that I am being supported and encouraged to learn in every way. It has a small school feel, even though it is a large public college. I enjoy my classes, and I love being able to make friends quickly and easily through clubs and classes."
Freshman,5,"I'm not there yet. I am a senior in high school, however, I just enrolled at Towson for the upcoming fall semester. I did a tour and it was amazing. Beautiful campus with beautiful facilities. I am so excited."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a dance major with a performance and choreography track. The dance department is so accepting of everyone, and there is never a day where I doubt my decision to go to Towson to pursue my dance career. The professors have really challenged me to perform to the best of my ability, and to always aim for excellence.  I truly feel that I will be the most successful in the near future having attended Towson. As far as my other studies, I am more than satisfied. All of the professors from all of the departments really have your best interest in their hearts and only want to see you succeed."
Niche User,5,"Towson University is a university centrally located in the heart of Towson. Although the area is a little pricey, security is immaculate and on-campus jobs are easy to come by. After classes feel free to go to Barnes and Noble to get in some studying and enjoy a trip to Towson Mall to enjoy a variety of eateries like The Cheesecake Factory, Bonefish Grill, P.F Chang's, and more!"
Freshman,5,"When I visited the University I fell in love with it, the campus is safe as it provides emergency blue lights. Also, the food options were something I would enjoy eating everyday. This campus is right by the mall and many other food options and stores. Can't wait to attend for the fall 2020 semester."
Niche User,5,"I love Towson University, I am an incoming freshman and I have visited on  multiple occasions. My sister is enrolled as a sophomore and I have heard and witnessed nothing but great things."
Junior,5,I liked the atmosphere of Towson University but there is always a lot of construction in the area and on Campus
Senior,5,It has been a long four years but very nice to attend a great university. The faculty and staff go above and beyond for students.
Sophomore,5,"I like the diversity at Towson University. Not only are there many students from the United States, but also from across the world. People are nice, I feel like I am on track for my major, which is Education, and that my courses are invented and informative. I believe that Towson will prepare me for mmy future!"
Freshman,5,"I love the close-knit community and the welcoming feeling I get from everyone, from the staff to the students. Despite some lectures having many students, up to 60 pupils, the professors still take the time to make sure the majority understands what is being taught. One thing I would change about my school, which is more of a personal preference, is the quality of the food at the dining halls. Changes to the menu would be nice, but seeing that the only issue with Towson University is something relatively small and not affecting me academically, my love for my school does not diminish. My biggest goal for attending the university is to get high grades and earn my bachelor's degree, and they have provided me with the resources to help me achieve that."
Niche User,5,Towson is a wonderful school with lots to do and lots of ways to get involved! The campus is beautiful and just the right size for a student like me.
Freshman,5,"I really like it so far. I'm going into my second semester and of my 5 professors last semester, I would say 4 were excellent. There are plenty of on-campus events to occupy my time. The quality of the food depends on where you get it. West Village Dining Hall is known to be the best dining hall. 

There are plenty of clubs. A women's self-defense class is offered at the beginning of each semester. There are free classes at the gym. Next semester I'm planning to take the boxing classes.

In the nearby area, there's plenty of restaurants, a movie theater, and a mall. I'm not old enough to get into the nearby clubs, but I know there are some in the area that my peers like to go to."
Niche User,5,Towson University has an amazing campus filled with wonderful supportive people. They are always wanting you to succeed and feel comfortable.
Sophomore,5,The professors are very helpful and there are so many opportunities for help. Itâ€™s such a safe and inclusive campus.
Freshman,5,"Students get the big school feel while still having small, intimate class sizes that allow you to build relationships with staff and excel in your field."
Junior,5,"I was incredibly bummed that I couldn't go to MICA because of how expensive it was, but Towson's even better since it lets me interact with a myriad of people from different majors while helping me thrive in my own. I love the art department at Towson University. I basically live at the Center for the Arts; the relaxed atmosphere, the theater majors who sing in the hallways, and the tools I have at my disposal there make it an awesome place to be.
Besides that, the campus is easy to navigate, the staff are super welcoming, and the optimistic air about the place is always encouraging."
Niche User,5,I have many family members and friends who have attended Towson University and have loved it. I have visited multiple times and each time Iâ€™m greeted with such open arms by the students  and staff. The campus is beautiful and is in a great location.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy Towson's campus and work environment. The campus has everything a student needs to enjoy their college life or improve it. There are great food choices around campus. The gym is always accessible. Also, if you are in need of a job, there are on campus jobs that you can sign up for and if you do not wish to work on campus, there is a shopping mall not to far from the campus. The students and the diversity is what I like most about Towson. The people around me are open and you are never alone. It is easy to make friends."
Sophomore,5,I like how itâ€™s a small school with a big school feel. Towson is my home away from home. I am involved on campus with being on one of the dance clubs and I am also involved in greek life while doing community service and fundraising events.
Niche User,5,"I have been to Towson university for school visits and have always enjoyed the campus. I wish to attend this school in the future. This campus is full of diversity, opportunity, and positive energy. It is a large campus with many majors like Political Science, Pre-Med, Business Administration and Management and much more. I recommend any one to visit the campus and consider Towson University."
Junior,5,i hear lots of good thing about the college of towson University and i went to there 3 time really nice place to study good atmosphere to study and also like to tell everyone please visit here.
Junior,5,quality education at a decent price! pretty standard college. sports games are a ton of fun and good night life and student activities.
Sophomore,5,It's really fun and diverse here. Everyone is really friendly and the teachers are very helpful. Anyone who goes to this school would have a lot of fun and truly enjoy the experience.
Niche User,5,"It's a big campus, I feel like it's a great way to be in a new environment and making new friends. It seems very fun and relaxing since it has a section outside where you can lay down and do your work."
Freshman,5,Towson University is the a good college to attend. i current do not attend Towson but I will be next year. Towson has helped me with the application process when I started applying to colleges. With out the help of TU then I would be stuck
Alum,5,"My experience at Towson University was very positive.  The campus is beautiful and well located.  Academically, the school offers a wide variety of classes to meet your degree requirements and the professors are fair and professional."
Freshman,5,"Towson University is the quintessential school for a unique and diverse college experience.  There are amazing people and staff here at Towson and the campus is full of life. At Towson University, you feel at home. You feel if you belong somewhere. There are so many clubs and organizations to get involved in here on campus and there's always somewhere you can fit in. There's literally something for everyone. My experience here at TU has been a great one so far and I would definitely recommend this school to anybody!"

Niche User,5,"The campus is very beautiful, nice gym, clean dorms. A lot of good surrounding places. Movie theater within 10 mile radius"
Niche User,5,"When I visited back in 2018, I loved the campus and the community. The students made me feel welcomed and apart of the school."
Freshman,5,"I like that the majority of the student body is very welcoming and nice. For the most part, the professors are understanding and will work with you besides a few in the science department. A lot of lecture is the same and many teachers grade on attendance although it is not required to actively participate in class. The bulk of your grade in most classes will be exams so it is imperative to take good notes. The biggest piece of advice I can give you is to show up to class and try to make as many friends even if you are not social because it will help you a lot if you can have a little study group in each class."
Junior,5,Towson has been very accepting. I was nervous about getting lost on such a big campus or forgetting important dates but they have some very kind staff who are always happy to help.
Niche User,5,Has an amazing campus and so many great and loving people there. An absolutely beautiful place to be and enjoy a great college experience with great food and activities.
Freshman,5,Towson University is welcoming to new students. They help with moving in and schedule activities so you can meet new people.
Alum,5,"College is what you make of it, not what you expect of it.  I had an amazing four years at Towson because i was INVOLVED!  Some of the best college facilities I have been exposed to.  Only problem is the parking situation."
Senior,5,"The president, Dr. Kim, and professor are very enthusiastic and love helps the students and the community. I like how many the clubs and organizations it had for every department or path. I am in Math and Since pathway and join to Software Energring club. There are also many clubs that I join such as, Agape Christian Fellowship club, First Generation club, Risk Management club, and much more."
Junior,5,Meeting people from all different backgrounds and coming together in the classroom and in free time in order to make friends and meet people who will be in your life for years to come.
Sophomore,5,I love Towson University! It is a great school and a great campus! All my classes and professors have been awesome!
Junior,5,Great at making people feel welcomed and very informative on the transfer process. Advisors have been amazing at making sure the classes I take are the right ones in order for me to graduate in a timely manner while also working full time.
Sophomore,4,"Yes, I took my Calculus II and Computer Science II classes, and although it took a little getting used to the new process of learning, it eventually became an efficient means of communication between me and my professor."
Sophomore,4,"Towson overall is such a wonderful school that offers great diversity, academics, and social scene. I recommend anyone that should apply for here as it contains something for everyone."
Niche User,4,"From the first time that I've been at the Campus, they have been really nice. The dorms were pretty good, the food was amazing, the campus was really easy to get through, and then the instructors and students were awesome."
Niche User,4,"Towson is such a great place to be, they have such a great marching band program. That was the first time I went there, to do a summer marching band program. It was really amazing, I learned so much there with the great instructors at Towson University."
Senior,4,Towson University (TU) lives up to its goal of promoting diversity. Almost everyone would find a place or a group to connect with on TU's  enormous and diverse community.
Senior,4,Online classes are well organized. The Professors are always available when students have questions or concerns. The application used for online classes are secure and easy to maneuver.
Freshman,4,"The professors have been really nice and helpful lately, which I didn't expect for some reason. Even though everything is remote learning, everything has been going smoothly."
Freshman,4,All five of my classes are online through Blackboard and we use Zoom or Blackboard Collaborate to have lectures and speak with each other. My teachers have used a feature called breakout groups which separates the students into groups and that helps us get to know each other as if we were face to face.
Junior,4,"Towsonâ€™s online experience is alright and simple enough to use, but still requires more refinement in terms of how the professors distribute information."
Freshman,4,"The online learning experience with Towson is wonderful. Typically using zoom as a way to interact virtually, it has almost no difference to the traditional classroom experience because the teachers are just as engaged."
Freshman,4,"The faculty and staff at Towson are wonderful. They try to be as helpful as possible. The only thing is that sometimes the student ambassadors are no help at all. I remember at my orientation, the student ambassadors laughed a student's question and then could not answer some of the most simplest things such as questions on transportation."
Junior,4,"A great campus with plenty of opportunity. Helpful staff, great classes and plenty of things to do. I haven't had a bad class yet; the only thing I can complain about is the parking!"
Junior,4,"Some of my classes transferred online unexpectedly due to the COVID pandemic. Towson was quick to adapt, along with the professors. Any technical issues were ironed out within a week - it was just like attending in person! A big relief in a stressful time."
Junior,4,"I like Towson because I feel that the professors are great and easy to form relationships with. The professors have helped me to formulate my opinions, morals, values, and purpose in life.  I owe so much to my academic advisor for the guidance that I have received."
Junior,4,"I have loved my experience at Towson! There are so many opportunities to get involved! Towson has become a comfortable place for me to get out of my comfort zone. At first, the campus seems huge, but after getting involved in a wide range of different organizations on campus, I feel like I can't go anywhere without seeing someone I know! There is always so much to do on campus and so much going on in the Towson area. It is truly such a great college town!"
Sophomore,4,When the corona virus hit the US and put us all in quarantine I thought Towson did a very good job transitioning to online classes. They let the professors choose how they wanted to teach online and did their best to make the transition smooth for everyone. They extended the withdrawal deadline to the day before finals and made every class available for pass/fail. I think overall Towson did a great job with online classes.
Sophomore,4,"As a rising sophomore I am very happy with my choice of going to Towson. I have had a very good experience my first year and there is not much I dislike about it. There are so many clubs and organizations for you to join and the academics are good too; I only had one or two professors that I did not like but that is bound to happen at any school.  When looking at universities I was very intimidated by large state schools but I love the size of Towson; it's not so small that you know everyone on campus but also not so big that you're constantly getting lost and only have 100+ person classes. As an incoming freshman I did not like that you weren't able to pick your fall schedule. The university chose your classes for you based on your major and a survey you filled out, I understand that it takes the pressure off of students so they don't have to go through the stressful process of choosing classes but I was put into some classes I was not interested in."
Sophomore,4,"It was  hard to learn online because I had to teach a lot of the work to myself, but if you put in enough effort it is not too difficult."
Sophomore,4,Towson University was one of my reach schools. I applied because of in state tuition and I do not regret that decision till this day. The staff and students are friendly and welcoming. It has some diversity in the campus. And I've just had good memories at Towson. I highly recommend you apply there.
Sophomore,4,"During the Covid- 19 pandemic, we had to move to all online classes and it was a struggle at first but it became easier with time. The professors were really helpful and understanding during the transition."
Senior,4,"Towson is a very interesting university. The school has many positive and negative. However, I believe the positive out way negative."
Freshman,4,Towson is a great school! It has a variety of majors and has a beautiful campus. There were so many clubs to join and a handful of events every weekend.
Freshman,4,Towson's online experience was smooth and easy to follow. Professors were easy to reach and assignments were easy to hand in.
Freshman,4,"Because of the ongoing pandemic  classes had to make a transition to online learning. This was a new experience since in my first year I was thrust into a learning environment that I wasn't used to. However, my professors tried adapting as best as they could and we made it work. Sometime learning was difficult online but other than that it was an okay process."
Junior,4,Towson has several opportunities to offer students. The staff members (the nice ones) are always supportive and will help make your college career perfect for you.
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience was a bit rough, but it honestly could have been worse! I was a bit stressed out at first but when I got the hang of things, it was smooth."
Niche User,4,"Iâ€™ve taken several tours of this school and been there several times for many school sponsored trips. Iâ€™ve met many of the students and staff and Iâ€™ve even sat in on a few great classes. I think that this school is great for anyone and especially for any Marylander looking to get away from their hometown while still staying in the state! Also, the food? Exquisite."
Sophomore,4,The campus is very diverse and the dorms are amazing. The professors are average but overall it a really good school
Niche User,4,I haven't gone yet but when touring the campus I found it to be very charming and friendly. All the staff I met or ran into were extremely kind and I can't wait to go!
Freshman,4,"After attending Towson University during my freshman year, I learned many different aspects of growing up and growing into the person that I hope to be. The staff is very generous and takes their personal time to help you with whatever you may need. The one thing I love the most about Towson is the diversity among the students. It opens up new ways of life for some and helps students find out who they truly are. I can't wait to be back for the fall semester!"
Niche User,4,"Towson University is an A+ school. It is great in the classroom, the campus lifestyle and engagement is fantastic and satisfying. The parties are crazy fun and amazing to go to wherever you are on campus. It was a great college experience for me and I know that you will like going there as well."
Freshman,4,"I love it but I would like to see the food prices go down some so that people with the 10 meal plan can get more food. Matter of fact, it would be nice to see the 10 meals bumped up to 12 for the same amount."
Sophomore,4,I loved living on campus my first year and I loved the people Iâ€™ve met. I liked working on campus in my dorm building. The professors are good and really care about your education.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see Towson change their views on diversity. Administration still has not changed the names of its dormatories named after previous slave owners. I like that Towson cares about the students and their success. There are many clubs and groups so that no one feels left out and although the construction is loud, I like to see the money spent going towards bettering the programs and academic buildings."
Freshman,4,I like the community at Towson. All of my classes are racially diverse. This made my experience as a person of color more enjoyable.
Alum,4,"I loved being at Towson University. The atmosphere had a ""warm-like"" feeling. The teachers were excellent. My favorite part about Towson is its diversity. Walking around campus, you will see people from various cultures, ethnic groups, and races. I had a great experience at Towson University."
Freshman,4,"Towson University is really close to my home and easy for me to commute. It is also in a nice setting where I have access to a local Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, pizza places, and places to shop in my free time. I like the diversity of the people at this college as it allows me to meet plenty of new people throughout my college years."
Freshman,4,I really like Towson University because it has presented me with so mnay oppurtunities within my chosen major. I also had a lot of oppurtunities outside of the college scene and was able to get involved in the community by volunterring at an elementary school and being in a group called Project Serve. The professors I've had so far have been helpful and nobody here wants to see you struggle academically or socially.
Junior,4,"Towson university is a very all inclusive school. One of the great things there is that staff, students, and faculty all introduce each other with preferred pronouns."
Niche User,4,Nice Campus and nice people.  Easy to find your way around too.  The classes were tailored nicely to meet the needs of the students in order to help them succeed in their intended major.
Freshman,4,It's been good so far. The facilities are nice and I feel generally safe walking around campus. My only complaint is that the shorter bus route around campus stops running after 5:30.
Freshman,4,"So far, I am enjoying my education at Towson University. I enjoy majoring in computer science because it challenges me to learn and create programs that I actually enjoy doing.  I like how the professors care about students and truly want the best for them if they are willing to put in the effort. I would change the security level at the school. I understand it is for the safety of the students, but it seems that every corner you turn there is a camera watching your every move."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently an undergrad at Towson. The student body is very diverse, there are so many clubs to choose from, and I generally feel secure on campus. There's always something to do."
Niche User,4,Towson is my top school! I love how big and clean the campus is. I had a great tour. He showed us every part of the campus and explained its history. The location is perfect. It is located in a place where you can go find really anything you can imagine. I have heard great things about their nursing program and I am very excited. There are some safety concerns but I think it is still worth it.
Sophomore,4,Towson has a great business program and professors who are willing to make sure you have the best chance possible of succeeding.
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity within all of the students, everyone is accepted no matter what. There's a lot of construction on campus which ruins the aesthetic but overall, that's my only complaint"
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed many of my teachers, especially those in the theatre department. They have strong educational values and are there to help you along your college path. Most parts of campus are fairly accessible, though it can be confusing to new students."
Freshman,4,"very good, i've heard lots of good things about this university, so far it's really good. looking forward for the next few years"
Junior,4,"i think the school itself is great. It is very fairly priced and a large enough school to really create a campus feel, but having everything so close, so it seems small and close knit. The academics I feel are very good, but the one downfall is applying for classes. Classes fill up so fast and there is a lot of problems with that."
Freshman,4,"Towson University is an excellent school. The academics and student life are great, the food is good (most of the time), and the people are very friendly. It has become a bit of a party school though, which is unfortunate because the parties are loud even late at night on school nights. But it's been a great experience for me for the most part!"
Alum,4,I am glad I chose to attend Towson University for undergrad. I am now pursuing a master's degree here too. This school has plenty of resources to help you succeed you just have to be active on campus and search.
Niche User,4,"I walked on to the campus and I automatically fell in love with it. It has many clubs and organizations, lots of job opportunites, and it has a five year masters program instead of six."
Senior,4,"It is a great school, with many great professors who care deeply about their students. Some students got scholarships, some are able to pay out of parents' pocket, and some are still applying for financial aid. I am working full-time and am a full-time student, so  I am looking to apply"
Junior,4,"Towson was my first and only choice. it is situated in a very nice spot, it is close to Baltimore City and D.C. The students there are wonderful, I have made some of my best friends in my entire life here. All of my classes have challenged me to examine myself and my beliefs, and I feel like I am better of now than I was when I started at Towson University."
Senior,4,"Towson could improve its' faculty awareness for student service options. This means that teachers and service providers could benefit from accurately knowing what other services are available on campus to students in need. When a student goes to the faculty for a concern, that faculty should be able to accurately direct the student to a resource of support; not provide misguided information."
Sophomore,4,Overall I've enjoyed it. Very welcoming campus especially to new students. Many professors are great and care about the student. Campus wifi can be inconsistent. Surrounding area somewhat sketchy but campus overall is safe. There have been some sexual assaults lately but admin seems to be taking action.
Junior,4,"Towson University is a very good school. The school itself is very diverse, from the prestigious majors such as nursing, biology, engineering and many more. The school has so much to offer and is open to everyone and anyone from different backgrounds. GO TU!"
Sophomore,4,Just transferred here and am enjoying it a lot. The professors I have had so far are pretty good and I am enjoying my classes. The campus environment is safe for the most part. The classes that I am taking is a lot of fun because I am a dance major taking mostly dance classes. I am very much looking forward to my next two years that I have left here at Towson University.
Junior,4,What I like about Towson University is the help that is given. There are enough resources students can get for free such as articles. You can also practice with interview answers and the career center will help you build your resume for future jobs
Freshman,4,"I am happy that I choose Towson.  The Dance program is great.  My professors are relatable and the school is just the right size. There are many activities to get involved in --- fraternities and sororities, sports, clubs and other activities.  The students are cool as well."
Sophomore,2,"Professors overload with busy work, they send videos to do the teaching for them and act like they're too busy for questions during class."
Sophomore,2,"All these other reviews are very fake. Towson sucks, the staff sucks, the professors suck, the homecoming sucks, the housing sucks. Every time I have had an issue and tried to contact the department (Music,Math) of the subject they never look into both sides of the story, they immediately take the professors side even if the professor has a trend of complaints. I had an issue with a roommate and went to my RA for help and she told me ""Im not a good helper, I just know how to listen."" Professors are very strict, one mistake on an assignment has often lead me to a complete 0, mostly in science and math classes. Professors often have an attitude and provide no help when coming to them about problems. The only decent department is the communications department. I am looking to transfer."
Senior,2,Math classes are hardly ever offered and many teachers simply read from the book. Little support after 200 level classes. Administration does little to assist students further
Freshman,2,"Towson is a very large school.  Throughout my first year at Towson University,  I learned a large school was not for me.  I found that Professors have spread themselves very thin with the amount of students they are assigned to.  I have requested tutors and emailed my professors on several occasions throughout the year. Never once did I receive help and felt mostly that I was on my own."
College Sophomore,2,Many sororities and fraternities are very vain and the people involved are in for selfish interest of getting ahead socially or  professionally.
College Freshman,2,"i am not in greek but i dont really care, but i do see a huge presence of the students on campus, more than athletes."
College Freshman,2,"I was extremely surprised and disappointed by how little there is to do here, especially as a guy. If you like sports, you would be better off going to a high school game because there would probably be more fans attending that game than there are at any given towson sports event. The towers are isolating and west village is pointless if you do not live there. Really nothing special to talk about when it comes to towson. The education is moderate in the rankings and the students attitudes reflects that. As for fun and activities, there are very few. Pretty much nothing to do on campus, except for maybe thursdays, because the school knows that most students are commuters. School spirit is very low and an absolute ton of the students would rather have gone to school at the university of maryland instead of attending their reject school of towson. You will see the same, if not, more Maryland apparel on campus than you will for towson. If i could do it all over again, I would definitely not choose towson. Some people find it great, but it does not do it for me personally. Putting yourself out there barely makes a difference here."
College Freshman,2,"I was very surprised to see how little there is to do here. With almost 22,000 students, you would think that would be plenty of opportunities to make friends and plenty of things to do around campus, but you'd be entirely wrong. The towers are isolating and west village is pointless if you do not live there. The campus is a ghost town on the weekends, there are only activities on thursdays because they know everyone commutes and sports here are completely irrelevant. As a guy, if you do not rush, the only two options you have is to get a fake and go uptown, or drink in your own room, neither of which is really a good way to meet new people. Putting yourself out there at Towson barely makes a difference. Class sizes range from a lot to just a few, but students ive found barely show up anyways and are just looking to party at any given moment. What is really sad is that a large part of the students wish they could be attending the University of Maryland instead of Towson, as just walking around campus you would see more UMD apparel than Towson. The dining hall hours are complete whack and overall it just has not been the experience i would have hoped it would have been. I will be transferring next year without question."
College Freshman,2,i felt very isolated at towson
College Sophomore,2,"I have a preconceived notion that Greek life isn't all that great in general.  I hear about parties, hazing rituals and I've met some people on campus who are involved in Greek life who never go to class and are just in college to have fun.  I've also met people involved in Greek life that have become great friends who seem to take their schooling seriously. Greek life is kind of looked at as a fun thing for people who are very social and love having something to do every night."
College Freshman,2,Greek life isn't really what Towson is or should be known for.
College Junior,2,I do not live on campus but I walked through a dorm room and it was so small I knew there was no way I could live in one.
College Junior,2,We are a dry campus and the visiting hours are awful.
College Sophomore,2,"It seems like everyone lives in the same complexes, which can be nice for community but you don't have a ton of options. If you have a car, check out places in Baltimore."
College Sophomore,2,"Towson weekends are usually the same. A few people manage to find decent parties, most either drink in their dorms or go to the bars."
College Sophomore,2,"You'll get tired of The Den and Paws very, very quickly. Because they're gross, as are most other places on campus. Every once and a while they get something right, though. And take advantage of the Kosher Korner in Newell, it's usually the best food."
College Freshman,2,they need to make college more affordable
College Junior,2,"I think that the financial aid process should be a little easier, and the university should be more willing to help out its students."
College Sophomore,2,"Worst mistake of my life coming to TU and enrolling into the Poli Sci program, I've been miserable since I transferred here last year. It's been nothing more then a constant headache, and I literally dread everyday I have to come into campus. If you go to AACC and are in the Homeland Security program, steer clear of this place. I'll be transferring or dropping out immediately."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing has been impressive about the academics so far, in regards to the Poli Sci courses. I feel like I've wasted a year of my life coming here, and should have went with my gut instincts to go to the other schools I was accepted into."
College Sophomore,2,"Never seen any on or around campus. Heard of occasional parties they throw, but besides that they are inactive around campus."
College Sophomore,2,Cancelled all tailgating for the 2014 football season because a girl fell out of a truck bed. Stupidest thing I've ever heard of. Everyone subsequently stopped attending games. Fail....
College Freshman,2,"Lot of problems this year with ice over campus and doing an awful job of cleaning it up. Parking is terrible, and they tend to enforce policies on drug and alcohol use to a strict degree. Those are the only glaring issues."
College Sophomore,2,Transportation buses are a great idea but the implementation is poor.
College Sophomore,2,"I have had a lot of issues with the financial aid office, including them not putting through my financial aid from FAFSA. I did not receive any aid directly from the university, and it is not well advertised when I was a freshman."
College Freshman,2,Towson definitely needs some improvement with their food options. That is all I have to say.
College Freshman,2,"Iv found that the food here isn't as good as I would have liked it to be. We pay a lot of money to have meal plans and I think we should get our moneys worth. If I were to recommend places, I would say that the chick-fil-a is a must, Einsteins Bagels, Jamba Juice and the Den in Newell."
College Junior,2,"Not enough parties, but school is more important."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I tried following up on a sorority and never heard back, it's all about who they think will be popular I guess?"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The only way I found out about aid was getting into the school several times to talk to someone, and scholarships are just like playing the lottery!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I applied for the occupational therapy program...

- You have to write an essay, 3 references, and 30 hours of community services

- Once you are accepted there are multiple shots, testing, and classes (CPR for example)

-The acceptance rate is 30%"
College Freshman,2,"I feel like the fairly small loan I received barley covered just one class. For the amount of people living in my household and the income, I believe I should have received more."
College Freshman,2,I feel like I am constantly receiving emails about crimes on or around campus which scares me. I also sometimes do not feel safe walking to or from my car at night sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,"If there was an analogy to explain the process of financial aid, receiving it, and/or paying for classes it would be comparable to pulling out your own teeth. Unmedicated if i may add. 

Make sure you apply for aid ASAP. Keep the Bursar's office number in your phone on speed dial."
College Freshman,2,I do not see a lot of scholarships and most are offered to specific fields
College Senior,2,"There has been a significant increase in the crime that has happened since I have been attending. It seems that the school and general area police are taking the issue very seriously and trying to help students feel comfortable, but the area has gone downhill a bit."
College Sophomore,2,A tremendous amount of theft and robberies lately.
College Freshman,2,"Rain sucks, especially when it's pouring and you have to go to class. Snow days are nice though. Make sure you buy snow boots, rain boots, a rain jacket, hats and gloves!"
College Sophomore,2,Everyone drinks in the dorms. Its known that you can't just walk around campus with an open container but most common in the dorms.
College Junior,2,Strict on fake ID's and even stricter on house parties
College Freshman,2,The number of text alerts I've seen reporting sexual assault is just horrifying.
College Junior,2,"In my experience, members of Greek life are often rude to those who are non-members, and can be very disrespectful to guest speakers who present on-campus. Additionally, drinking is a major problem in this community."
College Freshman,2,My WiFi is constantly going in and out.. I don't see what we're paying for honestly.
College Freshman,2,"On campus, there is a high presence of Towson University Police Department during the day hours. While this is a great thing, the presence lowers after hours, when most of the crimes would/do occur. At Towson, if you choose to enroll in the e-mail and text message alerts, you see that you get a lot of security alerts about off-campus crimes, yet they are very close to campus. 

There was a night that I called TUPD because of an incident in my dormitory, and when on the phone, they asked for my name and room number. I gave it to them without a problem thinking they would not say anything to the perpetrator, but they brought them to our door and said to the perpetrator that we were the ones who called on them. Now, I am pretty sure they will not do anything to my roommate or myself, but there is always a little uncertainty about our next door neighbors. Also, in our dormitory, there is a severe lack of security cameras. There is a camera in the lobby, and a camera in the staircase, but nothing on the floors of our hallways. There has been an increase in ""activity"" on our floor, and we have gone to housing and residence life about it, but nothing is being done about it."
College Student,2,I have heard alot of bad things about the safety at Towson University. There have been many robberies.
College Freshman,2,"There are constant crime alerts from the TUPD, almost weekly, and they have only ever caught a suspect once. None have ever occured on campus, but keep in mind off campus is the street behind any buildings, our campus is a giant square in the middle of connecting roads, so the crimes/thefts happen five minutes away. We have the blue lights, but its still nerve wracking to walk around in the dark without a lot of other people"
College Freshman,2,"Towson is in the middle of nowhere, other than the towson mall and Baltimore a few minutes away. Theres nothing to do on campus, and the only off campus places to go are the bars"
College Freshman,2,"The yearly permits are very expensive, and the only place freshman can even park is at the parking garage all the way on the other side of campus. It is very inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,The food here is not very good
College Sophomore,2,"Police are scarce, and the health center is a disaster. "
College Sophomore,2,Food was better last semester. And do not stay open late. 
College Sophomore,2,Not close if you do not have a car. But the food is good.
College Freshman,2,I don't think we have any traditions.  The gym is small.  We suck.
College Freshman,2,"I'm sort of biased because Towson was not my first choice school.  They simply gave me a lot of money, but frankly I just feel like there's nothing special here.  It's just simple."
College Freshman,2,"To be honest, I feel like I receive a crime alert every other day on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of parking on campus is very high.  Neighboring colleges do not even charge students for parking.  Also, the parking enforcement is too strict.  They will not only give a citation, but tow a car if it is not supposed to be parked there.  I do not have first-hand experience with this issue; however, many of my classmates do."
College Freshman,2,Parking sucks.  Tickets are given very frequently and this is usually the worst thing about our school
College Freshman,2,"Things like food varies entirely, the menus are made up of foods that sound good and well put together on a menu but when presented with the actual meal you might catch yourself staring at the meal wondering what it actually is. After a few bites deep you probably will lose your appetite and give up on it because it just tastes like garbage after awhile.  As for the dining halls the employees there all lack manners, and are God awful at giving a customer attention and lack care towards their job moving at the pace of a snail.  Most of the time you can't even understand what they're saying by the way they talk to you or co-worker."
College Freshman,2,They have all your basic majors but the way they teach is ridiculous and barely offer any help or assistance you are basically on your own entirely.
College Freshman,2,"Okay parking here is a huge problem. Yes, parking garages are located close to classes and dorm rooms however, grages often get filled up quickly. I don't drive but I know for comuters and those who do drive, they paid $300 for a permit but have to park all the way at SECU arena which can be a 20-30 minute walk depending on where on campus you are going."
Senior,1,Coming to this school was such a big mistake. I hated all 3 years of going to Towson as a transfer. Parking is insanley expensive when there is BARELY any parking available. Science department sucks. Professors do not respond to emails for example professor Behensky who teaches biology and A&P.  You're advisors are of no help at all at this school they literally are not helpful at ALL. I really wanted to go to their Docotorate in Occupational Therapy school program but I cant stand another 3 years at this place. I feel uncomfortable being a student here.
Alum,1,Students reak of drugs and don't come to class or do work. They are aggressive towards staff in class. These students run the school and tell the dean what to do!
Freshman,1,"this school is a joke,  thereâ€™s construction everywhere you turn on campus, on weekends the campus is dead because everyone go homes. also on weekends the dining  halls are the only places open to eat and theyâ€™re only open from 11 to 6, so if youâ€™re an early riser, have fun starving. work hard and go to a real university, donâ€™t waste four years of your life here"
Sophomore,1,"Coming to Towson University was by far the biggest regret of my life. Many people here commute, or begin college already knowing many people from high school and are not friendly or open to meeting new people. The only people who seem to enjoy it here are those in sororities or fraternities, but for those who are don't get in or choose not to join, are left with no social life. Not only is this school isolating and miserable socially, I have had countless awful professors and advisors over the years. I feel like in my major (Business), good professors are few and far between (and my fellow students agree with me)."
Senior,1,"I am having the absolute worst experience with Towson University. I transferred in after two and a half years at a different University and was expecting to only need another year and a half. After accepting my admission placement, Towson decided to deny credits for courses they had previously told me would transfer in. I have now added two extra years to completing my degree.
 if you have any disabilities requiring accommodation, good luck trying to get Towson to cooperate. In order to get anything accomplished at this university I have found myself sitting in front of the president's office in order to get attention because going through the proper channels gets you running in circles."
Junior,1,"Not for adults! Orientation was about drinking/sex, but left out important enrollment instructions. Science building is outdated! Top floor has broken heat/ always  extremely hot. Ant infestation in bathroom on 2nd floor; NEVER enough supplies in chemistry labs. Only 8 scales to share between 2 classes (80 students), had to wait in long lines to use things, then the lab teacher threatens you with 0 grade if not finished on time. Old building, rushed lab classes, teachers don't care. Had a teacher threaten to walk out cause 1 student's cell phone went off, then he punished entire class for it. I'm 30 years old and don't want to be treated like I'm 10! Been there, done that 20 years ago. Now at UMBC and its more professional, less ""party school""!"
College Senior,1,Some professors favor students who are in Greek life over those who are not. People in Greek life think it is the most important thing ever but it is not.
College Sophomore,1,There's a decent amount of drinking
College Freshman,1,Football is the schools biggest sport and it barely gains any attention nor fans to go see the games. Basketball is comically overlooked despite being somewhat of a good team. Really a shame because Unitas stadium and SECU arena are quite beautiful places.
College Junior,1,There aren't many scholarship options.
College Sophomore,1,"Awful, intend on transferring as soon as this semester is over."
College Sophomore,1,"I've had only one good professor in the past year, and that's pretty much been it. I have yet to meet one that doesn't ramble about off topic subjects for the duration of entire lectures. I had MUCH better professors at my community college...."
College Sophomore,1,"For me personally, it's been awful. Nothing has been remotely impressive about this school, as I now see coming here for the sole reason of saving myself money was one of the dumbest decisions I've ever made. If you enjoy dance, film, communications, etc then I suggest you come here. If you like subjects related to Homeland Security, National Security, Intelligence, Criminal Justice, etc then stay far away from this place. I'd rather drop out then continue my studies here."
College Freshman,1,"The whole reason i wasn't able to go there this semester. I was told that i would have 4-5K in grant aid fall semester 2014 then i get there and within the 1st month of attendance they took away some of my grants causing my family to have to pay 8 THOUSAND DOLLARS for that semester instead of our 4-5K and because of that we couldn't afford spring semester due to the FAFSA mixup, that is my only issue with them. I am still in their system and have applied for re-enrollment for 2015 Fall semester but I shouldn't even have to go through this. However since my mom retired our FAFSA this year is solely based on my dad and she made more than him so I should receive more aid mixed with all of the scholarships i am applying for. But as far as I am concerned i had a terrible experience there with Financial aid department. That is my only real complaint about the school, but I have experience with their system now and plan to make sure that never repeats itself, now I might be a rare incident but that shouldn't even happen to any student to begin with."
College Sophomore,1,They sell more permits than there are spots. They continue building residence halls then don't build additional parking garages.
College Sophomore,1,Fafsa does not care for me. They only gave me loans. I hate Fafsa soo much. If your parents are not dead then you not getting any money
College Sophomore,1,The weather in Maryland sucks no matter what. One day it will snow the next its sunny. Its unpredictable and you never know what youre going to get.
College Freshman,1,The professors are often difficult and don't seem to care about teaching. The workload is ridiculously easy and I often feel like I'm taking classes I had in middle school. I'm in the Honors college and unfortunately those classes don't provide much of a challenge either.
College Freshman,1,The police are horrible. They harass you and make you feel guilty when you haven't done anything. They also always report robberies and don't seem to do anything about it.
College Freshman,1,Move in day was scorching hot and continued that way all until October when it dropped to freezing levels in which they still stand. Your typical upper east coast weather.
College Junior,1,Parking is what makes people late to class. It is very expensive and they are always looking to give out expensive citations. There is nowhere free to park on campus and parking permit prices are ridiculous.
College Junior,1,Parking permits are expensive. They are always looking to give expensive parking citations. Parking is hard to find. There is public transportation but traffic is usually terrible.
College Junior,1,"Unfortunately, I did not receive much financial aid at all despite the fact that my father lost his job and my mom worked in the deli department of shoppers food warehouse. The scholarships are very redundant and there is nothing suited for art majors like myself."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life at Towson isn't that big. One of the reasons might be that Towson is a small school. Also, it's pretty expensive to join a sorority or fraternity. If you want to join a sorority or fraternity, I suggest you find a bigger school."
College Junior,1,"Parking can be pretty terrible. Even if you have a parking permit you can still struggle to find a parking spot. They do offer free parking on the weekend but spaces tend to fill up fast. If you try to ""get around"" the parking system, it won't work; a tow truck comes through frequently."
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman commuter, you get stuck with an ""Overflow"" parking pass. This means that you can only park in a few VERY inconvenient spots. Decent sized campus means a lot of walking freshman year, and a lot of lateness. Bus system is under-advertised, confusing, slow, and usually unreliable."
College Freshman,1,"They wouldn't give me any financial aid because my parents ""make too much money"" but we make average incomes so yeah financial aid would be helpful to us but we are denied anything,"
College Senior,1,"Parking is awful in each area around campus. If you don't arrive right when classes are letting out to follow students to their cars, then it can take around 20 minutes to drive around and find an empty spot. It is frustrating to experience this when you have to pay well over $300 for a commuter parking pass for the year. In addition, you are only allowed to park in specific areas according to your pass even if there are plenty of open spaces in other designations. The parking issue may cause you to be late to class."
College Freshman,1,It's all about the frats. Not that many clubs here
College Sophomore,1,Unless you can get into a bar your nights can be boring. Apartment/House parties are over-crowded and run out of alcohol quickly.
College Sophomore,1,The campus is supposed to be SMOKE-FREE yet students and sometimes faculty walk on campus smoking at all times of the day with no care in the world.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus is smoke-free with very minimal designated smoking areas. The alcohol policies in the dorms are very strict. Even if you are just playing music, they will automatically assume you are drinking. Red cups and shot glasses are considered paraphernalia, and you can be fined for just having them in the dorm- even if you have no alcohol."
College Sophomore,1,i actually do not enjoy my biology program at my school. Its not enough hands on assignments. Its always book work.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible. Towson's only flaw. Parking passes are expense and must be renewed yearly. Even if you have a pass, it is hard to find parking. Free parking for the general public starts at crazy inconvenient times so when friends visit for a weekend, it becomes a hassle."
College Sophomore,1,"Dowell Health Center overcharges for services that are usually free.  It is extremely inconvenient to make an appointment online because you have to fill out all your full medical history before they allow you to continue. However, if you do eventually make it to the waiting room, prepare for attitudes from the ladies at the desk and to be waiting a while."
College Junior,1,Greek life sucks. It's filled with hazing and bullies.
College Junior,1,parking close to the classes fulls very early. Any classes after 9 and you will be walking
College Senior,1,"Towson's campus has horrible parking. The permits are very expensive and do not guarantee you a spot. Parking garages are a plenty, but spots fill up quick. Parking spaces are frequently lost to construction sites or new buildings, as well."
College Senior,1,Hard to Park â€“ Towson University does not have enough parking space for all of the commuters. It is really hard to park if I don't go to school for the 8:00 am class.
College Senior,1,"Need to Let up on Parking â€“ Parking here is very difficult and there isn't anywhere off campus where you can park and still be remotely near the campus.  The parking enforcers (they aren't even cops) are complete jerks, and do not issue warnings.  They will issue tickets that shouldn't even be issued, and then you have to fight with them about it.  Overall something needs to be done about this problem."

Freshman,5,Canvas is the main site used for online learning. Professors teaching online classes are very engaged and make it easy to understand what is expected of their students.
Freshman,5,All of the professors are really passionate about their fields! Students are very accepting and kind. Plus the campus is beautiful!
Alum,5,"I didn't take any classes online, but I am sure they would be satisfactory as the professors are very dedicated."
Alum,5,Great place that gives you a very well rounded education. Academics and social scene strike a good balance.
Sophomore,5,"The school has been amazing overall! Great academic experience especially in Carrol School of Management. Even during the pandemic, BC has done an excellent job!"
Graduate Student,5,"Great flexible programs, amazing and helpful professionals.  I would recommend it to recent high school graduates and everyone seeking graduates program."
Graduate Student,5,"I’m enrolled in the MHA online program. It has been such an amazing experience, I have come across excellent professors, and they are very helpful."
Freshman,5,"Great city, beautiful campus and outstanding faculty. Despite challenges of spring 2020 school acted fast, refunded our accounts for dorms and dining quickly and supported our transition to remote learning."
Freshman,5,Covid19 Experience was a smooth as expected. Faculty worked hard to make transition seem less- although much prefer face to face experience.
Sophomore,5,BC is a beautiful campus! And to me the biggest change I have seen is the gymnasium for all the students and facilities! Definetly the program fo study has changed a little bit  but everything  is great as always!
Sophomore,5,"As much as it was easier online to take classes, it was harder to keep the same focus as being in class."
Sophomore,5,I thought that most of my teachers did a good job with online classes. They were attentive to emails and attempted to make classes feel more personal. They were also more flexible with assignments understanding the hardship that Covid-19 has had on people. I would say that they handled it very well and I was able to learn just as efficiently as on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed the new plex gymnasium that they built. It has 4 floors with a pool, 2 basketball courts, a tennis court, and an indoor track not to mention all the exercise equipment. The campus life was very active with a lot of programs and also the food was pretty good. They do their best to keep a lot of fresh new options to eat."
Freshman,5,Boston College is a place where secondary education is continued in every portion of student life. The campus is lively and extracurriculars are fulfilling.
Senior,5,I love Boston College. I feel like I have made friends with similar values and work ethics as me but that I have also been introduced to new ways of thinking and cultures. I have always felt academically challenged but also supported.
Sophomore,5,"The undergrad is great at Boston College along with the social life. However, changes could be made in the food and diversity"
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the location especially. The campus encompasses a fitting size and also has a great scenery in general. The location is right outside of Boston which is a hot spot for just about anything!
Niche User,5,Awesome experience. Challenging classes. Great facilities.  The retreats and Clubs are fun too.  Lots of opportunities for service.  Appa etc
Alum,5,"Boston college has great professors and provides a great education to their students. I personally loved the vast number of student groups offered on campus, and was always in awe of the beautiful architecture on campus."
Alum,5,"The campus is beautiful! Located close to, but not too close to, the heart of Boston. Easy to get around. Great sense of pride and good sports teams."
Junior,5,"Great school spirit! Not great on diversity, but an inclusive environment with great alumni connections. Teachers who care about you and lifetime friends!"
Alum,5,"Amazing liberal arts school 20 minutes from Boston, with a gorgeous campus and community culture. The staff, students, and alumni at BC are all incredible people always looking to help and better others. The mission of the school to create ""men and women for others"" rings true in all senses. The nightlife is extremely fun with off-campus houses and local bars, and the D1 football team rallies students, families, and alumni alike for 6 home games a season for amazing tailgating. The hockey team is always a strong contender and a fun time to watch, and the intramural and club sports options are expansive and participated in widely. The alumni network since graduation has been transformative in my job search and career growth, and I have striven to pay it forward to other recent grads as well."
Alum,5,Boston College is an excellent return on investment. It is a pristine university and offers excellent professors and resources.
Niche User,5,"Boston College, located just outside downtown Boston, was founded by the Society of Jesus and has maintained its Roman Catholic Jesuit religious affiliation. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies it as a university with high research activity. BC has nine schools, which include such highly ranked graduate programs as the Lynch School of Education, Boston College Law School and Carroll School of Management. The school competes in nearly 30 NCAA Division I varsity sports in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and the BC Eagles have one of the highest graduation rates for student athletes in the country. Students can join more than 200 clubs and organizations, but there is no Greek system on campus. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, but the majority choose to do so. More than 1,000 students participate in study abroad each year."
Freshman,5,"Boston College has a community that I am yet to find anywhere else! People are kind all over campus and the community revolves so much around service to others. With the many clubs on campus, one can see that it is very easy to get involved with the school and the local community. I have never seen a school with so many people as involved as they are here at BC"
Sophomore,5,"Boston College has an extensive number of resources, a beautiful campus, and enthusiastic professors that genuinely care about their courses and students. Everyone wants to see you succeed, and the school is constantly working towards bettering its academics, diversity, and environmental sustainability."
Junior,5,"I loved the people, the classes, the professors, and the campus at Boston College. The location near Boston is a great plus as well."
Junior,5,"This is a great school with a beautiful campus.  The academics are challenging and engaging; the curriculum is well established.  As a humanities student, I enjoy the classic liberal arts approach to learning.  My professors have been wonderful people who are passionate about what they teach and advisors are helpful in suggestions about classes, majors/minors, etc."
Junior,5,"I love Boston College and could not say enough great things about the university. I never wanted to go to school in Boston but last minute I changed my mind and decided to give BC a chance. Two years later, I cannot see myself anywhere else. I have met my best friends, been given so many educational and career related opportunities, and become the strong and independent student that I am today. I feel so prepared to go out into the real working world with all of the connections I've made and values I've learned."
Junior,5,"Its the absolute best. Everyone is awesome and all the people who go there just want to help you. The alumni network is absurd, with opportunities for legitimately all graduates. The social life is a lot of fun. BC has the perfect balance between athletics, academics and social life."
Alum,5,"Very good classes, people, and resources. It doesn't have greek life, which forces students to find their place through friends, hobbies, and academics. I enjoyed my experience there, and would highly recommend this school.

The proximity to the city is great for internships and volunteer opportunities outside the school as well. I would say the only downside is that there is a lack of diversity on campus. There are a wealth of experiences and backgrounds, but you have to dig a little to ensure your exposure. Easy for people to keep to their circles if they don't push themselves."
Niche User,5,"Campus is beautiful, well maintained, and academic buildings are close together making it easy to get from class to class. Kids are friendly.   Neighborhood surrounding campus is gorgeous and safe."
Sophomore,5,"Great faculties/students.
Easy access to town,
Great library and school spirits.
Sports teams are awsome.
Nice diversity of students and facilities.
Dining food is excellent."
Sophomore,5,Very nice liberal arts based curriculum that prepares students to be leaders. Not as Catholic as it may seem; more historically than it is nowadays.
Alum,5,Boston College had a wonderful mental health counseling department! Both students and faculty are extremely supportive and genuinely want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,"Boston College is pretty generous with financial aid. It's set in an affluent, safe suburb of Boston. Boston is a half hour train ride from here. BC has a lot of school spirit which makes any sports game really fun to go to, especially football and hockey. The student body isn't as stuck up as you'd think for being a private New England school, but it could be more diverse. The housing process could be improved, but overall it's worth it."
Sophomore,5,"Great student body and professors that really seem to care about you (for the most part). Wonderful campus, food is pretty good and really nice to be near Boston (but not TOO near!)  Great school spirit & athletics, lots of clubs and activities to participate in and quite a diverse course selection between the 4 schools. Career support is excellent and new athletic center opening soon is a big plus. Also new STEM/engineering center coming soon!"
Sophomore,5,"Boston College is a tremendous institution. Whether it be the high quality  professors, food, campus, or athletics, BC is the place to be for driven, inquisitive students. Additionally, the surrounding area, Boston, is a fabulous college town, as there are endless things to do."
Freshman,5,All of the Professors are very hands on and are there to see each and every student excel. They are not there for a pay check but there because they believe in the students that they work alongside with.
Freshman,5,"LOVE my professors, people I've met, and school spirit on campus! Although BC is not perfect, I couldn't have asked for a better first year at a better school in a better city!"
Alum,5,"The ultimate college experience here.  You can be involved in sports, ministry and have a social life in addition to getting a world-class education.  Very forward-thinking professors who promote personal growth and change in its students.  The student housing situation isn't ideal, but the benefits of the rest of campus, the academics and the very real connections with others you make here make it worth it."
Alum,5,I loved campus and how challenging the classes were in the business school. There are always things happening through campus activities and in the city of Boston.
Alum,5,"LOVED IT! Math department is rigorous. Biology department is amazing. Pre-med track is challenging. Gym could of been better, but they made a new gym."
Niche User,5,"I’m a parent of a BC freshman from the Midwest and we could not be more pleased with our daughter’s first year experience at BC.  If you are the parent of a HS student that has been accepted to BC, you should seriously consider the Heights! Go Eagles ever to excell!"
Freshman,5,"I am only in my second semester here, but I know that I would not want to be at any other school. The school is just big enough tot have countless opportunities, but not so big that you feel swallowed. The professors want to see you succeed and are extremely kind. The students are academically driven without being cold. My ONLY complaint about the school would be the forced triple living situation, but that's only something you have to deal with for two semesters and you are compensated well for the inconvenience."
Sophomore,5,Boston College is a great school to get involved in your community and beyond. The school's academics are extremely high and students are well prepared for the career search after college.
Senior,5,"very good on all fronts, more should apply for more perspectives, really only thing missing from the school"
Alum,5,"Loved Boston College! I truly enjoyed my time here and met a lot of lifelong friends and colleagues. I really could not imagine going somewhere else. From the nightlife to the academics to the food and just social life, Boston College had everything I needed."
Niche User,5,"My daughter is a freshman at BC and loves it but for $70K+ per year I would expect dorms to hav AC and be nicer! She text me a photo of the thermostat in Sept. and it was 106 degrees in her room.  Other than that, fantastic school!"
Senior,5,"Boston College is a great school for students who are looking for a competitive university with a smaller school feeling. Students are open, from all over the world, and are go-getters."
Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved my time at BC so far. The community I have found has been so encouraging. The professors care about you and your success and that was huge for me as well. I would change the lack of diversity, I grew up in a diverse community in a Chicago suburb and moving to chestnut hill was a big shock."
Sophomore,5,"Great academics and athletics as expected.  The absence of greek life really isnt an issue as thee is always plenty going on in the mods, off campus, and at the bars.  I love it here."
Niche User,5,"Boston College has an amazing campus and such a welcoming student body that makes it my top school to apply to and proves that going to college can be a pleasant experience. Should I go there I will be able to learn at a top school and be able to appreciate not only the school itself with the gorgeous architecture and the friendly students, but the accessible staff that has great open office hours and are always happy to answer any question a student has."
Sophomore,5,I am going to be a sophomore and I love it at BC. Great people and awesome academics. Would recommend at least a visit.
Alum,5,"As a recent grad, there were definitely a lot of things I wanted to see changed during my four years, but looking back I would definitely do it all again.  I don’t think the issues I saw were unique to BC but rather complaints that pretty much all college students at any university would complain about such as managing a work-life balance and administrative policies that keep the university’s long term goals rather than a student’s short term goals in mind.  I don’t think I could have asked for better  academic quality, personal growth, or career placement.  Although biased as a recent grad, I think BC did a great job in helping me to think more clearly while providing me the skills for my career."
Sophomore,5,Boston College is one of the best decisions I could have made for college. It has allowed me to grow so much as a person and to learn new things I could not have learned anywhere else. I have met some of the best people and continue to meet great people everyday. Boston College really cares for their students and ensures they are getting the best education.
Alum,5,"Boston College provided me with a home and gave me the confidence to move toward reaching my goals for the future. My professors, classmates, and friends fostered an environment that allowed me to grow into the best version of myself: the courses challenged me intellectually and my support system will follow me for a lifetime."
Niche User,5,"Visited for three days and loved it. Due to my three day experience, I decided to commit to BC. Education seems rigorous and diversity is ok from what I saw. Also, the objective behind how they educate students was quite compelling."
Junior,5,Boston College  is so much better than I could have imagined. The course load is rigorous but the access to professors is amazing. Very caring faculty.  The sports scene for someone who does not drink is still incredibly fun and exciting.
Freshman,5,I love the alumni network that I know BC has; it makes the thought of applying for jobs seem a little less stressful. I think it also speaks to the really strong sense of community and family felt here on the BC campus and the how that feeling isn't lost when you graduate. One thing I would like to see improve is the University's responses to social issues on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Some classes I had were asynchronous, meaning that they did not occur at a particular time. I appreciated this, as it allowed me to set my own schedule on certain days. 

A lot of the material is self-taught, and that may be a pro / con depending on your learning style. For me, it was a major pro, as I love to learn by myself within the comfort of my own home. But if that is a problem for you, it might be wise to defer / take a gap semester."
Sophomore,4,"It's pretty good. The professors are warm and friendly. Most of them are communicative and are willing to work with you if you are having problems in a respective subject. 

As a rather introverted person, I like the atmosphere at BC. It's pretty serene, and the lack of Greek Life means that there are plenty of other ways to make friends other than partying. The housing is comfortable and spacious, and everyone is eager to meet each other within the first week of school.

I wish Boston College was a bit better when it came to Diversity. As a minority student, I felt slightly uncomfortable during my first month on campus, but this uneasiness slowly subsided as time passed by. I also do not like the food. 

In general, it's a warm and wholesome community, and I could not be happier to be here."
Junior,4,Classes switched to online because of Covid. Each professor handled the situation differently with some synchronous classes on Zoom and some prerecorded lectures. Most professors were very understanding of the challenges the transition and subsequent time brought.
Junior,4,The school has mostly great professors. The administration needs to listen to students' needs and wants.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience was not as terrible as I thought it would be. My professors made even more time to ensure that I was getting the extra support I need during the time period in which students had to return home because of the COVID-19 outbreak. I was able to get my work done in a timely manner and I ended the year with higher grades than my first semester. So overall, it was a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Boston College was an unforgettable experience. It was honestly the most challenging year of my life because I was living an entirely different lifestyle the required a certain level of independence that was fairly new to me. I did struggle to adjust to this new lifestyle, but I had unconditional support from my peers and Boston College faculty members. I also joined an African Dance Team that welcomed me with open arms and made this transition go more smoothly. This team was the safe haven I needed whenever I felt overwhelmed with school work and exams. My teammates continued to encourage me whenever I felt like I wasn't built for this lifestyle. Although I ended my first semester with a low GPA, I was able to pick myself back up and earn a higher GPA during my second semester. Overall, I am more than satisfied with my choice to attend Boston College because it was an experience that strengthened me as an individual."
Sophomore,4,Online learning experience still needs improvement. They are utilizing more devices to enhance the experience.
Freshman,4,I have minimal issues connecting to zoom meetings.  The few issues I encountered were quickly resolved.
Freshman,4,"I have so far enjoyed my experience at Boston College.  Despite the current situation, BC is doing everything they can to try to keep things organized and set for opening this year."
Junior,4,Being on-campus is superior. Learning online has only made me appreciate BC more for its stellar academic atmosphere and great teachers.
Junior,4,"I love BC. However, I really didn't enjoy my time there until sophomore year. It is a university that has many things to work on, including diversity."
Senior,4,"Some of my classes were asynchronous and others were synchronous. Those that met up weekly via Zoom felt lacking, and I much preferred listening to pre-recorded lectures at my own pace. I believe the summer classes now are all asynchronous."
Senior,4,"The greatest aspects of BC that set it apart from other schools are its Jesuit values and their theology & philosophy departments. The Jesuit values of BC simply refer to an educational philosophy-- the fact that education can empower students to create change in the world (i.e. through service). As a liberal arts college, BC's theology & philosophy departments are very strong and all students must take a minimum of one year courses in both subjects in order to graduate. These areas of focus seek to shape the student's mind to think, to question, and to ponder. This is an ability that goes beyond educational material or curriculum requirements of a college. Many students end up adding a minor or major in one of these areas.  My favorite classes and professors were from both departments even though I am a nursing major."
Junior,4,"Some classes continued to be live, but many of the classes were actually pre-recorded and professors had extensive office hours that you could use to ask questions. Overall good adaptation to online learning."
Junior,4,"It's a great school, academics are not too rigorous but still challenging. Party scene lacks a little bit and it is not ""in"" the city of Boston, but around 20 mins away. I've had amazing experiences, I've learned a lot and have had an incredible time there."
Alum,4,"I liked the people I met in my courses, clubs, and housing options. The campus is full of energy and opportunities."
Senior,4,"I overall loved Boston College. I am very appreciative of the financial aid package they have given me. However, I still had to take out a significant amount in loans. The campus is absolutely beautiful which makes it easier to get through the difficult academics. I wish the science department was more supportive of their students in wanting them to succeed. It can be a very discouraging environment. However, I have gained so many opportunities here to grow my skills for the workforce in research and community service. I feel that I am leaving here a passionate and holistically developed person."
Senior,4,"I loved Boston College mainly because I found my best friends. Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot and had some great professors along the way. However, the small family I found at BC made my four years here truly amazing."
Freshman,4,"Being a student at BC for the past few months has allowed me to see that everyone on campus truly cares about your future and they want you to do the best you can. My professors are amazing and I love all of my classes. They are interesting and all of the work is directly related to what we are learning. The academics are unlike anything I have ever learned in high school, and everything I do here is going to be helpful to me in my future as a nurse. I know that I will be prepared to be of great help in hospitals when I start my clinicals and this is because I am enrolled in classes even as a freshman that show me what it is going to be like when I am in an actual hospital setting."
Niche User,4,"It's amazing guys. Just absolutely amazing. The professors are legitimately the best in the world, the people are very nice, the food it great.

I rate it very highly all in all.

So-- you might be wondering, why is the rating only 4 stars instead of 5? Two words: Sports teams. They're actually the worst.

Football, Basketball, even soccer, none of them are very good at all. If you want a great time or education, this is the place for you. If you want to play some ball or have fun cheering on the school's teams, then stay very far away from this place."
Niche User,4,"Seems lit. I really enjoyed to atmosphere when I toured there, and everyone was nice. The tour guide was very cool and fun. All the buildings are very pretty and old which I enjoyed. Although it is technically located outside of Boston, there is still a lot to do around it."
Freshman,4,Its a great university environment here. The thing I like to see changed is variety of food they offer. Students often complain about food being too expensive and or not enough options esp for   vegetarians.
Senior,4,"This is very good college .Good academics, food and dedicated teachers. It is beautiful campus. Fellow students are very helpful. Good public transportation into Boston down town. Tuition is very expensive but it is all worth after graduation. Connection to good internships."
Freshman,4,Boston College has a beautiful campus and its dedication to education is just as impressive. Most of the students here are very hardworking and driven.
Sophomore,4,I like how dedicated the professors are to their students and how qualified each professor is. I wish that there were more classes to choose from and that the university core was not as extensive.
Sophomore,4,"You can see that it is a Catholic institution by its beautiful architecture. However, while religion is an important part of this college's identity, so is religious freedom. They respect whatever belief that you have as long as it is not hurting other students. 

If you are looking for a party school with Greek culture, Boston College is lacking. There are no sororities or fraternities. There are still parties and fun to be had, but a lot of students carry that ""work hard play hard"" mentality here. 

The academics is rigorous and it makes you start thinking seriously about time management if you want it to mesh well with student jobs and extracurriculars. The compact size of the campus is beneficial in this way because you know exactly where everything is. 

From experience, the Russian and Business department of the school are excellent in that the professor that I have had have a deep understanding of material and teach it well."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Boston College is fairly good, except  that administration clearly has trouble addressing controversial issues on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Boston College has given me the resources to become my own person and achieve any goal I set. With the Jesuit values seen within every class- I am given a space to reflect and discern my future. The school environment feels constricting at times with the ""BC look-away"" and the ""BC bubble"" but during my sophomore  year I have been able to find my people and find my home within the school."
Sophomore,4,"Boston College is a great university, but every school comes with its issues. Housing is frustrating, and freshmen face the brunt of it. The food is actually alright, but the meal plan and prices are disappointing.  But the academics and people are superb, and I truly feel lucky to receive my education there and grow as a person. The school, being Jesuit, places an emphasis on character and well-being, and myself being atheist felt no pressure about religion, and also joined Freshman League my first year -- it's a terrific school."
Freshman,4,"Boston College is a beautiful school like some outstanding professors who truly and honestly care for their students. There are several opportunities and resources dedicated to help each student find additional support - academically, emotionally, and mentally. There are plenty of clubs and student organizations available for a wide range of students, so there is something for everyone."
Niche User,4,"Boston College is an amazing school. Although I wish the amount of diversity was higher, the opportunities made available to me, and the environment I was in made the experience worthwhile."
Freshman,4,"I’ve enjoyed my time so far at Boston College. I appreciate how dedicated it is to service and being men and women for others. However, like any other predominantly white institution, there is a history of racist events on campus."
Junior,4,"I am a Junior at Boston College in the Carroll School of Management and I have nothing but great things to speak about my experience. At first, being from New Jersey, I was quite homesick but found there were many friendly people willing to become friends with me and help to show me the ropes at BC. Being in the business school, I have really seen how being at a great institution can open up a lot of doors in regards to post-collegiate opportunity. Keeping up with school work and involved on campus has helped me and many of my peers land internships at top companies across various industries."
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of great things that BC has to offer. As a STEM major I was worried about the availability of research. However, professors are accommodating and I was easily able to get a position in a lab. The academics are outstanding, professors love to connect their subjects to other classes you are in. Almost all of the professors I've had are accommodating, available to help, and excited to talk to you about their classes. There is a wide array of student organizations to get involved in and the students are incredibly passionate. I love BC's values about being women and men for others, providing an inclusive education, and being able to use our skills to help those around us. A few things BC could improve upon: diversity and acceptance (there have been 2 major problems in the time I've been here), housing (the process is stressful),  administration (there are a lot of politics & administrators are much less accessible than professors)."
Freshman,4,"I found a very welcoming and tight knit community here at Boston College. The campus is beautiful to walk around no matter the time of day or year, and while the school is located near Boston (which is greatly accessible), it has a nice sense of privacy. The education you receive here is excellent as most professors are enthusiastic and understanding of everyone's different situations."
Senior,4,While I visited Boston College I feel in love with the campus. The buildings are very unique with a gothic architecture.
Sophomore,4,"Boston College’s Professors make it a wonderful institution. My experience with the chemistry and mathematics department has been especially rewarding. Professors are interesting, professional, and passionate. Aside from academics, the plethora of clubs and activities offered is wonderful. Athletics are also a fun way to spend time and the school spirit is immense. The school is truly a community and everyone seems to enjoy interacting and getting to know one another. I have met the most interesting and intelligent people at BC, and I am glad I chose to come here. Although the student population not as diverse as other schools, there is a niche for everyone regardless of their socioeconomic, religious, ethnic, or cultural identity."
Alum,4,Boston College is an excellent mid-size college. It is not too big and not too small. The liberal arts education and core curriculum are top notch. The alumni network could use some improvement.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the daytime atmosphere. The academics and social surroundings are challenging ; however, they have enriched my mind in accepting social situations and absorbed knowledge that I could have only dreamed of."
Sophomore,4,Boston College has opened me up to many new opportunities. Living on campus is far different from living at home in ways that are positive and negative. I am excited to continue my educational BC as it is challenging but rewarding.
Alum,4,"Some profs are better than others. Some can be very bland, while others are quite interesting. The prevet scene isn't very good. There isn't much support. You can take the T to Boston which is nice though sometimes it does feel a bit isolated as there isn't too much to do in a ten minute walking distance. I liked Newton campus but again, it is pretty isolated. The Stuart Dining hall is probably one of the best places for food though."
Sophomore,4,"I love Boston College because of the dedication of the professors and faculty to the success of students. As a first generation, low-income college student, professors and other faculty members that openly and outwardly express their willingness to help students creates an environment that I feel heard and seen in. The classes are intellectually challenging and some are even socially challenging as group work, team work, collaboration, and community service may be involved. Unfortunately, Boston College has failed to create an atmosphere in which students that do not fit into the 'white' or 'middle class' categories are able to feel comfortable in."
Junior,4,"Very good school, academics and people are very nice.  Administration doesn't listen to students very much and it is expensive."
Senior,4,"The student body is overwhelmingly white, Catholic, and middle class. As a person of color it can be a little weird being surrounded by white kids, but that doesn't mean there aren't people of color on campus--there definitely are, but it  takes more effort to find them. Overall, the experience is very much whatyou make it to be; I personally didn't enjoy BC until my junior year."
Sophomore,4,"During the college application process, I was not expecting to attend Boston College. The university was always in my pool of options, but I had my eyes set on another school. After being rejected from that school, I decided to attend BC. After completing one year at BC, I can say it was everything and more that I hoped college would be. Boston College's beautiful campus, wonderful array of courses, outstanding professors, and motivated students create a supportive environment and provides a superb education."
Sophomore,4,I wholeheartedly love this school. There are opportunities everywhere and professors who are looking to help and connect with students. I do wish the administration would listen to the student body more and the financial aid office can be quite stingy.
Alum,4,The students are very driven and the teachers are dedicated to seeing you succeed. Although the school is a bit lacking in it's diversity in terms of students and some courses (specifically in those focused on diversity) there is never a shortage of clubs and activities to join to find more people like yourself. The campus is breath taking (both in the view and the million dollar staircase). It is in a great location--accessible to Boston but not in the middle of it where transportation becomes a major issue.
Sophomore,4,"Boston College is the perfect amalgamation of everything a student would look for in a college. The academics are amazing with such intelligent and caring professors that genuinely want to help the students. Despite there not being greek life, the social life is still very lively with hundreds of clubs to join to foster that sense of community and mentorship."
Junior,4,"After transferring to Boston College, I felt very afraid. But everyone was so welcoming. Filled with international students who are friendly and lots of northern kids who know their way around Boston and NY, I felt right at home. Would love to see the housing process change and more students live off campus."
Freshman,4,"Boston College is a great university with outstanding resources; however, as a college freshman, the transition to college was not the easiest. My experience has only gotten better as time goes on, so I hope this upward trajectory continues."
Junior,4,"I have wonderful professors and have the opportunity to take a diverse range of classes. From Public Health in a Global Society to Modern Latin America and Medical Humanities. A beautiful campus, making it a wonderful atmosphere to learn."
Freshman,4,"Boston College is a good blend of academics and social life. Boston College is one of the only need blind schools in the country, allowing for students of all walks of life to attend the school."
Junior,4,"BC education is top notch. Professors are awesome and the culture is fun, especially with D1 sports!"
Niche User,4,Really great buildings and professors. I found my visit to campus to be very welcoming and its absolutely beautiful! Everyone loves it who goes there.
Junior,4,It's great unless you're an aspiring medical student. Classes can be very difficult along with the grade deflation.
Sophomore,4,"The experience is all about what you make of it. Freshman year, there are many students who are unsure of their decision, but by the second semester of freshman year or by sophomore year, everybody starts to love BC. There are some really great professors (Wolfman) who really care about their students and an excess of clubs to join. People here definitely love to party, but don't be fooled, most of us are still hard workers and bang out an essay or two every weekend.
Overall, I love it. There is a friend group for everyone. Also, if you look hard enough, there are endless resources for students to accomplish what they want."
Sophomore,4,Boston College a challenging and interesting curriculum. It has such a beautiful campus and offers many opportunities for student involvement (volunteer opportunities in particular – even ones that tie in with certain courses).
Graduate Student,4,"Boston College is a great place to learn and grow. The student body has a variety of people with different interests, and professors take the time to get to know their students. Additionally, the campus is absolutely stunning and a joy to walk through to classes. The University does lack in diversity and often the administration doesn't deal with issues properly. If not for these, I would rate my four years at BC a 5-start experience."
Freshman,4,"Boston College is amazing! It has a beautiful campus, D-1 athletics, a city nearby, and a bunch of awesome people. The classes available are super interesting and there is always something to do. The housing process is a little sketchy though."
Sophomore,4,"I've had a great experience at BC. The campus is beautiful, they offer a wide variety of classes, and the nightlife is a good medium."
Senior,2,"As a Black student, Boston College has let me down. The university has 4% Black students and is not doing much to change that, there are often racial incidents among students and the administration rarely - if ever - does anything bout it, and there are very few professors of color. Aside from racial issues, Boston College treats its LGBTQ+ students poorly by not giving their clubs funding and not allowing them to use the language they want when it comes to events and clubs names for fear of losing donors. The university refuses to divest from fossil fuels and gun manufacturers, as well as Israeli support.

There are good things about BC (which I believe are outweighed by the aforementioned points, but good nonetheless). For example, the academics are strong, the campus is beautiful, it's in a great location, and there's a wide range of clubs."
Freshman,2,"I really wanted to love it here, but BC has little to offer apart from a name, which itself is false advertising. Between BC and the actual city of Boston are 10 miles of suburbs, and even more if you are forced to live on the law school campus along with 40% of all freshmen. The required meal plan is insanely overpriced for sub-par food, and they steal $300 of it through taxes. Personalities are cookie-cutter, and the student demographic consists almost entirely of white prep-school kids. With almost nowhere to go and nothing to do, a dreary and repetitive ordeal is what $75 thousand gets you. Thank God I'm transferring next fall because I really want 2019-20 to keep the award for ""loneliest year of my life"".

However, a couple of classes had some of the best teachers I've ever known, my roommate was a solid guy, and BC gratefully provided strong financial aid. These are the only reasons I didn't give 1 star."
Freshman,2,"bc is great if you're cis, white, straight, and like vineyard vines. i'm queer and feel very out of place here. the party scene is very poor for freshmen, and in general very monotonous and mostly just binge drinking. it's hard to make friends if you don't like the office or drake. don't come here if you don't want a continuation of high school pettiness and drama."
Freshman,2,"White privilege is the definition of Boston College. The acedemics here are great and it's kind of near Boston, but those are the only positive things about this school. The workload is extremely demanding, and most people at BC suck. The vast majority of students are white, religious, preppy, well off, and live in a bubble. Every guy on campus has short hair, wears khakis, boat shoes, and collared shirts. The party scene sucks. A lot of people drink here, but that's about it. Only a handful of people smoke weed on a regular basis. If you even mention a hard drug, people will freak out. The administration is also very conservative, which causes lots of problems for students. We have an entire police force on our campus with nothing better to do than arrest drunk college kids. If you're looking to have a good time in college, or if you're interesting, this isn't the school for you."
College Sophomore,2,Boston College has let someone suspended due to sexual assault live back on campus and has let another man get away with filming and distributing videos of women he's had sex with without their consent. BC talks big but doesn't do nearly enough.
College Freshman,2,"It's everywhere. The smell of weed on certain floors has almost become iconic year after year, and underage drink is pretty rampant, even on Healthy Living Floors (at least they have the common sense to go else where to drink). Cocaine usage does happen but, Marijuana is the drug of choice. There's not really any pressure to drink or do drugs if you don't and its not too hard to find friends who don't do such things. However finding a floor that does have that going on is pretty hard."
College Junior,2,"While it's definitely not big enough of a deal to be a deciding factor about whether or not you should attend BC, the housing process is pretty bad. Students become cliquey about it sophomore year, but luckily off-campus housing junior year works well to break up the cliques that are formed only long enough for you to have to scramble to find 5 other people to live with by senior year, since the housing lottery goes by groups. However, if you communicate openly with your roommates and figure things out ahead of time, housing shouldn't be a problem."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm attending a rather large university, but I think I am better suited to a small school"
College Sophomore,2,"I am minority and I feel that BC doesn't support our causes. I know that it happens at a great majority of schools, but I am a paying student and I deserve the same respect as everyone else."
College Senior,2,"BC is widely known as one of the least diverse schools in American, and a few days on campus will show you why. The vast majority of the student body is the personification of the phrase ""white privilege."""
College Senior,2,"People are very attractive, but there's only one of two types of girl:

1. Very, very into the hookup culture OR

2. Thinks they're God's gift to BC

There are some that are very attractive and cool, but they are few and far between"
College Freshman,2,Diversity is precious to BC.... because it is so rare.
College Junior,2,"Alcohol use is pretty much never regulate, but other drugs are strictly punished."
College Sophomore,2,"If you have a sibling over 25, they don't take that sibling into account even if parents are still paying for their tuition fees and that sibling is still in school,"
Recent Alumnus,2,BC gives very little and it is very expensive
College Freshman,2,"The weather in the winter is incredibly cold, windy, and snowy. Walking to classes sucks."
College Sophomore,2,we don't have many off campus venues. Only chipotle or chinese food
Recent Alumnus,2,I didn't qualify for any BC aid so I needed all government loans. Their financial aid program is not the best.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is an urban area - there isn't a lot of parking and what there is usually requires a resident permit
Recent Alumnus,2,If you are under 21 it sucks - Boston is a tough town for under 21 nightlife and they are really strict about fake IDs.
College Junior,2,Last semester i had a very difficult workload of only major classes because that is what my advisor advised i should do and i horribly regretted it. if i could start over last year i would.
College Sophomore,2,"Very, very few people bring cars to BC because parking spots are absurdly expensive. A parking permit costs over $2,000, i'm pretty sure. What a shame, because I have an unused car sitting in my driveway at home that could have been put to good use."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many people at Boston College use drugs. Most students that do partake in drug activities have done so before entering college. There is no pressure on campus to do drugs, but it does exist in some smaller circles. Alcohol use is much more prevent than drugs."
College Junior,2,"The students from Boston College are mostly white, and many come from private schools. It is not a very diverse campus ethnically, but most students have very different life experiences."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus police are very strict regarding underage drinking. This is understandable, but there is a problem with the way in which punishments are given. People tend to be given the same consequences for infractions that are very different and should deserve varying punishments. I advice staying safe and avoiding getting caught."
College Junior,2,"Overall diversity is low at Boston College. We fit our stereotype of having a white, upper middle class student body. There are many programs geared towards promoting diversity on campus, and many put on fun events throughout the year. However, students tend to hang out with people who are similar to them."
College Freshman,2,"he drug scene at Boston College is not really big, although it depends on who you hang out with. If people are doing drugs, they're usually just smoking. Drinking is a much more popular activity."
College Freshman,2,"BCPD takes their job very seriously. There is no doubt in my mind about BCPD's effectiveness in any would-be crisis situation. This is probably due to the fact that they treat pretty much everything, including underage drinking, like a crisis situation. Any student who is visibly drunk will be breathalyzed, taken into custody and made to spend a night in the infirmary. My only legitimate complaint about the school is the way that alcohol-related offenses are handled. It's a well known problem, and the student government is trying to pass a new system, but as of right now most alcohol violations will put you on some sort of probation for at least 6 months and enroll you in a safety seminar program. As far as RAs go, there are a few who will give you a warning before writing you up, but in most cases, if you're caught, you're done."
College Freshman,2,"This is not a party school. The parties are usually at ""the mods"", senior housing. The most you will get out of them is a packed, sweaty, small living room. As a freshman, it has already gotten very old. The kids here in general are NOT fun. There is a very pretentious, judgemental vibe here (you know how rich kids are)."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is typical Boston weather, it snows, its rainy, its gross 6 months out of the year. If you like skiing or other outdoor/winter sports there are tons of places to go enjoy that around the campus and within a few hours drive if you want to make a weekend of it. Once the weather gets nice, everyone is outside enjoying the beautiful campus."
College Freshman,2,"Because of the lack of fraternities, the parties tend to take place at either the ""mods"" or modular senior housing on campus or on the streets that branch off of Comm Ave.  While at other schools you may be able to get in by paying a small fee, at BC, at least you know someone in/running the party or are in a sea of girls, your chances of getting into the party are slim to none.  People tend to have a work hard/play hard attitude that really limits the desire for most people to head into Boston on the weekends so that they don't miss out on any of the ""fun"" they may miss."
College Freshman,2,"I don't agree with Boston College's policy that it does not offer any merit-based scholarships, but claims to meet 100% of all need-based aid. I believe that they should reward students for their high school grades, so that in cases like mine, where my non-custodial parent does not provide enough money that is necessary for me to attend, I would be able to receive aid in another fashion."
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of apartments in the area near campus but Boston is an expensive city! The average one-bedroom apartment costs $1300. It is very easy to find housing, but one of the main challenges is that all the landlords use realtors, and a realtor fee is usually a month's rent (although sometimes you can talk them down). Parking is also difficult and you should expect to have to rent a parking space as well."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Is A+ really visible or hardly available? If the higher grade means a low presence of drugs and alcohol on campus, then I would rate BC at a C-. Alcohol is everywhere, and while I never really felt pressured to drink, it was weird if you didn't. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights were always crazy in the mods, and you could find people willing to go out to the bars any night of the week. As for drugs, people were much more laid back. Most people I knew smoked pot or took prescription drugs like adderol to get work done. I never felt any pressure at all to use drugs while I was there, and the drug scene is nothing in comparison to the drinking scene."
College Sophomore,2,"It Is Boston Isn't It? I spent my whole life in California before coming to BC, so weather wasn't a huge priority for me. You know what you're getting if you choose to go to school in New England. For me, weather was only a problem when it prevented us from going out on the weekends. Besides that, as long as you bring your winter clothes, you'll survive the few months of cold."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Big Problem – Alcohol is extremely popular on campus, but not so much for drugs. Marijuana and ADD medicine are the most common, but the majority of people do not partake."
College Junior,2,"No Snow Days – It could be 5 feet of snow on the ground and a temperature of below zero and classes would still never get cancelled. I've been here for two years now and class was cancelled once during the New England storm two years ago. Also it rains a lot, make sure you have rain boots and a jacket."
College Junior,2,"Don't Plan on Bringing a Car to School. Parking is readily available for weekday visitors.  On the weekends, expect some kind of ticket."
College Junior,2,"It's nearly impossible to have a car on campus, and the closest train to get into the city is well-known for being the slowest. I believe the only way to have a car on campus and have a parking spot is to either be a professor or have proof that you need a form of transportation that the buses and trains can't cover - such as nursing students who need to travel a lot. (And even then, a parking spot is pretty expensive.)"
College Senior,2,"Everyone Is More or Less Alike – Although there are exceptions, most people at BC are alike-- Irish Catholic and middle/high class.  This can be frustrating at times."
Freshman,1,"False advertising. BC is 45 minutes away from the actual city of Boston via train and in the middle of the suburbs. There's nothing to do in the area. Students are composed of white prep school alumni, and the majority of my teachers put almost no effort in their classes, making those who do all the more exceptional in this unexceptional school."
Freshman,1,"If you’re not a preppy white kid from a local, single-gendered religious school, then you will not enjoy BC. People who go here will say it’s a crazy party school and everyone has fun; you have to completely go out of your way to find anything social to do at night besides watch netflix. Students with social lives leave as soon as classes are over to go to other local schools. People in the business school have a serious superiority complex (they act like they’re at Wharton and constantly bring up that it’s “way harder to get into”). I could go on forever about BC being blatantly racist etc. (someone was put on probation for writing B.L.M.). I was originally looking forward to BC, but it wasn’t more than two weeks into my first semester before I started filling out transfer applications."
Sophomore,1,"Don’t come 
It’s a racist and political biased school. It does not support the whole range of debate but simply choose a side to stand. ***Boston College does not give a shit to minority students ***"
Sophomore,1,"I feel like I completely wasted my college experience coming to this school.  Although the academics and reputation of the school might help me get an above average job after school, I would have much preferred to have gone to a slightly worse school and actually enjoyed my time there.  Not only is any form of partying strictly policed, but the school is willing to completely screw over their students in doing so.  Some weekends BC faculty even patrol the streets with police helping them send students to court.  Moreover, the school's leadership only cares about the school's reputation and money even if it means ignoring racists problems on campus.  Also, the dining hall food is absurdly over priced especially for how low quality the food is.  Its hard to believe the school calls itself a jesuit institution with how corrupt the institution is."
Senior,1,"Don't come here if you want the traditional, fun college experience.  This school treats students like children and will go through extensive lengths to shut down any sort of party and then unfairly discipline students.  Besides that, the sports teams are garbage and Boston Police are just as strict/unforgiving.  The leadership at BC is truly corrupt and incompetent of running a Jesuit institution."
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Housing is a joke at this school. Freshmen are separated from the rest of the undergrads on Upper and Newton Campus. If you end up on CoRo your sophomore year, your social life will (somehow) get worse. Juniors live off-campus, supposedly the, ""best year of your life."" And seniors enjoy the mods. They close at 1."
College Freshman,1,"This school eliminates the idea of ""fun."""
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life at BC since it is a Jesuit institution.
College Freshman,1,"If you take UVA and push it into a cold, dark jail in the Northeast, you would get BC. Kids are preppy and cool. Girls are attractive. But the administration works off of archaic principles not dissimilar to that of a prison. The attitude towards underage drinking is strict to say the least. Cops lurk around every corner and while this serves to keep the campus safe, they are more so focused on getting kids in trouble merely to uphold the narrow minded perspectives of the administrators. As you trek into Boston, the same storyline continues. Bars are strict all around. Clubs are especially exclusive. And the local movie theater is 21+. Overall this leaves underage students without an outlet for fun, burying them further under their already rising pile of books on Friday and Saturday nights. This is quite a toxic environment for stressed students who are trying to figure out the rest of their lives."
College Senior,1,"There is no greek life at BC, except for the one ""fake frat"" that is not recognized by the university and is generally looked down upon by the rest of the student body."
College Freshman,1,"This is one of the least diverse places to go to school. Mostly upper class, straight white kids who are religious/went to catholic school."
College Sophomore,1,"BC financial aid is supposed to be generous, however I have had a terrible experience with it. The financial aid department has unrealistic expectations for family finances and isn't helpful."
College Freshman,1,"The Administration here is actually the worst. It is the most conservative administration I think in the country, DEFINITELY in the northeast. They're all conservative catholics who hate demonstrations and protests and denounce free speech. They encourage the most inactive social justice campus perhaps in the country. They are anything but forward thinking. They don't want a cafe in the library because ""jesuit tradition says food and books shouldn't mix."" wtf? how about some practicality? it's 2015 not the 1500s. Also they of course are anti-birth control/planned parenthood because of its conservative nature and there's a pro life club on campus but (literally) God forbid there be a pro choice club to balance that out because BC cultivates the ""whole person."""
College Sophomore,1,"the financial aid officers are so quick to put a hold on your account, they can be completely unreasonable and only take account numbers rather than personal situations, they have money that they dont want to give, will randomly have balances on account, too expensive, have to take out huge amounts of loans, unreasonable, can reject your loan if they want"
College Freshman,1,"I hate the food here with a passion. Lunch is okay but as a freshman eating at Mac, dinner often feels like a chore."
College Junior,1,"The cost of living on campus is significantly higher than living off-campus, and if you live on campus, you are forced to pay a refundable $2400 for food that tastes bad and is bad for you. The people are animals and will destroy, deface, and vandalize their own dorms, your dorm, and common spaces. This happens with total impunity, but the campus police will still harass you for drinking and smoking, even if you are not bothering anyone.

Living on campus is absolutely miserable and the people who claim otherwise are usually the one-in-the-same inconsiderate animals mentioned above."
College Junior,1,There are very limited resources for physics majors.
College Sophomore,1,"BC offers little to no financial aid and the application process is tedious. Every year they have lost my documents and I have had to resend them. They also notify you VERY LATE about financial aid, so late that if you cannot afford it there is not time to seek other options."
College Sophomore,1,Boston is SO COLD and SO MUCH SNOW
College Sophomore,1,"This school sucks completely. The people are stuck up and cliquey. No one will give you the time of day socially if you aren't in their crew. Parties are smallish and only good for close-knit friend groups. The work is mad hard and you will spend all your waking time studying and doing homework in order to stay level with the people here. Honestly, I came here thinking I would have a great time and freshman year was pretty good. It deceived me into thinking things would get better but this year blows. People are fake and shallow, not something that changes. It looks nice on the surface, but beneath the veneer BC's true colors show. Good luck trying to have fun here."
College Sophomore,1,One Greek group and they are not even associated with the school.
College Freshman,1,"The parties at BC are fun for people who never left their house in high school because they get to see alcohol for the first time but once that thrill is gone you might as well stay in unless you're 21. The bar/club scene isn't a thing for many reasons until you're an upperclassman. First, Boston is really strict on fake IDs. So, if you're going to use one it better be good and you have to look old. Second, people just love school here. Plato on a Thursday night is 10x better to 90% of the BC population than being a college student and going to a bar. Also, the T closes at 12:30, so it means taxi back to Chestnut Hill. On top of your bar tab, that makes for a pricy night. Weekends are better right? No. People still just love school. Got a paper due Thursday at 4? You should stay in and work on it Saturday night. Or at least thats what a lot of people think. "
College Freshman,1,The school offers very little financial aid and basically no scholarships which wouldn't be so horrible if the school was not as expensive as it is.
College Freshman,1,There just aren't many spots. You're lucky if you get one. 
College Freshman,1,"There isn't greek life at BC. Since this is a Jesuit institution it is not allowed. We have the ""BC Fake Frat"" in which case a bunch of guys live off campus in a house, throw parties wearing bow ties, and state their ""dominance over the pledges"" but most students look at this as one of the biggest jokes around. "
College Sophomore,1,"Almost no one gets financial aid, which is ridiculous for such an expensive school.  I received almost no aid."
College Sophomore,1,"BC is not a convenient school to bring a car to. Spots are extremely expensive and difficult to get. Thankfully, getting around Boston is easy and cheap, so a car really isn't necessary at BC"
College Junior,1,"Parking at BC is extremely expensive and there are a very limited number of spots. Every time that there is an on-campus event (which is almost every weekend), any student who pays an exorbitant monthly rate for a parking space is forced to move their car from main campus to the Newton campus, which is a 15 minute drive from campus. Furthermore, BC claims that it allows paid overnight parking during the week. However, this is not the case; I have several friends who have been towed from BC lots despite this claim. BC parking imposes very unreasonable ticket fines and is very inflexible."
College Freshman,1,Financial aid this year has been a nightmare. The process is not explained well and the financial aid counselors seem apathetic and can do very little. Paying for BC is extremely stressful if you are middle class.
College Sophomore,1,"The majority of students at this school are conservative, white, and Catholic.  Many people are very grounded in their ways, often appearing ignorant, homophobic and racist.  The school consists of a lot of wealthy people, very preppy attire, and little to no diversity.  I honestly thought there was more diversity at my tiny suburban private school on the South Shore..."
College Freshman,1,"Coming from California, the winter here makes walking to class a miserable experience. It absolutely affect my happiness level."
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman, living on Newton is terrible. The bus is a complete hassle, especially when you are waiting out in the cold. You always have to make sure you are out during the bus schedule hours and have to leave for class at least 20 minutes before it starts. Some people will try to justify living on Newton, saying there's more of a community, but I have not experienced this and would certainly give up the ""community"" here to live ON CAMPUS. It would help if we were located next to something useful or interesting, but we are literally in the middle of no where."
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol? Yes. Marijuana? Yes. Study drugs? Absolutely.

Most people drink and if they don't, they usually smoke. If you don't use drugs or drink, it's not like you won't have any friends, but you will certainly be a part of a separate group of people. A few of my friends at BC have used cocaine and ecstasy, but that's definitely uncommon."
College Freshman,1,"Sex is not allowed on campus (although this is hardly enforced, it does send a pretty close-minded message to the students), and you can't buy condoms in the school store or get them at health services. The housing administration does not make an effort to help you when you are having serious issues with your room. For me, personally, the situation became pretty drastic before Boston College was forced to take action. Freedom of speech for select clubs is pretty horrendous. The RAs are somewhat lenient about drug use and noise, but it differs wildly from floor to floor."
College Senior,1,"Rubbish, with very little parking available and what is there is absurdly expensive. The good news is that there are lots of public transportation options, including three T lines that go right by the campus or are easily accessible by bus shuttle."
College Junior,1,"The dorms are OK in size and amenities. there is no air conditioning so fall and spring can really suck. The dorms are not super social if your not friends with your neighbors it is unlikely you will talk to them. 

The housing process is horrible. People have lost friends over it."
College Freshman,1,"I give this a D because, technically, the school is racially and culturally/religiously diverse. However, can you really call it diverse when everyone dresses identically, no matter what their ethnic background is? Everyone here is the same. Everyone is wealthy and superficial. You just can't go to a big name school without it being like this. The better the ranking, the more insufferable the people."
College Senior,1,"Financial aid at BC is pretty terrible. They are known for being notoriously stingy, and they are. They analyze every aspect of your family's finances. I did not receive nearly as much aid from BC as I did from other schools. There are no tips for getting financial aid at BC, but it obviously helps if you are a student athlete or are actually in a terrible financial situation. For middle class students, you are going to be paying a LOT."
College Freshman,1,Jersey Trash and White Wash – Too many Jersey kids. Barely any diversity at all. The international students all know each other and any minority students have their own little cliques. The white students are the majority of all students at BC. People don't care about diversity as much as they should.
College Freshman,1,"With the lack of parking space and construction going on, there's absolutely nowhere to park for free on campus. Pricing for parking is around $300 a month! Ridiculous! No way am I bringing my car on campus if I have to pay that much. I'll wait till I live off-campus..."
College Senior,1,"Take the T – Parking is very difficult to find if you do not have a permit. The permits are really expensive and are only available for upper class students. Honestly the train stop is very close to the school and you're better off taking the train to grocery stores, bars, malls. It is easy to do and more convenient."
College Senior,1,"The Truth – The school's located very close to the city and the social scene on campus is actually pretty great. However, if you are a minority student it can be very difficult for you both on campus and in the city. Very difficult."
College Freshman,1,"There Is Almost None – If you want to have a car, you will pay 200 per month, plus 15 bucks a day to park on campus if you want to drive to class, but the great aprt is, you dont need a car, or really want one"
College Freshman,1,"Everyone Drinks and Smokes – Almost everyone Drinks at BC, (and this is a great thing) thats just a fact. If you arent drinking, you usally only hang out with the VERY small group of non drinkers. Most weekends are spent pregaming hard, then drinking more at the party if the keg hasnt run out. Most everyone smokes too, some more than others, but few will turn down a hit. Finally with hard drugs, most of the kids who go to electroic shows roll, but not all (such as myself). you will find people doing everything, but mostly just drinking and smoking."
College Senior,1,"The Orientation Leader Scam – My favorite part of BC is seeing who is chosen as an Orientation Leader each year. The group of Orientation Leaders is a great mix of people from different background with different interests and all of them are absolutely over the moon for BC. Truth be told, they're all full of it. It's a complete scam. There are very few minorities here and if there are, they have a specific group that they are immediately ushered into upon arrival. It's like BC is screaming at everyone ""WE ARE SO DIVERSE LOOK AT HOW MANY ETHNIC CLUBS WE HAVE!!!"" but it's all BS. Most of the campus is rich white kids who haven't had to work for a cent in their life."
College Freshman,1,"Very White – BC is a very white campus. Yes, there is some diversity on campus and most people are very accepting of different ethnic groups, but the majority of the student body is upper-middle class white students with conservative, Christian backgrounds."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is almost impossible, few students have on campus parking."
College Sophomore,1,Overral Experience – My favorite experience at this school by far was when I realized I could graduate in 2 years and never have to set foot on this awful campus again.  I look forward to the day that the University contacts me to donate and I can explain to them how they robbed me of four years of my life that I will never be able to do again and until they find a way to replace them I will never give them even one cent in donations.  If you still have time save yourself and stay away from this dump.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you enjoy freezing rain, perpetually gray days and high winds DO NOT attend this school"
College Sophomore,1,The internet here is slower and less reliable than the internet in my house.  Multiple times I have gone to printing labs before class to print an assignment out and found that they are not working.  The computers and printing stations in the library are out of order on a nearly daily basis
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is tough!  There are not many passes available and even when you have a pass they are picky about which spots you can park in, so you might still get a ticket.  The street spots have all sort of varied rules about times to park and it is hard to find a metered spot."
College Senior,1,"SO STRICT. If you are looking for a school that's fun, don't come here."
College Sophomore,1,The only way to get parking is if you are seriously handicapped or in ROTC and even then it is around 200 a month. The thing is though you don't really need it. BC is located on three different T stops.
College Senior,1,"Parking is available for faculty and staff, and commuters can get a special permit but it costs an arm and a leg. Best bet? Ride the T."
College Freshman,1,"Newton Campus – Although some of the dorms are nice, it is impossible to be placed in those dorms unless you are a senior. There is also a satellite campus for freshman which 40% of the freshman class lives on. This means you have to take a bus to get to class, and because the buses don't run on a schedule, it can take anywhere from five to thirty minutes to get to campus."
College Junior,1,"VERY BAD – There's an asian table, a black table... There are three white guys who hang out with the asians and are known by all the asians as ""the white guy who hangs out with the asians"" and are accused of having asian fetishes. You feel like a minority as a non-white individual. Race is such a touchy topic because people like to avoid conflict or seeming like a racist, so it's not acknowledged. Personality diversity is bad too, students are all conservative, and preppy. There won't be any people with pink, purple dyed hair, or goths and skaters, or that many hipsters. "
College Junior,1,"Super Strict Ras – BC is scary strict, especially with the freshman class. The RAs are not to be messed with. They are allowed to come into your room anytime and look around, they just can't open your closets and friges. They will knock on your door if you make a lot of noise. Campus police regularly prowls on weekends, busting parties sometimes before 12, so the party scene suffers, and people have to be super quiet."
College Sophomore,1,"Veryyyyy Strict – BC is trying to expand so they are trying to crack down on partying in order to please the surrounding community. This means that there is absolutely no partying in dorms. The RAs are very strict. I think I know one person who has not been written up. Most people get in trouble at some point or another. They are also cracking down on off campus parties meaning people are becoming even more exclusive as to who can enter the party, making it even more difficult to find a party to go to."
College Senior,1,"Frats: NOT in the Jesuit Work Ethic – As a Jesuit school, Boston College does not support the existence of fraternities or sororities in the traditional sense due to the nature of exclusive student organizations and their tendencies to demonstrate the negative effects of competition and conformity."

Freshman,5,"I have not yet had to take any classes online, but in preparation to switch to online learning in the event that we have to stop in person education our teachers have put all assignments on PLATO to ensure that we will know what to do from home."
Freshman,5,"I have really enjoyed my time as a Penn College student this far. I love that we get to spend more time in labs than we do on lectures, because in my opinion this is an easier way to learn. My professors have been very helpful and are very knowledgeable in our field. The facilities are all very clean and it is over all a great place to be."
Freshman,5,We actually haven't been online this semester this is my first year and we all have been in person classes.
Freshman,5,Online classes were actually what made my grade last semester. At first my professors didn’t know how to handle online classes so everything was scattered. But over time communication got better and everything was more organized. At first I struggled with finding out what assignments needed done and when the due date is but weekly reminders really helped me. It was really hard to keep motivation especially since I got severely ill during online learning but I pulled through. My professors gave me lots of room to work and even forgave some assignments that were weeks overdue because of my illness and I am extremely thankful. Finals week was far less stressful and I for the first time I felt like my grades relied on my skills rather than my memory.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, Pennsylvania College of Technology is by far the best college. Attending into my sophomore year, the programs are excellent. The professors that run each program are very knowledgeable, and are there to give you the best education possible. The funding here is excellent they are very understanding of our situations in the real world. Penn College also exceeds a graduation rate of 97% and most students walk out of college with a job."
Sophomore,5,"The school uses an online learning platform PLATO. Everything is user friendly, and the professors communicate their expectations frequently through news posts and emails. Interaction with other students is encouraged through zoom meetings and discussion boards."
Sophomore,5,i hvae not done any online courses at pennsylvania college of technology but have heard many good things about the online courses here
Sophomore,5,"the college is amazing, the campus is very clean and interactive and everyone there is nice. i would definitely suggest anyone who would like a career in a trade to look into going here"
Freshman,5,A great place for further your education! It has all the facilities a good program should have to be able to make their students capable of learning everything they need to succeed. The programs are high in national success rates and jobs are given right out of college!
Freshman,5,"It is one of the best heavy equipment schools in the country.  Teachers are great, easy to make friends.  If your looking into trades as a career this is the best your going to get.  And its Penn State Affiliate.  I would highly recommend it."
Freshman,5,"Penn College has a very welcoming amours with very welcoming staff and students. There is always someone you can ask for assistance on anything you may need and if they cannot help you, they will find someone who can."
Junior,5,"I love how quickly I can get my degree and save a lot of time and money! This college has so much going on around it, it is easy to find things to do in your off time, within walking distance!"
Freshman,5,This college is a good mix between conventional 4yr programs and trades. the area is very nice with minimal disturbances
Senior,5,"I absolutely love Penn College, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a technical school. The teachers and administrators strive to make sure that there is a limited amount of students in each class so that they can truly have every opportunity to get the assistance in class"
Freshman,5,"The teachers at penn college are all very capable and friendly, they really care about the students. The school in it's self is very helpful. I commute to college for 2 hours and they have been very helpful in finding a schedule that works for me."
Niche User,5,"The staff and students were very friendly and clearly wanted the best for you. The dorms were nicely spaced and clean. The buildings are close to one another but not jammed packed either. The dining areas were very good and had a wide selection. The scenery is very nice, and it is a gated college."
Niche User,5,I have only been to the school for their open house but from those three hours of being at the school I decided on the spot to apply for the college. Their dorms and classrooms were very clean. Their teachers seemed like they wanted to help the kids in their class.
Freshman,5,Hands on learning is a big plus to developing the tools needed to a career in the field that technology is fast growing and ever changing daily.
Freshman,5,I love everything with this school. I like the professors. The dorms are the best doors that I saw when touring colleges. The social scene is also good.
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer student from another state and I am just ecstatic with PCT! Such caring teachers and staff.
Freshman,5,I am incoming freshman and have been so pleased by what I have experienced at Penn Tech so far. The staff is very nice and the instructors in the culinary program are outstanding. The camp that they host for high school students is amazing and reaffirmed my desire to work in the food industry.
Sophomore,5,Penn College is full of very friendly staff and it is a great college environment! Teachers are very helpful if you have any questions.
Junior,5,"This college is a very up to date college with great academics. Their science department is challenging, yet rewarding. The degrees that Pennsylvania College of Technology offers show a great employment rate. Professors will go above and beyond to make sure you succeed"

Freshman,5,"This will be my first year in this college but just being on the campus the few times I have been already, it is beautiful. Everyone is so friendly and is there willing to help you."
Freshman,5,"Great college with many different majors including Mechanics, Dental Hygiene, Nursing, Welding, and much more!"
Freshman,5,Pennsylvania College of Technology is a great place to continue your post-secondary education. It is an affiliate of Penn State University. Currently I am a 2nd semester freshman. I am very impressed with what PCT has to offer me. I am majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering which is a 4 yr degree here. PCT offers students many 4 yr and 2 yr degrees. I have wonderful professors. I absolutely love the hands-on approach they offer in many of my classes. The campus is beautiful and the reputation that Pennsylvania College of Technology has is phenomenal. I truly feel I have chosen the right college to continue my academics. PCT and the surrounding community feels like my hometown.
Junior,5,"Everyone here is so friendly! It’s such a heart warming campus too, with event going on every day!! I love it here!"
Alum,5,My time at Pennsylvania College of Technology was great! It was the perfect college experience for someone who enjoys small-town living but with opportunities that are similar to large colleges. The staff of Penn College truly make the campus -- everyone is helpful and positive. Unique majors with great job placement made my experience!
Niche User,5,"The Campus tour I took of the college went very well. The dorms were very spacious and felt comfortable. The main dining facility had a wide range of excellent food. Student life on campus seemed fun, there are always activities during the weekend with a wide range of athletics to spectate or to compete."
Alum,5,"Honestly would have never had the opportunities I had anywhere else. With my major the largest in the nation make the trip to penn college from all over the US to pick out guys up. Before my senior year I had 3 job offers from the largest home builders in the nation. I ended up taking my offer with Ryan Homes and I am now climbing the ladder to success along with the 4 other penn college grads in my division. Along with the job placement the education, social life, and athletics were all big contributions to the Best college experience. Thanks PCT, highly recommend this school!!"
Sophomore,5,"Things I really like about my college is the information I have learned from my teachers about Diesel mechanics.  The teachers, advisors, support personnel,  and the Dean are all very personal and supportive to you. There are so many places to eat, entertainment, and stores within walking distance. There is security which made my parents fell safe about me being there. I have met a lot of people and have really enjoyed my college life at Penn Tech. I would recommend anyone to go there."
Freshman,5,"Everyone here- administration, professors, staff- are very helpful and caring and want you to succeed at what you do. That said it's still a college and they want your money, but the individuals are great."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this college! I attended one tour and was hooked! I am returning as a sophomore and RA and I have to say, I am honestly excited about going back!"
Sophomore,5,Penn college's campus is beautiful! This campus offers many different academic programs that are very unique. The program's labs are very updated so they really prepare you for life outside of school.
Sophomore,5,"I like that Penn College is so hands on, we really get to be involved in our interests and get to learn by doing. If I could change anything, it would be that my major gets the opportunity to choose more elective classes that tailor to our interests within the industry."
Sophomore,5,"As a technical school, there are incredible hands on experiences that are offered to students.  The campus life offers students a wide variety of activities throughout the semester.  I highly recommend this school."
Freshman,5,"To be honest when I first went to visit my college, it was love at first sight. It has really good programs and the staff and students are very nice."
Freshman,5,"What I love most about Pennsylvania College of Technology is the small class sizes. I really connect with the instructors, thus getting the most out of each class. The professors also really stress the importance of each individual students education. They provide flexible office hours, that students can take advantage of if they are struggling through their course. This shows that the instructors are there for the students academic benefit to advance in their careers."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere at the college.  I also enjoy the dinning halls and all of the different foods they have.
Freshman,5,"I love how all your professors try to help you as much as possible. Also, they have so much to offer like free tutoring, gym memberships and open labs."
Freshman,5,"My experience has been very excellent my first year of college. I have gotten lost, found amazing friends, found classes I love, professors that I think are amazing and professors that I’m not really a fan of. My learning experience has been a lot different then high school but for the better I believe that college is 95 percent better then my high school experience. You have to learn to get your things done and stay organized by yourself no one is there to baby you and push you through if you want to be there you better show it."
Freshman,5,"PennsylvaniaCollege of Technology is a wonderful school. I don't just say that because I go there. The campus is located in downtown Williamsport and there is so much to do. 
The professors at Penn Tech work with the students to attain the highest grades they deserve. If a student is failing it is simply because they don't show up to class or don't do the required work. 
Penn Tech has many dining areas. My favorite is the Keystone Dining Hall where they have hot meals, soup, salad, sandwiches and more. 
Pennsylvania College of Technology works with students so they can get the degree they want!"
Freshman,5,This college has small classes which makes it easier for students to ask questions and have one on one time with the professor. All the professors are great with teaching the information to give all students a great understanding of the content.
Freshman,5,"I like my classes so far (still a freshman), and the teachers are very helpful at this school. I just wish some of the eateries on campus were open on the weekends, only one dining hall is open on the weekends. But overall I love the school!"
Senior,5,"Today I had taken a tour around campus to meet the instructors and students and to get familiar with the area since this is my first choice for college. What I experienced today was nothing but a great environment they informed me about all the extra things they have to help you out such as free tutoring, free IT help in case your computer crashes or something.It was such a welcoming environment to be in and i enjoyed the tour very much it helped answer so many questions I had so I advise you to plan a college visit as soon as possible."
Niche User,5,I visited the campus of Pennsylvania College of Technology and every one of the faculty members helped me out a lot and the campus itself was fantastic and I loved it from the first time that I stepped onto the campus.
Freshman,5,"So far I love it! Staff member are very helpful, teacher are great . Dorms rooms clean and very spacious. College campus very safe."
Sophomore,5,Love my school! It's a great place to be. Great opportunities on campus to take advantage of and so many hands-on experiences with classes. Everything is easily accessible
Freshman,5,Penn College is a very great school that's always been present in my life. I'm from the local area and they've always been involved in the community.
Sophomore,5,Penn College has the most hands on learning which makes it great for students. The small classroom make it easier to learn and everyone is willing to help each other out.
Freshman,5,Everyone here is very friendly and nice. The majority of the instructors just want to see you succeed. I am so glad that I chose this college as the college to get a degree from.
Freshman,5,My experience here at Penn College has been absolutely amazing. I feel as though i have never learned as much has I have in the one semester I've completed so far in my first year. I would recommend this school to anyone thinking about applying and wouldn't change a single thing about my experience so far.
Alum,5,"Small Classroom settings, hands on learning, professors had a lot of experience and knowledge to share with students, Diverse campus that always had activities going on"
Sophomore,5,"I love Pennsylvania College of Technology. This college provides a great learning experience and overall great and friendly environment for students. This college also provides the best hands on experience for any major. It also provides amazing courses within ones major that you cant find any where else. I love the atmosphere as well, it is a friendly and safe campus. Every staff member is helpful as well with whatever you need."
Junior,5,The school has an amazing atmosphere. The academics are held to a high standard. The food is great. The staff is very respectful and helpful.
Freshman,5,There are so many resources to help you succeed. They really take time to make sure you understand the material and help you as you learn.  The hands on is really nice because you learn things from text and then actually apply it to the real world.
Graduate Student,5,I like this program it really helps. I can find many different scholarships very easy and it doesn't take long. 
Niche User,5,"I liked there computer lab, which is important because it involves my major, Engineering Design Technology.  "
College Junior,5,"Wide network of connections, corporations, museums and other businesses that work with the college to ensure employment after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"With very little notice my professors quickly adapted their curriculum to an online format. I truly believe that they did their best and that I got most out of the experience that I could, despite the circumstances."
Sophomore,4,I would recommend Pennsylvania College of Technology for those who like a “hands on” experience. Most of your classes will be labs that you participate in rather than lectures (although depending on your major you will still have to take some). You will leave with real world experience that you can apply to your future career.
Freshman,4,It is a very good school all of the factuality really wants to see you succeed and do well in there classes they are doing a really great job at keeping everyone safe during this COVID stuff. The school needs to have more things for the kids to do I know its hard  during these times but the kids are getting so bored there getting in trouble.
Sophomore,4,"During COVID-19 Academic year, it was very stressful. Studying at a Hands-on learning school is difficult to learn online."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very invested in students and are down to earth. Class sizes are on the smaller end, with a focus on hands on learning. Only negative is the lack of accommodation for commuters with parking and prices of program materials. Almost nothing is included in your tuition— you have to buy EVERYTHING for your program."
Freshman,4,"I am enrolled but did not start yet. During the enrollment process, I was helped by the counselors and it became complicated at some point because of covid-19. Great experience so far and can't wait to get started."
Freshman,4,"Online had more leverage, but was harder because I had to do critiques for art. If it hadn't been for COVID, I would not have applied for online classes. Although I had some early classes, being on campus gave me the motivation to have a schedule that I adhered to"
Freshman,4,"Not many teachers, had to have some online classes since there isn't enough space for all students in only two time periods during the week. Not much diversity. Food is pretty good."
Sophomore,4,Great school with great opportunity to connect with professors and get additional help otherwise more difficult to obtain at a larger University. Prices tend to go up every year. Well known for their trade course offerings. Great placement rates for students into their career field prior and pending graduation.
Sophomore,4,Course framework outlined well in syllabus. Utilization of Zoom when needed. Great online communication with professors.
Sophomore,4,"All in all my college is nice. The program here is only taught for my major at this school, which makes me think that I’m getting the most out of my college experience. Changes? Some of the professors can be a little...hard to understand, but I guess that can’t be helped. Some of the housing arrangements I’m sure could be improved as well as how things are handled as far as kids go. But all in all it’s an amazing school."
Freshman,4,The teachers and staff care a lot about their students and always go the extra mile to ensure student success.
Junior,4,"The college, over all, is a pretty good school for technology focused degrees. In addition, outside of classes there are plenty of clubs and activities on campus to meet new people and relax from the grind. However, if you are going for an information technology degree best bring your own computer. The college fails to keep the computers and software up to date. Additionally, if a class requires a specific piece of software, be prepared to go on a goose chase to find which public lab has the computers that have it installed as public labs in the same building may not have it installed."
Niche User,4,"I've already visited the college 3 times already and plan to attend for the fall semester. While visiting those 3 times, I got tours around the campus like the classes, town, and dorms. Seeing the cleanliness, the diverse number of students, and the number of different majors they offered, instantly hooked me to the school."
Freshman,4,It’s a pretty good campus and the motive and intent is quite great. You can tell the compassion and true dedication teachers have to making sure students leave with nothing but success. It’s not too diverse and the system held at the school can be questionable sometimes.
Freshman,4,"This school offers so many opportunities for its students and provides them with a welcoming environment. The campus is beautiful, the professors are wonderful and care about their students. Freshman especially are surrounded in a safe environment to learn and grow away from home. The only downside is how tough the academic programs are to stay in. A lot is expected from the students from the get go."
Freshman,4,"Pennsylvania College of Technology is a very clean campus that is filled with an active student life. The professors are great - they truly want to see you succeed in school, and in your desired job. There are many amazing options when it comes to studying. The college offers and amazingly helpful tutoring center, writing center, and open labs. These are all available to students, in hopes of success in a course."
Junior,4,My overall experience with Penn College has been very good. I got involved with a Christian club on campus called Cru and it's a really great time. Most of the teachers are awesome although some simply don't care.
Sophomore,4,I like how the professors and staff teach you and have on-hand training sessions instead of preaching you all day.
Sophomore,4,Hands on experience! Not just all lecture with no experience but labs and clubs t put you knowledge to work. Caring profs that help you succeed.
Freshman,4,Great College community with instructors that are experts in what they are teaching. Awesome hands on experience in labs
Senior,4,"What I like about Pennsylvania College of Technology is the amount of opportunities the school provides for you to succeed. Not only do they have numerous free tutors/facilities to obtain academic help, but they also organize and execute a Career Fair each semester where  dedicated they bring in employers from all over looking to fill 1000s of positions and 2-3 days are dedicated to encouraging students to associate and interview with employers."
Freshman,4,"A small college located in the city of Williamsport, Pennsylvania.  A very hands on, technical learning school with a 96% placement after graduation. A Penn State affiliate school with great chances in a job field. I highly recommend."
Freshman,4,"Pennsylvania College of Technology is a good school in a small town. The academics are exceptional and leave employers coming back year after year to recruit graduates. However there is not much to do around the town Williamsport meaning weekends can be boring if there aren’t any parties. As far as athletics go, there is not a football team or baseball team even though Penn College is a division 3 school. Although there aren’t many sports, there are a decent amount of clubs such as Baja SAE, ski and snowboard club and gamers guild."
Freshman,4,I’m learning so much about the have industry and the partnerships they have with the corporate world will help my fiture
Sophomore,4,"I love the hands on approach. For every hour of lecture there is three hours if lab. Teachers are very friendly and receptive. The only down side for having industry size equipment is the tuition bill to foot them. Diversity could also be improved, being in the heart of PA is a very white demographic."
Freshman,4,"This school is great every step of the way. As a non traditional student, I had lots of questions and barriers. Penn Tech helped me with everything and for a great price. Many majors are offered and leads to great diversity of students"
Alum,4,I have attended this college from Fall of 2010-Spring of 2013. Penn College or known as PCT is a beautiful campus. Large enough but perfect. The staff and student admins are amazing if you have any questions or concerns. There is always help somewhere. I can't wait to continue my education with PCT.
Junior,4,"The academic is very good. Penn College is not a place to have a college party. But if you are looking for a college to have a good education and do some hands on training before you go to the real world and practice your degree, than this a good for you. Students who graduate from Pennsylvania College of Technology have  opportunities with companies. Every year, the College brings different companies and have a career fair so students can explode different options and also complains they will like to work for. The College girl and boys soccer team is very good. Pennsylvania have good programs, such as nursing, Human Services, art and so on. The workers are good. When you have a hard time with a subject or failing it, there are places and team of people to help you pass the class. Overall, Pennsylvania College of Technology is good school."
Senior,4,"I applied here for the hands on technical education that Penn College promised, and they don't disappoint. I love the experienced faculty here. Great opportunities here as well like career fairs, job placement, study abroad, and graduate school relationships."
Freshman,4,"I had some issues with Financial Aid, but from what I hear its been an issue all over the state. My main issue was that I was never informed about the paperwork they needed, so I assumed everything was taken care of, then I get a bill for a late fee on my tuition. The college staff was very easy to work with and resolved this issue fairly easy and were very helpful in this process."
Freshman,4,Penn college is a very prestigious institution but they'll let anyone in. The acceptance rate is too high
Sophomore,4,The good qualities are the professors are accommodating especially since I'm a student-athlete.  One thing that I might change is maybe update some of the dorm rooms to make it more livable for some students
Freshman,4,I like the classroom setting where it’s small class size and able to talk to professor and get feedback.  The employment opportunities when you graduate are great for the money you are spending to attend.  The dorms are nice and good size depending what building you end up in.  The food is good and has a good variety of choices.  Have to be social to meet people because of smaller school.
Sophomore,4,I Like the education and how it provides you with the necessary skills to succeed in the job you choose. A lot of hands on job training and practice.
Freshman,4,"The biggest thing for me that I really like about the college is how they have everything that I'm looking for with lower prices than colleges that have similar majors.  They have construction management at Penn college, and it is more than half of the price for the same major at Pratt Institute.  Also, the guarantee for a job after college is really high, so I'm also happy about that."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the professors here they really know how to teach the classes. Being a hands on school we get a lot of lab time to work on labs. Also most professors have worked in the industry they  are teaching. This allows them to bring real world applications to the class room. Another nice thing is you can get two degrees in four years. They offer a variety of two plus two degrees.
Junior,4,"This college is beautiful and very historic. Buildings are scattered through the city of Williamsport giving you the feel of being a true student. Campus life is really pretty. The dorm rooms are very large and better than most I have seen. Yes, very pricey but worth it if you want the college feel. If you are just trying to get a degree, then maybe you could find a cheaper way to do so. Very good courses with great teachers and education oppurtunatieis."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere at the Pennsylvania College of Technology because it is a smaller campus and everyone, from students to professors, are so kind and caring every day. I have met so many wonderful people in my last few months here. I find it to be a very practical institution to study at because they are extremely devoted to giving you the best education in your field and providing hands-on training."
Niche User,4,"so far, everything I have seen I have liked. I have been on campus three times so far and have not been disappointed.   I am currently looking for off campus housing.  It would be nice if there was more housing options located closer to the earth science center.  It is nice that there is a bus line that runs from the main campus to the off site areas so in bad weather I can ride the bus instead of driving from campus to campus."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a transfer freshman studying Emergency Medicine at PCT. My experience has been very positive. I live in an apartment close to campus. Being at PCT truly is a great College because they offer so many different majors for real world jobs. I am studying to become a paramedic, but I know students who are becoming mechanics, construction management, nursing, radiology, and many more. This school offers so much!"
Freshman,4,"I love the more one-on-one setting between student and professor. It is very easy to reach out for help on this campus, whether it is personal or academic."
Sophomore,4,I love it here! It is a beautiful school kinda in a crappy area but that doesn't put a damper on your education. This school makes you feel so connected and welcome and the faculty is great and gets to know you and I enjoy having small classes here.
Niche User,4,"A friend of mine attends here and I constantly visit this school. The school has a beautiful campus with many restaurants nearby. From the stories I hear from my friend, the professors actually care. She needed help in a course and went to the professor and her professor was glad to help"
Sophomore,4,"Pennsylvania College of Technology is a great place and I really enjoy being a part of this college. There is almost always something fun going on, trips, carnivals, late night snacks for everyone, good food, and a bunch of pool tables for people to just chill in between or after classes. Health services, free counseling, fitness center, and just so much more that comes with being a student here. I have an 8 month old baby girl and a finance now and I love how Penn College hosts family friendly events such as Halloween parties, trick or treating, and Easter eggs hunts, you name it. It's great! All of the professors I've had were wonderful! They are so passionate about what they do. I highly recommend this school!!"
Junior,4,"It seems like a really good school for skills based learning. The teachers I have had for my major classes have been really awesome and knowledgeable, with helpful personal experience of the industry they worked in. It has the usual trappings of a college atmosphere/environment but it can be avoided.  There also seems to be great opportunities for adult learners to go herer and truly learn new skills."
Sophomore,4,"What I like most about Pennsylvania College of Technology is it offers free tutoring , and hires passionate instructors that are willing to help the student any way they can. What I would like to see changed in the college is the expensive prices on food products."
Junior,4,The advising at Pennsylvania College of Technology has excellent advising and great teachers. They make sure that you schedule for the correct classes in the correct amount of time.  The class sizes are small and are all in class rooms rather than big lecture halls.
Niche User,4,"The campus and housing are absolutely wonderful. The dorms are so nice. Unfortunately, the local area is not exciting and does not offer much fun on weekends and when you do not have class."
Sophomore,4,"Great education, crowded parties, some classes you don't need to take, and the girl to guy ratio is finally evening out more and more."
College Junior,4,So far it's been a very good experience all around
College Junior,4,There are a lot of opportunities here to get a job in your field and experience
College Junior,4,Technically I'm working towards getting into my major which I know is a rigorous program to begin with so I know that a lot of time will have to be dedicated to this program
College Junior,4,I've transferred here and so far I'm really enjoying the atmosphere of classes and how the professors are texting classes
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors have real world experience which they share.
College Sophomore,4,The welding engineering labs and equipment are first rate.
College Sophomore,4,It's been exactly what I was looking for.
College Junior,4,I was able to switch around my classes to fit with my work schedule.
College Senior,4,"I personally think I chose a great school to study my major at. There are a couple things that I would like to be made better. For example, the crime rate off campus it pretty high during the fall and spring semesters. I would feel safer if there were campus police who patrolled around. As far as academics go, I think I have learned so much and would not choose another school if I had the opportunity."
College Freshman,4,I have had no problems.
Senior,2,"I attended Pennsylvania College of Technology in the fall of 2016. My experience at this school is an authentic experience. The location of Penn Tech is in the city of Williamsport,pa which is a predominately  Caucasian  area. The school was not diverse at all due to it being a Tech school in the middle of Pennsylvania. The make up of the school was primarily white male who were very ignorant in understanding other peoples culture.The frustration I faced being a Haitian- American at Penn Tech is one of kind. The up side of attending Penn Tech is my amazing teacher in my Human Service program who cared about their student. These teachers are people who invest their time in their students and want the best for them. I am glad I encounter them my last year at Penn College."
College Junior,2,The cost is very high but it is hard to tell where our money is actually going.
College Senior,2,The student body is mostly adults whom go home at the end of the day and the rest of the student body are your typical country folk who like trucks and drinking.
College Senior,2,If you want classes where you do the minimum work and get a good grade these classes are for you.
College Senior,2,Extremely expensive for out of state students. Spending way more money than I needed to.
College Sophomore,2,"I have just been keeping to myself and trying to get back to Johnson and Wales University
"
College Sophomore,2,The kitchens are not up to par and do not provide the experience i am looking for.
College Sophomore,2,My school is very male dominate and and has a very week Greek life.  Along with other clubs.
College Sophomore,2,It is very expensive to go to the school.  You need to be dedicated and willing to graduate.
College Sophomore,2,I don't believe we have much of a student body at all. this school is so diverse with our majors that there tends to be a lot of cliques with whoever you have most of your classes with. In addition PCT has a lot of non-traditional students so a good majority of students do not even live on campus.
College Senior,2,"My program was less than 4 years old when I started, so I felt like the school was using the students for experimentation to see what about the program worked and didn't. This, I felt, affected the education I was receiving. As I said previously, some of the staff haven't been on the floor in years and some of them have different levels of teaching degrees (some earned their teaching credentials with a 2 credit class)."
College Senior,2,"With being in the nursing program, we are stressed to learn the most up-to-date information. However, there certain nursing professors who haven't practiced bedside nursing in over 5 years, some almost 10 years. Luckily, there are a small few professors who have a passion, which makes it enjoyable to learn."
College Freshman,2,Community College – I feel like the education I am getting is from a community college. They do not give out enough financial aid for this school & they rip off the health students majorly.
College Junior,2,"College Is Costly – The cost of my education is cheaper then most of the other branches of the Penn State affiliated schools. Even though,my college is cheaper than others that are affiliated with it, I still need money to pay for my tuition. I think the cost is a bit high for my budget."
College Freshman,2,Good but Bad – Great School with a great learning atmosphere but the guy to girl ratio is probably an 8 to 1. It sucks being a guy cuz all the girls are taken. It has a great program so come to learn. Not for a relationship
Niche User,2,"This school is awful. This school is awful. If you think ""pimping out"" your truck is a cool idea and you enjoy wearing camo outside of hunting season, then you belong here. The majors are awful (construction, carpentry?)–do something better with your life. I'm going here to get my GS done and transfer to a reputable college where I can actually find a job outside of hick towns and earn six figures. Sorry to be rude, but use your 2 to 4 years wisely and go somewhere half-decent. Penn Tech, Degrees that [just] work! The professors are either stupid or brilliant (but only a handful). We have a sociology professor teaching philosophy and sociology professor also teaching psychology. Professors are supposed to profess, not teach. Some of them actually read from the book and they are generally uneducated. Williamsport is crime-ridden, dirty, and absolutely boring–you'll understand when you get here. The view from one of my classes is a burnt-down laundromat. Parking sucks as well and muggings constantly occur in the parking lots in the fall and spring. Penn Tech also does not offer ""internal"" financial aid; you have to just rely on government aid, which is extremely inadequate. On average, you get $100 off a credit (for $400 credits). Again, save your money, save your time, save your life, and go somewhere and make something of yourself. Don't look at the college's ""looks,"" look at the academics."
College Junior,2,"Tuition is decently high at college. It is very difficult to get financial aid because it is all based on FAFSA, including scholarships. In my specific case, I cannot get financial aid or any support from FAFSA, my family, nor the college."
Sophomore,1,"This college is not made for online learning and that was shown clearly to be the case during covid 19. The classes are supposed to be hands on to aid with learning, so it is hard to learn hands on information from online classes."
Freshman,1,if your racist as hell and hate diversity country and come on by!  They take only take in white folks so beware of that.
College Senior,1,"Ive gotten hardly any aid for the administration doesn't have there stuff together. And in every class they are trying to sell a product or get you to buy into another ""quick degree""."
College Senior,1,"Most of the work i have been shown are, things i would have hoped the students should have known before attending."
College Senior,1,"A lot of rude, obnoxious people. Lots of smokers that don't have any sense of common courtesy."
College Sophomore,1,I do not like their printing system at all it is unorganized and i do not like that i only have a 1000 sheets to use a semester.

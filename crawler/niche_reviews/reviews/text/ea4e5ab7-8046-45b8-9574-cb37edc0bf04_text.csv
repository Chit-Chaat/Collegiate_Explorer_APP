I was at a community college that told me I shouldn’t be a nurse, a school that told me I wasn’t good enough, a school that discouraged me. After being told these things I transferred to Mercy College and was accepted into their ASN nursing program. From the first day at Mercy I felt like I was home. I am surrounded by supportive staff and the most amazing fellow students.

The curriculum and course work is tough, but it's not impossible. As a student myself, I find the staff I encounter always are more than willing to work with you and help you succeed. When registering for classes the advisors are always very clear and extremely willing to guide you down the path of success."
College Sophomore,5,"Teaching healthcare is the main goal of Mercy College of Ohio.  With nursing, Mercy has given its students a plethora of resources to learn from.  From the skills lab, to the different clinical sites, Mercy gives their students a very good opportunity to learn.  On top of that, the professors and instructors are very knowledgeable, many whom have specialized in a field of nursing.  "

College Junior,5,The fact that the library/computer lab is open 24/7 helps me out tremendously!
College Junior,5,I really enjoy this school. I have attended 2 other colleges and feel that this one suits my needs the best. The commute is about 15 minutes for me and the hospital has a library/computer lab available 24/7. The teaching staff is wonderful and are readily available to meet with students if needed.
College Junior,5,They were straight forward with the cost of my attendance at mercy.  I'm a non-tradtional student who has reached my education limit and i must figure out a way to pay for the rest of my semesters.  Perkins loans dont apply for the youngstown campus and i recently lost my job of 20 years in January.
College Junior,5,"The computer lab i use is in the library and printing is free, with plenty of computers to use so there is no waiting."
College Junior,5,i attend the Youngstown facility we have assess to the library  24 hours.  Lab is open for as long as needed to practice skills.
College Junior,5,The faculty go out of there way to help you.  Very different than the traditional College that i attended due to the one on one interaction.
Sophomore,4,Mercy college really cares about their students' education. They give you all the resources that you could ever need to be successful.
Junior,4,"I just started here at Mercy College of Ohio in Youngstown, Ohio and so far I love it. It's very fast paced however the information they give and the amount of different resources we have to help up with the many different challenges of trying to become a nurse help make nursing a more obtainable career choice. From the beginning we are given practice questions which are worded in a way that our questions will be worded on the NCLEX. I love my school and I am excited to become an RN through them."
Junior,4,Mercy College of Ohio has a great Nursing program. Class sizes are small and the Professor are great!
Freshman,4,Currently I have enjoyed my time here at Mercy. The teachers are very hands on and eager to help you when it’s needed.

College Freshman,4,"I am going for my BSMI, bachelor of Science in Medical Imaging"
College Freshman,4,"I am in the Radiology program and the teachers are there with me all the way. They help in the lab, the clinicals, etc. The workload is not as much as one might think. Yes, it might be a little stressful but that's school and to prepare us for the medical field."
College Senior,4,"For the most part, the professors I came across were willing to help and go out of their way for students. I never utilized tutoring services, but I heard they were helpful from other students. In particular, the program I took I felt the director wanted our opinion on how to improve the program but never took the advice from their students which led to its failure. Generally, I have enjoyed my time at Mercy and the majority of staff and professors are willing to help in anyway necessary."
College Senior,4,Staff is always willing to help you succeed.
College Senior,4,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Mercy."
College Junior,4,Transferring credits into Mercy was very easy. They accepted most of my credits and helped me a great deal putting them towards my pre requisite classes for my program.
College Junior,4,"We have been talked to by many of the staff members willing to help us prepare for a career. We have advisors that help us make resumes and have information on job leads. There have been job fairs held at the school, but I have not attended any yet."
College Junior,4,"My classes have been wonderful. I have mainly taken nursing classes which content is directly geared toward the nursing career. I like that the classes have been broken up between two instructors. One instructor teaches one content, then we would test on that content and then we would be taught by the other instructor another topic and then test on that. The two instructors went back and fourth like that and I think it helped keep the classes interesting. I also enjoy having a lecture class and a clinical class. I think it is very helpful to have one hands on class and another book content class. Clinical setting classes are nice because you have a smaller group, whereas in the lecture portion there is a large amount of students to compete with for attention."
College Junior,4,"I thoroughly enjoy being a nursing student. It is very hard work, but extremely rewarding. I enjoy the skills lab where we can practice new skills that we are taught. I also enjoy working in the clinical setting. I think it is extremely helpful to be able to work side by side with actual nurses and patients to gain knowledge and experience."
College Junior,4,The professors are wonderful. They are helpful and very knowledgeable. I really like the tutors that are offered as a service to the students free of charge.
College Sophomore,4,classes offered morning afternoon and nights which is great but if you have to retake a class you have to wait a whole year which is super inconvenient
College Sophomore,4,ive heard a lot of great things and seen friends get jobs easilly. ive heard that mercy students are hired in the areas health care before other schools.
College Sophomore,4,I see a lot of success in this area at the school.
College Sophomore,4,The nursing program is super challenging. People drop out like flies. Like any other nursing program you have a pretty heavy workload. facilities are currently being updated which is much needed. The professional building definitely needs updates.
College Sophomore,4,Classes have very different times for the people who need different hours.
College Sophomore,4,The online programs are very helpful and easy to use.
College Sophomore,4,The professors and staff are wonderful and really want to see you succeed. People are there to help us find jobs and make sure everything looks good for us.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are really there to help you succeed. They want everyone to do well and are able to help you out when you need it.
College Sophomore,4,"The Radiology program is a lot of work, but very rewarding. We have learned so much and it makes me excited to be out on the field actually doing xrays."
College Sophomore,4,I really like how driven we are as a school to produce people that actually know what they are doing in the Health care field. Small classes and the teachers are helpful and really get to know you. Free food whenever there are events that involve students.
College Senior,4,Mercy College has great professors that really care and want their students to succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"mixture of age groups, mostly female"
College Junior,4,I was a transfer student from Owens Community College when I first attended Mercy College and the process of transferring credits was fairly easy and accommodating. Working with my advisor really helped and still helps when I need to work around my outside life and school.
College Junior,4,"Although I have only taken two online courses, it was a great experience. My professors were always quick to respond to any questions I had about the work and quick to post grades so I knew how I was doing. When needed, my fellow peers were also quick to respond to emails and questions. It was an overall good experience with online classes."
College Junior,4,Mercy College has great resources. The library is open during hours that have always been convenient for me. The computer labs and tutors are also available when needed and it makes it so much less stressful for my studies.
College Junior,4,"There is always something going on in the student life that students can be involved in. It brings everyone together in a positive way. Also, in some classes, there are trips across seas that really bring people together that I haven't seen done on other colleges."
College Junior,4,I'm thrilled I made the decision to transfer to Mercy College! It was the best decision I've made when it comes to my education and future. The professors are great and always enthused to see their students succeed.
College Junior,4,"I just recently got into my program of study, so I cannot say how the program load is just yet. However, the work load I've endured this far has been great. I've been able to manage my classes and time wisely and had been successful in my course work."
College Sophomore,4,I get to go to hospitals and get clinical experience
College Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience at Mercy College is very good.  It challenges me to strive for my best and gives me the resources to unlock my best.  The professors are always approachable and willing to talk to you on just about anything, not just the their subject.  The clinical experience is also very good.  "
College Sophomore,4,The online courses at Mercy are very topic based.  Many time the professor will post a topic and you are required to reply to the topic and comment on two other student topics.  The nice thing is that the professor will partake in these discussions and giver their opinion.  
College Sophomore,4,"The career services at Mercy College are very good.  For each graduating class, they bring in someone to look over your resume and teach you how to approach interviews.  Since Mercy College of Ohio is affiliated with Mercy Health Systems, this gives the students a place to start looking for jobs."
College Sophomore,4,"The typical student at Mercy College is that of the non-traditional type.  Most of the students at Mercy work a minimal of part-time with some who work full-time hours.  There are a lot of students who have families.  I would say that the diversity of Mercy is predominately Caucasian females, but every year Mercy becomes more and more divers as they reach out further than the Toledo area."
College Sophomore,4,I really think the best aspect of this school is the learning environment.  Everyone at Mercy is there to learn.  There are very little distraction.  The faculty are very knowledgeable in their fields and are always willing to help you.  
College Sophomore,4,"The student resources at Mercy are very good.  The only thing that is lacking at Mercy is an athletic center.  Other than that, the library is very nice, which is run by a staff that is knowledgeable in helping you find what you need for a research paper/project.  There is a lot of support at Mercy, from to the Campus Ministry to career help."
College Sophomore,4,"The computer network is very good and dependable.  The only downfall at Mercy is the computers themselves which are a litter outdated.  For me, I always have my laptop and being that the WiFi is very dependable, I really don't have a problem."
College Sophomore,4,"The programs are mainly related to healthcare, therefore the different degree programs are geared toward a specific field of healthcare.  There are a lot of different electives at Mercy, both degree related and non-degree related.  The only downfall at Mercy is that they do not offer many degree minors."
College Senior,4,"I have not had a problem with the printing, computers, etc."
College Senior,4,"The college provides various avenues to help the students during their time at the college.  They have an excellent Student Success Center which allows you to study, seek tutoring, and career placement and advancement.  The library staff is very knowledgeable for its small size but can compete with any major college/university large-scale library.  It offers a counselor and Campus Ministry."
College Senior,4,"The small classes, family atmosphere, location, newly updated Student Lounge and HIT (Health Information Technology) computer lab and classrooms."
College Junior,4,"The small school size makes for students who really want to learn, which makes for a great environment."
College Senior,4,Our career coordinator is continually posting job openings and assisting us with access to outside resources to obtain jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"nursing is my major. It is a hard coarse load, but they are so helpfull and positive. Always there to lend a hand or a pat on the back."
College Sophomore,4,they help you decide what class load you can handle soo thet you are successful.
College Sophomore,4,so far everyone has been so helpful and supportive.
College Senior,4,"The financial aid people are very easy to work with.  When I exhausted my federal options, the school told me about an institutional loan that is very reasonable.  I would much rather pay the school directly than deal with a bank."
College Senior,4,The HIT field is becoming very important in healthcare today.  President Obama has spoken about transitioning to electronic health records and the cost savings to be had for the entire field.  Mercy has a very robust HIT program and is very concerned that everyone is comprehending the material to be ready for the real world.  The curriculum is always being evaluated for relavancy and the workload reflects what would be expected of us in a job.
College Senior,4,The HIT program has been evaluated and approved by AHIMA.  The courses are constantly evaluated by the school and sometimes change to be more relavant to the real-world.
College Junior,4,Email them if you need any assistance they will easily help you out. All the forms are online for you to print out and them submit. It makes your life so much easier then waiting in a long line. Everyone there is eager to help you. The education is worth the money.. it is all information I need to know for my career.
College Senior,4,They are very hard-working and always pushing towards imporving. They are always concerned about help the students to do better and the best they can. They continue to help students strive and prepare for our future careers.
College Senior,4,"Mercy College has a big workload for the ASN program. We have way more clinical hours than other schools and I feel they prepare you really well for your boards. The campus is nice and small so you really get to know everyone around you. Parking is easy and convienient and is never an issue. Program is much tougher here than at other schools, which is a bonus although many complain about. Thats what makes the school good, you are getting a good education."
College Senior,4,Mercy College is a small school and there is always help for students in the skills lab or with the tutors. The instructors are great and real knowledgeable. The nursing program is one of the hardest around though. It really keeps you on your toes. It is hard to get into a clinical day that you prefer unless you sign up at exactly 8am if registration begins at 8. There is a very high percentage rate of graduates that pass the NCLEX. Mercy is a great school to graduate from and graduates get jobs easier when graduating from here.
College Junior,4,"Everyone that I have talked to is extremely nice, including the upper classman. The students all seem eager to help each other out with any problems and with studying. If a student is absent other students are generous enough to share their notes."
College Senior,4,"I'm a nursing major and the topic of my classes change every semester. All of the classes that I have to take are related to my major. The workload is a lot and it is challenging. Mercy does have opportunities for students to work in the hospital or skills lab and I've heard that after graduation, mercy hospitals tend to hire mercy students."
College Junior,4,"This is not a party school. Many students are there to get their degrees. We are a healthcare campus, which means that our behavior is closely scrutinized. However, we do have fun. We joke about study guides and flash cards being our weekend getaways from having to do care plans and other such things. 

However, the student body is very non judgemental. We are all accepting of one another, and there are very few students here that will make you feel unwelcome. Even then, it's usually because the student is uncomfortable with you and they don't want any trouble."
College Sophomore,2,no student center or activities
College Senior,2,"Some instructors seem more interested in their text messaging during clinical hours, while others are extremely helpful and professional, and some are very demeaning towards students, and can be very rude and unprofessional at times!!"
College Senior,2,"Overall outside of my specific major, the school is awesome; however, in our major, there are some instructors who are very demeaning and very unprofessional."
College Junior,2,"Student Center Outdated – Our student center is in need of some major help. The computers are very outdated and only have three of them in the lab, usually only one works though. There are not many places to sit. There is a mini kitchen with a fridge but usually it is gross because people do not pick up after themselves."
College Junior,2,Printing Is Outrageous – The printers are linked to a card where you have to load money on the card in order to print documents off and it is 10 cents per page.
College Senior,2,I think that the tuition is very reasonable compared to other colleges and universities. Mercy College does not have out of state fees and I really appreciate that. It does however take the financial aid a long time to give the students back their refund checks and we need those asap
Freshman,1,"Blood sucking liberal vampires. I took an online lab because of Covid and had a lot of trouble with the format. The professor was not nice either & it sounded like other students had a lot of problems. I filed an appeal to get a refund due to the circumstances & waited months to hear back. I sent an email that if they didn't give me a refund, I was going to picket. I'm working & paying out of pocket and wanted to retake the lab that was never designed for an online format again in a later semester. THE NEXT DAY they emailed me and said they would not refund my money out of spite. I have a 3.8 GPA and a bachelors degree from 2018. My mom is a single mother, disabled veteran, and a nurse of 25 years in the local community (not that it matters per se). If you were looking for a Conservative, to send your kids to, look elsewhere. Lofty beaurocrats that will screw with your kids. My advisor also talked down to me everytime I had to see her. Also, a lot of mind numbing tech that never works"

Senior,1,Youngstown campus is literally a joke. Very expensive. All they want is your money. Teachers are absolutely rude and have their favorites. The way they teach is reading from power points-then at test time it’s nothing off the power points. They expect you to teach yourself. Clinical  s are even worse...they give you a patient and throw you to the wolves. They just expect you to know what to do. Staff there at the hospital are horrible!!!! So rude and so inconsiderate. I hate this place! Go to Eastern Gateway or try your luck going to YSU. Don’t even waste your time here!
Graduate Student,1,"The nursing staff is very condescending and lack compassion towards their students. The entire process of grading exams, providing exam material that is actually tested on (not just using test bank questions) and providing a positive environment for students to exceed in is poor. Mercy only cares about receiving your tuition money, not helping their students have a successful future."

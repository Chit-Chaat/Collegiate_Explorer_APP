Junior,5,"I am currently taking online classes and I don't find them to be challenging; however, you really need to stay on top of things."
Junior,5,Being at California State University Long Beach has so far been a pleasure. I really love how friendly the campus is. The professors have all been really amazing and caring. I am glad I chose this University.
Alum,5,The Beach has one of the best learning environments I've ever been a part of. It has the feel and vibe of a beach town but the coursework and professors remain very professional and rigorous.
Alum,5,I only used a few features online but it was only for submitting coursework and not for instruction.
Sophomore,5,"For my first year at CSULB,  I had a great time and loved the campus although there is a lot of walking from lower campus to upper campus. Its a big school with some bomb food at The Nugget and the Outpost which is delicious.  Going to school here is fun and I really love it. Many clubs, fraternity and sororities you can join and there is a game are where you can play. Its a cool place."
Junior,5,professors were understanding that online is not the same for everyone and they check in on you typically. They still do their best to bring that live classroom setting and translate that for online classes
Junior,5,"Helpful and friendly advisors for your academic journey.
Professors that attend office hours and are willing to help you beyond the classroom
Variety of food choices for buying food there
convenient food stands for quick snacks 
plenty of open space in the fields outside
library space is always nice tidy and there's usually some space you can find to study alone or with other people"
Junior,5,Most of my professors have been very kind and understanding with everything going on. I also appreciate how the school has been giving us regular updates on the status of online/ in-person learning.
Junior,5,I have had such a positive experience at CSULB and I love how there are so many student resources available for us.
Senior,5,"California State Long Beach is full of attentive, patient professors and students who are all willing to help you navigate through college. The facilities such as the library and the REC center are also great and add to students' college experiences."
Alum,5,Great Campus! Great Social Environment and proximity to the beach! The school continues to get better every year and it's very affordable!
Freshman,5,I love attending here because they help us and offer many different resources for everyone. I also love how understanding teachers are and how they try thier best in encourgaing every student.
Freshman,5,I like how teachers help a lot and make plenty of their time to office hours so that everyone can get the help they need.
Alum,5,"My last semester we were transferred online due to covid. It was a bit messy at first because it was all new, but my professors made it work. Unfortunately online translates into more work and I found that part difficult to manage. I believe they were able to discuss better homework loads the next semester."
Alum,5,"I loved my time here at CSULB! The campus is large and beautiful. Everyone is welcomed here and I love that people are free to express who they are with confidence. There are many resources and facilities available to the students. During the busy times of the semester, it can be hard to find places to sit and study, but the beautiful weather all year round allows for some time on the grass under a shady tree. The staff on campus are more than willing to help you with what you need and I always felt that I had options. My recommendation for improvement would be more outdoor seating areas and more accessible ways for people to get around campus as there are lots of hills and stairs which can make getting to and from classes on opposite sides of campus difficult."
Junior,5,"I love the diversity at long beach. My professors have been great, very knowledgeable as well as approachable.  I enjoy the campus and all around college experience."
Freshman,5,shdjdjdjxiciicjxndne em i j j i i i j h g g g g g g n me e. wuxi i i i. us. wei oops my bad i didn’t feel like typing.
Senior,5,"California State University, Long Beach is awesome. I have had nothing but good experiences with the Communication Studies Department. I have also had good experiences with academic counseling and the financial aid office, though sometimes they get understandably busy and you're not able to see them for over a week. Overall though I have had a lot of support from my major department and they’re so wonderful. CSULB has a beautiful campus with really cool resources that people should take more advantage of—the gym, the health center, bowling, movies, multiple tutoring centers for different subjects, clubs, etc. College is what you make it—there is something for everyone at CSULB as long as you seek out those opportunities."
Sophomore,5,Very diverse campus with gender neutral bathrooms. I had the best year of my life at this school. Pokemon Go is also a big part of my experience at CSULB.
Junior,5,CSULB lets you find out who you are as a person. CSULB creates a home feeling as every student is united together. At CSULB we're one beach!
Junior,5,I wish I could just build a house on the campus and live there forever. I love Long Beach so much! That's why I applied there for grad school.
Graduate Student,5,"Overall, CSULB is a great school. Students have always been friendly and welcoming. The professors at CSULB are dedicated to the education of their students and are always willing to help. The only negative aspect of CSULB is the location of student parking. Most parking lots are at a 15 minute walk from classrooms. Students must plan accordingly to arrive on time to classes."
Graduate Student,5,Most of my education at CSULB was on campus. I did take a few online courses. The online courses are manageable and easy to follow. Most online courses i have taken do rely heavily on discussions online via BeachBoard.
Sophomore,5,"I like the environment of the campus and how everything you see is green, taking care of the campus is a big thing. They have plenty of space around for students to get comfortable and take a nap or grab a bite to eat. It seems so much more open compared to a lot of cal state campuses."
Junior,5,"I love that at CSULB I am taught by professors who really care about my education and who push me to succeed on a daily basis. I also enjoy all the academic resources, such as the University Library and the 24 hour study place in the student union, as well as the extracurricular resources, such as the bowling alley in the student union and the Student Recreation and Wellness Center, just to name a few! Lastly, CSULB has amazing psychological counseling services available to students everyday, who make the transition to college as well as overcoming the common college obstacles so much easier to tackle."
Junior,5,"At CSULB, I took all five of my classes during the spring 2020 semester and one class during the summer 2020 semester online. I felt like all of my professors were extremely knowledgable on how to seamlessly conduct lectures at our usual lecture times. They made sure to hold office hours over zoom so that students could communicate with the professor about any issues or questions about the class. The professors also used technology like Respondus Lockdown Browser and zoom to administer exams to prevent any incidents of academic dishonesty."
Junior,5,It is an extremely diverse campus with an engaging staff. You feel cared about and heard here as a student.
Junior,5,Online experience is mandatory at the moment due to current circumstances but nonetheless a rewarding experience and better platform than used at my previous school I transferred from.
Freshman,5,Well its my first year going to the University but the times I've been involved I have always had fun and everyone of the staff are very supportive They are ready to help you at anytime. I remember I had to turn in paper work and I emailed on of the staff and they got it done in no time.
Sophomore,5,My overall experience here as a freshman has been positive. Professors are really engaging and there is a really good support system for any help you need.
Freshman,5,"The people I have met at California State University- Long Beach, the environment as well as campus life everything about this school made me want to come here as a high school graduate."
Junior,5,"I love this campus due to many reasons. The classrooms often always undergo some sort of improvement that helps students out. The diversity is also great in CSU Long Beach. You will never be left out, there is always somewhere to fit. As for the location, the weather is perfect and you can also see the beach from the library. I am glad I decided to go to this school."
Sophomore,5,"It is a beautiful place to study at, the campus is amazing and the weather is very pleasant. Really good for business and Marine biology majors."
Sophomore,5,"Learning online is not my thing, but I tried one of the classes and it was good. The experience is not as good as in class since you can interact with other students as much but it does the job of completing the class."
Senior,5,"I enjoy my academic learning as well social life in this university! There is so much diversity and cultural heritage that outlasts importance of both the students' community as well the upbringings they share. The people that I have encountered are friendly and welcoming, especially if there is an event going on."
Alum,5,The campus activity is incredible. There are a lot of vendors  every week. The food is delicious and there are many events to help you network with other students. You can also see movies for free with your student ID! Professors are often open to mentoring you and are usually happy to see you during office hours.
Sophomore,5,"Very good, I was able to learn at my own pace. If professor saw me struggling they would not hesitate to message me and question me."
Sophomore,5,"Very good professors that really take the time to explain, very open campus. Quite helpful to undocumented students, as well as students in need of financial aid."
Sophomore,5,"Attending my first year at CSULB has been a treat. It is a very beautiful campus with kind and helpful peers. There are many resources to get help like the student center to get free tutoring. As well as many places to just relax and gather with friends like the recreational room or the horn center. Above all that however, stands the educational part of this campus and the professors all have the best intentions for their students. They provide great teaching lectures and allow questions anytime that is appropriate. This not only includes the lecture halls, but the classrooms also have great collaborative conversation opportunities as well as personal time to speak with professors in those classrooms. My first year has been great at CSULB because of all these factors, however due to COVID-19 majority of the second semester was online."
Freshman,5,The overall college experience is something incredible and helpful to all that choose to attend this school. They are also open to helping their students with any problem they seem to have.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the high diversity and the open mindedness of those who attend. The school allows its student to gain confidence in themselves and gain success at their own pace.
Graduate Student,5,Many of the staff that I've come across are very helpful and educated in their field. They are willing to help and are very transparent. I've never encountered any problems and instead faced very useful information that has and will help me for my remainder time at CSULB.
Graduate Student,5,I am currently taking an online course that has been very transparent. Everything needed for the course was posted a week ahead. The professor has made himself very available to his students and understands how online courses might not be the best for everyone.
Senior,5,Their freshman orientation provided an overview of what the college experience will be like. They were informative about the resources that are offered on campus. They provide a variety of student services from tutoring to health services. Professors are very passionate about what they teach.
Senior,5,"Online courses allows for students to have flexibility with their schedule. Personally, online courses have been good so far in terms of the professors being clear about the course material and deadlines."
Senior,5,I do not like online courses because there is no interaction between professor and student. Engineering students need to do lab work either through simulation or projects at actual on site class work.
Senior,5,"CSULB has a great engineering program for electrical engineering. It offers the subfields of communication, control systems, digital systems, electronics."
Sophomore,5,The campus is big and there’s so many free activities you can participate and get a break from work . All my professors have been very understanding & easy to talk to . The gym is always kept super clean and neat .
Alum,5,Attending Cal State Long Beach has been a wonderful experience for me. I was able to grow as a student and as a person. CSULB offers many opportunities for its students.
Alum,5,"During this time where most classes have switched to online format, it can be difficult to get used to for many students and professors. At CSULB, the faculty has worked tirelessly to ensure that students and professors transitions from face-to-face to virtual classrooms as smooth as possible. Good job!"
Sophomore,5,My online experience with CSULB has been very good so far. They make it easy to transfer face to face classes to virtual meetings. They provided many resources for the students in case they don't have supplies like laptop and give a long time for students to get adjusted at home. They made us feel supported when living the dorms and told the professors to understand our sinceraio with COVID-19. It was nice because I didn't feel stressed out like other students when taking 4 courses. I liked the system they created where teachers can upload lecture videos and audio recordings as if everything is normal. It made learning easier and I enjoyed the Zoom meetings for some of my classes. I still got somewhat of the discussion and college experience that made it feel less like an online class. It was nice being able to participate with my classmates and professors.
Alum,5,I've only had a handful of online classes but from what I remember they were pretty seamless. Everything seemed to flow and professors were always readily available if there were any errors or if questions arose.
Alum,5,"Honestly my four years at CSULB were probably the best four years of my life. I was a Kinesiology: Exercise Science major and all the professors were genuinely invested and loved what they were doing. In turn, that made our learning experience that much more exciting. I lived in a LLC (living learning community) dorm my first year where I was paired with individuals that were also studying the same/similar major as me. That was amazing within itself and it's where I made many long term friends."
Alum,5,"Long Beach is a wonderful university with an amazing campus. In my time there, it was a second home (although, in all honesty, some days I did spend more time there than at my actual home!) The school has been around for 70 years and has gone through a lot of changes. The campus has a phenomenal library, a great computer lab (the Horn Center), and dozens of areas to relax or study. The activities planned during both Week of Welcome and finals week are very appreciated.

I would like to see some of the buildings get updated. While I'm sure that those changes are gradual and admittedly not cheap, there are several buildings that boast updated technology that should be more widely available and evenly dispersed throughout the campus. Additionally, I would love to see an increase in professors of color. I'm told that Long Beach has a top-ranked Africana Studies program and a higher demographic of students of color. Even so, more representation is always a good thing."
Freshman,5,"Luckily, I had teachers who were extremely good at communicating with their students. For example, my Korean language teacher, Professor Lee, already had most of her stuff online, so it was a quick switch with no complications. All of my teachers did a good job actually. All my classes I took in person and we all switched to online pretty swiftly."
Freshman,5,"This was a school that made me up my confidence, skills, and social circle. It is something I never thought would happen, but would."
Junior,5,"Great support from faculty, enrollment services department is very responsive. Flexible class times and safe environment."
Senior,5,Online classes due to COVID-19 in 2020. Online classes were really easy to manage as well and no need to drive anywhere. Online zoom conference were a bit annoying when scheduled but for those professor who recorded the lecture then posted it later were the true heros. Allowing you to see assignments and quizes in advanced prepared you  more than a syllabus.
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful and inviting to the entire community. There are various resources available and offered to students. Not to mention the staff is incredibly helpful and genuine.  I would highly recommend visiting the Japanese Garden and art exhibit if and when you or know someone that needs a breather.
Junior,5,Online experience at CSULB has been going well. During the pandemic professors really tried and reached out to connect personally with their students. In fact most to all of my professors were so flexible during the online classes some assignments were even dropped. The professors genuinely care about their students and their success.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and definitely a workout to get from one end to the other. I also enjoy eating at the on-campus restaurants/pubs, they have really tasty food."
Sophomore,4,I like the campus and professors at CSULB. The restaurants near campus are great and there are many amazing professors teaching on campus.
Sophomore,4,Currently taking classes online because of covid. CSULB is doing its best to ensure the quality of our education remains and that we all stay safe.
Freshman,4,Classes online can be difficult since we spend 3-4 hours looking at a screen all day but my classes at CSULB make it very engaging for me to work.
Freshman,4,"Overall, CSULB has been very welcoming as I transitioned from Cabrillo High School to CSULB. They have been very clear and open for me."
Junior,4,"My experience with online classes has been a little stressful. I am used to having the in person experience, I feel like I have not learned as much as I wanted too... other than that though, the professors have been very understanding and helpful."
Senior,4,CSULB has done a great job in providing students from various backgrounds with resources but would definitely like to see more diversity on campus.
Alum,4,"All my classes were on campus, but professors used online tools to enhance the learning experience. It's what you would expect at all universities."
Niche User,4,It was a great experience nice campus and great faculty the city of Long Beach is great and the overall take on the college is one I would recommend to anyone
Junior,4,"My online experience at CSULB has been good so far. I'm a transfer student so adjusting to the atmosphere of the school has been a challenge since COVID-19. I planned on staying in the dorms there but since the pandemic, I have been confined to my home in Northern California, learning virtually. The process so far has been handled pretty well, as professors have been available for a lot of students due to most in-person classes being unavailable."
Junior,4,"[My experience at CSULB has been good as of now. Being a transfer student has opened my mind about a new campus and its environment compared to my previous college, CSUEB. In CSULB, there are a lot of virtual opportunities that the school offers. Zoom is the go-to for all events so although the process is quite unique and frustrating, the administration is being as professional as it can get. The main reason I went to CSULB is the vast majority of majors as well as their great reviews and its diversity. The location, near center Los Angeles, made my decision even better since there are a lot of opportunities to achieve."
Freshman,4,Learning online wasn't much of a hassle and I adapted to it very quickly. There were a few complications with technical issues however but it was resolved.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman in college, it is okay so far and nothing out of the ordinary. I got into the groove of things pretty quickly."
Alum,4,I took couple classes online. The professors were always available and had zoom meetings to meet up with students for office hours.
Alum,4,"I had amazing professors, who were very invested into their students. Campus is big and nice. If you want decent education with no loans, come here!"
Graduate Student,4,I have had a lot of opportunity within the psychology major. The campus is beautiful and I have been met with welcoming faculty and staff. Parking however is terrible and some students complain of a largely commuter vibe.
Graduate Student,4,Teachers are doing the best with what they have been given. It is not ideal but it is what we have to deal with.
Junior,4,I like the campus. It is very big and pretty. The campus is a bit of a walk you will easily get lost if you don't know where you are going.
Senior,4,"With COVID, last semester professors had to switch online. This upcoming Fall 2020 semester is now fully online as well. I applaud CSULB for making this decision early on and sticking to it; now we’re seeing many schools that tried to reopen with in-person classes have COVID outbreaks, and I’m glad that CSULB will not be one of them. It shows they take campus health seriously. Last semester was understandably a huge change, but the majority of my professors translated their courses pretty smoothly to an online format. Even with the two professors who didn’t, I was still able to learn and succeed—and I didn’t blame them for not being fully prepared, because nobody expected this to happen. The next semester hasn’t started yet but I have already seen some professors posting their courses online and it already looks much more prepared and seamless. Thank you Long Beach for taking the health of your students seriously and not re-opening with in-person classes this semester."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful, and has an abundance of resources. The African American community is a bit on the smaller side. Advising could be improved."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience here at Long Beach State University is quite interesting, but we definitely have improved since moving to remote learning. I am sure the teachers and staff will adjust just fine, and we will have a great experience in such uncharted territory."
Sophomore,4,"I did take classes online and for the sudden turn of events with COVID-19, I think that my teachers did as well as they could considering the circumstances."
Freshman,4,It's been great even thought I don't like online I rather be in person but I have had a great experience doing stuff online its different because you can't really connect with your classmates.
Freshman,4,There was some difficulty starting off but as the year progressed everyone got into the swing of things and I passed the year with a great GPA.
Junior,4,"I have been taking all of my classes in person but ever since the Covid-19 outbreak all of my classes had switched to online. The change wasn't hard though, in our student portal we have zoom linked into our accounts so instead of our class time being in person, the teach would provide us with a link and we had to be there on time and ready for class. Online learning was a challenge however the good part about it was that my professors would sometimes upload their powerpoint slides and the recorded lecture so the students were able to look over past lectures if we ever needed to review something difficult."
Alum,4,"Transitioning to all online instruction was a smooth process. There were no hiccups, for me at least. My professor had us test out zoom before online began to fix any problems. Once classes resumed, it was like a regular class just through a screen, which was excellent, in my opinion. I would have to say that I commend the university for its quick reaction to the adversity we all faced and thank them for letting me finish my last semester on a somewhat good note considering the circumstances."
Alum,4,"Online classes are okay if you are able to successfully manage your time. Often, there are discussion posts to engage in weekly. Office hours with professors are then held on zoom. If you are someone who does better with in-person classes, it may be harder. They're good if your schedule is hectic."
Freshman,4,The professors are extremely helpful during online instruction. They are very understanding and are always happy to assist their students if there is any confusion pertaining to coursework.
Freshman,4,The learning environment at CSULB is very pleasant and the campus is rather resourceful. The librarian staffs are extremely helpful if one ever needs to gather sources for their studies and projects.
Senior,4,"I have taken several online classes at California State University, Long Beach. As long as the professor is prepared and you are on top of assignments, everything is great! Especially a good choice when there is a need to balance school and work."
Senior,4,"California State University, Long Beach offers a wide variety of majors that allows students to figure out exactly what is the best choice for them. The campus is very large and always as something going on within it."
Alum,4,"CSULB is known as a good bang for your buck type university. It was a great experience, and a good education."
Sophomore,4,"Online was pretty difficult but most professors gave us longer periods of times to get work done and provided tutoring, & always open to any concerns or questions we may have ."
Senior,4,"The campus is nice and open and offers a lot of programs both for entertainment and for networking. However, the number can be overwhelming and it may be difficult to learn of all of the opportunities available to you as there are no centralized ways to spread the information about events and groups. There are plenty of professors with real passions for teaching and for their subject, however, outliers always exist and you have to look the prof up to make sure they match your needs and learning styles.
Love the Nugget - one of the campus restaurants."
Alum,4,"For the most part, I really enjoyed attending LBSU. Most of the faculty are great, knowledgeable, and willing to collaborate and support their students. The campus is beautiful and I actually miss being on campus and walking through it. Many nights were spent in the computer lab or library (10/10 honestly). The rec center is top notch and the community at school really encourages everyone to participate in something extracurricular. There are, of course, some bad apples and sour notes, including poor staff focused more on their own agenda and political gains, but it isn't enough to override the other great things about the school."
Freshman,4,"Overall, it's a very good school.  Teachers are great and genuinely are there to help you out if you need it. Recommend connecting with your teachers and networking."
Niche User,4,This is a very good school. It is competitive and pushes students to do their best. It has many resources for students to use and it gives them many opportunities. Yes it is hard to get into this school but once you’re in there are going to be so many things one can do to make you a better student and person in general.
Senior,4,"My time at long beach was great; I was studying engineering and Long Beach State gets scouted by Aerospace and Defense so job outlook is good. However , I the campus resources are sub par."
Senior,4,The university itself is very nice. It something about getting your education in a nice area that akes you feel good about getting your education. A lot of the professors are highly educated and do a great job teaching. Some can be less understanding and hard to stick around for. They are as approachable as any professor are. Parking is terrible.
Sophomore,4,"Pretty good and some professors were very accommodating and supportive. Some classes were hard to do online, however it was manageable."
Sophomore,4,"Pretty good and some professors were very accommodating and supportive. Some classes were hard to do online, however it was manageable."
Alum,4,"CSULB wasn’t my first choice, but it ended being one of the best experiences ever. I am a public relations student and the professors in that department truly care about student success. The campus itself is supportive to many people from various walks of life. Though while the school lacks school spirit being a commuter school. Regardless of that, you will definitely find a support group."
Alum,4,"Online learning is really dependent on the student. It can be easy or difficult and that depends on how much time you are willing to put. My online experience was great, while some professors didn’t interact much or took longer than usual to grade assignments, I still learned the subject."
Sophomore,4,"As a General Biology major at California State University, Long Beach, I believe that most of the professors in the Biology and Chemistry departments are excellent instructors and strive to teach their courses so that their students are successful. Of course, there are some exceptions to this positive trend but most professors are helpful in office hours, responsive to emails, and assist students with succeeding in class. Since CSULB is somewhat a large campus, I like the availability of a campus shuttle that can aid students with transportation. Since parking can be difficult to find, I often park in a distant lot and utilize the shuttle to go on to campus. One thing I was displeased with is the administration's lack of clarity. When the coronavirus hit, they seemed to be in limbo of whether or not the school should shut down and only took action weeks after several other CA schools had already shut down."
Sophomore,4,"When I took classes that were meant to be online, the instructors made the grading scale and layout of the class very clear. Classes such as Nutrition 132 were very easy to understand. With the transition to online classes during COVID-19, some professors are not technologically skilled so there has been some difficulty."
Junior,4,I like the people I met here so far. The workload is manageable too. The cost of attendance is affordable.
Sophomore,4,"CSU Long Beach is a great campus and community, with many people really engaged in their classes and the social life. It provides a good education without being incredibly overbearing, and students have plenty of opportunities and resources to assist them."
Alum,4,Cal State Long Beach is an excellent school. I enjoyed my time at this school and believe it is worth the money. This school provides great academics through quality professors. The campus itself is large and has a lot of amenities. It is a diverse school. I would recommend it.
Sophomore,4,As of right now with COVID-19 I can say that my school as well as my professors are doing an amazing job to make sure we're transitioning well to this drastic change. My professors have been super understanding and our president have given us frequent updates about our campus.
Senior,4,Great environment. Very diverse. We really have pride. Everyone is friendly. Big campus with lots to do and eat. Many clubs/organizations to join. We are a top school in California.
Niche User,4,"I like the environment and feel of the school itself, it is very appealing; however it is not amazing. The dining hall food could be improved overall."
Freshman,4,I love the diversity of the campus and student involvement. I would like to see more food place choices.
Freshman,4,"It is very diverse. There are many resources to help with classes as well as personal issues. Some professors teach well, but others may cause students to experience a difficult time."
Senior,4,"My experience at CSULB has been overall very good. In the School of Art, the professors are very skilled at their area of expertise and really know how to give individual instruction to make sure you are being pushed forward and challenged to grow as an individual and as an artist. I value the studio times we are given to work, have conversations, and discuss work together."
Sophomore,4,"CSULB is a pretty good school. Great pricing when you apply here, a diverse amount of people on campus"
Freshman,4,"Long Beach is a very chill place, where you get what you came for - a degree. Its not really a social gathering type of college because it is a commuter school, however it is very possible to create such an environment. Professors are great and will help you only if you ask it. Its a great environment, really hippie-like and its a fine school."
Junior,4,The campus is very nice. There are many resources available for students to succeed. There is even a Writing Lab available for students who need more help in that area. Many of the professors are passionate about their particular subject as well.
Freshman,4,"California State University- Long Beach is a great place to attend for your Undergraduates. I'm currently a freshman and someone who dorms, and I love it. It's not that far yet not too close to home, there is a good range of diversity there and overall I have great experiences."
Niche User,4,The college is very good and helpful for new students. My family has been going to this college for years and they love it and has been my dream school.
Freshman,4,"One of the things that I really like about CSULB is definitely the variety of fields that you could pursue! They have a fair share of career paths that can get you to where you need to go. Another is that it's relatively in one area that makes getting to classes pretty quickly. On the subject with classes too, there are a lot of programs that they offer to help you out on subjects that need some reviewing which saves you time and stress for those exam days. I could say that the school definitely needs bigger parking lots because it's really difficult to find a spot when it's getting busy"
Alum,2,"I graduated with a B.F.A. in 1987. Ordered a copy of my degree on line. They can't find it. They can find my enrollment, grades, transcripts, etc. They can't find my degree. So far they have had me fill out 3 different forms and asked for $10 twice. WTF? No integrity with there system. If you can't keep records straight, shut down. If you can't help your own graduates, shut down.  No bueno."
Junior,2,"The campus is beautiful and it is in a great location. However, the people in charge of enrollment are horrible. From the time I started attending this university, I have had a difficult time getting classes I need because it seems as though the faculty are unorganized or uninformed about the requisites and, therefore, would advise students wrongly. I was advised to continue to be on a waitlist for a class with the guarantee I’d get in at a certain time, then, only to be told at the last minute the spaces are reserved for international and transfer students. Hence, not only did I not get the class I need, but I wasn’t able to enroll in other classes because I was on a waitlist. Such an overrated campus with counselors who don’t give a crap about their students."
Senior,2,"For this University it all depends on what college you are entering, the college I entered was full of professors that didn't care about their students, they were more focused on their tenure and their overall image to the school. This school is too focused on the ratings that they receive, instead they need to focus on the needs of their students. Cal State Long Beach is focused on getting as many students enrolled as possible and graduated to improve their image. One of the few things I got out of the school was a good of peers that really helped me grow as a person."
College Sophomore,2,"The experience of living on campus involves a lot of noise, parties, and expensive costs. The walls are pretty thin so if one wants to study inside their dorm, it may be hard to focus if they need quiet. The parties do not help and just contribute to the loudness. I don't about the best option between the 3 housing options but I know they're not the best, not to mention how expensive they are. I'm just glad that they offer food with housing."
College Senior,2,"The school is just too big for the kind of resources it has for students. The career center is there, but is never emphasized or talked about in classrooms. Only students who are motivated go to the center for help. I do not know of any alumni network that pertains to my major. The on campus recruiting is only for STEM majors or business type fields. The arts are left out of the job fairs, which does not help the job prospect coming out of school."
College Senior,2,"The best thing about being in the dorms is the ease to get to campus. Parking is a hassle in the mornings, so getting to class is easier by just walking. The parking lots surround the dorms anyway, so the walk is just as far. The other thing I like about the dorms, is the option of applying for a single room. The roommate paring is awful, I have had no good roommate experience while living in the dorms. The RA's are usually nice and welcoming. They will answer all questions and help you if you need anything. The housing process is pretty easy if you are a returning resident. They have a certain number of spots for returning residents, so it is good to get the application in early."
College Senior,2,"My school is big. The campus and the student body. It is also a commuter school, which adds to this effect of being alone in a big sea of fish. I live on campus and it is hard to make friends with other students because most of the students know each other from high school, so it is hard to break into the tight nit groups. The school has a big fraternity/sorority focus on campus. If you are no in a frat or do not want to be in one, you are considered different. I feel that I have not found my group on campus yet and it has been four years there. I would not choose my school again if I could do it all over again. I would choose a much smaller school that would allow me to get closer friends over the years."
College Sophomore,2,The sports here are pretty boring. the basketball team is sub-par in a weak division so not even march madness is all that fun. the only other popular sports are volleyball and baseball and the only reason people go to these games is because they give out stuff.
College Sophomore,2,The atmosphere is great because everyone is social and outgoing and it's hard to feel lonely. The only problem I had with housing was the actual dorms because there is no space to move around. It was uncomfortable living in a tiny room with two other people.
College Freshman,2,"Living in the dorms is a great way to meet new people and make friends, but the dorms themselves are quite dirty. There are spiders and centipede-like bugs in the showers and the carpet can make your feet turn black after two minutes of walking barefoot."
College Freshman,2,"I've heard that this is like the most sexual assaults our school had in one school year and so as a freshman, I'm extremely scared."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is very cliquey, even within each chapter. The structure of the Greek system is basically a mess, and seems to be more about partying with other Greeks than it is about being a positive part of the school and community."
College Sophomore,2,The campus Career Center has not had events that include creative or cinematic careers.
College Sophomore,2,"I always try to go to the job events, but I would never get a reply for the places I would apply. Last year when I received federal work study, I applied for over fifteen positions, and only two got me back for an interview, but I did not receive any work study position whatsoever. With this issue, I had to take out more loans sadly, to take care of other educational expenses."
College Senior,2,"I am not sure about other Universities, but at my school the professors did not care much about their students. All they like to do is lecture, and it does not matter if the students understand or not. Also, I do not like the fact that I have to buy parking permit every semester, but every day I have to buy Metered Parking because there is no parking at school. Besides, I feel that WPE (the English test that every students have to pass to be able to Graduate) is unnecessary because what is the point of taking English 100, Communication, and for Business students have to take Business Communication class already but still have to take WPE and if you fail, you have to take another Writing Comprehensive class, turn in the portfolio for the committees to grade, if you fail you have to re-take the class over and over again to be able to graduate."
College Freshman,2,"Parties are almost non-existent in the campus.  I have gone to other schools such as UC-Santa Barbara and have realized that CSULB has A LOT less happening than other schools.  Sure there are a few gatherings here and there but the extent in which they go are not as exciting or ""crazy"" as the other ones in which I have attended."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus dining includes the usual chain restaurants available anywhere else like McDonalds and Burger King.  The good restaurants are located far from campus, about a 20 to 30 minute drive.  There is little to no variety off campus.  I say this in a manner that all I see near the campus are fast food restaurants next to each other."
College Freshman,2,"The police officers often ""hide"" in places where students are unable to see them violating the fact that they are supposed to be in areas where they are able to be seen clearly.  Parking tickets are unusually expensive from what I have heard from other students.  Some students have even gotten multiple parking tickets on the same car on the exact same day and moment.  The police on campus are strict to the point of scaring the students.  We have had many protests on campus in which none have been stopped so far as to my surprise."
College Sophomore,2,not a lot of variety
College Freshman,2,"There are a variety of different dining areas down 2nd street, but it's overpriced and only limited to that area. Any other place around campus is scarce and there's not much."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot to choose from in the immediate area surrounding the campus.
College Freshman,2,"It looks terrible, feels not too terrible. But for it's price, totally not worth it."
College Freshman,2,"For the most part, academic attendance is up to the professor. However, it gets to ridiculous levels where some professors threaten to force you out of the class if you miss class twice, or that 20% of your grade is attendance. On another hand, some professors don't even care if you attend class (though, these classes are in lecture hall so it's understandable)."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty much got minimal financial aid from just filling out the FAFSA. My family ranks middle class income-wise, but my mother continues to support both of my brothers despite them not counting as dependents (one of them is 24 and the other is in their 5th year of undergrad) so our family is stressing financially."
Recent Alumnus,2,When you think about going to college you think about all of the parties you'll be going to.. here it's hard to find them. We're definitely one of the more mellow schools when it comes to partying which is good when you need to focus on studying but bad when you want to have fun and meet more people.
College Freshman,2,In order to receive your money you have to be extremely patient.
College Freshman,2,"It gets old really fast. It seems the people in the dining hall have the mentality of ""oh mozerella sticks were a hit, LETS NEVER SERVE THEM AGAIN AND GIVE THEM THIS NASTY TURKEY FLATBREAD THAT EVERYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT"""
College Freshman,2,I applied for financial aid but was not given any.  It was very stressful applying and in the end I didn't get any financial aid.
College Junior,2,"It is hard for middle class students to get any help, and you start to drown in loans that you eventually have to pay off. All colleges are this way though. The sad truth."
College Freshman,2,"The only thing I van think of that is bad about the school's policies is the one about demonstration of any strikes or protests. It is unacceptable for anyone to protest on anything, it usually happens in front of the library but soon after one will be taken by the police if they do not quit. There was an incident right after the Mike Brown trial where someone wrote in chalk ""justice for Mike Brown"" and those students demonstrating human feelings were confiscated of their rights."
College Freshman,2,te dorms are almost always loud. bathrooms are almost never clean and the food at the dinning halls isn't very good
College Junior,2,"I am currently not able to receive financial aid for my school due to my parents' income. However, just because my parents' incomes are high, does not mean that I am financially well off. The only best aid that my school has given me was loans."
College Junior,2,"The area around campus is not so great. It is located mostly near and around residential houses. There are local restaurants that are popular to CSUlB students. Some restaurants also offer student discount for CSULB students. Other than fast food restaurants, there is not much things to do around campus."
College Freshman,2,They are really expensive and really small.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid isn't too good. I was estimated to receive about $8,000 and that estimation was way off and I actually received nothing. Hopefully they can actually help my family and I with some financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,It's really difficult and people are not very open about it. the employees at the financial aid center aren't very nice but they help you out. too many papers to fill out on your own and lots of legal talk they should explain at a seminar.
Recent Alumnus,2,I had a friend that lived off campus and she did not have the best experience. The parking included the shuttle which came and went but ever so slowly. The cost is about the same as if you were living on campus. The bright side is the pool.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's not anything nearby the school unless you count the number of fast food restaurants, especially the horrible customer service at IHOP. It's every fast food chain you can think of."
College Junior,2,compared to the super safe town i come from thiscity is unpredictable and you always have to be extra carefulplus a nice apartment is always expensive over 1k for a one bedroom.
College Sophomore,2,There are more numbers in a few ethnic groups
Recent Alumnus,2,I personally would pack my own food or eat outside campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,it's bad. you should get nearby housing if possible.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Personally, i think it is pretty bad for average student."
College Senior,2,I am not receiving enough in my financial aid award to cover all of my costs. I have to get another loan or seek scholarships to finish my senior year and graduate.
College Senior,2,"I got accepted to CSULB, but not for the major I wanted. I would be doing a very similar major if I decided to go. CSULB was my #1 alternate school if the others didn't play out. I ended up coming here, wanting to take classes that my major didn't allow. I plan to be a producer in television. It's a very competitive industry with no guaranteed jobs after graduation. I have to work my way up. If I could do my CSU college applications all over again, I would not have come to CSULB."
College Junior,2,"I did not get any finiancial aid.  I got one scholarship from a private organization that had nothing to do with CSULB.  I did not recieve anything from the school.  My family is comfortable when it comes to finances, but that doesn't mean I didn't need help to pay for school."
College Junior,2,"It's almost impossible to get into the program.  Even students with near perfect grades and scores don't get in.  I'm applying to other schools because it's almost guaranteed I wont get in.  You have to have at least B's (really A's) in Microbiology, Chemistry, Anatomy, Physiology, Communications, Critical Thinking, Math, and English.  You also have to have a good TEAS test score.  Even if you do have good grades, it doesn't mean you're in.  Most of the spots available are not for CSULB students, but for transfers and veterans."
College Freshman,2,I did not get any scholarships
College Sophomore,2,"Counted by swipes, cannot be used in school convenient stores."
College Junior,2,The program I wanted to get into was impacted that it had a lot of requirements that made it difficult.
College Freshman,2,I think it's bad but I live on campus so I'm not sure.
College Freshman,2,I haven't had the opportunity to have an internship this year. The main reason being my major kept me busy. Also for my major there isn't a such thing as an internship. The closest dance majors get to an internship is when a guest teacher comes and we audition to be in his piece. Even then it's very difficult to be in it because they choose the best of the best. Nine times out of ten it's a senior who gets it. Other than that there aren't any in my field choice.
College Student,2,"The off campus housing is okay, but the effort to work and study at the same time to meet the lease amount is hard to juggle."
College Freshman,2,"I hate living in dorms. People are loud and rude, and the R.A.s don't really enforce quiet hours on my floor."
College Freshman,2,"As a state school, there is little assistance for the ""average, middle-class"" student."
College Freshman,2,"There is no student parking near upper campus, and the walk to upper campus from the parking lots is long and time consuming. The parking lots that are there are always crowded, especially in the morning."
College Sophomore,2,It can get very hot
College Freshman,2,The speed of the network is horrible especially if you dorm. Other than that there are many computer labs scattered through out the campus.
College Freshman,2,"Being in the dorms this situation is a lot more relevant. Drinking mainly happens at parties and not on campus or in the dorms. Also, being in Long Beach there is an abundant amount of marijuana circulating."
College Freshman,2,A lot of people smoke even the teachers. As an asthmatic this is very negative on my health and I constantly feel that I need to use my inhaler now.
Alum,1,"This is not a University--meaning, this is not a repository of knowledge nor is it a place where knowledge is cultivated and expanded. The students' future and needs are not of their concern. This place treats their students like cattle; they want to move students through as soon as possible to graduate. I asked multiple department advisers if I could switch majors, and they each replied with an unthoughtful 'No'. Mind that I was only a freshman when I requested this change, trapped in a major that didn't have much investment value... University is an expensive investment that is supposed to reap a return of intellectual and skill enrichment and also create possible economic mobility--however, it seems that this University is in the business of profiteering, not education."
College Senior,1,"I loathe this place. The tutoring centers have incredibly rude receptionists too. You'd think that an institution designed to accommodate people in wheelchairs, people with Autism, blindness, deafness, etc. would be kind, friendly and professional. Nope. Not even up to par with standard customer service."
College Senior,1,I have not been able to find the kind of work experience that I need to get into grad school.
College Senior,1,"Once you get past calculus I, you will find that most professors in CSULB's math department do not know how to manage their office hours. Students in their classes who go to office hours with questions are brushed off in favor of socializing with personal favorites. I'm not talking about one professor who engages in this corruption, but 75%. 

If you have one office hour listed on a syllabus for students in one particular class, but you take up 40 minutes with one drop-in student in another class, that is incompetent. But it's standard behavior for CSULB's math instructors. This trait also tends to cluster with a need to constantly interrupt and make assumptions about students' questions before actually understanding the question accurately. I laughed when one of these types made a comment about the need for understanding concepts, because he clearly only memorized the words of concepts, and the words of a meme which excellent instructors believe in and know.

Many times over the course of your college career, and especially in math departments, you will bump into someone with social power over you due to their role as your paper-pusher. This might be a teaching assistant or a secretary as well as an instructor. And although this individual might even present themselves in a polite, organized manner initially, after having a few conversations with this kind of individual, you will come to realize that this person is not capable of understanding half of the words that come out of your mouth. They will not understand your meaning no matter how clearly and directly you put it. And then, you might come to realize that all the right words that had come out of their mouths up until this point were words memorized from far greater minds, and that nothing goes on inside that originates on its own.

The arrogant complacency of an over-paid bureaucrat, alongside the desperation of a social climber is all we can expect after turning education into big business."
College Senior,1,"In the past two years at my school, there are have been several instances where women have been sexually assaulted at Geek houses during parties. This is disgusting and despicable. I would take no pride in being called a Greek if I knew that this happened at my residence. If you are not Greek, then you usually despise the Greeks. The same goes for the Greek looking at the non-Greeks."
College Sophomore,1,It is the worst maybe in the entire United States
College Junior,1,Parking is waaaayyy to strict. They aren't willing to hear your petition against any ticket you received even if it was unfairly given.
College Junior,1,costs are getting to high for a state school
College Sophomore,1,I have not been able to receive any financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"Live here if you plan to burrow yourself in your room and smoke weed.

-Community: Community isn't too bad, but it is very clear to see that the housing staff favors certain people. I was unlucky and got stuck with an alcoholic roommate from out of the country. He once damaged my property so I reported him to the RAs. They did nothing.

He came back and threatened me. 

I reported it to law enforcement and the administration. 

They still did nothing.

The food here gets old fast; the cafeteria is run by students so its always better that the start of the semester and gets gradually worse. By the middle of the semester it's awful. 


Overall. Don't live here. If you have the option live off campus."
College Junior,1,Scholarships are very difficult to get if you did not grow up in the city or are not a science major.
College Senior,1,"Of what I pay every year in school charges, the meal plans are the worst. Meals can either run out before the end of the semester or you have dozens of meals left. You still pay for the meals you don't use, though. Also, the food options inside the dining halls are abysmal. For the high charges I pay every year, the value is simply not worth it."
College Sophomore,1,There's too little spots on the program
College Sophomore,1,It's really hard to get into and very stressful
College Junior,1,"I've gone out once and that was with roommates, you dont hear anything about parties here."
College Freshman,1,Personally I didn't get financial aid and it doesn't seem fair to me because I'm going based off of loans. A lot of people I know get financial aid and good for them but it still feels unfair.
College Freshman,1,Not many clubs that are active but there are many sororities and fraternities
College Freshman,1,I don't have a car but from what I've heard and seen both on and off campus it's strictly enforced and costly.
College Sophomore,1,"I am currently a pre-nursing student. Nursing is too impacted, so you have to apply to be in it. It is a tough process and you will be torn apart and chewed up just trying to get there. It seems impossible."
College Sophomore,1,"Permits are overpriced for college students, especially those who are taking loans. They changed how they want the permit displayed on your car. It has always been on the front right side of your dashboard and now they want it in the back window. So people have gotten tickets for that. I still have it on the front. "
College Junior,1,Im so desperate Im applying to as many scholarship as I can. I have no support for my parents and I am forced to take the bus. I visited the financial aid office at least five times this year and I have no aid. They did not help nor did they offer me alternatives. If I do not get any scholarships I will be forced to leave the school for a semester.
College Sophomore,1,Incredibly strict they have no real crimes to prevent.
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't know since I commute.
College Senior,1,"I am currently a nursing major at CSULB.  The process of getting into this major is very stressful and difficult (some would say it is arguably the hardest major to get into on this campus).  The application process looks at eight class grades and your score on a standardized exam (the TEAS).  Students are then ranked according to their grades/scores from top to bottom.  The top students are selected for admission.  The most important criteria for admission is having good grades in those eight classes (it is very competitive, mostly A's must be achieved).  With all of this said, being a part of the nursing program is one of the greatest and most rewarding things that I have gotten the opportunity to do throughout my life.  It's hard work, but worth every minute of it!"
College Sophomore,1,Too many people. It's a commuter school. The school should invest in building a new parking structure.
College Sophomore,1,"There is an absolute no drinking policy at CSULB. Any students caught with alcohol or who are found to be highly intoxicated in the dorms are treated with severe repercussions. I give it a low grade because it seems that low means ""strict""--however I don't see this as a bad thing, because CSULB is one of the most secure campuses in the CSU system. The campus police are always willing to escort girls to their cars after dark and there are emergency phones all over campus."
College Sophomore,1,"This is mostly a commuter school so there is not much Greek life to speak of. If you look for it, it's there, but tends to be cliquish."
College Freshman,1,I have never witnessed any illegal activity in regards to drugs and/or alcohol.
College Freshman,1,CSULB is known for never being able to find parking!
College Freshman,1,The first few weeks of school I had to come to school an hour early just to find parking. It's terrible the first 2-3 weeks of school and during finals. Parking pass prices are a little over $100 a semester. The year round pass is roughly $250 and is cool if you're going to take Summer/Winter courses.
College Sophomore,1,"VERY WHIITE, i'm from LA so coming here was quite a culture shock for me, the average student here is fairly homogenized, beachy, and spoiled. If you're different in any way, no ones really going to know what to do with you here, some are accepting, some will leave you alone, some people will pride themselves on their tolerance of you...it's interesting to watch."
College Junior,1,If you get caught with drugs or commit a felony you will loose your financial aid.
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible. Leave for class really early, and go to the far spots first if you get bad anxiety (like me). They ticket you even if you park without a pass in like two minutes."
College Junior,1,"It is impossible to find parking the first couple weeks of school; some people wait hours. After those few weeks, parking opens up but you still must plan accordingly, arriving about 30-45 minutes before your class starts. Parking permits are ridiculously high priced, especially when parking is incredibly hard to find. However, on weekdays after 6PM and on weekends, if you have a semester-long parking permit, you may park anywhere on campus. You don't need to have a car on campus, but CSULB is a commuter school so most people drive to and from school. Taking the bus would probably be faster for those closer to school."
College Junior,1,Getting into CSULB is hard period since they have such a high amount of students that apply. Being a transfer student was even harder.  I went through three rounds that lasted till May. The most important important criteria I believe would be GPA and ACT/SAT scores. This made me delay my intent to enroll to other schools. It is well worth it though. My only tip is to score better on all your tests and to maintain a 3.0 GPA+ to even be considered.
College Freshman,1,They seem as if they are race based. Majority of the soroities are white girls there is only one sorority that is mixed raced.
Recent Alumnus,1,I dont drive to school because of the fact that you can never find parking. There is very few parkign spots. Its really hard to find a parking space also the parkign permit is pretty expensive.
College Senior,1,"The smoking policy! That is not 20 feet from a building, it's more like next to the building. I just hate walking pass people who are smoking and in the way. I choose to not smoke for a better health and yet, there are people's smelly strings of smoke dancing in the wind."
College Sophomore,1,"I have tried twice to get financial aid, but unfortunately they say I am ineligible to receive it. They say it is because of the household income, however I know friends whose parents I know have a better income yet they have received financial aid."
College Junior,1,"Most people I knew got it, except me. My family income is not that high, but I still had tuition out of my pocket. A lot of people I know get it and waste it"
College Junior,1,"It can be very tedious trying to find parking; especially, because all the closest parking to the classes are reserved for the faculty, so students have to walk long distances to get to their classes."
College Senior,1,"Definitely Could Use Some Work – But I don't think it's CSULB's fault, the financial aid process is just absurd."
College Junior,1,"Fall Semester – This Fall 2012 semester, the parking is terrible. I have been attending this school for almost 3 years I have never had to park on a fire lane before. Even though I was allowed to, I went around the entire parking lots and structures and no parking was available. There are way to many students attending CSULB if there is absolutely no parking available in the 2nd biggest school in California."
College Sophomore,1,"Pretty Strict – they are watching all the time.  The security who are responsible for parking will really check at all times if you have parked in the wrong spot or if you have a valid permit.  The campus is a ""very dry"" campus meaning no alcohol anywhere except inside the club and they are very strict about that, if you get caught then you're screwed."
College Sophomore,1,"It's a Scam – Like every college I've ever been to, it's a complete scam to force EVERYONE to pay for parking in one way or another, whether it be by enforcing street parking with city ordinance, requiring a permit, or forcing you to funnel into congested areas to pay for your overpriced day-pass."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Easy, but Doable – The process of getting in my major of interior architecture is a difficult and demanding task. It in order for one to succeed you have to give up a lot of your extracurricular activities. All the projects are incredibly time consuming and have lots ideas and concepts to explore with endless possibilities."
College Freshman,1,"Maybe it's because I'm so much smarter than a lot of these hackjobs, but everything is wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too easy"
College Student,1,Commuter School! There is no night life in all of Long Beach. The only club that was 18+ closed down a long time ago. CSULB has a restaurant/bar where there's some live music sometimes but it's always full of frats.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Very Difficult – It is extremely difficult to find parking near classrooms. Especially when I have to go to the library for a short visit, I have to park relatively far in order to walk to the other side of campus. I suppose it is good for exercise. I have to account at least 30 minutes for parking and walking (very fast)."
College Junior,1,"Commuting Sucks – Overall, CSULB's parking SUCKS! Permits for one semester cost $123, almost $250 a year. To top that off, its not even a guarantee that youll find parking. If you come around 11-12pm youll probably end up looking for parking about 20-30mins!"
College Freshman,1,Pretty sure EVERYONE smokes weed here. It's a very liberal topic of discussion; people talk about smoking it all the time. It is really quite ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no specified area for only college students to live off campus. Pretty much if you can find a place for a decent price, go for it. There needs to be a community for students to live and socialize!"
College Sophomore,1,Use Public Transportation! The price of parking permits are really high and there is a small chance of easily finding a parking spot. It would be a lot better to use public transportation and it is free for students!
College Freshman,1,"El Pollo Loco and Subway – I went to El Pollo Loco and I got food poisoning from their food. When I went to subway, some sick worker coughed all over my food."
College Sophomore,1,"Awful, Awful, and Awful – The parking is terrible. It usually takes 45 minutes to an hour to find a spot, the passes cost far too much for the value, and those patrolling the lots give out parking tickets like there's no tomorrow."
College Sophomore,1,Parking permits cost too much per semester and daily parking permits cost even more in the long run. Parking spaces are far away from heavily populated areas and therefore you have to walk a while just to get to where you need to go.
College Sophomore,1,"Highly Disagreeable – The Greek societies on campus are just how they usually are, and that's the problem. I don't see the benefit of frats when all they offer is stuck up rich kids that party all the time."
College Sophomore,1,"All the student parking lots are on lower campus away from any feasible destination fro all but music majors and engineering majors. For a commuter campus, the school does not have nearly enough parking. The parking permits are overly expensive, and it is easy to get a parking ticket even if you are following the rules."
College Sophomore,1,"The Student union has the typical fast food. Aside from that, the dining halls are lacking in both taste and variety."
College Freshman,1,I don't have a car myself but I see parking is ridiculous. Parking permits are about $100-200 each semester. I hear some people show up about an hour early just to find a good parking spot.

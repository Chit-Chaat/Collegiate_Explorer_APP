Sophomore,5,I love the environment and how friendly and inviting the campus and people are. They make an effort to make sure you are plugged in and find your place in on campus.
Alum,5,I loved my undergraduate years at Whitworth. The faculty and professors are all so kind and considerate. I have been at professors' office hours multiple times and they really care to see each student improve and understand the material if it is complex or difficult.
Alum,5,"Time spent at Whitworth is irreplaceable. You will work hard and graduate. When you reflect on the memories, it will cause you to smile. It was the culmination of all things you  needed to grow and strengthen who you were meant to be. It is a place of unparalleled learning and lasting friendships."
Freshman,5,"Cant stress this enough. Whitworth is PERFECT! 

Great academic programs, intelligent and caring professors, beautiful campus, diverse student body, homey community, and many other things that make Whitworth WORTH it. 

I'm also glad that Whitworth now has an Engineering program. They're really doing well in STEM as a liberal arts school."
Niche User,5,The college offers many benefits that other colleges just don't offer. They have plenty of diversity that causes people to get a look at other cultures and what their customs are and so forth. The campus was so inviting and it felt like home as soon as I stepped on to the campus. The whole experience that I had while I was there was amazing. It was everything that I was looking for in a college and it met all of my expectations if not all of them.
Sophomore,5,"I have attended Whitworth for two years now, and while those two years have been hard, it has also been some of the best years of my life. All of the professors are amazing and support you if you need support."

Freshman,5,"Whitworth University is a welcoming academic community. My education and my social life benefits from my continued enrollment at this gorgeous campus. The professors force themselves to learn every student's name by the end of the first few classes, and they reach out and welcome students into their lives. Students at Whitworth University are people, not numbers."
Niche User,5,Great communication! Each time I called I always reached a person and my questions answered. Very friendly staff. A student of Whitmore even called me to ask if I had any questions with applying.
Niche User,5,"I had my experience with Whitworth University by going to a college visit at Whitworth. I was very intrigued and happy with my visit of Whitworth University. I felt that Whitworth was the right place for me to go to college, so I applied and got accepted. I am so happy that I will be taking my next step and attending Whitworth University!"
Freshman,5,"Whitworth is excellent. I really enjoy all of my classes, and the professors are all so helpful. I would like to see the dining hall food improve. We are required to live on campus and get a meal plan for the first two years, so there should be more food options."
Graduate Student,5,"Whitworth is an amazing experience, far better than what I have received at public schools. The professors are engaged and intelligent, and they create a culture where everyone feels valued and supported"
Sophomore,5,It is a culture centered around making sure students succeed at their goals. There isnâ€™t anything that I can find fault with.
Senior,5,"Whitworth is a great institution that prides itself in its academics and mind and heart culture. Professors strive to help you succeed in all aspects of life, in which I am truly grateful to have as a resource on campus. This is a college that I wish everyone had the privilege of experiencing at some point in their lives."
Junior,5,Everyone is very kind here. I love how I have been able to meet so many people here in the short time that I have attended Whitworth U. I am loving my classes and my teachers are great. My theology teacher seems to really know what she is talking about and she has posed some very fascinating questions during class. My art teacher is also really cool. I have been having a lot of fun here while also learning a lot. My hall even does study Sunday where we all get together and do homework. It's all about community here.
Senior,5,"I love Whitworth's  diverse opportunities to find different activities that fit your interests, the professors' and academic advisors' dedication to supporting you in setting aside time to answer your questions and make sure you succeed and grow as a student."
Freshman,5,"I love the small college atmosphere. I love having those close knit relationships in a smaller college. Their food is excellent. The campus looks amazing. The class sizes are small, so I get more 1-1 time with my professors. They have a thing called primetime, so in every dorm, everyone living in the dorm gets together and does something fun, every week. Every time I've been on campus, I've just had a great experience."
Freshman,5,"Very helpful staff, answered all my questions in a timely matter. Friendly atmosphere with lots of activities. Seemingly friendly students who are very motivated in what they want to do."
Freshman,5,A very good Christian university with top rank academics and the staff and students actually show that they care for you. Highly recommend
Junior,5,Everyone there tries to make sure that you experience a really good educational environment. They strive for excellence. The staff helps in every way possible to ensure that each student that has a disability has the items that are needed in order to succeed.
Niche User,5,Students and staff have made me feel welcomed. The campus is close to the city but far enough away that you can be relaxed in nature. Traditions such as catching a pine cone and throwing frisbees warms my heart.
Junior,5,"Whitworth University is one of the best choices I have ever made. The education is exceptional and the professors are fantastic. They know you by name and make themselves available to students. The students are wonderful too, all very friendly and open to deep conversations at the drop of a hat."
Freshman,5,"The professors love what they do and the residence hall community is excellent. The campus is open, but self-contained, and it's easy to get to know lots of people in a short amount of time."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere of Whitworth.  It is a very welcoming and intelligent campus.  Every person I have spoken to has a unique story and a wonderful reason for being at this great school.
Freshman,5,Whitworth is an amazing university. It was the best choice. The professors and faculty are amazing. They have a great support system and help guide you through your four years there.
Junior,5,I just started attending Whitworth and so far my experience has been great. All the students and faculty are very welcoming. Professors care so much for all their students it is just an environment I love being a part of.
Sophomore,5,Whitworth has an amazing community no matter who you are. You will be challenged academically and encouraged by professors and students alike. The only thing that could improve is the food.
Junior,5,I love Whitworth! This university is incredibly unique in many ways. The community is unlike any other school environment I've been exposed to. The students and professors are genuine and committed to expanding their worldview and living out their faith.
Junior,5,"Great school, beautiful campus.  I grew up in Spokane and Whitworth has always been coveted as a top notch school.  Now that I am a student there I can proudly say that I agree!"
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Whitworth. It has provided me with amazing spiritual growth, incredible relationships with students and faculty, and stellar academics. I have loved every day I have attended and am so blessed God led me to this campus."
Sophomore,5,"At Whitworth University, it's easy to feel at home. You are welcomed by everyone you meet, and friendships are fast in the making. My first week at Whitworth was a whirlwind of ""hellos"" and ""how are you's"" from people who genuinely wanted to know me. The professors are extremely helpful, and understand that what you are doing can be stressful. Overall academically, Whitworth is fantastic. I have learned so much towards my field of study in my first year alone. I am also a part of Whitworth's swim team, and they are like a second family to me. I know that I can rely on my teammates to be there for me when I need them. Being a Christian college, Whitworth does not have much of a party scene, but that does not take away from how wonderful of a school Whitworth is in the slightest. I would recommend Whitworth to anyone that is searching for a home away from home with great academic and athletic opportunities surrounded by people who actually care about your well-being and success."
Freshman,5,"This university is a place where incredibly talented people come together to learn from devoted professors. The campus is beautiful, safe, and fun to explore. Since it is small, you see the same people every day and campus traditions promote friendliness. Student athletes are committed to both their sport and academics."
Niche User,5,"I am going to attend Whitworth University next year, and I couldn't be more excited. I have been on campus a few times for events and to meet people. Each time I go I just want to stay. Everyone is welcoming and friendly, staff, students, and professors alike. You just feel at home when you are on campus."
Junior,5,"Whitworth puts a huge emphasis on community. It is a small school, but that's one of the perks of going here. It is easy to meet people and everyone is friendly"
Sophomore,5,"Whitworth was the perfect college for me. I majored in Biology so I loved that I could take courses with cadavers to supplement my learning. My faith was connected into each course I took, from science to English and all the way to Core classes, a series of courses specifically designed to teach about Worldviews and educate on other religions around the world."
Freshman,5,WHITWORTH IS A SCHOOL THAT CHOOSES YOU... IT IS FOR A SELECT FEW AS IT COULD BE THE ENVIRONMENT NEEDED FOR ONE TO BLOOM AND GROW WHILE DISCOVERING WHO THEY ARE AND SEEING HOW POSSIBLE IT IS FOR THEM TO IMPACT THE WORLD POSITIVELY JUST BEING THEIR BEST SELVES AND I FEEL I AM A CONTRIBUTING CASE STUDY OF THIS INTUITION.
Freshman,5,"Great University with great people. You get to have lunch with your favorite professor and have intellectual talks or just random talks which might not make sense at all. One time you are reading, and the next minute you can find yourself going on an unplanned trip nearby. This place has super energy, allows you to explore yourself and challenges you to go beyond the grid."
Freshman,5,"My experience here so far has been excellent. While Whitworth is an expensive school to attend, nearly all the aspects of the college are worth it. The classes are interesting and challenging, dorm life is exciting and there's always something going on, and the surrounding area of Spokane is fun to explore. Overall, this is a place I would want to stay at for four years and gain my degree from."
Freshman,5,"The campus is very welcoming, and the make sure that can help you succeed in anyway they can. The academics will push you to new levels, and yield exponential rewards. No matter who you are or your level of learning Whitworth will make you succeed with their mission to heart and mind."
Sophomore,5,"I'm in love with my college. Every day I love this campus and this community more and more. The professors are incredible, and I have never been anywhere with such a good community feel. Yes, you will run into the hardcore closed minded Christians or the people who think they're opinion is fact, but the quality people you will meet make up for this. "
College Freshman,5,I got the dorm I really wanted.
College Freshman,5,The athletics here are perfectly balanced.
College Freshman,5,"There are different kinds of dorms that are available to us. Such as; single rooms, triples, double, and even quads. There are many different options to satisfy everyone and Whitworth is flexible when giving students the room they want. People in the different hallways in dorms are very friendly and caring."
College Freshman,5,Professors are the best around. they care about their students and love what they do.
College Freshman,5,Whitworth is an amazing school. The professors all really care about your success and notice students as individuals not simply a name or number on a paper. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
College Freshman,5,"I really do enjoy Whitworth. It's big enough to not have to be friends with everyone, but small enough so you could be if that's what you're into. The class sizes are great. They don't have too many majors to choose from, but you have your basic ones. The professors are great and the classes are very interactive."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are incredible. They are both very qualified in their fields and very personable. They get to know their students personally while also giving them an amazing education. We also have an 11-1 student to faculty ratio, giving us smaller class sizes. A degree from Whitworth is considered valuable because of our well-known academics."
College Freshman,5,"Whitworth has a system of rules called the ""Big Three"": no cohabitation, respect the community, and no drugs/alcohol. Therefore, the drug scene is almost nonexistent. The university still promotes a fun environment, just without students being under the influence. Most students don't drink or use drugs; if they wanted to, they'd have to go off campus."
College Senior,5,"I have loved all most all of my classes. In four years I have taken 15+ credits each semester, so that's around 40 different classes. I can think of only two I didn't like and only one that I hated (writing 101). Whitworth has a Janterm, so there is a term in between fall and spring. That is when professors get a break from teaching what they have to and get to teach the classes they love the most. They get to teach what they are most passionate about, which means they offer classes you will never find at a state school. They offer the basic courses, just not during Jan term. So rather than teaching physics 101 again they offer the physics of weapons, instead of psychopathology they offer psychopathology and film, the offer classes on both C.S. Lewis and Tolkien. The professors care about the students in a personal way. I have had dinners and study groups at multiple professors houses. Students aren't seen as a number but rather a person, that's one of the biggest reasons I chose Whitworth."
College Senior,5,"Whitworth has some of the best study abroad programs I have ever heard of. I have been lucky enough to participate in two, both were amazing. The school helped me find ways to finance the trips and made it possible to go. All five of my housemates at Whitworth have gotten to study abroad or do internships, including going to Turkey, Greece, France, Italy, England, China, Tanzania and an internship with the Smithsonian in DC."
College Sophomore,5,The admissions counselors are wonderful.  They answer phone calls and emails promptly.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus
Sophomore,4,"I love attending WU! I have met some amazing people including peers and professors. The campus is very inviting and clean, and there are many places to hammock and hang out. I also love the abundance of places to study as well."
Junior,4,"Whitworth is very much community based. You will be able to find life-long friends in this institution. There are many club and group activities on campus. Everyone can find their funk. However, for it being a small institution, there are limited resources. There are not much on campus options to eat and for most of the part, the resources are limited during the weekend. Even research opportunities are scarce for STEM majors. However, the small class size makes up for it because the professors ACTUALLY care about you."
Senior,4,"The professors and staff are so welcoming, friendly, and ready to serve students. There is a real passion for community and faith on campus. The school is not particularly academically rigorous, however Whitworth is a respected institution in the greater region."
Senior,4,I love that all of my professors make it a point to be available both academically and emotionally. The classes are challenging but encourage mistakes and learning.
Freshman,4,"Coming in, especially as an international student, you're welcomed very well and transition to college and a new environment seems seamless"
Niche User,4,"Went there for tour of school and to get the feel for campus life. Explored the football program and what it's like to be apart of the family. All of the buildings at Whitworth are nice and clean and the outside is very colorful with all the leaves changing at once,makes for a cool and relaxing campus."
Freshman,4,"Whitworth is an overall amazing university. I have always felt safe on campus. Everyone is extremely friendly. The small school atmosphere is welcoming. However, the school is completely different in the Fall and Spring than in Winter, and the extreme weather WILL affect your mood, grades, and overall social experiences."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed the campus and how it seemed small, but also, it's within a city. Also, I immediately felt the compassion from others and the kindness all of the students had. One thing that could be worked on is the diversity of the professors."
Freshman,4,"Whitworth University is a wonderful place for any student seeking high-quality education and meaningful relationships with other students. Whitworth seeks to create an atmosphere that is diverse and challenging to personal views while respecting each human being and their personal story. Faculty and staff here at Whitworth care deeply for each student, inside and outside of the classroom. The courses are challenging and give students the opportunity to think critically about the material. Whitworth is expensive, but the education is definitely worth the high sticker price."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone here is so nice. There are many activities and festivals that are put on year-round, and is a great way to meet new people. The only thing bad about Whitworth is the food that is availble. There aren't much options and is usually bland. Other than that, this campus is super freindly and there are so many people that work here that are willing to help you with whatever you need."
Freshman,4,"I loved how helpful and kind everyone was. Community was a big part of the school, and it showed. However, there was quite a bit of agenda pushing. The school claims it is Christian, yet undermines everything Christianity is."
Freshman,4,I have been here twice for visiting and hitting with the tennis team since I would like to be on the tennis team. It's a really nice college that has everything a student could ask for. What I really like is that they have a big cafeteria where they have a lot of food and it's variable. There is nothing I would change about this.
Freshman,4,"Whitworth has a lot of great and helpful people in its administration, from faculty to the staff. A Christian university it is not. ""Christian"" is more of a label they place on the university, there isn't a lot of substance behind it. The material they present is definitely intellectually challenging. Overall, this is a very good university."
Junior,4,Amazing school if you want to feel invested in. The professors really do want to sit down and have lunch with you. People really do want to see you succeed. RA are friendly and always there to help. Its impossible to fall through the cracks at this school and you won't walk away feeling like your time was wasted. I'm getting my degree in Elementary Ed. but I'm also getting a chance to feel invested in and cared about as a person.
Freshman,4,"Whitworth is an amazing school. The faculty is great, and the community is great. It is a smaller school which is really nice for building the community. The campus is also very pretty. If you want a university where you feel cared for, this is one."
Freshman,4,"Whitworth University is a great school, and the community is very generous caring. I love the academics are so high and the professors push you to do better academically . And most importantly to thrive.  I have also liked how it is a Christian school and with learning about Christ you can live in a positive way."
Freshman,4,"The people were very welcoming and helpful. When I had difficulties it was easy to get guidance or help. Although the school is not very diverse, there are enough resources for minorities like me to feel welcome. But there were some unpleasant moments where I felt uncomfortable doing what I usually do in my culture."
College Freshman,4,Athletics seem to be a big part of the school
College Freshman,4,The experiences I have with professors and students so far have been very enjoyable.
College Freshman,4,Very fun to go to sporting events with friends durning the year.
College Freshman,4,Its be a really fun and enjoyable time. Very good choice.
College Sophomore,4,Overall I enjoyed Whitworth. I made great friends and have enjoyed the community at Whitworth so far.
College Sophomore,4,"Because I am only a freshman, I am not sure yet how Whitworth is in career prospects."
College Sophomore,4,I really really enjoyed my freshman dorm Stewart. It was a great dorm for freshman. I met great people and some of my closest friendships began in this dorm. The community was great although sometimes I wished more people were involved in the activities. I enjoyed the RA's but I did not like the RD. He was not involved with the students that lived there and made no effort to get to know them. He was not personable or approachable. That would be something that could improve at Stewart. The housing process for next year was incredibly stressful but in the end we got it figured out.
College Sophomore,4,We do not really have Greek life but we do have Theme Houses that might qualify as Greek life and they function very well in the community of Whitworth.
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the athletics at Whitworth. My personal favorite is Men's Basketball! It is probably the biggest sport on campus and so many people attend and enjoy the games. They are always so fun and exciting to watch. I really loved how Whitworth had ""Monday Madness"" before the season really started it was a great pep rally for the sport. I played in the basketball intramurals and I absolutely loved it. It connected me with many students that I might not have met otherwise and it allowed me to continue to play the sport I love."
College Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my experience at Whitworth so far! As a freshman, Whitworth was really great with helping me adapt to the big changes that come with college. Specifically at Whitworth, I have really enjoyed the traditiation for freshmen and all the events that it contained. I really enjoyed the events on campus during weekends. I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college. This might be an improvement with the advisers but I think students need help with stress and knowing we can find stable careers out of college that correspond with our majors."
College Freshman,4,They are helpful in finding work.
College Freshman,4,"I am going into elementary education, and have already been looking into options for employment after college that will be available to me."
College Freshman,4,"Though I wouldn't recommend walking around in the dark at one in the morning anywhere, if you're going to do it somewhere, I would recommend Whitworth. You're likely pretty safe, and if you feel unsafe, security has a twenty-four-seven number that you can call, and they will pick you up in their cart."
College Freshman,4,"I stayed in one of the women's dorms when I was there for Honors Colloquium, and I found it to be excellent. Adequate space, and a home-y atmosphere. The only weird thing was the bathrooms; very little privacy, so I would not recommend any of the smaller, older women's dorms for shy people."
College Freshman,4,Whitworth's workout facilities are some of the best I've seen. Very excited to be able to run and work out on the weekends.
College Freshman,4,"I attended an Honors Colloquium to get a feeling for what attending school at Whitworth would be like. I was blown away by the kindness and personality of those I met! I felt included, which is something that rarely happens at my high school. I am looking forward to attending in the fall."
College Junior,4,Dorms at Whitworth are great. Most rooms are pretty small but they do provide enough space to at least get by. Dorms are walking distance to every building on campus.
College Junior,4,"Most Whitworth students that aren't actively involved in a sport/team,  are very supportive. Everybody shows up to the games and try hard to show support and school spirit."
College Junior,4,I've been at Whitworth for 2 years now and i love the community. Some classes and professors are really challenging but you always have the necessary resources to try hard and succeed.
Recent Alumnus,4,I got a job right after getting my degrees.
Recent Alumnus,4,More expensive than off campus housing.
College Freshman,4,All of my professors have office hours and are willing to help at any time. There are many different course we can take just for one Gen-ed. When it comes to class size they are always a responsible amount.
College Freshman,4,I havent talked to the career center about any jobs this year or asked/know about internships but I do feel that Whitworth is preparing me to find a job once I finish school.
College Freshman,4,I also see security driving around campus and parked patrolling which makes me feel very safe.
College Freshman,4,No one is degraded at Whitworth. Everyone is very accepting and loving.
College Freshman,4,"When it comes to athletics at Whitworth University they have a very strong fan safe. When there is more fans at a game, it helps us to preform better. Our athletics are very successful. Athlete at Whitworth love to wear their gear and represent their school."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy not only attending Whitworth University but also being able to be a part of the soccer team. Schooling was actually fun and I was taught a lot this year. Soccer gave me a new outlook on different people and my relationships with them.
College Freshman,4,Security is great. The campus is very safe. Security is accessible whenever it needs to be.
College Freshman,4,"A degree from Whitworth is highly respected, because of the rigorous courseload."
College Freshman,4,"I have a common area in my room, which is so nice. The buildings themselves are pretty average or better than average. However, the community aspect is great in most dorms. Lots of pride for wherever you traditiate."
College Freshman,4,The people are so friendly and the education is actually useful!
College Freshman,4,"Whitworth University is great in the fact that it is extremely small. This allows for students to meet with professors or TA's as often as they would like. The campus is also very beautiful and maintained well. There are a few downsides, however. One of those is how expensive it is. For it being over $50,000 it does not always feel like you are always getting your moneys worth. Along with that, it seems to be harder to get involved in different clubs because they are not often advertised."
College Sophomore,4,We have internship and job fairs frequently and our career service center is very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"It is difficult to find variety within the Spanish Department, but all of the professors here are wonderful and I have had great relationships with most of them. Most of the classes are smaller (30 or fewer) and it provides a great learning environment."
College Sophomore,4,It is fun and offers you with a built in community and friends.
College Sophomore,4,"We are a D3 school, so sports are not crazy important, but the programs are very nice. The coaches care about your academics as well, and will support you as you need for your academic needs."
College Sophomore,4,"As always, there are downsides, but it is a wonderful community and teachers are there for you. They care and will offer a great support system."
College Senior,4,"The academics are great. The professors are wonderful, the curriculum is difficult but interesting, the variety of classes is fantastic, and students take their studies seriously. The university really listens to student and what they want to study, professors will create and accredited classes that students want to take. Can't find a class on something you love? Do an independent study on what you want to know more about."
College Sophomore,4,"Although it is not very active, sexual assault is still present. Not very often, but it still happens. Our school is VERY active in aiding and preventing it."
College Sophomore,4,"Very good programs, good campus opportunities and the professors are amazing."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school. It is hard work, and stressful finding the money to pay for my education, but definitely worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my dorm, however sometimes I wish it was nicer or cleaner. I wish they would upgrade the laundry system; our washers and driers are so old and only take cards. I wish it took coins at least so that I could use change instead of having to lose five dollar bills at a time to the card. then it wont even read if it has less than 75 cents on it!! GONZAGA GETS FREE LAUNDRY; I think we pay enough to get that too."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the community of my school where we all come together to support each other in all things, including athletics."
Junior,2,"There are many things I can say about ""online"" work, from the required codes you must purchase either from a brand new $200 textbook, which the book itself could be a hand me down from student to student at a fraction of the price. The math classes felt fine to take, after getting said code to even do the work. Like most online work, many if not all the students I've collab with uses the internet to do easy work very fast, from looking up answers to other various tasks. Having to buy a ""code"" for every class with online work adds up a lot. In retrospect, choosing a 2 year community college for gen eds and transferring credits would save a lot of the hassle and stress I've worked through from this institution."
Niche User,2,"Great smaller campus with strong Computer Science and Math departments. Beautiful campus with lots of activities. Fun location, close enough to downtown to have a fun night, but far enough away that you're not living in the city. Lacks in diversity and does not promote individuality."
College Senior,2,The parties exist but mostly happen off campus. Whitworth is a faith based school so partying is often looked down on or not talked about in the open.
College Freshman,2,They have a wide variety of options to choose from but they all upset my stomach. They taste fine but something in the food gives me the worst stomach cramps. And it's not just me. My roommate always has Tums in the room to eat after eating in the cafeteria.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The party scene at Whitworth is pretty small and underground. There's no alcohol allowed on campus, so mainly the parties happen at off-campus houses. If you like to party, this probably isn't the place for you."
College Freshman,2,"The parking downtown is very difficult to find, and the cost is high for a small parking place. It is difficult to get from Whitworth to downtown via public transportation. The downtown area is nice, but can be unsafe in certain areas at night."
College Senior,2,"There isn't really a nightlife at Whitworth. There are a few bars near campus, and downtown Spokane isn't too far of a drive, but taxis aren't widely used, there is no shuttle back to campus, and the public transit system shuts down early."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot of diversity on campus (part of that is due to it being so small). The college is working towards better diversity with offering minority scholarships and trying to get more international students.
College Sophomore,2,"There is the big three policy in place, which is no tolerance for cohabitation, violence, or alcohol on campus, which is a big deal and enforced on campus. The RAs are very friendly, and don't want to take disciplinary action, but if you break a big rule, they will turn you in."
College Junior,2,"Truly the food is not that bad, however the lack a healthy choices and obvious amount of sodium in each option is not ideal. Another issue falls with the meat available for students as the meat seems to not be the best choice within the dinning area. Around the school it is known as being ""Sagatarian"" when choosing not to eat the meat."
College Freshman,2,Campus security is really nothing more than parking patrol.
College Student,2,You will see the same food a lot and can get sick of it but there are always sandwiches and toast.
College Freshman,2,"The fall tends to be rainy most of the time and it does snow a lot in the winter, but classes aren't cancelled very much. It takes awhile to walk to and from classes in the snow and ice, but the weather is very nice at the beginning of school and in the spring. You will see a lot of people playing frisbee and other games outside once it's nice."
College Freshman,2,Whitworth is pretty hard to get into. The average GPA coming into the year of 2012 was 3.74. Whitworth University is amoungst the top three Universities in Washington for academic excellence.
College Freshman,2,"The strictness is here is semi-enforced. This all depends on your Student leadership and on your dorm. Since the main rules are to not drink on campus, no sex or opposite gender sleepovers and violence you are pretty much free to do whatever. Do note that on campus drinking and sex does still happen quite frequently on campus. First time offenders will generally get a ""big three"" if caught which is served with either a fine or community service. If you get caught drinking on campus for example you'll have to take in addition a test to see if you're an alcoholic. You need about multiple ""big threes"" in which the end result will be that you'll be told to move off campus. No one has been expelled for breaking school rules and for the most part its pretty relaxed. Underage drinking isn't something I've seen that can get you in trouble at all only if you're caught on campus drinking. Otherwise entering your dorm room drunk should be for the most part okay as long as you're not obnoxious and disrupting quiet hours for which you'll be fined for."
College Freshman,2,"Dry as the Sahara â€“ I am not a partier, but if you are looking for that sort of school, you definitely won't find it here. I was looking forward to going to at least a few parties to meet a few people, have fun every once in a while, but parties are pretty much non-existant. People drive to other schools to find parties. That's how dry we're talking here."
College Junior,2,its not seen on campus but off campus alcohol and weed is prevelent
College Freshman,2,"Whitworth is an expensive school $40,000 roughly a year and the price keeps going up. They offer good scholarships but expect to pay 10,000-15,000 even if you get multiple scholarships. Funding has been cut back and tuition was raised this year making it just that much harder to attend this school."
Alum,1,"Questionable decision to attend school. Lots of religiously motivated students, but a lack of academic rigor sinks overall rating."
Junior,1,"There are many reasons I didn't like Whitworth. Stayed for for 2 and a half years and each year was progressively worse than the last. The campus is a bit small, and the community of students all are ""clicks"", you either fit in or don't, ESPECIALLY the colored students there. I was indifferent to people regardless of skin when I enrolled, but HOLY CRAP the students themselves make the place unbearable. The food service there, SODEXO, also exists in other colleges like Gonzaga, but the food quality between the 2 are night and day. Gonzaga had an amazing selection, tasted great while Whitworth's food was like leftover slob that was only meant to get the students super fat. Nothing bad to say about the professors, all of the one's I had were amazing and genuinely  were interested making sure the students were doing okay, except CORE classes, a huge waste of time. College tuition is a student by student case, which I feel like I didn't get what I paid for. In the end, I regret attending."
Freshman,1,"I attended whitworth university in the fall and only lasted one semester before running home with arms wide open to be happy again. The students here are very happy go lucky and very fake. The campus is very small and the on campus activities and clubs made me feel like I was in elementary school all over again. I could not decide which one of the orientation games I disliked the most, duck duck goose or the ""extreme"" game of Rock Paper Scissors we played. I'm not joking that actually happened. I felt like an outcast my whole entire experience because I could not make any friends. My roommate took rubber gloves and blew them up into balloons and tapped them to the ceiling, watched the office on her laptop with her lab goggles on, as well as set a cerfew for lights out at a VERY early time. I can not stress this enough, Do. Not. Go. To. Whitworth."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no Greek life at Whitworth.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a Greek system
College Sophomore,1,"The party scene is small and you have to know the right people, or you will be sitting in the movie room watching disney movies every Friday night..."
College Freshman,1,It is completely ridiculous that you HAVE to live on campus for two years
College Freshman,1,Only one scholarship is really available to students unless you're not white or play an instrument
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is no Greek system at Whitworth. For me, this was a plus."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a greek system
College Sophomore,1,"They are just always asking for verification for my information, and no one else I know has been asked."
College Junior,1,There are a lot of rules which most universities dont have.
College Freshman,1,"I know this area really well, and we've always gotten super crumby weather for about 6 months of the year. We're talking snow, ice, cold, and just plain ugly. It sucks. Plus, they do an AWFUL job of clearing walk ways. I have fallen so many times trying to get back to my dorm. There's like 3 inches of ice!"
College Freshman,1,"If I Knew, I Wouldn't Have Come â€“ If I knew then the kinds of people who go here, I would have never come. It's just impossible to really know what a school will be like until you're living there and you can see for yourself.

Kids who were really strange in high school, and couldn't find friends end up here, and band together. I had one roommate who would hardly talk to me, and one who was home schooled her whole life (and lacked serious social skills. she honest to goodness skipped from class to class, and watched yu-gi-oh). There's also a lot of pk's (pastor's kids...yes, it's common enough to warrant an abbreviation), and together, it creates a weird dynamic.

Are people there nice? Absolutely. For me, they're a little too nice. I know how strange that sounds (you'd never think that would be a problem, right?), but there all SO polite and positive all the time. Sarcasm is hard to come by, no one will say anything (even in a joking manner) negative about anyone else. Personally, I have mocking, bitter sense of humor, and most of the people who go here just don't understand that sense of humor.

There's dumb dorm activities called ""primetimes"" every single night, and the people who go them are always the really strange kids who are trying to make up for their lack of a social life in high school by showing up to these things every single night."
College Sophomore,1,"The Big 3 Rules â€“ Basically summed into no violent drunken sex.

Do not disrupt community, however they see it.
Alcohol is not tolerated on campus regardless of age.
And 'cohabitation' aka sex is not tolerated as well. 

Very Christian."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Diverse â€“ Whitworth University is mainly caucasian or white.  There isn't very much diversity at all.  In my dorm last year I think the only other diversity in my dorm other than white was asian, and there were only a couple of them.  Whitworth could sure grow with this."

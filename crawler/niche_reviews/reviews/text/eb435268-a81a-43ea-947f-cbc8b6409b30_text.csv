Freshman,5,"I love Design Institute of San Diego because, the energy and will to help of all the staff there is ver supporting each semester. You can feel they are willing and try there best to be there for you no matter what is going on on your life."
Senior,5,"No school is perfect, but I couldn't imagine learning as much as I have here any where else. The general education teachers could be better, but the actual interior design teachers are amazing. Everyone teaching is actually in the field, whether they are designers,or architects, they teach on the side. There is no ""those who can't do teach"" at this school. Besides the teaching staff everyone is family here. I don't know any university where you can say you know all the staff by name and they're interested in what you have going on in your life."
Sophomore,5,"This school is absolutely amazing! The staff is all very helpful and because the school is so small, they take the time to learn your name. All the teachers are real life designers, architects, or artists in the field and are extremely knowledgeable! "
College Sophomore,5,DISD has been such a great fit for me from the quality of the instructors to the depth of the coursework.  I feel like I am getting the best possible education to help me succeed in the real world.
College Senior,5,"Anne Kellet is the adminstrator who runs the internship program here and is a great resource for finding jobs after graduation. Not only is she well known throughout the community but so are our other instructors. Having small classes they get to know you personally and give you great recommendations when you are looking for a job, this industry is all about knowing people and they give you plenty of opportunties to network!"
College Junior,5,Staff is very helpful. Teachers are will to stay after as late as you  need to help you with your issues. also students are nice the school is a great learning environment.
College Junior,5,Mostly Females at this school. every one is friendly. and we all help each other
College Senior,5,Academic Effectiveness – The program is structured for one thing; success. This school thrives on the success of their students and our dedication as students to the design industry does not fail the status quo that this school tries to keep. I am very proud to call the Design Institute of San Diego my college because I know that they have prepared me for success.
Senior,4,"GOOD TO SAY THAT NICE ENVIRONMENTAL IN CAMPUS , and the best part of work to get done before I leave. Mainly because I don't want your trick to getting together , tried calling you but your phone is not working properly."
College Senior,4,"The internship programs help you get a feel of the real world, I think I might choose a different path than direct regular client to designer relationship. I want to work for a big firm, they almost prepare you for your own business here."
College Senior,4,"I will not say that I haven't learned anything, but I think having a very strong drive to learn the most I can. I wasn't pushed to my limits like I wanted to be. I am graduating in two semesters and feel like I could have a greater knowledge that what I currently have. All of the photoshop, CAD, Revit classes should be offered towards the beginning of the second year attended so we have time to progress those skills, I understand that we need a foundation but our projects could have been way more advanced and professionally sound if we learned the skills before. The school also might loose its ACIS accreditation, which is different than CIDA but still something to consider."
College Student,4,"Its a great school. As an interior design college, i thought it would be more aesthetically pleasing but it is okay. I wish they had an option for traveling abroad, even for one semester"
College Senior,4,"The education I am recieving is definitely worth the money, the class sizes are small so you get a lot of individualized attention. They are well known and can really help you find a job after graduation. However, the communication between faculty and students is poor when it comes to the main office. Best advice, ask for a copy of any changes that happen in your file so you can have your own record. Also, when it comes to student events, be proactive and ask questions to faculty and teachers about ways you can get involved. They post some events but there is definitely more out there, you have to put yourself out there!"
College Senior,4,"Staff Is Willing to Help! When i first applied to my school one of the major topics covered was about job placement. They offer plenty of information and assistance, as well as keeping their info up to date with the surrounding job market. Am I hopeful about the current market? No, but I am confident that the admins at my school will listen to my needs and aspirations when it comes time to looking for a job in my field."
College Senior,4,"Professors are always involved in your work and provide critiques. You also learn to critique other pieces of work in a responsible and consideratte environment. They are always available, considerate, and helpful."
College Senior,4,Classes Are Fun. Classes are fun but require some definite time management. You start off with the basics and build on it so your always expanding your range of skills. Professors are top-notch and super credible.
College Senior,4,"Awesome School. Overall this school is great. It is CIDA accredited and the professors are working professionals with ample experience in the field. The curriculum is intense but teaches you everything you need to know for your future career. Since it exclusively offers a BFA in interior design, it easy for students to make friends and quickly become your biggest supporters. They heavily concentrate on LEED, sustainable design, and green practices which is great."
College Junior,4,Staff That Cares – I love my school! The education has been great but what I appreciate the most is how thoughtful and caring the staff is. The financial advisor always keeps me updated on where my money is going and how its been dispersed each semester as well as works hard to make sure I receive the best rates. My dad recently passed away and the past two semester I have withdrawn from my classes because it was all too soon but the school director has been more than understanding and very supportive. Even while not attending classes for the last few months the staff would call and check up on how I was doing. I enrolled in summer classes today and it was so great to be around people that support my decisions and are excited to see me succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"If Your Professor Is Reasonable Then Your Class Becomes Reasonable. Online courses have differed especially in the professor/student relationship and the peep-to-peer interaction. When it's traditional the professor can not only tell you but show you what they mean, and the interaction with peers becomes much friendlier. With online courses you do focus on the task at hand but it can be a little disconnecting. But as long as my teacher is good at communicating (so that even if it's a hard project it is understandable) and doesn't create group projects for an online class (that never seems to work out well) then I've been pretty happy."
College Sophomore,4,Ask Ahead of Time – The education is definitely worth what I'm paying - especially considering it is cheaper than most design schools. You've got to ask ahead of time for help with financial aid just in case you mess up a form and have to have it redone - they'll try their best to inform you as soon as possible so that you can do that if it occurs. As long as you are persistent in keeping up with the financial aid information then it works out very well.
College Sophomore,4,My experience has been great. I asked administration what would transfer over and why and it got done. They've understood when life gets in the way so I've tried my best not to let it. As long as I talk to them I get what I need done.
College Senior,2,"Our school offers a materials library, most everything is discontinued fabric, but we do have an active kravet library. Our library is small, but is the best resource we have because the Library Lisa is amazing and can find you anything you need, and if we don't have it she can go get it! Other than that, we have no sports, student center or many campus activities. With our cirriculium there isn't much time to use other resources anyways."

Sophomore,5,"Ive been very happy with it.  My freshman year was nerve racking at first, but once I get the hang of where my classes where and how to get around, I loved it.  I went up there with one of my best friends as my room mate.  It was like having our own apartment.  It was a lot to take in at first, I didn't think it would be such a big adjustment, but once I got used to it, I loved it.  I didn't get involved in any clubs, I assumed I would do that my sophomore year.  Then Covid hit.  I was very happy with how NMU handled it.  I went home in Late February to finish out my freshmen year.  It was another adjustment, but once the teachers and students alike, figured out elearning, I did pretty good.  My Sophomore year Im still elearning, as I have asthma and am at a high risk, so we decided it was better for me to stay home while they still offered online classes.  I appreciated that they offered online for those of us that wanted or needed to stay home."
Sophomore,5,"It was an adjustment for sure, in February when everything  went online.  It was new to me and it was new to the teachers.  I can't imagine how hard that had to be for them.  As the first couple of weeks went on, it got easier, we all got better organized and I did well that last semester.  I was able to stay home and elearn for the first half of my Sophomore years as well.  i have asthma, so it puts me at higher risk for resperatory illness.  I have been happy with my classes so far.  The teachers have even made some classes half in class and half online, which i really appreciate."
Freshman,5,"Feel safe with Covid, everyone is helpful and welcoming, and I love being in the UP. The professor are very helpful and understanding. All of the department heads are very fastat answering emails and are very helpful with any and all scenarios. The food needs some fixing, but the overall experience here at Northern is wonderful."
Senior,5,"The teacher are very helpful , and they try to make everything easy to understand , they are also very understanding ."
Senior,5,"Other then the fact that Northern needs to add more online classes , the actual classes have very enjoyable ."
Alum,5,NMU is always on the forefront of new technologies to help their students and the community thrive in the digital age.
Alum,5,"Great programs, on a great campus, in a great city! NMU was the perfect school for me. I received a great education while also gaining valuable experience out of the classroom in different on campus groups and activities."
Sophomore,5,"Northern Michigan is an amazing place to be, as it provides comfort and friendship and an overall great relationship with the community outside of campus and inside of it. NMU strives to make students feel at home and yet independent from it at the same time, and with countless places to explore and see, it's a perfect destination for nearly everyone seeking a little bit of adventure with their learning."
Sophomore,5,Northern Michigan has a ton to offer. This school is outstanding and the teacher to student ratio is very good compared to larger schools. The teachers are amazing and very understanding. During finals week everyone is stressed well the school will bring in puppies for you to play and love on to take all the stress away. I choose Northern all the way. Northern also offers breath taking hiking trails and amazing views.
Freshman,5,"I love Northern Michigan University because of it's homey feel. I knew the first day I moved in I wanted to stay there until my degree was finished. The community is amazing, the professors genuinely care about you, and the students are nice and outgoing. It was so easy to make life-long friends within the first couple of weeks! The courses are interesting and the professors always keep it a fun and an enjoyable time. There's always something going on that you can get involved in so you never feel alone or left out.  They have plenty of student services you can reach out to no matter the problem you are having, they really make you feel like you matter and that they are there for you. To be honest, I wouldn't change a thing about Northern, it is great how it is now! They know exactly what they're doing and how to do it. I am genuinely excited to go back this fall."
Freshman,5,"Northern is a tight knit community based school nestled in a wonderful natural area. Since it is a smaller school, there is a smaller student to professor ratio which allows students to get to know their professors much better and are subsequently given great opportunities and aid throughout the duration of their classes. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved with clubs and associations on campus, or even start your own."
Works Here,5,Overall an amazing school! If you are looking to go into Nursing I definitely recommend going here. Friendly staff and community. I've lived here my whole life and am so greatful to stay in the beautiful Upper Peninsula.
Freshman,5,I love this school the location is absolutely beautiful.  They have many amazing opportunities for each major. Living on campus is very nice and their is such a sense of community within the dorms. I’ve gotten involved in my hall government which is super fun. There are so many student organizations available for students to get involved. Overall it is a great campus.
Sophomore,5,"I love Northern Michigan University, I just wish the professors were a little more understanding during times of grief."
Niche User,5,"I haven’t even been yet lol, but this place is a beautiful place. Beautiful scenery, a beautiful campus, greta people and a lot of memories that can be made. I am attending in the fall, but after the college tour my view on the school changed drastically. It’s a very unique school."
Junior,5,"The small class sizes makes it easy to engage with professors. It would be nice to have more advanced equipment, but we're a small school! We get by."
Freshman,5,Northern Michigan University had a lot to offer from a wide range of majors and many things to do around town. One thing that could change would be more in depth on the classes. Not much homework was given and the classes only skimmed the top layer of the subject.
Freshman,5,Great staff and environment! Great local quiet area but there is still plenty to do. Quality education at a fair price.
Alum,5,"I loved NMU, the staff, students and professors are all great.  They all want to see the students succeed in their degree pursuits."
Junior,5,The smaller class sizes allow for more professor-student focus. Most students are willing to help you find your way around and point you in the right direction. Small class sizes also lets students create better relationships and peer-guided discussions.
Freshman,5,I really love northern. I’ve made a lot of friends and haven’t really met anyone I don’t like. Enjoy my classes.
Freshman,5,all of my professors are very easy to understand and when they arent they are helpful when you go to office hours. the environment is so friendly and theres always something to do.
Niche User,5,"Friendly staff, knowledgeable professors, beautiful campus, fantastic resources, and awesome programs. I am so incredibly lucky to be attending this school!"
Niche User,5,I loved the University it had a great homey vibe and had excellent staff. The student life is amazing and there is always something to do.
Freshman,5,NMU is a great place to meet new people and get in touch with your adventurous side. NMU is right off of lake superior and is the best place for getting out doors. From hiking the trails to paddle boarding on the lake they have everything an outdoor lover wants to be apart of and more. The community that each dorm offers is amazing and one of a kind. Each dorm is known for something else whether that be because they are always competitive or love walking the trails they all are the key to new experiences and home to fun traditions. If outdoors isn't for you maybe the athletics NMU offers is. NMU is home to an Olympic training center for Olympic weightlifting and Greco wrestling. They are also home to the NMU wildcat hockey team which goes up against teams in the big 12. Overall the community here is amazing along with the education system.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at NMU has been excellent and above expectation. Northern has welcomed me with open arms and given opportunities I would have never thought could exist to me. I came into Northern on freshmen probation due to my SAT scores and high school grade point average. When I was told I would be put in a program like this I was upset and angered, but it turned out to be the best thing to ever happen to me. The freshmen probation program here at Northern helped me with my learning skills and taught me how to become a better student. I went from graduating high school with a gpa of 2.5 to finishing my first semester of college with a 3.67 and on the Dean’s list. I was super excited that I accomplished a goal like this and was given the opportunity to become a tutor/teachers assistant to kids coming into college who happen to be in the same program as I was. At NMU you are “a student of Northern” not “a student who goes to Northern”. Plus it’s a good day to be a Wildcat!"
Freshman,5,What I liked about Northern University is that the professors show genuine interest and care in student success. I would like to see the involvement of students increase and the social nature of peers to lighten.
Sophomore,5,"The people, the classes, the campus. Everything about Northern Michigan is beyond perfect! Absolutely loved my freshman year!"
Freshman,5,"This school is amazing. I am so comfortable here with the staff, they have excellent resources! The tuition is really cheap, and affordable compared to other schools."
Freshman,5,The campus is small yet extremely nice. Professors are great. Also so much outdoors activities you will never be bored!!
Sophomore,5,The people in charge here are extremely helpful with any problem that may come up and are constantly checking in to make sure everything is going well.
Graduate Student,5,Northern Michigan University is great with communication and easy to apply for. I have enjoyed my time so far.
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, I am in love with Marquette! It is an all-around great place to be! The professors are all about helping you do the best you are capable of!"
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my first year at Northern. I made friends very easily though my dorm life and with the help of my RA setting up events to get us all together. The dining hall at NMU was just redone and is amazing. The Grate is my favorite place to eat because the burgers are so good. The staff at NMU is all amazing. I have always felt welcome to contact my professors and my advisers and other personal at the University. The only thing I would change is air conditioning. in the beginning and end of the year the dorms become very hot. The dorms are not equipped with air conditioners which makes getting cool air to the fourth floor rooms hard.
Sophomore,5,Love the campus. Super beautiful. You are never bored during your free time! So many great classes you can take. The business program is amazing as well.
Freshman,5,You get more one on one time with your professors and they have free tutoring on campus. The campus is very safe because of the location. They have a lot of fun activities to do with over 300 clubs you can attend.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely loved that an individual can be completely surrounded by lush greenery, and know that there's the possibility of seeing the magnificent Milky Way. The campus is amazing, set up so that student are near all campus facilities and not on the perimeter. I love how welcoming everyone is there, and how everyone is more than willing to answer question one may have. In the future, I hope there to be greater diversity,  as majority of the student body is Caucasian."
Freshman,5,Northern has been one of the best schools in my opinion. The community is great and classes are fun. All professors take a great interest in helping you to succeed.
Alum,5,I was in love with NMU from the beginning. The campus was the perfect size for getting around and I never felt unsafe walking alone/at night. The location (Marquette) is one of the most beautiful cities that I have ever been to and life by the lake is fantastic. Academics were wonderful and I became close with so many educators who greeted me even if I haven't been in their class for two years. I only had issues this past year because I remained living on campus in the dorm rooms and I must say that it was a nightmare. I remained uncomfortable living in the dorms because of constant noise and irritation. There needs to be more enforcement on living regulation because not everyone wants to stay up late and many students need sleep. There was never a time where I felt completely comfortable to do homework in my dorm because there were too many distractions around me.
Freshman,5,"Such a personal experience at Northern Michigan University. It becomes a home that you can utilize to make connections not just in your field of study, but as life long friends as well!"
Sophomore,5,"I feel right at home here. The staff are amazing, the atmosphere on campus is warm and welcoming, and the opportunities presented to me have changed me as a person for the better. I'm so lucky I chose Northern!"
Freshman,5,"I love it here, all of the people are really nice and caring. I would like to see the food in the NLD get better."
Sophomore,5,"I moved to Marquette (the city NMU is nestled in) just over 2 years ago and began taking classes almost right away. I had not planned on the move being permanent, but now I don't see myself ever leaving. The upper peninsula of Michigan and Northern Michigan University have so much to offer. The campus is just a few blocks from the southern border of the Great Lake Superior, and the city is surrounded by an immense network of beautifully maintained trails to explore. The classes are generally very small so your professors WILL know you by name, and they genuinely care about your success. Currently I am in the first semester of Northern's BSN program and I am absolutely loving it. The school of nursing at NMU is one of the best in the North West region and I am quickly finding out why."
Graduate Student,5,"Northern Michigan University is located in the largest city of  Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The professors are pretty cool. Winters are treacherous, but  the summer is always beautiful!"
Alum,5,Marquette is one of the best cities in the entire world. Summer in the UP is magic and winter is really fun too but you have to get used to it first.
Sophomore,5,"The food in the cafe is terrible, there are very limited options for people with allergies. The housing is newly updated but they require you to stay on campus until you are of Junior status, which is a wast of money when the food is so lacking. The facilities are great, like I said, newly updated dorms. Marquette and the location is great, lots of hiking and other activities to do and take part in such as cliff jumping, kayaking, swimming, hiking, skiing and snowboarding, snowmobiling, fishing, hunting, and lots more!The people are amazing, very welcoming and outdoorsy."
Niche User,5,"I recently traveled to Marquette Michigan to tour NMU before I graduate in the spring. I am incredibly impressed with the campus, modernized classes, and new dorm rooms."
Senior,5,"Northern is an amazing school! Not only is it less than a mile from Lake Superior and a bunch of hiking trails and the adorable downtown Marquette, but the university is amazing! The professors are always there to help, I don’t think I have heard anything bad about any professors here. The class sizes are smaller which allows for great discussion and opportunities to get the help you need. There are hundreds of campus resources and staff to assist you with any problem to do with school, homework, personal issues, starting a club, planning, etc. They’re currently working on helping rebuild campus and update the residence life and university center. This campus is going to be construction free and beautiful within a year! The students are happier than any university I have ever seen."
Freshman,5,I really like getting hooked up with the laptop. I also really like the center for native american studies because it feels really at home and comfortable. Great class size and lots of fun stuff to do with free time.
Sophomore,5,Everybody on campus has always made me feel welcome. Most of the professors I have had were amazing and are very passionate about what they are teaching.
Niche User,5,"Before visitation to Wild Cat Weekend, I was in love with NMU. I think what really sold me was the amazing photography on their flyers. Things I'd receive in the mail from them were covered in these absolutely beautiful images of life in the Upper peninsula. 
 Upon visiting, I was starstruck. I never knew you could be in love with a place. But Northern Michigan University felt like home. The campus had a large focus on safety and everyone there worked hard to make it feel like a community. Everyone was so genuinely nice. Not to mention the campus itself! Even though it appears to be a larger college, the classes were very intimate. Professors were very caring about each student's individual needs, and were interested in their student's stories. I look forward to visiting again!"
Senior,5,"Professors, administrators, counselors, basically anyone who works for the University will go above and beyond to help and answer any of your questions. There's just something about the U.P. hospitality that's very real here at NMU. They genuinely want you to succeed, and do whatever is in their power to help you. As someone who doesn't have a lot of friends and isn't ""popular"" I feel included and important here. NMU is unlike any other college I looked at (or attended prior to transferring here). Highly, highly, highly recommend."
Freshman,5,"I am just starting at NMU so I don’t know what the the academics are like as of yet. The town is great and has a lot to do, our family housing is nice and well taken care of. I am excited to attend the school."
Junior,5,"Northern Michigan University is a wonderful college. They have professors that care about their students success, as well as friendships that will last forever. The only thing that I would change about Northern Michigan University is that they should care more about students financial struggles. Other than that I believe that you will receive a successful education if you enroll at Northern Michigan University."
Freshman,5,So far my experience at NMU has been nothing but positive. The faculty seem to really care about their studies and as willing to meet 1 on 1 with any student that needs further explanation. The new dorms are fabulous and it is definitely worth the several hundred doller difference to get them. Also the older student know what it is like to be a freshman and help in any way they can to make the transition easier.
Senior,5,It is everything you expect from advertisements and more. If you love being outside and being in a friendly environment then this is the college for you. You will never want to leave the Upper Penninsula.
Sophomore,5,I love that  Northern has diversity and everyone at that college is like a family. I can not think of anything i would change
Niche User,5,"Northern Michigan University from the moment I laid eyes on it felt like home. I was welcomed by everyone in the university, and that was the main reason I chose Northern Michigan University as my home for the next four years."
Junior,5,"I grew up in Marquette, coexisting with the Northern Michigan University community my whole life. I moved downstate to go to school for two years and realized that I missed the energy of Marquette and craved the use of the wonderful facilities & teaching by the amazing professors I had heard about in the Art and Design program. So I moved home last year and now I am a full time NMU student who will recommend this school to everyone I know!"
Freshman,5,"I am born and raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Going to Northern Michigan University has not been a big change in venue and that! I love the setup of the campus, everything is very easy to locate and everything is in walking distance from the residence halls. I also enjoy how incoming freshman are able o have cars on campus, it's a big help to be able to get home more often. There are a few things that Northern Michigan University could improve on. The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas. They could have more of a selection of food throughout the week, which they are also changing for the Fall semester of 2018!"
Freshman,4,Different but the professors have been very understanding and are doing a good job with this transition.
Sophomore,4,"Northern Michigan University is a nice, smaller university nestled in the beautiful upper peninsula of Michigan. With a focus on new and emerging fields, one could easily find a degree that would help them secure a future."
Sophomore,4,"I'm on my way into sophmore year. The general education courses are interesting, and allow a basic understanding of whatever subject your learning without an ungodly workload."
Junior,4,"I can’t imagine attending any other university. The community is the most important and best part of this school, and the faculty actually cares about their students."
Junior,4,The faculty did a wonderful job transferring classes online due to Covid-19. They were kind and flexible with students which meant more than they know.
Senior,4,I took some classes online- it depended entirely on the professor how well the course turned out. I didn’t mind them!
Senior,4,"Although NMU wasn’t super academically challenging for me, I loved the surrounding area and I loved it so much. The hiking and housing was a really nice experience."
Junior,4,"All of my experience online thus far has been good. For some professors, it was quite the adjustment that made it hard for students but they were always there to help."
Junior,4,I like Northern because of how close our professors are and how they take the time to teach us. My program is small so we really get to know our professors and classmates. I also love the campus and how beautiful it is. NMU does a good job at making campus life lively and fun with activities for everyone.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience was very mixed, as taking a few classes online in the beginning was great. Teachers knew what they were doing and were very educational on that aspect, however online teaching during COVID was chaotic and nearly unbearable, but that was a time of crisis and no one is expected to know exactly what to do in those moments."
Sophomore,4,"I wrote over 30 pages every week in order to make up all the work. It was a lot of work, but manageable."
Freshman,4,"its an absolutely beautiful campus, right off lake superior, and surrounded with the beautiful northern Michigan woodlands. The campus is beautiful and well connected allowing you to explore new places, as well as not just feeling like a number on a college payroll. just a warning however, if you aren't from a snow receiving state or are not a fan of snow, Marquette Michigan is probably not the place for you."
Freshman,4,"I would definitely recommend Northern Michigan University. It is a pretty small school, so class sizes are good for a more personalized education. When you aren't in class, there are a lot of other activities outdoors to keep you busy."
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman and this is only my second semester here at Northern but I love it! Moved 8 hours away to attend school here and I haven't felt too homesick. Staff and professors are great, they really want you to do well whether you believe it or not. Advisors are really great as well. Food is amazing, especially the Den. Dorms are good, so far no bad experiences.  Stay Wild!"
Niche User,4,Smaller campus and very friendly faculty. Academic excellence. All the comforts of home with cutting edge technology.
Sophomore,4,I love nature so being in the U.P. is a getaway for me during the school year. Despite all other distractions it's a beautiful and peaceful enough to learn and retain.
Sophomore,4,"Over all, I believe attending Northern Michigan University was the best decision I ever made. I made some great friends, the community feel is incomparable to other colleges, the opportunities offered are endless, there is always something to do or places to explore, etc. Since my first semester it has truly felt like home to me. The only changes I would like to see in the future is better food offered int the dining hall. There are very little options especially for people with dietary restrictions like myself. Lastly the parking availability is very inconvenient. There is almost always little to no parking available because there are so many people who have cars on campus. If I am paying $180 for parking I should not to park a mile away from the dorm halls most days. Other than those two inconveniences, Northern is a great school!"
Freshman,4,"NMU is a wonderful place to truly grow and learn more about your individuality. Northern has given so many opportunities to be apart of a community of students who may feel lost in a new home. I could not be more happy with my college choice and I love the atmosphere thrives in the Upper Peninsula. My only complaint about this school and I am positive I would have the same issue at any other University is paying to be there. I am paying for my own college as a full time student and figuring out new ways to make paying for college more affordable has been a long and ransom road. That of which, I am very ready to find a solution for."
Senior,4,"Wonderful people in the Upper Penninsula make going to school in such an isolated city fun and enjoyable. Oh, the school is good too."
Freshman,4,"So far, NMU has been extremely friendly and helpful with everything I needed.  I am in the process of being accepting and so far everyone and everything has been clean, precise and easy to figure out."
Freshman,4,"I give NMU a ""Very Good"" rating because I've never been to other colleges,  but having attended for one semester so far, NMU is great.  The small-ish campus makes it easy to get around, even if you don't have a vehicle.  The classes are genuinely interesting if you put effort in, and the professors I've had or met so far are all kind and wonderful people.  Plus, to those of whom it makes a difference, I agree with the many people who say that the dining services on campus are really good for a college.  And, in your free time, you can do all sorts of outdoor activities in the beautiful Marquette area.  All in all, it's an experience I won't forget."
Freshman,4,Teachers care deeply about their work and their students. There is an excellent art program as well.
Sophomore,4,"I've had a very good experience at Northern Michigan University. The university is right by lake superior, there are so many hiking trails near by, and then there is the beautiful downtown Marquette. If you are a person who loves the outdoors then this is definitely the school for you. It is a very clean campus, it's a small campus so mostly everything is at walking distance. The professors here are amazing they are very helpful and want to see you succeed. The only downside in my opinion is that the library closes earlier than I would like it to and so does the dining hall, but other than that the school is great."
Freshman,4,"I like the layout of the campus a lot, it's close enough together so walking it cold weather isn't unbearable. There's a lot of fun outdoor activities like hiking, swimming, mountain biking, etc. However, the food is terrible and you have to have a meal plan when you're a freshman."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed the time I spent on Northern's campus last year, but it seems a little more expensive than it should be. While it's the 2nd cheapest university in Michigan, it's still around $25,000 a year, which can make it difficult to afford. Also, while the program I was in didn't suffer this problem, a lot of my friends studying sciences said their classes were too easy. Unfortunately, this might let under-qualified students graduate, but it seems that they get the information they need across in the end."
Junior,4,"Wonderful professors, clean campus and friendly staff to assist and encourage success! They create a healthy learning environment for everyone."
Junior,4,The professors and administration want to see others be successful so they are willing to go the extra mile to help others. My experience has been successful and rewarding during my time here
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the environment surrounding the small community that is NMU. The class sizes are very small, so you can get to know those around you and your professors very well."
Freshman,4,Northern Michigan University is my second home. I feel so accepted and welcome and everyone is friendly.
Freshman,4,"I start my school year at Northern Michigan University this fall.  I have visited the college once and will be headed up there next week to go to my orientation.  The teachers I have talked to have been super helpful and nice and have given me lots of information and opportunities.  The campus is beautiful and clean and new dorms have been recently added.  I highly recommend this school to those who love nature, snow, and a community-like environment."
Senior,4,Community and area are absolutely beautiful and welcoming. That being sad it is a smaller University and Town don't expect there to be something going on every night.
Sophomore,4,The school is beautiful and it is surrounded by things to do.  Lots of winter activities wilderness.  As a freshman the school was very welcoming and they had a lot of resources to help out starting students.
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my experience so far as an NMU global campus student. The process for transferring my previous college credits has been easy. My advisor has also been a friendly help throughout the process as well. I look forward to the semester.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have loved my freshman year of college at Northern! Marquette is an absolutely beautiful city and there is so much nature and beauty to explore. Most of the people here tend to be good-natured and kind, just because that's the Yooper way. I've had a couple of aggravating instructors that do not seem fit to be instructors. However, I've had an overall positive academic and campus life experience!"
Freshman,4,"The campus is wonderful and the surrounding town is gorgeous! If you enjoy the outdoors you will love this college. There is plenty to do around town and on campus such as surfing, hiking, skiing, or just shopping a the local sores. You will meet some wonderful professors that will inspire you fro years to come, while other may not be so great. This year it seems that they have hired a lot of new professors that don't have much experience with teaching though they will likely improve over time. The food is pretty good and they just renovated the dinning hall. There is a wide range of food options and they   accommodate for people with food allergies as well as vegetarians."
Alum,4,"Northern Michigan University is a great college if you want to have a college experience filled with nature and also a mid size city with great community relations. There's so many things to do nature wise including hiking up the two mountains located here, nature walks, seeing ice caves in the winter, access to the beach on lake Superior."
Sophomore,4,"The professors and nearness of Lake Superior are the best things about Northern! On the other hand, the school seems about 95 percent white and Marquette weather is cold for almost the entire academic year."
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at northern thus far. I am a student athlete and really love being a part of such a successful athletic department. When it comes to academics, the professors are really great about helping you completely understand and working with you until you really do understand the material."
Niche User,4,"I've only been up there for a campus tour during the summer, but it was worth it. It had such a beautiful environment and the nicest staff and facility members."
Senior,4,I think this university is amazing. Its small and it is in a great location. A lot of opportunity to get outdoors and discover new things. As a transfer student the dorm life is great. I only wish the university wouldn't put so much money into building new dorms that don't get students involved in residence life.
Niche User,4,"NMU is a good school. Marquette is a safe, fun town with lots of outdoor recreation opportunities. Tuition is reasonable and I was able to pay all of my tuition bills working part time without taking any loans. Professors are easy to get along with and are easily accessible. Campus is small and easy to navigate."
Alum,4,"If you are looking for a school with small classrooms, friendly professors, a campus surrounded by beautiful landscapes (and Lake Superior), awesome local breweries/coffee shops, and an entrepreneurial spirit, then NMU should be on the top of your list. NMU isn't a huge party school with Greek life, tailgates, frat parties, etc. yet there is always something to do in Marquette. NMU is a very special place to earn a degree, and I'm very lucky to be a brand-new alumni."
Graduate Student,4,This school has been amazing so far. The only reason it has 4 starts is because the school is taking away the GA positions from the graduate program I am in for no reason. It makes me so sad because I was guaranteed one.
Freshman,4,"Northern Michigan University is, overall, I good place to study. It offers a broad range of degrees, though it is not considered competitive in many of them. The most striking aspect of NMU to me was the community feeling of it, especially with professors. All of my professors knew my name in the first two weeks of classes, and I already have had two career-related work experiences due to recommendation by my professors. Because of the smaller size of the university, it is somewhat cliquey, but it isn't hard to find a group you belong to."
Sophomore,4,"Fundamentally, it is a great school with many highly educated and acclaimed professor in their prospective fields. The campus staff tends to be friendly and very accommodating regarding am multitude of issues. If you live in the dorms majority of your classes will not be far away which for many students is a benefit."
Sophomore,4,I love being at NMU! Everything is amazing! The professors care about you and are willing to help you if you are struggling. Housing and food is a bit pricy but it’s a beautiful place to live.
Freshman,4,Northern Michigan has a beautiful campus and lots of fun activities to offer. It's a fantastic school that gives a great return on investment.
Niche User,4,I loved the look and feel of the campus and town. College can be a scary changed but I never felt unsafe
Sophomore,4,"Northern Has many passionate professors who are well engaged with students. There are plenty of student events to attend and lots of food to eat. A wide array of classes to choose from.  Marquette, MI itself is a beautiful place to live."
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous, the faculty loves getting to know individual students, and there are a lot of resources that are either free or very cheap. Very nice college, definitely worth the cost."
Sophomore,4,"I love NMU. Campus feels like home to me and the professors I've had were all supportive, understanding, and really wanted to see me succeed."
Senior,4,This was the perfect place for me to get my undergrad. It has a vibrant community and great access to the outdoors. The class sizes are small so you get a lot of one on one with the professors. I loved all of my teachers and they are all highly qualified and love what they do! NMU is the place to be if you love the outdoors!!!
Freshman,4,"I love Northern so far. It’s a nice, small campus so your classes are more personal and you are able to get to know the professors. It’s also in a great area, there is always a new place to hike."
Senior,4,"There's a lot of information that's easy to find. Many different majors and lots of concentrations for many different majors. Many advisers are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. My biggest complaint is it's a money game, but other than that I've had an extremely good time here."
Niche User,4,"I plan on attending NMU in Fall of 2018. I have been around the campus and seen some of the activities. Had to make the switch over, it is amazing!"
Senior,4,I really enjoy school here. The town is beautiful and the university offers maby opportunities for things like undergraduate research.
Sophomore,4,"It's a solid school. Well-rounded Four year education, and very affordable for state residents. The art program here is very respectable; the professors in the school of art and design have very high expectations. I've learned more about art than I ever expected in a few semesters. The English program is rigorous and one of the school's points of pride. Students are required to live on campus through sophomore year if they're under 21 unless they're living with parents within a 60 mile radius. Students can get exemptions for this for medical or financial reasons, but that requires a lot of documentation and usually isn't granted. The Housing office and Dining services make an effort to make living on campus a good experience, but it's not enjoyable for everyone."
Freshman,4,Northern Michigan University is a school that knows how to get students involved. All of the staff is easy to get in touch with and always willing to help. The dining halls are always offering new food items to appeal to all students. There are many job opportunities for anyone and they work around your schedule. Not to forget is the environment around the school being breathtaking and a good weekend pastime. Overall my experience here has been very good.
Freshman,4,"I was really nervous for my first semester of college. Northern had good professor who were easy to talk to. However, being my first semester, I wish I would have had more of an idea on how to register myself for classes. Instead I was thrown in Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry, and so on. That really took a blow to my GPA."
Niche User,4,NMU has a very welcoming campus and students. Every part of campus is accessible from walking to driving your car. There's many places to eat at on campus and even off campus if you want to go around Marquette.
Sophomore,2,"I haven't taken very many online classes yet, but because of the COVID-19 lockdown, classes were suddenly thrown online last semester. With this sudden change, a vast majority of professors and teachers did not know how to work online programs proficiently, and classes suffered because of that."
Sophomore,2,The campus is beautiful and the professors are well educated. The housing staff is not accommodating and very unhelpful. The food is worse than hospital food. Don’t recommend unless you’re there for the nature.
Freshman,2,"I love the location of Northern Michigan University. There are a lot of outdoor activities and other things to get involved in, but the overall academic quality and value of the school is average."
Junior,2,"The campus, location, facilities, most things are fantastic and you will fall in love with it! Finding offices that care or are helpful, i.e. the financial aid office or student service center, is very hard. They messed up my financial aid for 5 semesters so far and I feel as if I am running out of options. I feel as if they care more about the money than the students."
College Senior,2,We don't really have greek life because their is a law against having more than 5 women live in a house in marquette.
College Senior,2,Greek life really isn't a thing at NMU.
College Junior,2,"Greek life is great if you are an incoming freshmen that has not heard their reputation yet. The few frats we have are known for the parties that many women are afraid to go to. The sororities we have are extremely cliquey and the members do not really associate with others outside of the small Greek life community we have. The reputation has gotten slightly better in my few years here, but still not good."
College Sophomore,2,I come from a heavy Athletic school and it's relieving that Northern is not like my old High school.
College Sophomore,2,Partying and drinking are not the reasons I attend school.
College Junior,2,I'm going to graduate in a couple years and I'm not even sure what to do with my major yet.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people smoke on campus, even though we are a no smoke campus. There are people who smoke marijuana and vape."
College Sophomore,2,"unfortunately, no one really appreciates the athletics at northern, which i think has a negative impact on the athletes as well"
College Freshman,2,"First, the residence hall that you want to avoid is West hall. It's extremely far away from everyone else and not social one bit. I think the roommate choosing process is horrible. My roommate is the complete opposite of me, so I don't know how we ended up living together. I think the social atmosphere is great if you aren't shy. I made a whole bunch of friends."
College Sophomore,2,"There were only a few things I liked about NMU. The people are very friendly and class room size are small so its easy to get the teachers attention. However, there are some issues I faced. First of all, the weather is a problem. If you're not used to the cold, it can be really difficult. NMU lacks diversity, even though you would find a few number of international students. They are mostly exchange students and if you're lucky you would find at least one person to get along with.  The food is terrible so its best to cook by yourself. The place is the middle of nowhere and if you're an outdoorsy person who loves hiking and skiing, this is definitely the place for you. Overall, I wouldn't attend this school if I had the chance to do it all over."
College Sophomore,2,"It's not easy to walk into parties like it would be at a bigger school. That said, when you can find them, they're a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,2,It's so hard to find scholarships
College Freshman,2,"Safety wise, I usually feel safe walking around. But the campus authorities try to sweep sexual assaults under the rug and not inform the public the way we should be informed."
College Freshman,2,"The food is absolutely awful, the general areas in the dorms aren't kept clean, and everything is beyond expensive. The wifi goes out all the time making it difficult to do homework, and there's never hot water."
College Freshman,2,I have no idea what I am doing and I can't ask the family for financial help as I live in the lower lower financial brackets..
College Freshman,2,Everything is far away. Cabs cost too much as well
College Sophomore,2,I have not since anything for housing off campus yet.
College Junior,2,There is little greek life on campus and it easily forgotten. Many student just try to avoid it or go just to the parties. Many times you see the different houses fighting and hear lots of complaining but its kinda a hit or miss deal.
College Student,2,There really isn't much greek life that i know of.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather in Northern Michigan is brutal.  If you cannot handle the cold this is not the school for you.  If you don't mind bundling up, there is lots of winter fun here."
College Junior,2,"It is very snowy and freezing cold. Sidewalks are slippery. When the weather is warm and the sun is out, it is beautiful."
College Freshman,2,"When there are parties, they can be a good time but rarely there are parties here"
Recent Alumnus,2,Nothing sets my school apart from different schools it sucks
College Sophomore,2,The computers the school requires are to pay for are crap! They are horrible computers!!!
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have a large greek life up here because of past issues within the city, so there isn't even a greek row. I believe there's only like 6 frats and sororities because the regulations to start a chapter up here are so strict and its hard to expand the greek life because of it. However, most of our greeks are nice, but the fraternities are more known for being rude or caddy than the girls are...."
College Senior,2,I never know what is going on with financial aid. They do a horrible job of explaining what is going on and I dread having to deal with anything to do with the financial aid office.
College Freshman,2,"Drugs are used by some, haven't heard of any problems or arrests."
College Senior,2,"It's easier to use your own computer at NMU.  We have WiMax capabilities and President Obama has been to NMU to praise and explore the WiMax at NMU.  However, we have two different computers issued to students.  ONLY art majors, not minors or other students, receive a MacBook Pro.  Very nice computer.  All other students receive a very old, slow Lenova Notebook.  It is a piece of crap and I actually switched from an art minor to a double  major in art and writing so that I could receive the MacBook to make my art classes easier.  WiMax is available for everyone at NMU, if you don't have a MacBook issued from the college, you  must pay for the WiMax connecter."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not prominent at NMU.  Every time I've visited the campus and stayed for awhile I haven't seen many frats or sororities.  From the people I know that are in them they have a close bond with the others in their groups however they interact and welcome everyone else as well.  These groups are nice for making friends and having parties but they don't dominate the campus like I've seen at other campuses I've been to.
College Sophomore,2,Marquette Michigan is sort of a small town so there is not really a big public transportation need. There is a campus shuttle that takes you where ever you need to go if it is within the confines of the University. If you wanted to get to somewhere off of campus there is a taxi service but it is quite expensive for a typical college student
College Freshman,2,"I just finished my freshman year and didn't get to take many classes that pertain to my major. My business law class was very interesting, it was one of the few business classes I took."
College Freshman,2,Everyone receives a decent lap top. They don't come with a cd drive which can be inconvenient and they are extremely slow at connecting to the internet when you go to different spots on campus.
College Freshman,2,I applied for many scholarships and did not receive much in financial aid as I was hoping. The process was easy though.
College Freshman,2,"The school is pretty strict with underage drinking and any type of drug use. If you're going to do either of those things just be smart about it, and don't make an announcement about what you're doing."
College Freshman,2,"As a dweller of West Hall, my parking is very close, but everywhere else on campus you're pretty much S.O.L. if you are a freshman. Figuring out where you CAN park according to your pass is also difficult."
College Freshman,2,"It depends on which dorm you live in if you see drinking and drug use. There are two main dorms where the drinking scene is very prominent, those are Hunt and Gant halls. Some other halls you'll see some drug usage and drinking but it won't be as prominent as these halls."
Sophomore,1,The school is in a very cool location but that is about it. Seems that a lot of prof don't know what they are doing or don't care. The dorms are brand new and are already falling apart. They also charge you fo every little thing at this school to make the most money.
Senior,1,"The parking is absolutely terrible. Do not go here if you don’t want to live on campus. There is nowhere to park so you pay for a parking pass and never use it and they won’t even refund the cost of the parking pass. The professors do not care about anyone at all. If everyone is failing, they will just curve it so the top people in the class pass so they don’t look like a terrible professor on paper. This college is 100% just about making money. They do not care about their students whatsoever"
College Freshman,1,There are really no parties.
College Freshman,1,"The MP has repulsive food. The fruit and vegetables are often moldy and/or frozen, food is often undercooked or old."
Recent Alumnus,1,Theres nothing to do to. the town sucks and it lacks diversity big time
College Sophomore,1,"In the winter, the whole campus is an ice rink and people constantly fall. Also the parking lots freeze over and the cars get stuck!"
College Sophomore,1,"They're in the process of renovating all the dorms. The renovated dorms are what I live in, otherwise all the other dorms have asbestos and are run down. Also, noise is a HUGE issue so if you're living on campus expect it and accept it. We all had to deal with it. "
College Sophomore,1,"The parking permit is expensive, and you don't have many options to choose from to park in. You would think for as much as we pay for parking passes we could have more options. And the parking enforcement is top notch, so expect a ticket if you break the parking regulations even once. Annoying."
College Junior,1,"The availability of parking spaces is totally bad. Many students park out on the streets, near by so they don't have to pay for a parking permit, and although many students do this, even if you have a parking pass, students, who have parked on the street probably have a shorter walk unto campus. Many times in the student parking lots you see cars waiting to find a parking spot. Many suggest, skip buying to parking pass and just park on the street, the only thing is that you many need to arrive 10 minutes early to insure finding a parking spot on the streets nearby campus."
College Freshman,1,"Public saftey are very okay with writing you an mip, And get kids in trouble. Very hard to get away with things. The Ra's are okay with writing you up. These things often make me want to transfer."
College Freshman,1,"Everything's expensive, horrible, and sketchy. As a pizza delivery driver, I've seen the inside of basically every apartment complex in the city, and I have been impressed by exactly NONE of them - aside from the on-campus Woodland Park apartments."
College Freshman,1,"I loved the fall weather. I'm a sucker for rain and thunderstorms. However, once December came, the greyness set in and never disappeared, and January and February were endlessly snowy. It's March now and neither of those has disappeared yet.

In short, it's cold, grey, and snowy here. You'll have to dig your car out of the parking lot quite often."
College Freshman,1,"What transportation? There is a local bus service, but it's incomprehensible as far as I'm concerned (it's free with a student ID though, which is a plus). NMU is five hours away from the nearest big city (Milwaukee, if you're curious) and is the largest city for 140 miles (Green Bay is the next), which is quite remarkable when you consider that it has a population of 21,000 people.

What does this mean? If you want to go anywhere or do anything, you need a car and money for gas...or friends with those."
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene and alcohol scene is very prominent here at NMU. Over 75% of people do one or the other, or even both."
College Freshman,1,The RA's and RD's take drugs seriously and there is zero tolerance for it on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Do not, I repeat, DO NOT take the buses that go downtown. The schedules are always f***** up and you'll have to walk back to campus... Uphill... In the snow... With groceries..."
College Sophomore,1,"We Need More – Northern Michigan University is not a very diverse school.  Our president has tried to get other ethnicity's to join this community; however, I am not sure it is working.  We are the second cheapest school in the state, but that does not mean everyone can afford it.  Many of the students who attend NMU come from lower Michigan or neighboring states.  This campus is not known for anything in particular; therefore, it is  harder to attract a diverse population.  Hopefully NMU can come up with a few new tactics to get more diversity here."
College Senior,1,There are a limited number of Greek opportunities at NMU. The city of Marquette has passed an ordinance which prohibits frat/sorority houses and has made it difficult for many to take off.
College Freshman,1,"So Visible Sometimes, It's Invisible – Not saying that it's absolutely horrible, but there is more users than I'm used to being around.  What bothers me about drug use is that to some extent, it's more out in the open than it should be, and the people that are doing drugs out in public hardly ever get caught."
College Freshman,1,"Needs Improvement – The parking is pretty dumb. Freshman park ""far"" away and have their own parking lots, while everyone else has to share 2 parking lots that are right next to the dorms. Also some of the lots aren't used at night because they are commuter lots; making empty space that could be used. The need for a car is pretty average to needed because Target and Walmart and those places are on the highway which is about a 5-10min drive."

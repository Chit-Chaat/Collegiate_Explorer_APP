The education has been top tier, most of the professors are compassionate, understanding, and more than willing to work with their students. Campus life is super fun, with a variety of fun organizations that help with your professional development. The freshman dorms are ok, but they do need some renovating. The food is also ok, but a little more variety would be great."
Freshman,5,"The university of South Dakota is by far the best school in the state. Big school opportunities, small school environment. Not to mention a world renowned music faculty."
Freshman,5,"I just started going to college at the University of South Dakota. I love it here. I have made some of my closest friends here. The teachers are nice, understanding, and always willing to help. The dorms are old but very homey. They have a wide array of food options available also. They have a cafeteria with good food, and they have a lot of restaurant chains available also. The RA's are very friendly, and they are always willing to help you out. Weekends are fun here, and there is always something to do. I am not transferring from USD. I love it here!"
Junior,5,It's a big university feel in a small town. There are many opportunities and people are really friendly and helpful.
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in high school. I will be attending USD in the fall of 2020. I am ecstatic about going! I have visited USD many times, and I love the school. The dorms are nice, the academics are very good for the price you have to pay, and the student life seems really lively. I am excited to start my college journey."
Sophomore,5,Everyone at USD really cares about the success of the students. All of the staff are easy to work with from Admissions to Professors.
Sophomore,5,I love attending The University of South Dakota. It has the big school feel when it comes to parties and friends while keeping the connections with your professors and short walking distance to classes. The professors are helpful and experienced. The campus is beautiful.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here and I absolutely love it here. Such a homey campus, it's feels just like home. The people here are so nice and welcoming, as well as the administration. They do everything they can to make you feel as comfortable as you can be."
Sophomore,5,I am in my second year at the University of South Dakota and I am loving it! The school is very involved with the students and I found this very helpful as a new student in the first few weeks I was there. I lived in the dorms the first year and made lots of new friends with people on my floor and throughout the building. The cafeteria has a wide variety of food options for students with a meal plan. They also have many different food chains in the MUC that give students plenty of options when it comes to mealtime. The classes at USD are very inclusive and informative. They have helped me prepare for the following years of school very well.
Freshman,5,The campus is great. Its small and everything is within 10 minutes. All of the professors and teachers I have had have worked with me and helped me do my best.
Junior,5,"I am a second time around USD student and it is what I was set out to do, and it called me back. The campus has since improved and the staff are very accommodating.

I see that this is such an amazing place to learn and am glad that I have the chance to be able to be a part of USD."

Niche User,5,The Admissions counselor is very nice and welcoming. Very informational and useful. I toured the campus and it is beautiful and the students who attend are pretty nice.
Sophomore,5,My favorite part about USD is that I am clear on what I need to do to get to where I want to be. I have all my classes planned and laid out for all my four years. This is nice to have a be able to know so keep me on track not be confused about certain requirements. I also really like my class size because I feel instead of being in a big lecture hall. My tuition is a very reasonable price that makes me feel better about knowing it will be easier to pay off less debt than some other places I could have went to.
Freshman,5,"A beautiful campus that enriches you with a great amount of learning opportunities, social life, and amazing resources to help you succeed. The faculty here is so kind with all of their interactions and so generous with their time. If you want to explore who you are as a person, find out your interests, and become a successfully independent version of yourself I highly recommend considering the University of South Dakota for the next step in your education."
Freshman,5,"When I came her for a visit, I knew from the moment I walked on campus that it felt like home. Living 4 hours away is hard when you move to a school and know no one, but as soon as I moved in I made friends that will last a lifetime. 
I picked the University of South Dakota pacifically for my major, but it offered so much more when I got here. I am active in intramural, a member of the Dakotathon, and volunteer at Adopt a School. 
Staying in South Dakota meant a lot to me, and it means even more to be at a school that cares so much about making me feel I am not actually 4 hours from home, my home is here. Go Yotes!"
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore attending the University of South Dakota and I couldn't love it more!
I am pursuing my Bachelor's of Business Administration with a major in Human Resource Management and a minor in Marketing. The Beacom School of Business has incredible professors and faculty that ensure learning and success are priority."
Freshman,5,I love the professors and the advisers. Everyone here has been extremely helpful and the community is great! Meeting people is easier then ever and classes are set up in a great way.
Sophomore,5,I like how easy it was to make friends. I made a lot of my friends on the first few days of being moved in. The atmosphere at USD is just captivating. I am excited to learn when I am there. I want to do the best I can in my classes when I am there. The staff is very friendly and very helpful when it comes to having any concerns. I truly feel at home when I am on campus.
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Dakota is definitely the best college for me! I love the atmosphere, the campus, the courses, and the infinite possibilities of success. The professors are great influences to help you in any way, even if it does not involve the courses. As an incoming freshman, you are ensured to have a great experience. The transition may be tough, but there are other college students that felt the same way and they and the professors are great at making you feel at home and like you belong and deserve to be there. I absolutely love this college and I can not wait for my next 3 more years!"
Sophomore,5,I love USD!  The school and community are amazing along with the athletic and art programs! All of my teachers were amazing and I'm excited to spend my next 3 years here and am actually thinking about moving here personally! The only problems I've had with USD are that you can't do much unless you are a part of a sorority or are friends with everyone in a sorority and that the dorms or freshman dorm weren't very well maintained.
Junior,5,"I honestly love the University of South Dakota. All of the teachers are amazing and willing to do whatever it takes to help their students learn. The classroom sizes range from 20 people to around 100 and fewer people are enrolled in each class as you get into upper level studies. I enjoy all the activities the college sets up because it helps students get involved further than just going to class. There are an endless amount of clubs and programs to join to help a student feel more at home. If I could change anything about the University of South Dakota I would change the location. The town is very small, but this has its pros and cons. The town has really nothing to do which causes weekends to be boring, but this also helps me feel the need to study more."
Junior,5,"What I really like about the University of South Dakota is how close I feel to other students and the faculty. Honestly, everyone feels like a family here! The campus and nice and small, and the dorms always feel like my home away from home. It's so easy to get to know everyone here and to feel like I'm truly a part of something bigger than myself. The education I've been receiving here has been excellent! The professors really know how to listen to each and every student and cater to their needs. In my 2 years at USD so far, I have not had a single negative experience that made me second guess choosing this university. I've met so many new friends here that I wouldn't want to ever lose; they make me feel like I belong here and have a bright future ahead of me! All in all, USD has definitely made me feel like I made the right choice in picking the college path that ultimately unlocked the rest of my future opportunities."
Sophomore,5,The University of South Dakota provides a great environment for academics and student life. The campus offers a plethora of groups and clubs open to all students and strives to find a place for everyone. The food options on campus are diverse and the same goes for off campus dinning. Every Professor is welcoming and willing to work with you in order to better your experience in their class and at the University.
Graduate Student,5,"USD offers a great place to focus on your academics. USD is in Vermillion, South Dakota, which is a small town and has a small town feel. There are many phenomenal local restaurants found in the downtown area that offers many varieties. There are many local bars that fellow students frequent throughout the year and offers a get away from academic life. Vermillion is a small town that doesn't have a lively weekend scene, but Sioux City and Sioux Falls are 30 minutes and one hour away, respectively."
Sophomore,5,"The community is very welcoming to incoming freshman, the new transfer students, and all the returning students. The campus life is diverse and the academic clubs and activities that students can get involved in are plentiful. Students have a vast variety of housing, fraternity and sorority options, meal choices and more! I personally like the small size of the campus. It makes it easier to get to my classes on time. Athletically, the football games in the dome are the best! USD has their very own rock-climbing wall built into our wellness center and it is the biggest in the state of South Dakota. I love this university!!"
Freshman,5,"I love the University of South Dakota! It makes college very organized. They are great at getting people out and about to do things and meet new people. I have enjoyed this school and can't wait to come back! I only wish that there was more as well as better parking. The spots can be annoying to get to, or you cant park close to where you would like to go."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at USD, I have just started my college experience.  At USD, the professors I have had so far have been excellent.  Most have gone out of their way to offer help with the transition to college. USD has a wide variety of event for students to do on campus.  Although Vermillion is a boring town, you can always find something to do.  USD may not be the most spectacular school out there, but it is truly what you make of it.  I am excited to finish my degree here at USD."
Niche User,5,The university of South Dakota has a wonderful academic majors. The professors are knowledgeable and so helpful.  The campus is safe and friendly. The university has wonderful opportunities in the field of health care and medicine.
Junior,5,The small campus brings a lot of family environment around. The town is a everyone knows everyone type of place so it makes the experience even better. The love you will receive from everyone you would think the people are related to you. The football games bring the whole town together!
Sophomore,5,I think the University of South Dakota is a great school to go to. They have numerous involvement opportunities for students to sign up for and they make sure to always have something going on each day.
Senior,5,"I believe my professors and academic advisers have very well prepared me for success. There are many academic support systems on campus that can be utilized. I feel as though all professors I have met really care about their education as well as mine. Some of the buildings are older and need updating, but overall the school is really great. They do have too much emphasis on athletics."
Sophomore,5,"I've attended the University of South Dakota for 2 years now and I absolutely love it here. USD professors and advisors genuinely want students to do well and will go above and beyond to support you in doing so. Very understanding, professors engage students and are always available to help. I can't recall ever having a bad or even lacklustre professor, all of them (even SI instructors, TAs, and grad school professors) have been incredible. Highly recommend!"
Freshman,5,I like that there are so many different meal options rather than having to eat the same thing day after day. I also like that USD puts on events frequently to keep students involved. One thing that I don't like is that printing isn't free.
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at USD and I really enjoy going here. It may be in a small town, but USD puts on many events for anyone to do so you always have something to do."
Freshman,5,"I attend the University of South Dakota through the University Center. It is wonderful, the online classes have great professors and I am getting a lot out of my education! I cannot wait to finish my degree and join the work force as a nurse and be completely prepared."
Freshman,5,"The University of South Dakota was one of my top choices when applying to colleges, hence the reason I am here today. The campus here is great, it is not too big so you do not have too far to walk to class. Everything is within walking distance if you are living on campus. The food is great, and you also have many fast food type options as well. The professors are phenomenal, they are willing to do whatever they can to help you in their class. They are easy to talk to and give great instructions."
Niche User,5,"I am currently enrolled to the University of South Dakota where I will be starting classes in the fall of 2018. In December of 2017 I took a tour of the college with my family and instantly fell in love with campus and its atmosphere. My mother went to the University of South Dakota when she was younger and always tells me how much fun she had and how many great memories she made. I can't wait to make those memories too, and share them with my future family."
Freshman,5,"I have no complaints about the University of South Dakota. The faculty and staff are respectful, helpful, and kind. There are multiple resources for educational purposes, and plenty of opportunities for recreational fun. Not only is the campus great, but the town of Vermillion is a wonderful place to live."
Junior,5,"I have had a wonderful experience while being a student at the University of South Dakota. My first two years of college, I took online courses through USD. Fall of 2017, I finally began to attend classes on campus and am now in the dental hygiene program. I am pleased with the learning experiences I have had, and all of my professors have been very helpful."
Sophomore,5,It is a great experience very me I believe.  The campus is a good size and is not spread out so you don't have to walk a large amount to get to a class.  If there is one thing I could change it would be to add another dining option on campus for students.
Sophomore,5,"It is a great campus with lots of school spirit. There is some clique issues due to the small school, however it is a very welcoming school."
Junior,5,Loved my time here! It’s a lovely campus and town filled with lovely people! USD has been an amazing choice for me and I couldn’t change that for the world
Freshman,5,The University of South Dakota is a Fantastic school! It has a vide variety of majors and classes you can take. You will definetly feel at home when you visit campus.
Sophomore,5,"I could go on and on about how much I love attending USD! The campus is beautiful with lots of blooming flowers throughout the year. The students are very diverse here and with over 10,000 students at USD I have met a ton of new people and will forever be grateful of USD for introducing me to them!"
Freshman,5,"Great school with great teachers who want you to do well. Flexible format makes it easy for the working student,"
Junior,5,"The University of South Dakota is a small but comfortable campus. My favorite part about USD is their small and personable classes. This offers more one-on-one time with professors, which is very beneficial and makes you feel more involved in the classes. I believe if they had more healthy dinner options on campus, it would make USD 100% awesome."
Sophomore,5,"There are great resources for struggling students as well as a multitude of activities for those who get bored with just coursework. Overall, this is a great university set in a small town."
Junior,4,"I've taken a few online courses and for the most part they are average in difficulty. The material is easy to find and understand. Some online classes, it is hard to take notes yourself and completely understand what your learning. The teachers answer student question at a timely manner."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at USD was an amazing year, I was sad that it got cut short due to corona virus, but I am happy to return in the fall! The professors are great, and I love living on campus at USD."
Sophomore,4,"Since our semester got cut short due to corona virus, we had to transition to online learning. At first is was a little confusing because something like this has never happened before, but it got easier."
Sophomore,4,"I always knew that I would probably attend the University of South Dakota. Honestly, I have loved almost every second. When we were told we would have to complete the rest of the semester online I was so devastated. I wasn't surprised given the circumstances, but all the people I had met during my first semester, I wouldn't get to see until the next semester. I have enjoyed every professor and class I've taken part in. All professors are understanding and want what is best for each of their students. Also, the atmosphere around campus is so safe and just inviting and fun. I think I definitely was able to make so memories and can't wait for the rest of the college memories. I would always recommend USD to those considering it an option. Being on campus gives off a close-knit group of people who can't wait to pursue their future. Everything seems well put together and everyone is so friendly. I am proud to be a coyote!"
Freshman,4,I love going to school here! People here are very nice and I love the atmosphere. Professors are very helpful and want to see their students succeed.
Junior,4,"The University of South Dakota is on the smaller side for a public university with roughly 12,000 students enrolled here. However, this fits really well with me as it means the classes are also smaller. All the professors and advisers are very friendly and willing to help the students graduate and find jobs after. The only thing is that it is located in a small town, so if you are used to city living it can take a bit of an adjustment."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy being part of the excitement at the University of South Dakota. I love how the professors treat the students, how you are able to talk to your professors one on one if you are struggling, and I also love the size of the campus because everything is close together. I also enjoy going to the athletic games because they bring so much excitement in the air. I also like how easy it is to get involved on campus if that is getting involved by being on a intramural team to being a in different clubs and organztions. I think USD is the perfect fit for me."
Senior,4,What I like about the university of South Dakota is the feasibility to accomplish your educational goal. They have many great faculty and professors.
Sophomore,4,"This college has a beautiful campus that makes it enjoyable walking to classes. All of the professors I have had have truly cared about the students and want them to do the best they can do, and they want to help them however they can."
Alum,4,I wish I would have worked harder in school it might have been better. Excellent facilities excellent teachers. They really are willing to work with you if you just put the time in
Junior,4,"The people and staff are very friendly and helpful. I do wish that the online nursing program would not require useless lab tests and background checks on a yearly basis as this is an additional fee. As an online student who is working on my RN to BSN degree, it is not a requirement to attend on-site clinicals. I do not understand why the extra expenses."
Freshman,4,There are a lot of things that make the University of South Dakota very good. The first thing that is awesome about the University of South Dakota is it is close to my parents so I can come visit them easily. Another thing is the food is good there. And the teachers are uplifting and easy to follow along with.
Alum,4,"USD has everything you could possibly want in terms of academia and student involvement. It is also located in a lovely, safe little town and costs less than many, frankly, shitty universities."
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience at USD has been a good one. The academic and nursing school is held at a high standard and provide a high level of education. The party scene at USD is very high if you would like to be apart of that. I choose not to be. The food is good on campus. The local area is not that great. There is nothing to do in the winter besides the gym and eating at local food restaurants which are actually pretty good."
Graduate Student,4,"Everywhere on campus is easy to get to. The grounds are always well taken care of and look pretty. The town is rather small and there isn't a whole lot to do outside of campus life. The student center has some awesome restaurants to eat at, but the campus dining hall isn't very good. Classes are usually kept under 40 students, which is great. Online classes being offered is very helpful."
Freshman,4,I have had great commutation with the school so far. They try their best to make sure I am getting what I want. I'm very glad they are working their best to make sure I'm doing good.
Senior,4,The university is very help when advising and if you transferring into the university. Also it's low in cost but the funding could use a little more work.
Freshman,4,"very friendly college, welcoming, never feeling threatened or hurt. the professors are always there to help will never let you down. Fairly small college campus but you meet someone new everyday so its big enough"
Sophomore,4,"I’ll be joining USD’s nursing program this August. I’m happy to say that they accommodate their students. While I didn’t want to leave my parents to live 6 hours away from my home town, I’m lucky enough that my university has an off campus site in my city. This way I can live with my parents and save on extra costs of living while I pursue my BSN degree. They’re accepting of other class credits from other area schools so you don’t have to go to the main campus for your general classes. I’m very thankful that they allowed me this opportunity."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus and the small town aspect. The newer dorms are amazing and the older ones are sufficient.
Freshman,4,I liked this college because of the career I chose. One thing to improve cleaning the streets and sidewalks.
Niche User,4,I love the environment created on campus. It feels like home to be there and it is very welcoming. There are so many clubs that you can join which makes it super easy to be involved!
Freshman,4,The University of South Dakota has great faculty and staff to help us students get the best education we can.
Sophomore,4,"USD is an exceptional school that is very underrated in academics and athletics. The professors are very personable and really care for their students' well-being, and the campus is new, clean, and safe. My only issue is with the administration, specifically the business office and admission in charge of budgetary and financial services. As someone who has experience in running companies, I can clearly see when an organization is poorly run and managed. The school needs new leadership."
Sophomore,4,"Professors actually care about the students education. The school has a wide variety of on campus activities for the wide varieties of average, broke, college kids."
Sophomore,4,"USD has wonderful teachers. So far, I've had a very positive experience with all my teachers. The dorms are pretty standard and could stand some renovations especially in North Complex. The fine arts building is also in need of repairs. Slagle aka Aalfs auditorium is beautiful ."
Junior,4,I attend at the Rapid City Campus. The class size is small so you get more one on one time. The cost of attendance is more reasonable than other colleges/universities.
Sophomore,4,"The University of South Dakota provides great diversity to its students--whether that diversity be in campus events, housing, or academics. There is something for every student at USD, no matter their background or interests."
Freshman,4,Exciting atmosphere to be around and there are many opportunities to get involved and meet new people.
Freshman,4,"The college is excellent for those who want to go into science or medicine. It's located in a small town (with not a whole lot to do), and the campus is fairly large. I've had a fairly good experience with USD, having only been here a single semester. The faculty is incredible and the majority of the students are also nice."
Junior,4,"People on and off campus are very friendly and humble. Even though the campus is very small, it is easier to walk from place to place especially when you do not have a car and you're from out of state.
I do wish there were a variety of places to go to for hangouts and entertainment.
Overall, I think the campus is really nice and affordable school to attend to."
Freshman,4,"As an online student, my experiences in the university are very limited compared to students living on campus."
Junior,4,"The University of South Dakota is a good school if you like a small-town vibe. The downtown scene is great, the town is situated right next to a major river, and is only a half hour from a bigger city, and 45 minutes from the biggest city in South Dakota. They have great programs, although I wish they'd offer more classes in certain subjects. The dorms, for the most part, are kept well and there is a variety of options for off campus housing."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the town of Vermillion and the home atmosphere it gives you. The best part about USD is the town and the people that reside here. It is a small school and a small town, yes, but both of those factors help to make it feel so comfortable here. I have made so many amazing connections through USD to the town, and I have had some awesome opportunities because of it."
Freshman,4,"A very good school, small classes and great professors! I wish there was more diversity on campus, but it obvious the University is making a step in that direction with cultural days and speeches."
Sophomore,4,"The University of South Dakota is an institution dedicated to learning. I love how on campus, one can feel the energy and excitement of a place dedicated to staying current and cutting-edge. However, I believe the school could work on expanding its meal plan options (especially for vegans). But overall, USD is a great institution, and I believe I am receiving a quality education. Go Yotes!"
Freshman,4,"My favorite thing about USD is that it isn't a really big school, so it feels more like a family. Nothing is too far away and the people are always nice a willing to help if you need it. You get to meet a lot of great people and the professors are all really nice, and enjoyable to work with. I also love USD because it is not to far from home, it is nice to know that if I need to see my family I can."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at USD and I love it so far. Vermillion isn't very big and if you don't want to go somewhere that is very big and the town is the college, then Vermillion is the place for you. It is a little higher in price, but that is what you pay for when you go to a University."
Niche User,4,I loved the size and the layout. I love the size of the school and the fact that it's also D1. One thing they can improve on it there map design. I was a struggle to read.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at USD has changed me in more ways than one. I've learned how to finance my money better, especially when grocery shopping. Its taught me how to make my schedule fit the daily rigors of class and studying in the library. Party scene is amazing once I've figured out the different avenues of getting in or just linking up with people to chill with."
Freshman,4,"The school has a really good environment. All of the people are very nice, and the professors are very helpful."
Niche User,4,It is a small student to teacher ratio which I liked! Small town which is hard to adjust to if you go from a bigger town to verm.
Junior,4,I currently attend USD. I say is fun going to class. Meeting people. Just enjoying the college experience. To get best out the university like any school you have to get involved in activities and clubs. I join fraternity freshman yr. That made for great experience and I did intramurals floor hockey. I say college is how you decide to live it if you live as hermit and don't try new things. It might not be fun but if your up for the challenge of exploring outside your comfort zone. Usd is great school that you will enjoy.
Sophomore,4,It's fairly laid back in my experience and everything is within walking distance. USD has a friendly student body and some really great professors. It also has a great party scene and definitely ranks among the top 3 SD state schools.
Junior,4,"The University of South Dakota offers a high quality education for a reasonable cost to students. The campus is growing and the programs offered continue to impress me and my fellow students. While the surrounding community is a quintessential small town, this mid-sized college offers exciting possibilities for people ready to experience what the Midwest has to offer."
Freshman,4,"While your student life can be a hit or miss, depending on who you surround yourself with, you get a lot of your money's worth here compared to most places."
Senior,4,"The University is small enough to walk everywhere, but have very harsh winters with no tunnels. The cafeteria food would fall at 3 stars. Some of the buildings have been renovated and have good architecture/technology, however some have not. The also favor the athletes and don't favor the art majors."
Senior,4,"Overall, great experience throughout. The campus is beautiful not too big and not too small. I believe it is a perfect size. I am originally from California, but I am glad that I got to experience school in South Dakota. All though the small town vibe can seem kind of daunting at times, the environment and the people make it all better. It seems that you get to know everyone. Professors also seem to put in the time to make sure that everything is being understood, or help with anything necessary. As well as advisors, especially those on campus. They literally help you with everything. Overall, great school!"
Freshman,4,"It's a really fun school. There are a lot of fun activities planned all the time so you never really get bored. Also, there are MANY different areas for studying in case your room isn't quiet enough for you."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed that there were help sessions for chemistry. I loved the ways that they got the students to interact through different activities and events. The activities are very fun to participate in whether it being through the sport, or just cheering on the teams."
Sophomore,4,"The university of South dakota is a great undergraduate school known for its low costs and good professors. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the winters are very cold. But the as far as social life goes, USD is the most underrated party school in the US according to a few articles in closing this one (https://www.follownews.com/the-university-of-south-dakota-is-the-most-underrated-party-school-in-america-25co7). If you want an education with out going into debt over 6 figures this is the place to go."
Freshman,4,"As a college freshman, I was very shy at first. At first, it seemed like I couldn't make any connections. But, my floor RA's gave me great advice on how to make valuable connections. The professors are very knowledgeable and are able to work with students. I would certainly recommend this university to anyone who is looking for a well rounded, liberal arts based education. I would like to maybe see more variety in food and other music opportunities like concerts come to the university, but other than that, this college is great for any incoming student."
Sophomore,4,Great college if you are looking for somewhere to go in a smaller community. Wide variety of degree programs to choose from. Many different ways to get involved on campus through different organizations and clubs. 
College Freshman,4,I like it because it helps me become more responsible.
College Freshman,4,Friendly staff and the value is good for both semesters.
College Freshman,4,They are all very welcoming.
College Freshman,4,Working with their staff leading up to the first day of classes has been great. They are extremely helpful and friendly. They care about each student.
College Sophomore,4,The freshman and sophomore dorms are exceptional. Coyote Village and McFadden are pretty cool.
College Sophomore,4,"There is no crime or safety concerns on campus, but I don't think that the campus doesn't have a lot of security measures."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life at my school is by far the largest organization.
Freshman,2,"I think this college is a great place for you if you do not mind the social dynamic of drinking and being in such a small area. The staff on campus are very nice, but there seems to be a lot of inefficiency on their part at times. There are alot of little things that add up to be a big problem, and it just feels like the school itself has no direct goal. It feels hard to get involved because of the small-town dynamic, and the fact that it seems like most people only have one of a few things on their mind."
Freshman,2,"The teachers and administration didn't seem to care. I had a teacher for biology that couldn't even speak English and was fired, but they didn't cancel the class or offer a refund. They just put a grad student in until they had another professor available."
College Sophomore,2,"It isn't so bad, but the process is so confusingly bureaucratic that it becomes overwhelming even to those who have done it before"
College Junior,2,"Especially in the dorms, I wish the CA's and other authority were more strict because the noise on floors was not controlled very well and prevented sleep. For example, one of my friends lived on a floor where one of the residents would play music on his DJ-grade speakers and it was so loud you could hear it two floors up."
College Freshman,2,I hate this town so much
College Freshman,2,"Driving to Sioux Falls is your only real

Option"
College Freshman,2,If you come from a big city you will struggle
College Freshman,2,"There is no variety, the food is over priced and it drives you insane"
College Freshman,2,tiny rooms and you pay double the amount you'd pay for a spacious apartment.
College Freshman,2,They don't really help you at all.
College Freshman,2,The party actually starts any time during the week.
College Freshman,2,It needs to be healthier and with greater variety.
College Junior,2,It's hard for myself to get any scholarships.
College Senior,2,During the winter it is hard to walk to class in negative degree weather and the wind blowing you around. I have skipped class at times because of the snow and cold. I also walked once to class in a rain storm. Campus had flooded so much that I was walking in water up to my ankles. They never called off classes because of weather in the four years that I have been there.
College Sophomore,2,"Seriously, Vermillion is great for school, because there is nothing to do there! Every weekend, if you have homework, there is no reason to go out, so your homework gets done. If you want to do anything fun, prepare to drive/ride an hour to Sioux Falls or Sioux City."
College Junior,2,It is very difficult to find scholarships if you are not used to it and have no direction.
College Junior,2,I am not a partier and don't know what the parties are like or how good they were.
College Sophomore,2,It took me forever to find an apartment that didn't have mold issues.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't want to go to my school if I could do it over again. The people are rude and the campus is full of stuck up rich kids. The only reason why I chose the school I did because it is close to home and it has my program right on campus. 
College Sophomore,2,"The nice off-campus housing is super expensive and the leases suck. The dorms aren't great on campus either, but they're better than anything you'll find elsewhere. "
College Freshman,2,"This is one of the only processes I've truly had issues with at the school. They claim to help students with financial aid but I've really been on my own, and even with FAFSA I'm still struggling. I've had to take out loans just to continue to the next semester, and I had to have my father purchase my textbooks for me. I've had to used loans and financial aid to pay for the expensive housing and meal plan. Whenever it comes to getting exemptions from the meal plans and housing situation at the school to help with financial struggle, the school is very apathetic. I've had little to no help asides from the initial FAFSA financial aid and the university's ""coyote promise"" which is 500 dollars a semester. I would suggest that the school become more interactive and offer more options for the students."
College Sophomore,2,"We are not about school pride on this campus at all.  During football games everyone leaves at halftime to go get drunk and nobody goes to any other sports unless we play are rival SDSU.  Some of our athletes think they are hot s***, but they don't prove it when playing.  However, our student body does not get involved with supporting our athletes either."
College Freshman,2,"I wasn't able to get as much help as I needed, and they were helpful in helping me find extra help elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,It's typical South Dakota weather. Be prepared for everything and anything!
College Sophomore,2,Most of the housing at USD has been there for a while and isn't the greatest.
College Senior,2,There are not a lot of computer labs on campus. Wireless access is not the best either.
College Sophomore,2,"There really is not need for transportation here as USD. The campus is not that big and everything is within walking distance. There are plenty of bike racks if you want to ride your bike, I suppose."
College Sophomore,2,"It's livable, but pretty crappy compared to on campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,I do not get a lot of financial aid.  My parents are divorced and they both work a lot of hours to make ends meet.  So income is average and I don't get much for student aid.  No one really can help me with this problem except to get loans or student plus loans.
College Sophomore,2,"Classes are all within walking distance of the freshman dorms. It takes a maximum of 10 minutes to walk to class. If you choose to drive, parking is pretty limited in some areas, so going early is recommended."
College Sophomore,2,"You may have a lot of options at the University of South Dakota, however the quality is quite poor most of the time. Also, you are forces to get a fairly large meal plan your first year if you are living in the dorms and I had a hard time using the too expense meal plan my first semester and wished I could get a smaller one, or no meal plan at all to save money and have better quality."
College Freshman,2,"There is Campus Police but they need more or the Campus Police needs to patrol more often.  There is drinking in the dorm and off campus people involved.  I feel unsafe walking by myself after dark and I have had a stalker that lived in the same dorm and there is no security inside the dorms except the front desk, and they have to call someone."
College Freshman,2,"Vermillion has a safe small town atmosphere. However, theft has become an issue. The closest big town is about a half an hour drive (Sioux City), and Sioux Falls is about an hour away. The campus is great, and the academics aren't bad, but there's not a whole lot to do around town. The parties are pretty good, especially if you know the right people. People around town are very friendly, though."
College Freshman,2,"The beginning of the year, the quality seemed much better than it has become. There are times that I also get tired of some things that are served."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at the University of South Dakota doesn't seem to be very big. There are some that have occasional parties or host dances, but that is about it. No one will hold anything against you for not being in a frat or sorority. It is just not seen as a big thing here in my perspective."
College Freshman,2,I feel like there aren't many opportunities for good scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,"Not too many students care about or follow the sports. The student section may be full at the beginning of football games, but most students leave at halftime. Almost no students show up for basketball games or other sporting events. As a whole, our teams are good but not amazing. They at least are worth going to the games to support and cheer on."
College Sophomore,2,"There are diverse races here, but it is a predominantly white campus. The other races that are here seem to be coming from various states only to compete in the sports programs here."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unfortunately there are some ""slum lords"" with off campus housing I wouldn't have my dog stay in.  There are, however, some good land lords as well.  You just need to do your homework and apply early."
College Sophomore,2,"It gets very cold and very bitter in the winter, and very hot and very miserable in the summer. South Dakota experiences heavy extremes, so bring everything from your shorts to your parkas."
Graduate Student,1,"I was an online student. I withdrew after 1 month. 
The graduate outline dictates that students aren't actually taught. They are supposed to teach themselves from the text books with occasional feedback from professors. Which works if the professors are responsive and give proper feedback. It fails miserably when they do not. One professor only reached out to provide scathing criticism of our work. No instruction whatsoever.
In the other class, we were using a text book from 2009 (this was this year, 2019) with Data from 2006. In a class about substance use. When data from six months ago is outdated on this topic, using a book in 2019, with no mention of the sweeping legalization, nor any discussion of the opioid crisis, that's downright educational malpractice."
College Freshman,1,They just hate being there and make sure you know it
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid office is horrible, the people make you feel as though you are so unwelcome you forget you are in the Midwest"
College Junior,1,"I voted it is the worst in regards to the parking. There is minimal parking for students and visitors. The parking that is available is weighted very heavily for people that live off campus. The parking that is available for students living on campus is mainly located by the dorms. Granted some places are easy to walk to, but in the winter most people try to drive if they have to go all the way across campus. My car has been ticked for having one of my four tires on the yellow line of the parking space. My car was also ticked while I was parked in the ""Visitor"" parking lot, because ""I did not have a parking pass."" To me if it says ""Visitor Parking"" on the sign that means that people should be able to park there without a parking pass."
College Sophomore,1,You need a bike or good walking shoes.
College Sophomore,1,"Nobody goes to anything, people might go if our teams won once in a while or if the university had a out door football field."
College Sophomore,1,"It gets so cold in the winter, it hurts to go outside."
College Junior,1,"In previous years, I received plenty of aid. However, for some reason, they took out a ton of my aid for this year and I was required to pay the school almost $1000. But since I didn't have the money, I had to drop down to 12 credits just so I would avoid paying the school. Also, some of the financial aid workers can be quite rude and condescending. The financial aid department is probably one of the worst things about attending USD."
College Sophomore,1,"This is smack-dab in the middle of good, old hick Midwest country. Your stereotypical person graduated in South Dakota or Nebraska, with a class size of less than 100; they are most likely Christian of some denomination; they are white; there is a lot of drinking and hunting; political beliefs are split between democratic and republican, leaning more towards republican; and most people are heterosexual. However, the USD Democrats, the 10% Society (campus gay-straight alliance), and some other ethnic groups are out and they are VERY proud of who they are."
College Sophomore,1,"You Really Have to Search – I love USD's campus but as for Vermillion, there really isn't much to do. It's a town of about 10,000 so the shopping, cultural attractions, transportation and parks/recreation is extremely limited. The only thing there is to do downtown is hit the bars. If culture, shopping, and nightlife are an important part of your college experience, USD may not be the right place for you."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm a new student at USD this year so I haven't seen first hand how bad the drug and alcohol usage is here. However, a lot of students must do drugs because USD is often referred to as The University of Sex and Drugs. Whether or not that's true......I'll eventually see for myself."
College Sophomore,1,"Punishments Are Too Severe and Not Equally Enforced – The university campus police do not have the best methods of punishment. For example, first semester a CA busted a dorm room for loud noises and then found alcohol in the room, each student was to give up their student ID and which counts as one strike (three strikes and you can be kicked out of school). I had been sober the entire night and even blew 0.00 for the university police to prove my sobriety but I received the same punishment as my peers that were underage and drinking. Then, second semester one of my friends went through the same problem and proved her sobriety but didn't receive any punishment. I think that three violations of drinking on campus resulting in removal from attending USD is too harsh."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a big deal at USD. The school police takes no mercy with parking tickets. You will get a ticket for being parked for 20 seconds. Not a lot of parking options, so tickets are handed out frequently."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are looking to go on a long-distance trip, Vermillion is not the place to leave from. There is no airport in the town. The closest one is about half an hour away. Also the town is very small and everything is within a walking distance from the campus so there is really no need for taxi's. But there are busses that give rides from the bars late at night to reduce drinking and driving"
College Freshman,1,"Largest on-Campus Complaint – USD likes to waste money when it comes to parking. Right now, everyone's biggest complaint is the removal of a much-relied parking lot in front of the school's library.  Last year, parking was already a pain, but recently, it has become a bigger pain ever since the removal of over half of university's library parking lot.  USD turned the lot into a large grass patch that is the biggest waste of space.  It's a good thing ticket fines haven't gone up, otherwise, USD will lose a large portion of its student body population."
College Junior,1,"What Night Life? Nothing for students to do on campus, small bars downtown that are filled with dirt and smoke. But the Greek parties make up for all this."
College Junior,1,"Hardly any school spirit transcends in the community or within the students, except for our homecoming which is a big drink and sex fest."

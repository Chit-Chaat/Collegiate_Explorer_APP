Sophomore,5,"As I am starting my second year at Stanislaus State in Fall of 2020, I was required to take online classes due to COVID-19. Before this, I had no interest in online courses. I would much rather be collaborating in a classroom face to face with my peers and professors. However the online format was easy to follow and it’s the only option we students have. I think all the professors did an outstanding job switching to the online format."
Sophomore,5,"I am starting my second year at CSU Stanislaus and can go on for days discussing how great this campus is. There is unlimited resources and facilities. Everyone is so kind and my favorite day of the week is Warrior Wednesday! Everyone shows their school spirit by wearing red and as you walk through our main quad there’s so many booths with things like breakfast snacks for your walk to class, quick games to play for prizes, and arts and crafts opportunities. I can say this campus has made me who I am today and I am so proud to be a Stanislaus State Warrior."
Graduate Student,5,I learned a lot in every class. Every professor that I had did a fantastic job at teaching their class. The only issue that I has was faculty did not assist you in achieving anything after the BA
Alum,5,Taking online classes is very easy due to using Blackboard. You can take any class online & are all taught by professors who would teach it in person.
Junior,5,"I love my school and its commitment to education, growth and inclusiveness!  Faculty truly puts their students first and ensures a productive safe learning environment."
Sophomore,5,Online was a good experience and I think the staff handled it well it's organized and professors are willing to help if needed
Alum,5,"I really went to the Stockton Campus, but I really did like how they have such great and wonderful staff to support the students and are trying to ensure diversity and campus events.
I do hope they continue to advocate for more student services such as Mental health services, Financial aid and other resources, and more clubs and sports."
Freshman,5,"The campus is clean, it is always kept up, most of the professors teach well and are helpful to the students when help is needed from, they answer questions in depth, the classrooms are set up well and they are run efficiently by the professors. Overall the campus has a good and helpful staff, the campus is very clean, and you get what you pay for, for the most part."

I highly recommend this university to everyone because the staff and students are very welcoming to individuals who want to experience Stanislaus state. The campus is clean and easy to get around. The college is very affordable. They have great counselors that are very helpful to the students. The college has great programs for the students. Such as community service and internships. Also, the college provides tutors that can help students with their students. They have a sister school in Stockton, CA if students choose to go to that location if they want to stay close to home."
Sophomore,5,"The university of Stanislaus has an excellent campus and have very good sources to help students in their college years. Whether is academics, financial, or even health they have good sources in campus that help students in what they need."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Stan State is the diversity that is within campus. Everyone is very welcoming and kind. The academics from my time being there is great, the professors are very helpful, especially during office hours."
Niche User,5,I am considering in attending this university because i think they have good programs. One thing i want to focus when i attend there is finishing a Spanish major and completing a bachelors degree.
Niche User,5,I like this university because of all the majors that it has. Especially since it has a wide academic scale of Spanish majors in which I’m interested in. I’m going to be attending this university in 2020
Alum,5,I enjoyed the small class sizes. I was able to get to know my professors well and also get help from them. The campus is nice and clean.
Freshman,5,Stanislaus is a great university to attend especially if you want to major in criminal justice because they have some great programs for criminology.
Freshman,5,The teachers were really helpful and the environment and people were nice. I made a good amount of friends there. Coming from a couple towns over from Turlock was nice because I was able to commute to and from school easily.
Niche User,5,Amazing campus. The staff is friendly and amazing. Positivity around the school. You feel welcomed by teacher as well as students that attend the school as well.
Junior,5,I enjoy all the art classes that are available to me. I also appreciate all the art teachers as they take time to get to know you and help you out individually.
Alum,5,"I liked how connected the campus is, how involved the students are, and how accepting the community is. Staff and faculty are very friendly and want students to succeed. One change would be the tutoring sessions, including more studies and guaranteeing the quality and consistency of the assistance would benefit many students."
Senior,5,"Its such a diverse campus! I love how it has lots of help for students. There's an amazing health center, and there are workshops that help us students improve in almost anything you can think of. The food in the cafeteria is also awesome!"
Niche User,5,"It is great school for public health, for example, social work, teaching , etc. It is also very close to home for amny students. Another plus is the acceptance rate for thsi school beause it allows many students to ome here."
Niche User,5,CSU Stanislaus has a very beautiful campus and welcoming environment. The people here truly know how to make you feel at home and welcome you to the campus with open arms.
Freshman,5,The environment and learning conditions are wonderful and the school is very welcoming. Safety is a number 1 policy and getting grades and help you need is enforced.
Freshman,5,"Great school and a wonderful experience, the classes and teachers are very understanding and great teachers.   Love learning here and the environment that the staff and other students give.  So many fun activities to partake in."
Niche User,5,"When I went to CSU Stanislaus to look around, every time I asked someone for help they were eager t help me out. They were  not rude about me asking question, like other universities have been."
Freshman,5,The campus is a wonderful place and they have so many possible ways of getting involved. They have daily giveaways and special offers everyday to get the students more involved and enjoy their time on campus.
Senior,5,I am a junior college transfer and this is my third year at CSU Stanislaus. I have enjoyed the classes and professors at this university.
Senior,5,"I appreciate my major department, which is Kinesiology. There is so much diversity on our campus. The professors are great and radiate their love and passion for the subject to us. Our department is quite far from the computer lab and that is the only resource I feel we should have on our side. Also, another change I would like to see is expanding our building so we have more classrooms and gym space. I would not change the professors we have though. I believe that is why I enjoy my major and do not feel it would make my experience better but it would help students overall to be able to have access to a computer lab to work on homework and printing services like all other students have on our campus."
Graduate Student,5,I have enjoyed my almost 4 year education at CSU Stanislaus. The professors and advisers have been there for me and have given the best education. The student population is diverse and you get to meet people of different backgrounds.
Freshman,5,"It is an excellent campus with great academics. Although this is my first year going to Stanislaus State, I instantly fell in love with the campus and the atmosphere. The professors I've had are very good, they explain the material very well and are very chill."
Freshman,5,I love the campus. I am a freshman so I do not know much about the classes but the students there are very welcoming and helpful to all. The campus is a relaxing place with all the green grass and trees.
Alum,5,"The psychology department had wonderful teachers. The school had a great range of class options and times, this was very important for someone like me who needed to work full time but was trying to get my education. I felt supported and had all the resources I needed online, on campus, and even and multiple campus locations."
Freshman,5,"I haven’t been there long, but everyone is quite friendly and very helpful. The people i’ve met have all been willing to point me in the right direction, literally on campus when I got lost and in my classes when i’m confused."
Junior,5,"I would like to to offer priority registration to more people. I think the school is very affordable and I like that it is local. The school does have a great nursing, teaching and business program but it should expand its other programs, including computer science and engineering."
Alum,5,"My personal experience from California State University Stanislaus was great.  Prior to enrolling at Stanislaus, I was enrolled at San Jose State University as a Mathematics major. For a duration of a year, I was commuting from my local home town to campus, rather than finding a place nearby in San Jose, it was cheaper to commute. The first semester, commuted twice a week and the last semester, four times a week. Ultimately, decided to leave SJSU due to the dreadful commute and the lack of support from the unhelpful abrasive advisers. It was not easy to decide to transfer to another university, but CSUS made the transition all worth it. The commute was more manageable despite commuting five times a week, the advisers were more approachable, more supportive, and every faculty member made me feel so welcomed. If I could go back in time and change my decision on what university to transfer to the first time, it would be a no brainer. Graduating with a Bachelors in Computer Science."
Freshman,5,"So far at this school, I have had a great time, mostly because of the professors I have, who care for their students and work hard to help out their overall academic experience. The campus is neat as well, with a bunch stuff available to students such as free access to a gym, some great food at the cafeteria, and plenty of places to hang out on campus. Just keep in mind about the geese though, they are noisy when they want to be, standing high up upon the various school buildings and looking down upon us mortals and our follies."
Alum,5,"I spent 2 1/2 years at Stanislaus State. I graduated in class of 2016 with my major being criminal justice with a concentration in forensic science. The campus is so beautiful, the teachers are there to really help you in school, and the cafeteria had amazing food. I had an overall great experience and it was easy for me to make friends too. This school I wouldn't say is a party school, like Chico State is, but students do have some parties there. If your here like I was to learn and get a great education then this is the school for you."
Junior,5,"I love the diversity and inclusion that this campus offers. The professors are wonderful and the staff is helpful. I would like the new student center to be finished already! Overall, glad I chose this university"
Niche User,5,"When I had visited the campus, I had a strong feeling that I belonged there. I had immediately fell in love with the campus and the atmosphere."
Junior,5,It's a great school because professors will help you keep on track and will help you when it comes to finding resources and questions
Senior,5,The professors are very friendly and easy to work with. The environment and diversity at this school is awesome. I have made many friends and have learned a lot from every course. I would have to say there hasn't been one course that I did not like.
Junior,5,Amazing college great professors. Being a transfer student I thought I would have a hard time adjusting however the staff and professors here helpful in any way they can be. The Stockton campus is very family like you are greeted with a warm welcome each and every day. Also being at Stockton center raised some concerns with safety but there are security officers always willing to help and escort you.
Sophomore,5,Ita a great campus with a lot of diversity and the professors work well with the stidwnts untill they understand thw concept.
Junior,5,the staff are very friendly and helpful campus is not the big so it is pretty easy to find your classes . I wouldn't change anything about stan state.
Sophomore,5,I am currently a second-year student. I am studying Criminal Justice and feel that all my professors teach me material that will soon be beneficial to my future career. The administration is very helpful in all fields. I love attending this school.
Freshman,5,"I love Stanislaus, the athletic program is excellent and the professors truly care about the success of their students."
Niche User,5,I will be attending California State University for the 2018-2019 school year as a freshman. I'm sure my experience with the school will be amazing.
Freshman,5,"I love Stanislaus! It is a great college. Diversity is excellent and so are the professors. The atmosphere is beautiful and makes learning easy. The one thing I wish I could change is the cost. This college tuition, like all CSUs, are expensive."
Senior,5,This university is a very friendly environment. Everybody always has a positive attitude and nobody ever causes problems. You feel comfortable asking anyone around you for help and they will gladly help you with whatever you need. I am glad I came here and glad everyone here is so motivated to learn. Nobody messes around and in class everyone always has their things ready to start a new lecture in class. I love the fact that people eat in the dining hall and work on homework sometimes instead of socializing. That just shows people really want to graduate and do good.
Niche User,5,I like the student to professor ratio. I’d change the housing rent because it’s too much each month.
Freshman,5,It is a very relaxing environment. Not a party school if that is what your looking for. This schools main objective is eduction and making sure you get it. It is a very good choice if you want to live in Californias valley.
Junior,5,"I love the size of the campus, not too big, not too small. There are a fair amount of students which really makes it a very personal school. Classes are small so there is more room for interaction and getting help."
Senior,5,I like that Cal State Stanislaus is very diverse. The professors in the history department are committed to you and make you feel like you’re going to be somebody.
Niche User,5,"I am not a student at CSU Stanislaus, but i have been there many times to visit.  Every visit i felt welcome and relaxed.  The environment was never hostile, the students are very nice and helpful.  I liked the college so much that it is now at the top of my list of colleges to apply to.  I would be so happy to go to Stan State.  Its got the perfect mix of educational life and recreational."
Freshman,5,"The professors may seem pushy, but their one-on-one attention is a great help to keep myself on track. Mandatory office visits help me make sure I am where I need to be to pass the class. The extra academic programs are great, too!"
Freshman,5,"Although I'm currently a freshman and csu stanislaus, I feel right at home on this campus. Due to the smaller size of the campus I can easily make it from one end the the other for classes. Along with the smaller campus the classes are also much smaller than at uc berkely or uc Los Angeles which allows you to recieve alot of one on one time with your professor to achieve your highest potential. This along with the general atmosphere of the campus, the pride and support the students have for the school really make you feel like you're part of something great."
Alum,5,"Cal State Stanislaus is the HIDDEN GEM of the Cal State system!  20 to 1 teacher ratio, free tutoring, national sororities and fraternities, 50 majors including Business Management and Administration.  Beautiful Campus, and the school administration really has its act together.  We arrived, they were waiting for me, name on the board, took me under-wing immediately, made me feel at home and that I had arrived.  Lots of leadership opportunities.  Even a huge observatory on campus! Stanislaus is BIG value for your buck!"
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, has great scenery and the professors are engaging. I would highly recommend students to go here. I'm majoring in psychology."
Senior,4,Many classes prior to covid had an online portion which was easier to keep track of documents and turn in work. With everything being online due to covid it is a bit less jumbled than other online course I have taken at anither college.
Senior,4,"Great professors, very competitive pricing. I had professors from MIT, Purdue, Davis, Stanford, even a director who went to Stanislaus himself for undergraduate. I feel that my education is competitive."
Junior,4,"I took a few online and hybrid classes. Lucky for me a lot of the teachers that were teaching the class already had experience in using an online format. At first, I feared I would not receive a proper education since I have never done online type courses but fortunately all the teachers I had executed well and I was able to learn smoothly."
Junior,4,Stan State is a very great college. I have made a lot of smart and dedicated friends throughout my classes. The campus looks great but the one thing I would like to see different is a drop in tuition cost.
Junior,4,I just started Stanislaus state. Due to COVID 19 its all remote access. I did have a chance to zoom some advisors and professors and they seemed to really enjoy the time working at Stanislaus state.
Junior,4,Instructors seem to be local so they understand the community and students better. It seems like a high school vibe.
Sophomore,4,"The experience is great and it is even more helpful if you apply for housing the are so many opportunities like academic advisor, housing office has access for computers and printing. It a great school and easy to get into the acceptance rate is high anyone can get into the school. The school spirit is good as well."
Niche User,4,"Stanislaus is great, there is plenty of resources for students throughout the campus. Stanislaus is so enthusiastic about being connected with it's students, that it's annoying.  They have proven that they care about their students and staff and if you ever need help you just have to ask.  So, far the only downside has been the pandemic forcing online classes and meetings on us.  Virtual college is kinda unorganized and a lot of technical difficulties arise."
Sophomore,4,"With the sudden closure of schools, I think my professors were able to handle it really well despite many of them having trouble with technology."
Sophomore,4,The staff is great. There are plenty of resources for students around the campus. Yet the only reason I am only giving it four stars is because our library is currently under construction and I feel the school lacks a bit of unification.
Senior,4,The teachers are very attentive to the students and what they need. There is a diverse culture in the students and activities. They have a lot of assistance for students as well.
Senior,4,Because of Covid all of my classes are online and so far I have had positive experiences with the course material and the professors as well.
Graduate Student,4,"educationally it is fantastic, but faculty preparing you for the job force or graduate study seemed to not have any support."
Junior,4,"I have only just recently transferred to this university, but I have had a very positive experience so far. The professors are great and the campus is fresh and clean. I'm really enjoying my time here."
Alum,4,Stanislaus is a small school with lots of commuters & clubs to join. It’s a newly renovated school with lots of opportunities in any major.
Junior,4,"Recently with the COVID related switch to online learning, most students struggled but Stan State professors were very helpful, available and understanding."
Sophomore,4,It's a nice campus and I enjoy how the campus looks . Although I would say the downside is the small science department especially in chemistry which makes it harder to get certain classes
Alum,4,I only took one online class to the top of my knowledge and it went okay. I was able to communicate well with my instructors.
Sophomore,4,"I like how small most of the classes are. This makes the courses feel more personal and gives you more one-on-one focus with your professors. I also like how calm and relaxing the campus environment is. If I could change something about this school, I would ask for reduced parking costs and more parking spaces."
Freshman,4,"Excellent staff and great professors, I love the campus and resources to assist every student with there academic goals."
Junior,4,I enjoyed the campus and atmosphere when I visited. The town that the college is located in best fits my personality. I also enjoyed the fact that I am still within two hours of my family so that if at all I can take some time to go visit them or vice versa.
Niche User,4,I have not attended stanislaus yet but I hope to gave a good experience.  I hear it's a really great school and I hope to have great job opportunities when I finish.
Freshman,4,"My experience behind this campus is fairly remarkable. Although it may not be a very big and tall campuses, the entire attraction is pulled for the relaxing lakes roaming through the school. Stanislaus offers you the experience to walk along the pine trees as you watch the swans in the water. This campus excites with a peaceful setting, as well a peaceful school."
Senior,4,"For the amount of money you pay in fees to attend, It is very good.  Class sizes are small enough to where you don't feel like a number.  Many professors have office hours and are good about meeting up with you when you schedule an appointment."
Sophomore,4,"It is a fairly small campus, which does not make you feel too distant. There are many advantages to a smaller school and campus. Being able to be recognized by your professors is one of those, and I have experienced that by former professors of mine."
Freshman,4,"I like the visual appearance of the campus, and classes are interesting and fun. Not many people are part of a large scale of school clubs. The food isn't too bad honestly."
Junior,4,"CSU Stanislaus is largely a commuter school without much of a party scene. Despite it being a ""value college"", there are many excellent resources and professors here for you to thrive as a student. The student body here is diverse and I always had many interesting people in my courses. The campus is humble but beautiful, with many ponds and lots of wildlife roaming around. It may not be the shiniest most glamorous campus or the most prestigious name, but there is plenty to love about Stan State. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of my time here."
Niche User,4,This review is regarding the Stockton Campus. I really have enjoyed my time at CSU Stanislaus. Attending the Stockton Campus allows from small classes and since there are not that many student you are able to get thign you need from the administration people a lot faster than you would at the regular campus. Everyone is nice and friendly and care about you succeeding.
Niche User,4,The university is very welcoming to all students and they provide you with resources to be academically successful.
Freshman,4,"Being a freshman, so far CSU Stanislaus has been a great experience. The people there are very welcoming and the teachers are very interactive with their students. The environment is calm and there are beautiful places on campus, for example, the reflecting ponds. Moreover, there are places where you can work quietly on assignments, homework, and study. The campus is small in my opinion, but it is a nice environment. I am not concerned for my safety on campus either, because there are cops on campus who are there to protect and watch over. The academics is also great, because not all the majors impacted and it is easy to get the classes you want. Additionally, for student life, there are many things to do, such as join a sorority or fraternity, clubs for your major, programs for academic success, and much more. Overall, the college experience at CSU Stanislaus is great."
Freshman,4,Im going into Stanislaus this year as a Freshman and after touring the campus and learning of all the activities and classes on campus I feel like I made the right decision by choosing to attend. It truly felt like home my first time there and I cant wait to experience these next four years as a student at Stanislaus State University.
Junior,4,"This campus has provided me one of the best educations, along with the very helpful staff. As a student living in Housing and Residential Life, I can say that I can feel welcome, safe, and with a good environment to learn."
Freshman,4,Currently going to be an incoming freshman and so far the school has been very welcoming and has helped make this transition a little less nerve wrecking. I cannot speak for much of the school as of right now but I expect great things from this school and hope to make the best of thee four years memorable.
Freshman,4,"I liked how it is a small school as it allows people to be more connected. I would like to have more clubs on campus and see more student involvement with sports, extracurricular activities, etc."
Niche User,4,I really liked the campus. It was beautiful. The campus seemed to give those home vibes so it didn't feel uncomfortable to be there. The campus didn't seem to be to big to get around with.
Niche User,4,I really liked the campus of Stanislaus State. I haven't began my time in Stanislaus yet. I am very eager to begin studying and looking to find those things that I love to do!
Junior,4,"I like the school campus, the professors and the student services that they offer. I would really wish that the Stockton campus offer more classes."
Niche User,4,"I am not a student at Stan State, yet.  What I like about Stan State is the accessibility to the campus here in Stockton"
Junior,4,Stan state has taught me new experiences and how to further my education beyond high school. Back then I did not want to learn but going to college has opened new opportunities here. I wish to further my education here and really love the college I’m going to.
Niche User,4,This school is bar far amazing!. I been on campus and it's a beautiful campus with a great vibe that you get as soon as you walk on campus. At the same time they have a great nursing program.
Freshman,4,"I am in my second semester as a first year student. Overall, the campus is extremely beautiful even though there is some construction going on right now. All the classes I have taken so far have been great, and the teachers all have their own amazing qualities. This is an amazing choice for school."
Freshman,4,"CSU Stanislaus has a beautiful campus that offers tranquility for stressed out students. It reminds them of the importance in connecting with nature even when one is extremely busy. It reminds them to take a second out of their day to admire life, to admire earth."
Alum,4,The campus scenery is absolutely beautiful. I personally loved the small classroom sizes because they allowed for one on one with peers and professors. Campus administration were accessible. I also liked the different parking options and the available parking. I disliked how certain student organizations continuously had the same representation (very selective). Dining options are limited and not the best quality.
Niche User,4,I think that it has a great campus that is used for pictures but the only thing is that the parking lots need to get better.
Freshman,4,Overall a good school. Food is good and the professors are nice. Not a whole lot to do but other then that its good.
Niche User,4,I really like Stanislaus cause it is close to home and it satisfies all of the requirements for my major. It is very convenient and very affordable. I do wish that it was more inclusive and it should get a football team cause everyone wants to have the full college expierence. It would really addd ot it Also to have small calss sizes is good becuase I knwo that personally I like to be able to have oen on one time with my teacher.
Freshman,4,Everyone is so kind and welcoming at the University. They also have so many clubs and options to get involved with the college and allow you to make connections for your future.
Freshman,4,One thing that I like about this university is that the campus is fairly small and easy to navigate. One thing that I do not like about this university are the food options they are not particularly healthy.
Junior,4,I really liked that when I moved to the dorms everyone who works on that area is quick to make you feel welcomed. I also enjoyed getting to know lots of people through the ASI program that is on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Everyone's so nice. It's a small community. However, it is hard to get the classes that I need. For my major it has been almost impossible for me to get my major classes."
Junior,4,"CSU Stanislaus is a great school, classroom size is small which is good because you will get to know your professors not only that but many of the professors at CSU Stanislaus care about their students and really want them to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,"As a new graduate student I found the school environment to be very comfortable, I didn't have a problem settling in as the professors and the school team were very welcoming. 
Stanislaus state over the past few years has successfully built its reputation and made its way unto top 50 public schools in the region, I believe that it self describes a lot about the hardworking team Stanislaus state hosts."
Sophomore,4,"At the beginning I didn't believe that  I would enjoy Stanislaus State. Now I don't understand why I had that mindset. Although, the school is small it is very energetic and polite. Overall, my experience has been great during these past three semesters. I can say that the classes that I have taken do challenge you, but with the right help you can achieve what you want."
Sophomore,4,Stanislaus is a big small school. The school is working on expanding and making it better for the students.
Junior,4,"I was originally at Merced College doing my required list to transfer to CSU Stanislaus. I couldn’t wait to get on campus and once I was I felt more successful than I have been in a long time. I wanted to go to Stanislaus straight from High School but had obstacles I needed to face first. Now that I’m here, I’m happy. I can finally finish and get my degree."
Sophomore,4,"This school is great, they have a lot of good programs especially if your majoring in nursing, criminal justice, or child development"
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely LOVE Stan State. The campus is small but, that is definitely an advantage in the classroom because professors usually know how you are and push you to do better. Housing is a lot better compared to others. There is free  8am - 11pm access to washers, dryers, games, printing, and computers for students who live on campus. Some rooms on-campus come with a kitchen and all are fully furnished.  The same amentities apply for students who live across the street in The Vistas. Food on campus can range from really good to edible. Warrior Grill is a great option for burger and wing lovers. Main Dining has everything from pizza, pasta, and salad to burritos and fried rice. Village Cafe has its ups and downs but when staff is doing good the food taste great as well. MSR Cafe is always reliable and usually really great when you need something fast. However, MSR Cafe is more of snack establishment as well as Pop's Connivence Shop. Campus also has lots of geese."
Junior,4,it has a great community. the professors know you by name and personally. the classes aren't over populated. the view of the campus is amazing. it is a great place to go to school.
Graduate Student,4,CSU Stanislaus is good because it has knowledgeable instructors that are currently working in the field they teach in. Classroom instruction covered real life situations and helped ready us for teaching in our own classrooms.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy going to CSU Stanislaus. Although it is considered to be a  ""commuter college"" there is a thriving campus life to be a part of. I love how the campus is laid out and the enviroment itself. Stan has amazing professors who are there to help you succeed and who are always willing to lend out a helping hand when needed. This was very helpful for me in my transition from high school to college. I am very happy that I chose CSU Stanislaus to study at to get my degree."
College Junior,2,"Greek life on campus is almost non-existent. It's very low key, and there are few to no events on campus that promote Greek life. As far as I know, there are no sororities or fraternities on campus at all. There are only small clubs to join but that's the extent of it."
College Freshman,2,Campus police need to be more active around the campus for more safety!
College Junior,2,"There are no ""houses"" and you are only a aprt of a group and they don't live together. so rarely those kinds of parties are thrown."
College Sophomore,2,Too cheap and I might have regretted going here.they cut my program classes a lot but not so much the other programs.
College Sophomore,2,Need more classes so I might have to attend another university and leave this one.
College Sophomore,2,I feel like it could be better . I think we should pay a little bit more for our tuition because we could have more class courses office.
College Freshman,2,Some Greek people seem stuck up so not much of a fan of them.
College Freshman,2,"When they have a party on campus, they chose to have it at the Event Center which is a tiny building so most of the time, people can't get in."
College Freshman,2,You don't know what's on the menu so you kind of hold up the line trying to find out what you want
College Freshman,2,The housing gets on top of your case if your relatively loud. Once was told to have me and my roommates to stop laughing because it was loud and it was quiet hours. Can't draw what we freely want to on dorm room chalkboards.
College Senior,2,"There are not many parties that go on.  If any, they are from sororities and fraternities with only few people invited.  These are rapidly broken up by the police and tend not to last long."
College Senior,2,"Satelite Campus in Downtown Stockton, CA"
College Student,2,You'd have to park pretty far if you're coming at any time after 8 am without a parking pass.
College Junior,2,no football team and poor game attendance
College Sophomore,2,There arent enough teachers to teach some classes that you need to get into.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much to do here in Turlock.
College Student,2,It's horrible. there is nothing to do unless your are in a greek life or know people in it.
College Student,2,"not much of a variety, mostly fast food places. Not a night life place for weekends, the cost is average and few places with student discounts."
College Student,2,"That is one had thing about this school, there is nothing much to do other than drive up to san francisco."
College Freshman,2,The process of getting into the Nursing program is very hard because it is very challenging. You basically need a 4.0.
College Sophomore,2,The off-campus parking is ridiculous.
College Sophomore,2,"I believe the cost for parking is outrageous, as college students we usually try to cut down cost on expenses and this is not a cost I personally would be able to afford.  "
College Freshman,2,Getting financial aid is hard. It is a never ending process of trying to recieve grants or scholarships that you won't have to pay back. I don't really have any tips. The majority of scholarships want you to be of a certain ethnicity to be able to recieve any free money rather than focusing on your career goals and whether or not one deserves the help.
College Junior,2,"I haven't seen any drugs, but I know they're there. It's a college in California. You can get anything, anytime."
College Sophomore,2,There are many different places to park around campus but in order to actually get a spot you would have to arrive early. If you don't you'll be parking a little ways from campus. Even then it isn't that long of a walk!
College Senior,2,"The Business program at CSUS is overwhelmed with students. Its difficult to get any personal attention. The professors are also not very helpful in or out of the classroom. They do not help you see how concepts apply in real life and prefer to read off power points. However, it is still a practical major and if you read the books you should be fine."
College Senior,2,"Turlock is a small time with no attractions. The closest city is Modesto which has a mall and some nightlife (not much) . For attractions, students usually take day trips to the city (San Francisco, San Jose)"
College Senior,2,"The options for off-campus housing are poor. The locations are badly maintained and the staff is not very friendly. It is a bit expensive for the quality that you potentially receive,averaging 700 and up for a studio."
College Junior,2,"No alcohol allowed on campus grounds with the exception of one small cafe, beer only and it's on and off."
College Junior,2,No major form of transit provided. Lots of parking for cars! Commuter school primarily.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am not part of any greek life on campus, but from what I see. They do not have very many events on the quad."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The dining hall on campus is okay.  The food is good, but it gets kind of old. They have had the same menu for the past two years so a change in the menu would not be a bad idea!"
College Freshman,2,The weather is perfect most of the time. It is very cold during the winter.
College Freshman,2,The parking permits are just too expensive. Student have to get to school really early in order to get a spot if they have no permit.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking permits here on campus is extremely overpriced. You're better off parking for free off-campus by coming to school a little early. If you are caught without a parking permit, the fine is $20.00 per ticket."
College Junior,2,It is definitely a commuter school. There are buses for students who don't have cars.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the dorms and I really like it because you get to interact with new people and end up close to some people you meet met but that's the whole point, to expand your horizon. What I don't like about living in the dorms is sometimes you're not going to end up getting along with your roommates. Like for me at first I got along with them great but then they slowly started to not clean after their selfs which was rude and so my RA didn't help our problem get solve. So it was just so uncomfortable to live in a space where others won't pick up after themselves. So I would say that problem solving would be one thing I didn't like in the dorms. The second would be is that it's too expensive! Like literally I can't believe I live in an expensive dorm where it has been used by others too."
College Freshman,2,"I believe that the police on campus are okay, meaning that they do their job well. There has been some incidents where students have been attacked by strangers that approach students in the parking lot which makes me realize where are the police when things like that are happening? But other then that I feel like they don't interact with student or bother them with anything. Unless its about alcohol or drug abuse."
College Freshman,2,Most professors are good at their jobs but there are some that can't teach the subject right. There is a excellent range of class options to pick from and the study center is extremely helpful. The registration process is horrible. Changed to new system with restrictions and it makes it extremely hard to get classes you need.
College Junior,2,"The campus seems to be very strict about some things. Noise complaints are common in the dorms, and alcohol regulations are really strict. Also, police have no mercy when it comes to parking tickets. If someone parked their car for 5 minutes, they would surely find one when they come back to their car."
College Junior,2,"I am still in process of receiving my financial aid. However I have friends who have told me it has been a hassle to receive theirs. Some still haven't heard of any of their financial aid, and the next semester is soon to start."
College Senior,2,The town is very conservative. There is no college life.turlock is a small little town but it is definitely not a college town.
College Freshman,2,"If you live in the housing, it's impossible to drink. There are cops always walking around the campus at night, so if you do want to drink or have some fun, you have to do it quietly. I don't know how it is outside the campus though."
College Sophomore,2,"I've moved to Turlock from Sacramento which is a huge atmosphere difference. Honestly, Turlock is very boring. There's not much to do except for go to the Student Rec center( gym), or go to the 18 & up club in Modesto (Studio 47), or the Turlock movie theaters."
College Senior,2,"I feel that our campus is very friendly to adults who need to study between classes in that there are plenty of comfortable quiet places to do so.  I am, however, very dissatisfied with academic scheduling and the availability of classes to students who work during the day and need to take afternoon/evening classes.  I work school hours (8-2:30), and actually had to skip out on a semester of school because there were no classes available that worked with my schedule.  Upon discussing this with my advisor he explained that my only option would be to QUIT my job because the department had no plans to change class schedules for years to come.  I found this highly inconvenient and frustrating."
College Senior,2,"There is not enough parking on campus, and the lots are not near many  of the classroom buildings.  It costs $6.00/day to park if you don't have a permit, and the permit costs have increased yearly to help cover budget cuts.  Right now, a student permit is $164/semester.  There is parking off campus, as well, if one wants to avoid paying for a permit, but finding a spot is not an easy task, and it's quite a hike.
There is very little handicapped parking, and in some places the distance to classrooms is not an easy walk.  The campus is very large, so those with difficulty walking are at a disadvantage.  If you can't find a handicapped space open near your building, you end up driving in circles until something opens up, and then you are late for class."
College Freshman,2,"Any Student Discounts? I am currently a tenant in an apartment right across campus.  I understand that the price can be pricy knowing campus is literally a crosswalk away, but I do not understand how landlords charge students so much for an empty place.  College students do not have all the money in the world, they go to school to get an education, not to be in debt from overpriced apartments.  The apartment I am staying in includes absolutely nothing but a fridge and oven.  We have to pay for internet, water, electricity and even cable!"
College Sophomore,2,Pretty Much Average – Most people at CSU Stanislaus are pretty much average. The guys are athletic and dress pretty well. The girls dress casually and and friendly.
College Junior,2,It's Average. It was average. I could not use all of my money at once.
College Junior,2,"It's Not That Interesting – There isn't much socializing apart from the clubs, sororities and fraternities gathering in front of the cafeteria during certain times of the day. Most of the girls you see walking around are typical valley girls. The guys are just valley dudes. You don't often see eccentric characters. Most students are just there to study."
College Junior,2,"Way Too Expensive – I used to eat at the cafeteria all the time until they hiked the prices up. The food is mediocre and sometimes bad quality. The last time I ate there I paid 5.00 for a bagel with cream cheese. Outrageous. I haven't returned since. If I get hungry at school I'll usually go off campus to eat, it's cheaper plus the food is better."
College Junior,2,"Not Much to Do Outside of Campus – The atmosphere of Turlock, CA is typical of a small farm town of the Central Valley: boring. While the campus itself is beautiful, Turlock is average in itself. It's a good place to raise a family. There are elementary schools and high schools. There are shopping centers and many places to go out to eat. The closest mall is 30 minutes away. Pollution is prevalent. Most of the students I've met at this university commute, so there isn't much student life outside of campus."
College Student,2,The parking at the school is not very good.  The parking permit can be a little high.  If you park at a place where you are not allowed it is most likely you are getting a ticket.  You really need a car on campus if you are not living at the dorms.  And over all the convince of the parking space is sometimes a hazel.
College Freshman,2,"Teachers Are There, but Not Really There. This school has a good variety of classes and has many options in terms of General Ed. The professors all seem to have the same teaching methods, however, and lack personality. It's website is very confusing and crashes a lot, making it difficult to navigate and get things done."
College Freshman,2,"There should at least be a ""20"" minute parking, or whatnot, for a loading zone. Our school only has a round-about to drop stuff off, but no parking space."
College Junior,2,"Greeks Occupy the Quad – Greeks don't make a scene everywhere, but they definitely take over the quad most days and it spills into other public spaces like the cafeteria. The quad is set up with tables for the Greeks and it makes it awkward for non-Greeks who just want to get through. It is one of the things that I dislike about the school campus. I'm there to learn, not to hear about the raging party some frat boy threw last weekend."
College Junior,2,"Local Food – There are some small interesting restaurants if you search, but for the most part it is typical fast food and generic chain store mexican or pizza."
College Junior,2,"Turlock definitely doesn't have a college feel. It is devoloping suburbia with a college in it. Standard strip malls. The campus itself has many trees, ponds, and expanses of grass which are pretty. Shopping is average, the mass marchants like Walmart and Target are available. Over all the best attraction is the county fair which occurs in Turlock once a year."
College Sophomore,2,"There is nothing around this campus. No good place to eat, nothing to see, etc. It's only for study use."
College Freshman,2,It was pretty hard for me to get financial aid as an independent student. It wasnt until late that I found out the exact amount of financial aid that I would have. My recommendation is to talk in person or on the phone with your financial aid officer.
Junior,1,"I did not like anything about this school. The only positive thing that I can think of is that the campus itself is visually stunning. However, that was not enough to keep me interested in this school. The teachers were very liberal, which is fine, but sometimes I just want to learn course material... not their opinions. We live in the twenty first century and yet six of my eight teachers did not allow the usage of laptops for taking notes, etc. I was very excited about CSU Stanislaus at first, but after going there for almost a year I honestly would not recommend this school to anyone. It is terrible."
Sophomore,1,The support provided for students is very poor. They lack students services and are useless when it comes to answering your questions.
Alum,1,"After receiving my BA from this hell hole, I enrolled in the Credentialing and MBA programs concurrently while working full time.  Many courses were not available to take when I needed them.  Finally, with a 3.6 GPA and all courses complete, I was denied a masters degree because I went over the time limit by 5 months.   The Stanislaus' remedy was to VOID all my courses, make me retake the GMAT and reapply.  I wouldn't send me dog to be trained at this school"
College Sophomore,1,Not enough students on campus to know.
College Sophomore,1,"I think we should have more gates surrounding the campus, it is too open to the public."
College Junior,1,"Simply put, CSU Stanislaus is NOT a party campus.  Seek elsewhere if parting is a campus life priority."
College Senior,1,We do not have athletics at the satelite campus
College Senior,1,No dining options on campus
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't like it. The places to eat out are not great and expensive and if they are good they close early. There are no good places to go out and party either. Just with friends at home you are better off or out of town. 
College Senior,1,"Nightlife at California State University Stanislaus is horrible. While the campus itself is fantastic, the night life is not so great. There aren't nearly enough lights on at night to begin with, so safety is always a concern. Parties depend on a student's preference. Students can find pretty much any type around here, whether it's calm and collected, or rowdy and full of outbursts. There aren't any clubs in the town of Turlock, but Modesto has a slightly better selection. The bars are decent, and only because the people aren't very friendly here. Transportation -there is none. I say this because I have lived in San Francisco, and been to many other cities. Underage nightlife, I couldn't say. I've always been a very responsible student."
College Senior,1,I do not feel like Greek life is an attraction at our campus.  The events that are hosted do not include students that are not Greek members.  I have visited other universities where Greek life extends past the individual clubs and organizations on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"We have some competitive teams.  However, we do not have a football team, and that really hurts school spirit.  It is one of the main things people complain about at this school.  For the most part, we lack in fan support and school spirit."
College Freshman,1,The parking permit costs are outages. They have gone up to where it is not worth paying the price to park on campus and that is would be cheaper and better to park off campus. The parking spots are not designed for big SUV's or trucks. In some sections it is very hard to get a small car to fit in a parking spot. You have to arrive 20-30 minutes before class starts to find a decent parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,"Stanislaus is not strict at all. I mean of course you can't have parties in your dorm or drink in them unless you're 21. We're a wet campus, meaning that if you're 21 & older you're allowed to have alcohol in your dorms. Your also allowed to have guys and girls over anytime you want. If you do get caught with alcohol in your dorm they'll just have you dump all of it out in front of them that's all."
College Sophomore,1,Buses and Personal Cars Are the Only Option – You need a car and can't rely on public transportation.
College Sophomore,1,"Difficult to Get Into Nursing – To get into the nursing program at CSU Stanislaus, you have to take some lower division general ed classes, pass an entry exam, and apply to the program. To be able to apply to the program, you must have taken at least two science pre-requisite courses and two non-science pre-requisite courses. This doesn't seem too bad, except for the fact that it is an impacted program; required courses aren't available every semester, which puts you on hold."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Difficult to Get Admitted Into Nursing – I'm a pre-nursing major at CSU Stanislaus and it seems very difficult to get into the nursing program here. There is a lack of availability of nursing classes because of a lack of nursing instructors and because it is an impacted program. Some nursing classes are not even offered every semester, which impedes you from advancing in the program."
College Sophomore,1,Turlock Is Not a College Town – Turlock is a very conservative town with a lot of families and churches. There is absolutly nothing to do in this town except partying. The only good parties to even go to are only if you are in a greek organization. Partying is not everything college should be about but thats all you will find in Turlock. I wish our school and town could have more stuff to get students involved and if this town could have more for us todo.
College Freshman,1,"You Can Hear the Crickets Chirping at Night. The town of Turlock, CA is small and quaint. There are two 18+ bars the students go to and there are no clubs. House parties are usually at the edges of the town where no can hear or see them, which is the only good part about it."
College Freshman,1,"Kept in Touch, but Did Not Solve My Problems. The school did not offer me any types of scholarships or grants; not even references. The financial aid process was very difficult, I received my financial aid money two weeks after it was sent out. I was charged way more than expected and therefore ran out of money for important stuff such as books. It was like they had no idea what they were doing or just didn't care."

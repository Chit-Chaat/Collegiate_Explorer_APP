Freshman,5,In just a few short months I have fallen in love with this school. Their action plan in regards to COVID-19 is phenomenal! I have never had a more enriching experience in school. 10/10 would recommend this university!
Alum,5,"9/10 of the professors are amazing. They care about you as an individual student, especially in the School of Education. The atmosphere is very comforting, and it really does feel like the community as a whole is a family. The Fisher dining services are 10/10 and their staff consists of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. I really enjoyed my time at Fisher and highly recommend attending if considering. If there were anything to change, trying to get a more diverse student population would be a good idea."
Senior,5,Love it! I could not imagine myself at any other college. Fisher Family!!! Everyone is very friendly and the facility is very helpful and accommodating. They did a great job transferring from in-class learning to online learning during COVID-19.
Senior,5,"During this pandemic, all of the classes were changed to online learning. My professors did a great job transitioning from in-class to online."
Freshman,5,I felt right at home as soon as I stepped on the campus. Everyone on campus was very kind and welcoming. I felt as if everyone was part of a family. The food on the campus is very good. The one thing that I would change is their dorms. They are pretty tiny and tend to get very hot.
Freshman,5,When I visited St. John Fisher I was blown away with the amazing classrooms and facilities I saw throughout the entire campus. Amazing sports facilities and great people are what really stood out.
Niche User,5,I am so excited to go to Saint John Fisher College! It is in a great safe area with tons of activities to do. The dining hall is like a five star restaurant and the dorms are equally as nice. The nursing program is also perfect and they have good relationships with local hospitals.
Sophomore,5,"The ""fisher family"" slogan really describes everyone here. No one is hard to approach, and classes are small enough that you aren't lost in the number. Professors really care about more than grades and paychecks."
Freshman,5,"I love St. John Fisher! I’m a freshman this year and I’ve had the best experience so far. I was matched with a great roommate, so I’m super happy and relieved about that. Everyone here is so friendly! I love that it’s a smaller school so you get to start recognizing students pretty quickly, which really makes it feel like a family. I’m really happy with my choice to come here and would totally recommend it to anyone considering SJFC. Oh, and did I mention the food? Ah-mazing!!!!"
Sophomore,5,Overall I really enjoy Fisher! I’ve made good friends and everyone is nice and welcoming here. I definitely choose the right college for me!
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently a sophomore at Fisher. Very welcoming community!! The food is amazing, highly recommend it to anyone. The staff is always cheerful and in a great mood, they always make every student smile and feel welcomed. I've had a great experience with Fisher so far and I can't wait to finish my journey!"
Freshman,5,"I love this college. It is the perfect size for me, great area, many resources to help you. Everyone really cares about your success and that you do well. They have free tutoring services and many on campus opportunities to build your resume and interview skills to prepare you for the work force. They also have a great undergraduate research program which most schools do not have. If you like to have a sense of community, then this would be a great college for you. They have a great reputation for the science and business programs."
Junior,5,Fisher overall is a great school with great programs to be apart. The school works with its students and faculty by keeping everything up to date and simply making sure each student is comfortable while attending.
Sophomore,5,St. John Fisher college is an amazing atmosphere that I am glad to be apart of every day. Professors care about their students and try their hardest to make sure their students succeed. I am very happy with my decision to attend college at St. John Fisher and I would not want to attend anywhere else. The buildings on campus are amazing and they have a top 10 dining hall in the entire country. I could not be any happier going to school here.
Graduate Student,5,Great school with amazing caring professors who truly care about your success. Staff is very knowledgeable about content and provide flexibility to assist their students if needed.
Alum,5,"There is NOTHING that I don't love about Fisher. The professors were great, classes were great, facilities were beautiful and there really is a ""fisher family"" atmosphere. I would do anything to be able to go back!"
Graduate Student,5,I love my college and the faculty. Everyone is very helpful and frendly but professional. I would definitetly recomment Saint John Fisher College.
Junior,5,I love it at St. John Fisher. I'm going into my third year for pre-med Biology and I just love it. The small classroom size allows you to really get to know professors and get the extra help you need.
Senior,5,"One thing that is heavily stressed when attending St. John Fisher College is the feeling of family. Whether it be from a sports team, a major, or some high school friends that you happen to see on campus, there is a warm sense of community that is felt upon the campus. Everyone has a smiling face or is stressing out over the same test (although this sounds horrible, you can make some new friends or study buddies this way). 

Something I would change, however, would be the parking on campus.  The college is small to begin with, with about 3000 undergraduate and graduate students total.  The parking can be tight as there are staff and students who are looking for spots but must park on the opposite side of campus if the individual is running late.  As it is, this individual would have to sprint in order to get to class on time or just a few minutes after it began.  This is such a small price to pay for what you get in return at the college in terms of faculty, memories and more."
Sophomore,5,"An excellent choice in furthering my education. Great course and professors that want to help you. Excellent food, but no party scene at all
."
Senior,5,"I owe my ability to be accepted into a graduate program to the professors and students at SJFC. Here I learned to think critically, objectively and found a true passion in the sciences. Fisher set me up academically to do well on graduate entrance exams and provided me with the tools to do research which allowed me to gain valuable bench top experience. Even though it is a small school, SJFC allowed me to stand above students from larger universities when applying to graduate programs."
Sophomore,5,"St. John Fisher offered a warm, welcoming environment to begin a college career at. Everyone you encounter on campus is friendly and helpful, and makes you feel like you belong here. Classroom sizes are small and help you to get the best out of your education, and there is always a new opportunity to get involved with on campus or in the community."
Sophomore,5,"This college is great, I am a transfer student here and this is by far the best school I have ever attended. The food is great, they have a wide variety. The professors are great as well and anyone is able to be flexible in order to help you."
Junior,5,"I have been at St. John Fisher for a year now and I love the college. Not only is the food great here but we have a gorgeous campus that is easy to navigate and always very well kept. I have gotten along great with all my professors, many of which have introduced me to many people in the business world as well as teaching things they have learned while out in the field. While here I have been apart of 5 different clubs as well as two on campus jobs which I LOVE. The school has so many things to get involved in from a very diverse set of clubs to sports and people. I live on campus and have made amazing friends because of this decision.  The only thing that I would think about changing is the parking problem and more classes. Its hard for the college to find more space because of the small space they have available to work around but I know they are working on it, which all the students appreciate."
Senior,5,"Fisher is an excellent choice for teacher preparation! The faculty and staff are exceptional. There are several opportunities to get involved on and off campus through athletics, clubs, community service, and field experiences. Tuition is costly, but the education you receive here is so worth every penny."
Graduate Student,5,"For the program I am in, all the professors are so willing to help you. Every one is willing to go out of their way to make sure you understand that material."
Senior,5,"This has been the best experience of my life.  The professors are helpful, class sizes are small and student body is great.  The campus life is fun and the food is good.  Make sure that you go to the sporting events because the teams are good."
Sophomore,5,"Fisher provides a great environment for not only academic growth, but personal growth as well. The class sizes are small and all the professors are always willing to provide extra help, clarification or support in their classes. It is a close-nit community and we truly mean it when we say we are a part of the Fisher Family because that is how we act, as a family."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here. Everyone is kind, supportive and student involved. The professors are tough, but kind. They strive to make great students and to prepare them for the future. I wouldn't have liked to pick any other school than here. I wouldn't change anything one bit. Maybe just more activities and events."
Niche User,5,It's a great school for anyone whether they have declared a major area of study or are still undecided. The staff and faculty there are wonderful and very helpful.  The cost is a little high but the extensive knowledge of the professors is worth it.
Sophomore,5,I love St. John Fisher College. Best choice Ive ever made. Ive made lifelong friends there and feel so comfortable there. The professors are great and help out no matter what. Never could I imagine myself anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,St. John Fisher College offers a premiere education with a close-knit community and caring professors.  I would recommend this College to anyone who wants a wonderful college experience in every aspect.
Sophomore,5,St. John Fisher has been an amazing college for me so far. They made my transfer from one school to theirs amazing. Staff everywhere to answer questions and help in anyway possible. The campus is beautiful and well taken care of. I am so proud and lucky to be able to attend St. John Fisher College and obtain my bachelors in Marketing here.
Senior,5,"I transfered to Fisher after previously attending two other colleges. My experience at Fisher has by far surpassed my experiences at the other colleges. The campus is beautiful, very traditionally collegiate. The class sizes are small, ideal for learning. All of my professors are intelligent and kind and genuinely want you to prepare you to succeed in the real world. I feel like I will be highly qualified after graduation."
Junior,5,Fisher is a small school with a tremendous big heart.  The students are truly a family with school spirit and a intimate sense of community.  The faculty is top notch with a driving sense of commitment to help ensure every student has a sense to succeed.
College Senior,5,I have had maybe one bad class overall. The rest were amazing
College Senior,5,"It's not what you know, it's who you know. Fisher is great at this and you can really use our network of alumni to better your career"
College Senior,5,"With small college feelings and large college education, Fisher is the place to go"
College Sophomore,5,"My first year was amazing. I made tons of friends and had a lot of fun. While managing a job and school, I ended my first year better off than I was expecting. I wouldn't change anything of my time here so far."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm not much of a sports fan, but being around everyone at an athletic event sure does get the blood flowing. its so exciting and energetic at all of the campus sporting events."
College Senior,5,"SJF is a highly regarded Nursing school in the area.  Students usually have a secured job prior to graduating, we are seeked out in our field."
College Student,5,We have an excellent athletics program at Fisher. Multiple teams went to conference championships as well as the NCAA tournament. Athletics are a huge part on campus. The facilities are great and always getting upgraded. The machines we have work great!
College Freshman,5,"The professors at SJFC will go above and beyond to help you succeed.  They are always available to help outside of class. The cirriculum is well organized, and most professors lay it out on the syllabus so you know what to expect.  The registration process is based on how many credits you have.  The more credits you have, the earlier you get to pick your classes for the following semester.  The process is fairly easy.  The workload depends on your major.  Science/nursing/pharmacy and busniess majors tend to have the heaviest workload.  There is tutoring available on campus for various subjects, as well as theMath and Writing Center, which is open to help anyone with math or writing, Monday through Friday.  The Library staff is excellent help when it comes to writing any type of paper, as well."
College Freshman,5,"There are clubs for every diversity-related topic you can think of.  The largest organization if the Department of Diversity and Multiculutral Affairs, which sponsors events on campus for everyone.  Some diverse clubs include, the Gay-Straight Alliance, Asian Student Union, Latino Student Union, Black Student Union, Students of Multicultural Affairs, Fisher CRU (Christian club), Colleges Against Cancer, and many more."
College Freshman,5,"A majority of the students do not use drugs on campus.  Peer pressure is also minimal.  As with anywhere you go, it's important to choose the right friends to hang around that are similar to your views on drugs or alcohol.  Security moniters drug and alcohol use on campus.  If you are caught, there are consequences.  The is also a ""Good Samaritan"" hotline number available to call, should someone overdose on a substance."
College Freshman,5,I feel that being a resident on campus helps with your college experience so much and helps you get involved in the campus life.
College Freshman,5,"At St. John Fisher, there are so many ways to get involved and become a part of the ""Fisher Family."" As a freshman, I love my school and would not have made a different choice if I had the chance. There are many different things going on every week where you can do activities or watch a magic show or participate in a hypnosis. There are many chances to win free things at some events."
College Freshman,5,Employers are often on campus for job fairs. The career center is extremely helpful with finding internships and part-time jobs around the Rochester area.
College Freshman,5,"Most of the professors I have had are very passionate about their subjects and are also very understanding and approachable. Class sizes usually range from 20-30 people, and seem very much like high school class sizes."
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus. As a freshman, I don't have to deal with community bathrooms, as I have a bathroom connecting my room and my suite mate's room. My dorm is extremely close to the education buildings and the dining hall is on the main floor of my dorm! I've heard that parking for commuters is terrible, so I'm really glad that I live on campus and can leave ten minutes before my class starts and still make it on time."
College Sophomore,5,"You don't go feeling unsafe on campus. It's great here, we have blue lights everywhere and safety and security usually gives us their phone numbers so those are already in your phone if you ever need them."
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are small enough that your professor will actually CARE to know your name and you can make friends with people across the classroom. You will always have an option to do something if you chose not to lay in bed and binge on Netflix and fishbowl. I am so happy with my choice to come here.
College Sophomore,5,"The job outlook, especially for the nursing program, is GREAT. Not just for nursing students, but for anyone really."
College Sophomore,5,I love the dorms here at Fisher! Never a hassle to get into the room you want.
College Sophomore,5,I don't regret my decision to come here at all. I love Fisher and all it has to offer. It's my second home!
College Senior,5,"I could not have picked a better school. The size, the professors, and my fellow classmates are wonderful. I felt welcome from the day I got here, and there are truly opportunities for everyone. I fell in love with this school the first time I visited, and I am so glad I was able to attend this institution. I'm actually going to be sad to graduate in 4 months!"
College Junior,5,The professors have already gotten us in touch with alumni for possible job placements.
College Junior,5,The classes are small and the professors always make themselves available.
College Junior,5,Campus is very safe and there are a ton of the blue safety boxes.
College Junior,5,I've never lived on campus but everyone says it is the best.
Freshman,4,"The online learning experience at Fisher is not ideal, but they have definitely prepared for this well. Rooms are offered for commuter and residential students to attend class in a quiet area. Some professors could use a little work on their computer skills, but can't we all?"
Alum,4,The last couple months of my senior year at Fisher were online due to COVID-19. The professors did a great job of unexpectedly accommodating and adapting to the virtual platform.
Senior,4,St. John Fisher College is a beautiful campus filled with flowers in the spring and fall foliage spilling from the trees. The food on campus is known throughout the country and provides diversity of flavors and an enjoyable experience during each meal.
Junior,4,I took some classes online and it went very well. It was easy to work on my own terms and have even more free time without having to be in a physical classroom.
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my experience at Fisher based on the environment that the professors and students create. My professors are always there to help me succeed and I feel as though I am on the right track to creating a positive future for myself while at Fisher.
Junior,4,Fisher is a small school and the professors know their students and are very willing to help and just want their students to learn! If the professor was using an application that was problematic all we needed to do was bring up our concern and things would be discussed and usually changed for the better.
Junior,4,Fisher is a small school and the professors know their students and are very willing to help and just want their students to learn!
Alum,4,I loved the culture at SJFC. Once you are a student at fisher you become so close to everyone just on the fact that you are going through this together. I liked that it was a small campus so everyone knew everyone. It was a great school!
Junior,4,I loved the campus and its smaller scale size. It allowed for more personable professors who sought to help you with anything you needed. I play football and the athletics department is also a bright spot with student-athletes making up a good chunk of the population. The food is also highly ranked nationwide so that is also a big plus.
Sophomore,4,My favorite part about St. John Fisher College is the small class sizes and the bond that is easily created with the professors. If I could see one thing change it would be the types of housing. The only kind of housing that is really available are double and single rooms.
Freshman,4,"Some areas such as the honors program and course registration are disorganized, but the nursing program, housing, and extracurriculars are fantastic."
Niche User,4,"I stayed on an overnight there for field hockey and it was a great experience. They allowed me to meet with my department professor and stay with the girls. Overall, the school was great!"
Junior,4,"St. John Fisher is a great school for those who have an interest in majoring in nursing, pharmacy, education or business. For those who are looking to play a sport in college, this is a very strong division three athletic school. Their athletic facilities are always kept in great condition as the NFL team the buffalo bills have their training camp there every year. Not only are the athletic facilities kept in great condition the entire campus has a very modern feel to it as they are always doing renovations to keep up the growing interest in the school itself."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Fisher was great! I met so many great people and enjoyed most of my classes. Overall, year one was a success."
Junior,4,"It is a smaller school which I appreciate as the class sizes are smaller. Additionally, if you have applied as a nursing major as a first time student, you are guaranteed a seat in the nursing program come junior year as long as you meet the requirements."
Freshman,4,A small but not too small type of feel to it. The food is really good- especially in the Haffey Dining Hall as well as Fishbowl. All of the professors here are very knowledgeable in their respective field. A good amount of them take the time to reach out if they think you need help.
Niche User,4,The representatives are really nice and informing on all types of majors. The presentations felt warming at the open house and the science major tables really gave me a basis of courses I had to take for a biochemistry major.
Freshman,4,"Since the college is a small, private school, you can tell opportunities are limited, but there are still options for everyone to get involved in. The people can often be snobby or cliquey but just find those who suit your personality!"
Junior,4,St John Fisher is a beautiful campus! The staff is wonderful. If someone needs helps there are people that are really kind and always willing to help others out. They have great programs and the advisors always help students stay on track. A person never has to feel lost because there is always someone to guide you.
Sophomore,4,"St John's is an awesome school for sciences, especially nursing. The thing would change is a more diverse student body. White upper middle class New Yorkers are the overwhelming majority."
Graduate Student,4,"I went to St. John Fisher for my graduate degree. It was a great experience with very qualified professors and small class sizes. The down side, and reason for 4/5 stars is price, as the tuition was expensive when comparing to others."
Senior,4,I have been working my watch through the nursing program at SJFC and so far has found it great! We are placed on different types of floors for our student nurse program and the teachers really help you in the learning process.
Junior,4,This is a very good college with great opportunities throughout the community and upon peers. The professors are very helpful and the different ways to become more involved with your major is vast.
Sophomore,4,So far this has been a good choice for me.    I struggled a bit the first year and they took action to get me back on track.   I like this campus it is relatively small and easy to get around.   The area has many close ammenities
Sophomore,4,"I love attending St. John Fisher College because of the community. The college would refer to the student population as a ""Fisher Family"" and they live up to it. When I walk down the halls and in the campus quad, I can say hi to so many people and I would get a friendly hi back. I can go to anyone around campus, both faculty, and students, whenever I need help and they would be happy to help me. I am currently receiving a great education while having the best time of my life living on campus."
Senior,4,"St John Fisher College has been a great fit for me as a student.  Although the majority of student are traditional, they are welcoming of non-traditional students.  Being accepted into their nursing program was a big accomplishment.  In comparing Fisher's nursing program to others in the Rochester and surrounding communities, I found that Fisher has the highest pass rate on the NCLEX exams.  This tells me that they do a great job preparing their students for their nursing careers and make sure that they are ready to be employed as they walk out the door with their diplomas.  In addition, their state of the art lab equipment is second to none, giving us great hands on experience in simulation."
Freshman,4,The teachers are different they like weird things which helps  students to get out of their comfort zone. The classrooms are a small size allowing for one on one attention. The biggest downfall to this college is the excessive drug use and narcissistic  preppy people that attend the college .
Freshman,4,I liked the small class size because it allowed me to really get to know my professors. The food is really good compared to most colleges.
Freshman,4,"St. John Fisher College is a great college to attend. Every student is generally happy to be here, they are very welcome, and there are always events to get students to come out of their comfort zones. The only downfall is of course the hard courses. Freshman are thrown into horribly hard courses to see if they are meant for their major, this happens at every school. In my experience, the classes are hard, but if you work hard and study enough, it will all be worth it. The professors are amazing! They will do anything to try to help you anytime. They are always checking their emails and are always willing to help. "
College Sophomore,4,I love the fact that each of my course professor are available in helping me with any question I have about the lecture or assignment they gave in class.
College Sophomore,4,It is great because they gave students an opportunity to work .
College Sophomore,4,"My school pretty has a great safety and security office in which they always have their car going around the campus to make sure that students, faculty/staff are safe."
College Sophomore,4,"St.John Fisher College is a great college because I love the way that the class are small with an average of 20 -30 student in class in which make it easy to ask the professor question. Also, love the way that the professor are available after class or during the office hours to help any students who don't understand the lesson the professor teach. Moreover, I believe what makes St.John Fisher College unique is the warm welcome and friendly the students, professor/faculty staff are each others and I am glad to go that school because it also offer many clubs, volunteering opportunity."
College Junior,4,school could be more objective in political discussions
College Junior,4,students are diverse and willing to engage in social and athletic activities
College Senior,4,We have one of the safest communities as far as colleges go. Our security is top notch and very little bad has happened
College Senior,4,"Much better than any SUNY school, and the dorms are always clean"
College Sophomore,4,My school offers mock-interviews to help better our chances of succeeding in an interview. they also help in finding internships for us. The career center is super helpful.
College Sophomore,4,there's never been an issue with safety or crime on campus. you can walk around campus in the dead of night and feel completely safe
College Sophomore,4,"Fisher's dorms are fairly nice compared to others. Everyone has private bathrooms which is always a plus. They aren't the biggest of dorms, but there are definitely smaller at other schools."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a commuter, I've constantly been told it'll be hard for me to find friends and make inner groups on campus, but my school was super easy to make friends. Everyone is so friendly snd approachable, you could be friends with anyone. Being a small campus, it feels almost like home when I'm there."
College Senior,4,"I feel very safe on campus.  There are emergency blue lights throughout the campus if needed, though I have never seen one used yet.  I don' t live on campus, but I do attend some night classes and have always felt comfortable walking anywhere throughout the school and its campus"
College Senior,4,"I hear from fellow students that they really like it. I however, do not live on campus"
College Senior,4,Many of our school's teams went on to  win finals this year.
College Senior,4,"Overall the school is generally a place I enjoy going and when I am not there I miss my colleagues and professors.  You always feels respected and remembered. The school has a great reputation for a reason, it's overall a great school offering you everything you will need to succeed along with the staff that helps to make sure you do!"
College Student,4,Small class sizes. Opportunities to work one-on-one with professors if needed. Professors care individually about their students. Overall great professors but there are a few here and there that aren't as willing to help out. All the curriculum are vigorous and really are great!
College Student,4,"The career center is really helpful and often provide events on campus for career networking. Almost all students will have a job by graduation, especially nursing and business students. Many opportunities for internships, you just need to make the efforts to find them."
College Student,4,"The campus housing in campus is honestly great! Most of the dorms are very close to the center of campus and the farthest is no longer than a 10 minutes walk. The RAs are great and really willing to help if problems arise. ResLife does a great job choosing RAs. The freshman dorms are a little iffy but that's to be expected. There a perks and downfalls to all of the dorms. Keough and Founders are obviously the best dorms to live because they are the newest. Freshman that get placed in Ward or Haffey is great because the dining hall is connected to the main building and it takes no more than 5 minutes to walk to all your classes. Some RAs are strciter on rules than others and the RDs have no hesitation writing people up, so be careful about making too much noise on the weekends especially after quiet hours."
College Student,4,All the teachers I have had are always willing to go above and beyond to help their students succeed. I love that it's a small school so you can get to know all your professors and actually have a relationship with them as opposed to a large university. It makes reaching out to them for help a lot easier.
College Freshman,4,"Compared to the other freshmen dorms I have seen, Fisher has some of the best dorms. It is also the cleanest residential building I have seen. The rooms are pretty warm year round but opening a window usually does the trick to cool the air down."
College Freshman,4,"This is a wonderful, homey, small school were you can get to know everyone . The people are friendly and the teachers are there if you need help. Of course though, you must make the effort."
College Freshman,4,I feel that the lever of academics at Fisher is great. I think that majority of the professors are more than qualified to do what they do .
College Freshman,4,"I don't think that the campus is mainly one ethnicity or race, I feel as though it is pretty diverse. If I had to choose one, I would say that whites do stand out as being the most present."
College Freshman,4,"I don't think many people partake in drugs and if they do, it is not well known to the public knowledge."
College Freshman,4,"If anyone ever has a complaint, safety and security always checks up on it and follows up. Also, at Fisher, we have the good samaritan policy. This means that if alcohol is involved in an event, but someone needs help (you or a friend) and safety and security is called, there is no penalty for calling; you will not get in trouble."
College Freshman,4,"So far, I am in my second semester of my freshman year and I love my experience. I am very satisfied with my choice of my college and would not change anything about it."
College Freshman,4,"I like the athletic center, but there is a separate room for weights. I am a girl, so I feel like I would be judged if I went in the weight room, which is mostly used by athletes. The athletic center that I use is great otherwise."
College Freshman,4,"Safety and Security's headquarters is located on the ground floor of my dorm and they're extremely helpful in assisting with whatever you need. I had a medical emergency last semester, and they came to my room and checked on me a few times before my parents came. They even offered to call me an ambulance and wait with me for my parents."
College Freshman,4,"Being at Fisher has been great. I have made so many new friends and feel that I have already grown as a person. Some of my friends and I are starting a club, and being a co-leader has given me leadership experience that I can use throughout life."
College Sophomore,4,"We aren't D1, but we are great for a D3. The student section is awesome and we always seem to do well in whatever sport we play."
Sophomore,2,Did not equate to an in-class setting. Staff and faculty seemed highly unorganized and unready to begin online learning. Many professors were not available when they said they would be. Quality of education did not meet standards of tuition investment.
College Freshman,2,"Because there is no Greek life on campus, there aren't many parties. With this in place, it is hard to find out about the parties."
College Freshman,2,I hope you like McDonalds and Panera because that's all you'll get.
College Freshman,2,"I personally hate the party scene. If you want to feel like you're in high school again, go to fisher. The parties are all busted by midnight and the cops are so rude. Being in a ritzy part of Rochester, a lot of houses call the cops at the first peep of noise they hear. Often people hosting the parties shut it down around 1 because they want to go to the bars (understandable). If you like to be cheek to cheek, never be able to move, have no music playing and leave sticky, go to a fisher party."
College Junior,2,You have to go to sports houses or to clubs and bars to party.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is extremely overpriced and although I received aid to go to the school, it still isn't enough and it stresses me out to have to haggle with financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of cold and snow.
College Junior,2,"Living in Rochester,NY is no easy task sometimes. The winters are brutally cold, blizzards make it difficult to get to school and the weather in general can be unpredictable, sometimes going from warm to cold to rain to snow and then back to warm."
College Freshman,2,"The security takes their job way too seriously, trying to get anyone they can in trouble."
College Freshman,2,"not much parking, very crowded"
College Senior,2,between the months of November and April expect lots of snow
College Freshman,2,Security is always busting people for drinking or being to loud in the dorms
College Freshman,2,The atmosphere is not a college town but Pittsford is a beautiful neighborhood with some very nice people
College Freshman,2,The wifi in the dorms is very poor but you dont have to walk very far to a computer lab
College Freshman,2,Off campus housing is not that far of a ride and it is nice to have freedom from off campus
College Junior,2,"permits cost is to high for just 2 nights a week.

parking spots are limited"
College Junior,2,"I have evening  classes, choices are limited"
College Sophomore,2,Its a division III school so there isn't too much going on. If your on campus and have nothig to do its fun to go watch. Football is the most popular as expected. There arent a lot of intermural oppurtunities.
College Senior,2,"My experience with financial aid was great, however feel as if they could have helped me a little bit more. Some of them need to be a little more friendlier. Despite not being friendly enough, they endlessly answer my questions."
College Freshman,2,"It snows a lot, classes never get canceled. in the winter you never have to really walk outside unless you want to."
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek Life here at Fisher.
College Freshman,1,Everyone from fisher finds a job
College Freshman,1,"Worst experience of my life. My balance was constantly changing and after i applied for my loan my cost went up leaving a balance and a hold on my account. Process very confusing and little notice from the school on deadlines. No bill mailed, its all online and very inconvenient."
College Junior,1,Since tuition is always going up it only gets worse as the years go by.
College Sophomore,1,"There is never enough parking spots. Because we don't have off campus housing, many students are on their own as far as transportation. There are so many commuters, that it is impossible to find a parking spot and be on time to class. Students are forced to park illegally and create their own spots if they want to make it to class. I was forced to leave an hour early when it takes me 20 minutes to drive to school, just to I can give myself enough time to find a parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,There is no off campus housing at my school. It is all up to the students to provide housing for themselves if they do not want to live in the college dorms. I think more options should be available.
College Junior,1,Not nearly enough spots for the number of students and faculty enrolled/employed.
College Freshman,1,Campus housing is awful here. Only the freshman dorms are nice and the suites where seniors live
College Freshman,1,There is only one good place to live as a sophomore and reslife will screw you over.
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,"Theres some places to eat, its just hard to get there as a freshman"
College Freshman,1,"its very cold, cloudy and dull here. not much to do outside"
College Sophomore,1,scholarships and grants were non existent for average student
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life.  Other than the sports houses which may be considered Greek Houses.
College Freshman,1,Not a lot of diverse people but you will be accepted no matter what
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life at school but sports teams act as their own frats
College Freshman,1,Not really much around for college students so you may end up paying more than you want for a broke college student
College Freshman,1,"Even though it is not a big campus, it can be tough to find rides to places off campus freshman year because you are not allowed to have cars."
College Senior,1,There are far more commuter students than there are available commuter parking spots on campus. I literally have to get to school at least an hour before my classes so I have enough time to drive around looking for a parking spot.

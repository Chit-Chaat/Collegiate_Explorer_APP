Junior,5,"Valpo is a great school that is well respected throughout the midwest. I find it unfair some people knock their ratings due to the less-than-stellar party scene, (duh, it's a small school of course it's gonna be a bit harder than say Purdue or IU Bloomington), but your VU experience is completely how you want it to be. Very little peer pressure on the campus and everyone is encouraged to be their own self. Tons of ways to get involved. Close proximity to a downtown with a decent amount to do, as well as an hour from Chicago. For those who want a smaller college environment that isn't strict like most other religiously affiliated schools are, this the school for you. There's not really any specific rules that stand out other than dry campus even if you're 21+ but just be quiet about it. Great school spirit for basketball team.  There are some drawbacks to VU such as not as much to do as a huge school and not the best dining experience, but a lot of these things are subjective anyways."
Sophomore,5,"I cherish the community aspect emanated by Valparaiso University and have been rigorously pursued by peers and faculty to get me involved in leadership roles and extracurriculars that fit my skills that I already had and those that I wanted to develop. I have been able to find a balance of work, extracurriculars, classes, and social life by consistent communication. Although the campus is small it is spacious and the hearts and minds that reside within it are big. The compassion and passion of both the diverse faculty and students provides a perfect environment for learning and growing."
Sophomore,5,"Although the coronavirus caused students to have to study at home and be physically distant, the unique Valparaiso University community became ever more closer. Faculty and students alike united to enhance access and knowledge of online learning resources, which resulted in an increase in my own drive and motivation to finish out the homestretch of my freshman year with as much if not more rigor as when I began on campus."
Sophomore,5,Excellent opportunities to succeed. All around a very diverse campus where diversity is lifted and praised. Also many opportunities to speak about issues around the school. The honor code is met and followed by a large majority of students which allows for the college to be truthful and honest.
Junior,5,Valpo is a very unique place. Something that stuck me first is that nearly everyone here has high levels of  academic and social skills. I have met some of the most impressive people here on campus.
Junior,5,The transition from in person to online classes was good. It was especially helpful to have the option to take classes in my major pass/fail. It relieved a significant amount of pressure off me.
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Valpo was phenomenal. I experienced things that I was not expecting at all. I met a lot of people during my breaks, parties and my in class friends became my best friends. At Valpo, everyone shows respect; everyone is friendly and welcomed. Teachers are always here to help during their office hours, even before or after class. I am personally attending the engineering program at Valpo and it is the best I assure you."
Sophomore,5,Valpo is a school where you can find everything you need to attain greatness. It prepares you to strive in any situation.

Freshman,5,"It's a great small school. The campus is beautiful and the people are friendly.  I feel safe walking the campus.  Also, I like the unlimited swipes for food in the Union. You can just go in for a snack anytime you want. The recreation area is nice too.  Pool tables and table tennis.  Always something to do"
Sophomore,5,"I truly appreciate the time and care that the professors put in. I am extremely grateful that I decided to attend Valpo. I have learned so much in this past year and a half. Since I attended a small, Catholic high school, Valpo was the perfect college to transition to since the size was fitting towards me. The class size is perfect for one on one attention, and I have had positive experiences in each class I have enrolled it."
Freshman,5,"I love the small class sizes, the personal attention.The orientation was great for me and for my parents, really  made a difference as I prepared to go away to school.There is a real commitment to student success. I attend the study groups for chemistry and I feel the benefits. My instructors are available and open to questions. I feel supported by program adviser. Every effort is made to get me into the right classes each semester too. 

Valpo is great city. Good restaurants, shopping and downtown offers lots of activities. The popcorn festival was a hoot. Transportation is free for the students via the city buses.

The food is my only complaint. It gets old eating the same things all of the time"
Freshman,5,Valparaiso is a welcoming school! Valparaiso University is known for its meteorology program and physician assistants program. The meteorology program is nationally recognized. They launch weather balloons and have state in the art technology which includes a doppler radar. The campus is good size compared to most universities. The campus is close to downtown Valparaiso which is such a nice town. There are lots of good restaurants and coffee shops near campus.The faculty and staff here at Valpo are super friendly and extremely helpful.
Senior,5,"Valparaiso is a great community whether it be with peers, professors, or even locals. The location of the school is perfect because you have all that you need in walking distance.

Freshman,5,Valparaiso University is a university full of nothing but positive and encouraging people. You will meet so many nice people in such a short amount of time. I love how it is a private institute that includes a chapel.
Sophomore,5,I love the interaction with my professors. The class sizes are smaller so I had a chance to direct contact to ask questions and further understand the material.
Junior,5,"Valpo has been the best experience for me. It is in my hometown which was a turn-off at first because I wanted to be away from home, but I have really fallen in love with it. Valpo is such a welcoming community. I can never walk anywhere on campus without someone smiling or saying hello. The professors are great too. I can feel how much they care about their students. They will make so much time to be sure that everyone is doing well in their classes. The student organizations on campus are also wonderful. I really wanted to get involved on campus outside of classes and I have become a part of so many amazing groups. There really is a club for everyone."
Freshman,5,"Valparaiso University is a great university to attend. The environment is  awesome and safe. The student life is very adaptable and everyone around campus is willing to help whoever is in need.

Sophomore,5,It's a pretty campus with a welcoming community that most can find their place in. The professors are great and make sure you know your stuff. Some could be better.
Niche User,5,I'm so excited to be attending Valpo next year! Their Chinese and music program is excellent and location is perfect.

Valpo has opened so many doors for me and made me the person I am today. Everyone here is so nice and treats people with kindness. The professors are all very intelligent and helpful. The class sizes here are small and intimate which gives me a lot of time to get to know my professors and they can help when I need it. This is an amazing school."
Sophomore,5,"Valparaiso university is everything I wanted in an university.  The professors are always available to help and so are the advisors. Everyone is very helpful in guiding students through our college years.   The library and study areas are very up to date.  There is always something to do in your spare time, either on campus or the surrounding area"
Junior,5,I love how many activities go on throughout the week. There is always something to do! There are also so many resources available to ensure student success.
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful, the people are lovely, and overall I feel confident in my decision here! The only negative experience that has occurred here was my friend needed medical assistance and she did not receive the best help. They accidentally disclosed her medical information to student and they did not give her roundabout transportation to the doctor."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly, and the professors are very helpful and dedicated to their work. I love how beautiful the campus is. There are lots of clubs to join, and lots of opportunities to go to research presentations or other events to gain more knowledge that you can apply to life. Overall, I'm so glad I chose Valpo, it's the perfect fit for me."
Freshman,5,I love this school! The people are sooo welcoming and very friendly. Always a friendly face no matter where you turn. The campus is beautiful looks clean and professional. I am majoring in nursing and the building is amazing! The simulation rooms and so realistic and very hands on allowing for the best real world connections to be made

Freshman,5,"Valparaiso University is a very welcoming and diverse school. Classes themselves vary with a great mix of upperclassmen and freshmen. There are many opportunities to meet new people, pursue personal interests, and experience different activities."
Freshman,5,"I felt very welcomed coming to Valparaiso University. There are a lot of events in which a student can become involved and clubs in which students can participate. There are comedy shows to see, concerts to listen to, and games to be hyped about. As an engineer major, the classes are challenging and the work can be overwhelming if you don't stay on task and study. There are plenty of resources that help with tutoring and finding a job."
Freshman,5,"Valparaiso is a smaller school, but it is no less valuable than larger schools. Valparaiso's key goal for students is to help you reach your full potential and help you build a strong foundation before entering ""the real world"". Apart from Valpo's extensive academic course selection catalogue, they have many courses, clubs and organizations that help it's students learn about different religions and cultures, become better students as well as better people overall and prepare for life after graduation. Everyone on campus is friendly and helpful. This is an amazing university to attend if you value community, family and religion."
Freshman,5,"I really like my first year at Valporaiso University. It is very different from high school.  I have met alot of new people from all over, and tried alot of new things. I really like the option to be a commuter student, so that I can save money on living expenses."
Sophomore,5,I love the community. The academic departments are great. They have an amazing ROTC program. I am current students who enjoys his classes.
Alum,5,Valparaiso University gave me lots of opportunities to thrive and build my leadership and communication skills. The only thing I would like to see change is to provide more funding for student organizations and get more advertising for them.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the small class size and the professors that truly want to see you succeed! The business program is EXCELLENT. You never feel unsafe on the campus. All facilities are very clean. The student life regarding the party scene could be better, but overall a fun university to attend!"
Freshman,5,"I love the fact that this is such a close knit community, everyone is nice and awsome. There is no risk of bullying and everyone is there to support you."
Alum,5,"Valpo gave me experiences that I will never forget, and it set me up to have the successful life I have now. I could not be more grateful for the small class sizes, personal connections with professors, and beautiful campus that made me feel at home for 4 years of my life!"
Sophomore,5,"Valparaiso University is very different than any other college I have visited. I am now a sophomore at Valparaiso and can easily say that choosing to attend this university was the best decision I could have made. Valpo goes above and beyond the average college expectations. They genuinely care about each student and provide them with all the tools and knowledge they could need in order to succeed. The only downside to Valparaiso University would be the expenses that some people cannot cover. Often students are forced to leave, not because they want to, but because they have to. Student debt is a reality that most who attend a private university have to face. Unfortunately, if you are not able to afford a private university such as Valpo, you must withdraw and enroll in another school."
Freshman,5,People associated with the university are friendly and helpful.  The campus is always clean and the dorms are quite.
Freshman,5,"Valparaiso University has a great staff that is dedicated and passionate about what they do. VU is a small, inclusive university that is accepting of all different kinds of peoples, and it has a very high post-graduate employment rate."
Sophomore,5,"I currently attend Valparaiso University. I am an Electrical Engineering major and in my second year. I love it here at Valpo! The university has so many people that care for each student. My experience here has been great. Every step of my journey toward my degree has not been easy. But, whether it be one of the professors, my academic adviser, or even another fellow student, there is always someone who has my back. The professors are always willing to give there time and effort to any student that needs it to help them succeed. I have many times dealt with a stressful situation, but ended up looking at it in a positive manner thanks to the great professors here. Overall, this is one of the greatest universities in the country and will always be my favorite."
Freshman,5,I truly believe Valparaiso University provides a quality education for all those who attend. Challenging courses and kind professors are what make the school magical.
Freshman,5,Valparaiso University has a positive learning environment and it one of the best places to both gain a higher level education and grow as a person.
Freshman,5,"This university is so welcoming to others, especially new students. It feels like a home a way from home. The teachers make sure that the students know that they care for the students' future as well."
Niche User,5,"Happiness is the ultimate accomplishment one can pursue. Some may say that investing in money and education is not quite everything. Although this may be just, comfort and security are two aspects that can be associated with money and education when conceived properly. Personally, educating myself and outstandingly attempting to have a remarkable cognitive is where I find security and comfort. I believe that education is the most important facet of having a healthy, intellectual mind."
Sophomore,5,What I like about Valparaiso University is how invested the professors are in the future of the students. The faculty and staff here genuinely want the students to do well. It's a great environment to learn in and everyone is really friendly.
Freshman,5,So far I am enjoying Valparaiso University. I love how diverse the campus is and how everyone seems to get along and tolerate each other.
Sophomore,5,The professors are very approachable and do a great job of explaining things. All of my professors so far have had office hours that fit into my schedule in case I need to meet with them for help. Taking classes here has helped broaden my mindset about topics I hadn't given much thought before.
Niche User,5,"Well I went their on a visit and it is probably the most modern/safe school I have ever visited. With the college visits going one after another the people and the beautiful campus have remained with me, making this college the top of my list of choices. Honestly there is nothing to complain about!"
Junior,4,"A lot of people aren't fans of online learning and the whole country has had to go through this change together. VU for the most part is pretty organized with its online classes. It's a less than ideal concept in my opinion, but professors try to make the most of it and classes are still for the most part normal, except you aren't in person."
Sophomore,4,the college is safe and is a great environment. The professors are there to help the students whenever you are stopped.
Sophomore,4,"The school is great if you like a small student body with a medium sized campus! However, the party scene is lack luster and donâ€™t come to this school if you want to party. The College of Nursing and Health Professions is great, and so is the engineering college."
Freshman,4,Valparaiso is a great university with great professors. Their programs for all the majors they offer are amazing and the professors seem to love their jobs and genuinely want their students to succeed.
Sophomore,4,I like Valparaiso University because of the close connection that is between the staff and the students there. I appreciate that I'm able to ask my professor questions if I'm struggling on any topic. I like being at Valpo because of their nursing program and how prepared I will be at the end of my education. I'm able to learn from hands-on experience as well as being taught by my professors who are working nurses.
Senior,4,"Valparaiso is a very great school and I had a great education experience.  I wish to see changes regarding to the use of the athletics and for the students overall. I do understand that the university wants to improve campus and facilities to improve on the environment, but some of the improvements I do question and they do not make any sense to me. Overall, the facilities are in great conditions and I think the campus is beautiful during the spring and summer time. It is also rather a smaller university, so I recommend  this university for someone who would like a smaller campus."
Alum,4,Valpo prepared me well for graduate school.  The competitive academic environment was challenging and the curriculum was strong.  Had fun in my fraternity and enjoyed watching Valpo basketball.
Senior,4,"It has a strong reputation and offers many experiences other schools do not, such as business trips, internship fairs, and mentoring opportunities."
Freshman,4,The staff in all departments is extremely helpful. I find the transition into college has been relatively easy due to the effective communication. Events are well organized and plentiful. The classroom experience is outstanding.
Freshman,4,I like the campus life I like how everyone is very close and tight together but also I wish the campus was a lil big bigger it is a beautiful place sometimes I just wish it was bigger.
Junior,4,"Valpo is a beautiful campus and has great people, but they are constantly raising tuition and housing prices to the point that students have to transfer out. But those students canâ€™t transfer out because the mandatory classes they have donâ€™t transfer to other schools"
Sophomore,4,Valparaiso University has provided me with an incredible support system.  I have made great friends through students and professors.  I have been able to find myself and challenge myself.  I have been given opportunities to grow and explore myself.
Freshman,4,"I really love Valpo and Iâ€™m so glad that I chose it. It is a small school and very welcoming. Valpo has a beautiful campus, however sometimes the food isnâ€™t the best."
Freshman,4,Valparaiso's academic assistance is great. If you are struggling in a class there are multiple different resources that are available to help you succeed. Due to the smaller size of the university professors want to help you succeed and not just 'weed you out'.
Freshman,4,"I like that Valparaiso University is a small campus. The student body is close-knit because of its small size. Valparaiso offers a wide variety of clubs and organizations to get involved in, including major-specific clubs. The average class size is about 20-25 students, so the professors are able to learn about their students and help them individually if needed. Students and professors form a close bond because of the small class size. Also, because it is a small campus, students can easily walk from class to class without needing to drive or catch a bus. There are numerous ways to get involved in the student life at Valparaiso because of its small size."
Sophomore,4,"The professors and staff I have encountered have been wonderful to work with! I love the smaller campus and the relationships I've made with the people I met here. The only complaint I have is the actual layout of campus, very awkward."
Junior,4,I love the feeling of community here. It felt like I was at home on my first visit. There are also so many opportunities for leadership positions and getting involved in general on campus.
Sophomore,4,I am currently enrolled in the engineering program. My professors know me by name and I am not simply just a number. I love the open door policy that professors have and there are no TA's. The professors themselves teach the class and there is even a student tutoring system.
Senior,4,"Overall Valpo is a great school and I'll of the classes and professors I've had have been excellent. However, some major problems I have with this school is that every year they increase tuition by over 2k and the food is extremely overpriced."
Niche User,4,I love the environment and energy! It makes me feel right at home because everyone is just so welcoming and the academics very much prepare you for the real world. The teachers and the staff really care about everyone and that is very apparent from observing everyday life on campus.
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman at Valpo. I really love everything about campus life. From all the activities they have to campus food. Everyone is really friendly and the professors are very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"Valparaiso University Is a beautiful college. I enjoy this college very much, the campus is beautiful, down town Valpo is less than one or two miles away! They have fun festivals during the summer! Something that I believe Valpo lacks is that I believe that is should offer classes yearly around rather than just every other semester. I bilieve that they should also get better Advisors. I started school May 2019 and through out my acadamics, I have tried to reach out to her many times , and through out those times she has only contacted me back ocne. This is very irriatating becuase they should be there to help us, and it honestly feels like she does not want anything to do with me when I ask for help."
Sophomore,4,"The courses can be intense and time consuming, but what I have learned has been more than worth it. I also feel at home here and the professors are very nice and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I love Valparaiso University! Itâ€™s a small school with a great community backing you. Most of the teachers are there for you, trying their all to get you ready for the real world. The only down side is the cost. It starts out cheap and gets more and more expensive as you go through your undergrad experience. Otherwise, itâ€™s a beautiful campus and great place to learn!"
Sophomore,4,"Valpo is a safe community statistically speaking. Valpo city police, Porter County, and VUPD are very present and make sure the environment is safe.	
I am a fraternity member. This is not a state school, so don't expect state school Greek life. But, for the size of this school, it does go above and beyond as far as expectations. Do not come here thinking you can blow off school and not go to class. Most everyone here cares extremely about their grades and were good and accelerated students in high school. You make your own fun and get what you put in. Pretty much a small private school in Northwest Indiana. It offers the academics of larger schools and is extremely reputable. Outside of class, everyone is obsessed with Valparaiso Basketball."
Sophomore,4,"Valpo is a nice, small community with great people and opportunities. The curriculum is much more fast-paced than most other schools within the state."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are typically great and very knowledgeable as well as caring. They ask about your personal well being and class sizes are small enough to foster relationships between professors and students. 
One thing I struggle with here is the lack of diversity and open mindedness. I hope that in my time here, I can help improve these issues. The university is religiously affiliated however,  it could be more welcoming to everyone like it advertises."
Freshman,4,I came to Valpo university unsure of the whole college thing. I didn't know if college was right for me but that changed as soon as i got here. The community of valpo is super friendly and makes you feel at home immediately. The comfort I've felt here has allowed me to succeed as a student and citizen.
Freshman,4,"Valparaiso university has very clear strengths and minor weaknesses. The campus is beautiful. The professors are friendly and very willing to help and the student body is very welcoming. There is definitely room for improvement though. Many professors do not post grades frequently enough,  and some of the course and campus required events feel tedious. If you aren't a Christian/Lutheran you may not want to come here because they are very open about it. All in all its a great school with some minor problems that can be a little aggravating at times. And if you are in engineering, your second and third week will be tough."
Junior,4,"They give a lot of importance to Greek life and athletes. If you're not part of any of these you might feel like you don't fit in. However, academics are great and offer many tutoring options."
Freshman,4,Valparaiso University is a fantastic school. The professors love helping their students and there are so many different ways to find help for a course.
Freshman,4,"A small, close-knit college which gives the feeling of a community. The professors are amazing at their jobs and will help you find your career wants and goals. I believe they could improve in their Physics department."
Freshman,4,Valparaiso University is a great mid-size campus. Everyone is very friendly and has no problem with helping others.
Sophomore,4,"The Valpo community is very diverse and a pretty tight knit community. The campus is beautiful. Academics are taken seriously and the professors are great. There are many clubs and activities to get involved in. Our basketball team is good, so it's always fun to go to games. One thing I would change about Valpo is the food choices."
Freshman,4,"Very easy to get involved in more than simply academics. If you're going to college just to study, then you're spending way too much money. Valpo can give you book smarts as well as help you develop skills that can only be obtained through experience."
Senior,4,"Coming in as a transfer student, it's usually difficult to make new friends, however VU has become my home and I have met a lot of new people that I genuinely like. The community is warm and welcoming, although you do run into some snooty people from time to time. Professors are usually excited to be teaching and NO teach assistances are teaching the classes unlike other private colleges where newly graduated students replace the professors. Great population diversity, not only nationally but from around the world as well. Great experience."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great university! Class sizes are very small so you are able to develop a relationship with your professors. Content and curriculum are relevant. I would like to see more steps towards a sustainable campus, such as community gardens for the cafes. However, they do have recycling bins next to almost all trash cans."
Freshman,4,"Valpo is very welcoming. Every time I walk through campus, many people smile or say hello. The staff is wonderful. All of my professors are kind and great at teaching."
Freshman,4,"Valparaiso University is the first campus in general that I've felt accepted for every part of my being, from my identifying as pansexual to my spiritual calling as a Wiccan. The university is Lutheran-affiliated, but they welcome people of all backgrounds and diversity is what the students, faculty, and staff advocate for. I knew from the first visit to campus, a rainy, cold day filled with lake-effect winds, this was the place I was meant to be. It was different from other campuses in how my visit was catered to my MAJOR and my interests. Instead of showing me only what the campus was famous for, we also peeked into the buildings I would frequent and my questions regarding safety on-campus, religious diversity, and multiple other questions that are definitely not frequently asked were easily answered by any student I asked. I recommended this college to every upperclassman from my high school because I want others to feel as welcomed and happy as I do."
Sophomore,4,"One great aspect about Valparaiso is the friendly and welcoming community. The size of Valparaiso is smaller allowing  you to gain a relationship with professors. Having small class sizes have allowed me to excel in my academics. Valpo student life has many clubs and organizations that want you to join and will personally reach out to you to get you involved. The D1 athletics at Valpo are an intriguing factor, because every athletic event is competitive and has contests, food, and excitement. Valpo is a mix of feeling loved, feeling entertained, and feeling pushed to the best of your abilities. One aspect I would like to see at Valpo is to update their athletic facilities and some academic buildings, because they are outdated. Another aspect is they should add another food option on campus. Meaning there should be another cafe or store at a different location on campus with different options than the others to add more diversity."
Freshman,4,"The faculty and staff are very friendly. The campus is beautiful and just the right size. If there was more convenient parking, it would be five stars."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Valparaiso University. The campus is amazing. I professors totally defy the ""college professor "" stereotype because they really enjoy helping students to achieve and get the hang of the college life. Even leaving campus, it seems that the entire city of Valparaiso is full of friendly people who enjoy their community. I never really understood how a community could impact each other's lives until I attended Valparaiso University. It's somewhat diverse and there are numerous clubs that help embrace the different ethnicities and different sexualities on campus. For students, like myself, who aren't extremely quick at understanding new topics and information, Valparaiso University offers numerous help/support groups as well as personal tutors. In addition, the professors are more than willing to expand or make their schedules more flexible/suitable for the students. Overall, my experience so far at Valparaiso is great."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is easy to get into. They do a lot for the community & have awesome parties!
College Senior,4,"The professors are grear and good at their jobs, but I have experienced some bad professors. The good professors are the ones who can teach their class in a way that is beneficial to each student, however the bad professors just make the students like myself miserable."
College Senior,4,Many students who graduate from valparaiso have been able to get jobs right after. This shows the benefits of attending valparaiso.
College Senior,4,The dorms are great and spacious. The staff does a great job with cleaning the dorms and it feels like home.
College Senior,4,The athletics are great and the events bring the students together as they support their own. The athletics shows school spirit and it is a great part of the school.
College Senior,4,Valparaiso University  is a great school with professors and a loving environment. The numerous amount of activities and the size of the campus makes it easy to develop bonds with other students. The school challenges you to be the best you and that's why I would go back to Valparaiso University to do it all over again.
College Senior,4,"The crime at the university is low. Campus police continuously patrol the parking lots. I think that the campus police should have to do routine walk through checks, through the buildings, making sure there are no suspicious activity or people.  There are many help buttons throughout the campus, just in case there was a problem."
College Senior,4,"I do not play sports anymore, but sports are an important aspect of my university.  There is great school spirit, with many home games to attend.  Sadly, I do not make it to the games as often as I would like being a commuter."
College Senior,4,"Some of my favorite experiences at my school would be the material that is taught in the class room, by the great professors.  If there weren't 5 outstanding professors, from 5 different backgrounds, I would not be as interested in my field of study. With the diverse lectures and labs, it makes studying meteorology at Valparaiso University an amazing experience. One thing that I would do over is being a commuter from over 80 miles away.  It has put added stress on myself and my wife. There are a lot of out of pocket expenses that strain our bank account; but we find a way to make it work. I would have choose to live in Valparaiso if I could go back, with my wife."
College Sophomore,4,"Basketball is amazing, but the other sports are not as awesome."
College Sophomore,4,"My friends in Greek life really enjoy it, and Valpo's Greek life has a large influence from philanthropy, which makes it an amazing experience."
College Freshman,4,VU does a great job at preparing you for job interviews and projects. They have an excellent crew that does mock interviews and sets their students up with real employers.
College Freshman,4,The professor's here are very informative and care about their jobs. The course are relative.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. They have emergency call buttons if needed.
College Freshman,4,"It's great, the whole building loves to be social and get together and have fun. I love living with these people and having all these people around!"
College Freshman,4,They do alot for the community and are a big help!
College Freshman,4,There is a great show of school spirit! Everyone loves to go to a football game or soccer game! The work out rooms are clean and up to date.
College Freshman,4,Valparaiso University is such a beautiful and enriching school. Everyone that attends is so friendly and helpful. The professor's are passionate about what they teach and teach with enthusiasm. I love going to school there!
Freshman,2,"A safe and comfortable feel, but not the college lifestyle I wanted.  Hard to find people to party with or even hang out with on the weekends.  Nice people, just not a very social environment.  Campus is very spread out and there in not much to do in the surrounding city.  Academics are ok but very comparable to high school classes.  Dorm life here is pretty awful."
College Freshman,2,You're only here so they can take your money. Don't care about you or how you do.
College Freshman,2,i do not like valpo. it is very small and very boring. As an athlete i am extremely dissapointed
College Freshman,2,I hated my dorm. Too many drunks. Too many drugs.
College Junior,2,"Founder's, Valpo's main cafeteria has quite a few options such as pizza, pasta, sandwiches, soup, salad, bbq and burritos along with a main food line, whose food changes for lunch and dinner. The meal plans are mandatory if you live on campus and are pretty expensive, but you will use it all because each item costs something. You have a certain amount of money on your meal plan, not a certain number of meals to use. The options available for people who are gluten free or have other food allergies are not that great. This is something that they are working on but currently the options aren't very good. I often get sick of having to eat only a few of the numerous options.

Cafe is Valpo's other cafeteria. Cafe is more of a grab-n-go place with a small convenience store that has a few groceries and toiletry items. The Cafe also has crepes, smoothies, salads and rice bowls. These are delicious but expensive so you have to be careful not to get them too often. There is also a Starbucks in the Cafe, as well as in the library."
College Junior,2,Too many staff parking spots and not enough student spots.
College Student,2,Basketball is the only highlight of sports here. don't even bother to go to a football game. Fitness center has nice equipment but it is too small.
College Student,2,"Basically a bunch of middle-class, white kids."
College Student,2,It's call Val-pour-rain-snow for a reason.
College Sophomore,2,"all the majors have requirements which are necessary, but some hold double standards which in the end screw you over.  Some profs have no motivation to encourage their students."
College Sophomore,2,The only good housing is either Uptown which you can only get as a junior or senior or the newest building which isn't even finished yet.
College Junior,2,"Winters are very cold. Especially this winter, and rain"
College Sophomore,2,Bad weather as close proximity to Lake Michigan.
College Freshman,2,Always hard to find working printers and the wifi is slow.
College Junior,2,"Because we're in the north, the winters can get pretty brutal and walking to class becomes a huge hassle in 16 inches of snow."
College Junior,2,"The wireless can be jammed up from time to time from excessive use of the system, but the computer labs are a nice added feature."
College Junior,2,"It is at times hard to communicate with the office of financial aid, but once you get through, they can help you out at a medial level."
College Student,2,"I feel like the student life on campus is kind of bland because the campus activities are limited. The campus activities that take place is repetitious so it becomes boring after a while. Towards the beginning of the year, it was so much to do but now its as if its the same functions happening every week. There is nothing that really excites you."
College Freshman,2,"""Val-pour-rain-snow""--The nickname students created for Valparaiso. It describes all the different types of weather one can experience in a typical day here at VU.  But don't forget the wind, for there is always wind of some kind here.  And it is always blowing in your face, no matter which direction you're walking.  The met majors love the variety of climates here!  The rest of us, not so much."
College Freshman,2,"Valpo is mostly upper middle class white students.  There is a population of international students, but they pretty much stick together.  "
College Freshman,2,The parking garage is not very convenient and as a freshman that is the only place you can park.
College Freshman,2,"I struggled to get additional scholarships, if you don't have what the government or school considers ""financial need,"" then you are out of luck, even if your school is over $40k a year."
College Freshman,2,Athletic center is far out dated and especially for being a D1 school it is lacking.
College Freshman,2,The ARC offers great facilities if we were living in the 1970s.  A couple of gyms and a small fitness center.
College Sophomore,2,"It's an Indiana school, so the winters are pretty harsh and the summers are pretty scorching. There's also no air conditioning in the on-campus dorms which sucks, but you can go other places. "
College Sophomore,2,Founders is only open until 8 so if you can't make it by then you either have to go off campus or to the cafe. The cafe wouldn't be that bad of an option but the food is so expensive and unhealthy you might as well not eat at all. 
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is lacking, some friday nights it is practically impossible to  find a party to go to. And when you do go out its always the same thing, talking to people that will act super awkward the next day. If you wanna go shopping or out for dinner you have to find a friend with a car who is willing to drive you out. Or you could walk a couple of miles off campus and go shopping or something."
College Sophomore,2,"At Valpo, the police, or RA's are very strict about alcohol and drug use. If you're in a room that is busted for alcohol, you written up, along with whoever else is in there, sentenced to a 'j-board hearing'. Also, they confiscate your alcohol, or in other words pour it down the drain in front of you. You will receive and e-mail from the RLC of your building regarding your 'J-board' time, where you receive your sanctions for misconduct. If you are caught often enough, you have to take alcohol 'CARE' classes. If you are caught with drugs, it is a misdemeanor, and you face the consequences that you may be kicked out of school."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall often over prices there food, making it hard to stay on budget with your meal plans.  The food often becomes redundant but is typical of most mass produced food.  Local dining is very non-existent, aside from your typical Dominoe's or Papa Johns."
College Sophomore,2,The undergrad campus has lots that you can park in but the law school is in the middle of a residential area so parking can be scarce if you don't want to pay to park in the lot.
College Sophomore,2,I see a few frat houses but greek life is pretty quiet around here.
College Freshman,2,"In my experience, strictness at this school is very high. Noise level violations are always being handed out even if the accused aren't being extremely loud. It seems that students only get in trouble for the little things like noise, and visitation hours while there are other students doing drugs in their rooms."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life does have ocassional days when it dominates the social atmosphere, usually when it puts on big events. In general, however, Greek life does not take over the social scene. I personally am not in a fraternity yet I have made friends rather easily by other means. It's definitely worth considering joining Greek life but your status on campus does not depend on it."
College Sophomore,2,"Not much to do, most folks just hang out in groups inside dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"There are quite a few international students, but most of them manage to evade the mandatory rule of staying on campus until you've achieved senior status."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid department was not very helpful in terms of giving information. The process was speedy, but I basically had to figure out everything out by myself. If i had to advise anyone, I would say to make a detailed plan of financial information by term."
College Sophomore,2,I was very disappointed with the Greek life here. There is not a lot of variety and the sisters don't seem that close.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Much Variety. Unlike most other colleges that have big name fast food companies in the cafeteria, Valparaiso doesn't have it. Instead they have four sections in the main cafeteria. One is called Chef's Corner that makes stuff like grilled fish or stuff that is almost fancy. You have the Grill which makes burgers and burritos along with tacos. Then there's Sizzle where you can get pasta or pizza. Lastly you have the sandwich section that makes, as you guessed, sandwiches. The food is price decently but they really don't switch up the menu. You will get the same thing from time to time."
College Sophomore,2,"Lots of Busts â€“ For some reason it seems like the majority of the druggie users get busted. There are, of course, plenty of people who don't use that often, and they are rarely caught. you basically only get caught if you're stupid and smoke in your room."
College Sophomore,2,"Depends on the Day â€“ The past winter was mild, but it's always slippery when there is snow and ice. Also it randomly rains, and there is literally always wind. So the rain pelts you and blows your umbrella upside down. Entertaining when it's not you though"
College Senior,2,Buses Are an Option â€“ We have a bus system but it is not ideal for all students. It does not go everywhere and it does not run in the summer.
College Sophomore,2,there is not much night life other than at faternity parties. Valparaiso is a small town so not much goes on. There are a few bars around but otherwise you have to make your own fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing is only available to students during their senior year, so that is a negative aspect. The cost difference is noticable between dorms and the apartments. At the off campus apartment you are able to do what you want rathar than having to listen to campus living rules."
College Junior,2,"Valparaiso is extremely homogeneous.  Most of the population is upper-class, white, straight, and leaning more toward the conservative side politically.  We do have some international students, but they tend to socialize among themselves.  There could definitely be a lot more diversity here, but I do not see the composition of the school changing anytime soon."
College Freshman,2,"Good Acedemics and Dorms but Not Athlectics â€“ I believe that the student union and the library and all the academic building are all very nice and new. The Athletic Department is complete deprived for one its small, the basketball court only hold about 4,000. the swimming pool dose not meet NCAA regulations, the track? o I forgot there is none, football stadium is smaller than most highschools. The only thing there are improving in is the dorms with the new Up Town East appartments, Guild/memorial, and warrenburg, but they need to get new freshman dorms."
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot to do, school-sponsored, if you do not drink or party.  No transportation for those without cars."
College Sophomore,2,"It's an Outsiders Dream â€“ I feel Valpo puts a lot of emphasis on it's outward appearance. To visitors, the school is gorgeous and everything is modernized to the extreme. But once you're here, the dorms are awful and even some of the academic buildings are questionable. If I had realized some of these things before deciding to come here, I may have considered another small school.. I always feel safe here, but I hate living here."
College Sophomore,2,"Something most people don't realize until they actually start here is that the majority of students don't love this place.  I didn't love it here in the beginning but it has grown on me a bit.  The people are good though, they're what make it worthwhile.  There are a lot of service opportunities on campus which I enjoy.  Plenty of alternative spring break options is one of its strengths.  I'll be ready to leave this place when the time comes."
College Sophomore,2,"Hard to Live Off Campus Prior to Senior Year. Apartments and rentable houses can be found pretty close to campus, within the same range as Greek housing. I cant speak for the affordability of these housing options or how nice they are. Greek life is the best way to live off campus prior to Senior year."
College Junior,2,"The off campus housing near the campus is fairly old.  There are some new apartments on the North side of the campus, but other than those, most decent housing requires driving to school."
College Sophomore,2,"I did not feel safe anywhere except campus.  The security measures and police force are absolutely ridiculous and a complete waste of tuition money.  There is no need for them to manage college students' drinking habits every second on the day.  I was stopped once on my way back from class at 6 at night.  Crime isn't bad, minus that guy that tried to blow up Brandt."
College Sophomore,2,"The computers in the dorms are awful. They are super slow and work questionably at best. If you go to the library or union they work fine, but everywhere else they don't work very well."
College Sophomore,2,"Seems average â€“ From what I've heard, if the police catch you drinking, you go to jail. But tons of people drink all the time and don't get caught. Other than that, it mostly depends on how strict your RA is."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much to Do â€“ There really isn't much nightlife in Valpo. There's the hookah lounge and a few bars, but that's it."
College Junior,2,Most people are from the Midwest. There are some pretty girls. The guys aren't the hottest but usually are really great people-- no tools at this school.
College Sophomore,2,"Alcohol not hard to get into dorms â€“ While the college doesn't allow alcohol in dorms officially, it's really not that hard to get it in and have some."
College Sophomore,2,"Frankly, the wireless network at Valparaiso leaves much to be desired as most students can not obtain quality Internet access from their dorm rooms. Labs that are located within each dorm building are not well maintained and often run out of paper or ink for printing. Overall, I think this would be an area where Valpo can make large improvements."
College Sophomore,2,"From November-March, there's typically a lot of rain and snow. There is often flooding and massive amounts of snow during this period. Once you get used to it, you begin to count the days down until the weather changes."
College Junior,2,"fall and spring are ok... usually a lot rain.  Lots of snow come January and classes are never cancelled-its pretty though.  When its nice, its really nice."
College Sophomore,2,Things Do to but Not for College Students â€“ Valparaiso has many stores and a few places of interest such as the annual popcorn fest but is not an interactive college town
Alum,1,"Online classes are a ramshackle mess of whatever they could throw together and call a course, or they are just the pre-established online course developed elsewhere with no changes or supplementary material to accompany it. Most professors do not understand the technology and online platform they use well enough to troubleshoot errors."
Niche User,1,"I moved off campus, as I had found a job that worked with my schedule that I planned to keep during summer. They would not change my status to a commuter student and still pushed a ridiculous meal plan and lodging expense on me. The excuse ""my fafsa had an out of state address"". I was now independent of my parents, moved to IN, and living in my own apt. I hadn't paid for the second semester and wanted to negotiate to get rid of meal plan and housing for the second semester and my following year. They were not having it. It was either I paid for all of the above, or lost my enrollment. The meal plan is out of this world expensive as well as housing costs. If there is mold in a full building they don't remove it, (Promenade). They also require you live on campus for 3 years. It's near impossible to venture out and figure out how to be a productive member of society and figure out how to live on your own if you attend this university. I would never recommend this to anyone, ever. Period."
Junior,1,"Valparaiso University can be described in one word: Greedy. The amazing engineering professors are at the wrong university because this place aims and sucking every last dollar out of you. The cafe (place where you can get to-go food) has prices that well exceed and sometimes even doubles the price for the same item at the local convenience store. The $50k+ tuition is not worth the little the university provides i.e substandard housing, food, events, etc. Plenty of other schools offer better opportunities for the same cost or lower. Additionally, there is little to do here socially. You can either join a Greek organization, which are almost all dry and or basically professional and not social (for copious amounts of money), or you can hang out with your roommate. Other than that, social life evades Valpo. If you are interested in coming here, ask yourself one question: Am I going to Valpo for engineering and that is it? If so, please come, otherwise avoid at all costs."
Sophomore,1,This university promises a lot but returns very little. I am not happy with my investment in coming here.
College Freshman,1,Financial aid is a hassle.
College Sophomore,1,I did not like the way everything was handled for students that were struggling. Profs were misleading
College Sophomore,1,"I do not like being told what to do so the strictness bugs me, but I listen to what the rules are.  They make the rules for a reason.  You can get away with it if your careful, but you are risking a lot"
College Student,1,The financial aid constantly gave me problems. My parents had to make countless of trips to the university so I can remain in school. They really do not supply you with information on financial aid so you are basically confused when it comes to the whole financial aid process.
College Student,1,The weather in Valparaiso is horrible. I have to walk to class so it becomes difficult when there is 3 feet of snow and temperatures of negative degrees. I often become late because I always become detoured because sidewalks are not shoveled.
College Sophomore,1,"We are very overcrowded and even with freshman not being aloud to have a car on campus there is absolutely nowhere to park ever. It's extremely annoying and inconvenient, but the university is working on making more parking."
College Sophomore,1,The wireless connection could not be worse. My computer is so much slower at school and the internet is always going out.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is repetitive and often very bland. You will get tired of it second semester of freshman year. There is only one main dining hall, and a cafe. Literally, they serve the same things, week after week."
College Sophomore,1,"At VU, there are limited places your meal plan money can go to. The Union, Founders, and a little coffee shop area in the library. With that being said, the food gets old very quick. The burrito bowls begin to taste like the chicken alfredo because everything lacks flavor. Use your money, but you will might as well spend it on everyone in the union because you have a ridiculously large meal plan your freshman year that is non-refundable. Spend, spend, spend. Then, go out to Panera Bread, or Noodles & Co. with your friends here and there to remind you what real good tastes like."
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much to do in this town, it is very small and has a sort of rural appeal to it.  If you are looking for shopping the best place to go is about 45 minutes our to Merriville, IN.  The shopping provided in Valparaiso includes a WalMart, Target, JCPennys, and a few other retailers."
College Sophomore,1,"Valparaiso University is a division one school for basketball only.  The rest of the athletic teams here are typically not very good, and the track team doesn't even have an actual track to practice on."
College Sophomore,1,"The educational program at the school is exceptional, but the dorms would not reflect this at first glance. I found a cockroach in my dorm, and lets just say my roommate and I were not the only ones with this problem. The halls are clean, but the bathrooms are so old, the toilets and sinks are always overflowing!  Yuck. Needless to say it's not a 5 star resort. This is very common within the freshman dorms as well as Brandt and Scheel hall. The only tolerable dorms are memorial and the uptown East apartments. However, those are only dreams for most of us who can't afford another 18 thousand a year aside from tuition."
College Sophomore,1,"not much ethnicity. the admissions tries to admit alot of non-white people, but they get weeded out by the whiteness, for the most part. African Americans are a rarity, and probably on the Track team or Football team"
College Senior,1,"Dry Campus â€“ The campus is a dry campus and drinking is not allowed even for those who are of age. This of course causes problems both socially and academically. Many students feel as though they cannot go out and have fun with their friends even though they are of age. Many students also can get in trouble with the law for drinking on campus, which can cause problems in their academics."
College Sophomore,1,"Valparaiso is a dry campus. End of story. It's a ""tobacco free"" campus. Many students still smoke cigarettes. Alcohol has to be very well hidden and public intoxication is strictly punished. RAs and campus police are very strict. Only a handful of students smoke marijuana."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is extremely small. The dorms are decent and all are an equal distance from the Union. They're clean. Alumni, Lankenau, and Brandt are typically freshman, sophomores, and some juniors. Most upperclassmen live in Memorial/Guild or the Uptown East apartments, which are still considered on campus and have RAs. Uptown is very expensive and farther from the Union."
College Sophomore,1,"Lack and Overload â€“ I came to Valparaiso University because it was close to home. Had I visited and learned more about the campus before attending, I probably would not have chosen to attend. It is a very small campus and there is a lack of diversity in students and professors. I have had the same Spanish professor 3/4 semesters that I've been there. There is a work overload. I spend a ridiculous amount of time on homework. Registration is fairly easy and the school websites are simple to navigate. Engineering is a popular area of study."
College Senior,1,It's Cold â€“ It is freezing cold all year round and classes never get cancelled.
College Sophomore,1,"Always raining, always gloomy, classes are quite far from the dorms."
College Sophomore,1,"Very little off campus housing, will be stuck in a dorm most likely."
College Freshman,1,"Prison is better â€“ Every wall is cinder block, so the rooms get ungodly hot without a/c.  Rooms are tiny with everything built into the walls.  Sink water tastes bad and sometimes has a color to it.  Showers are tiny and dirty and there's no ventilation in the bathrooms so they stink and get incredibly hot "
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Do â€“ There are a few bars. There is no transportation, so make sure you have a dd. There is not much to do if you are under 21. Most parties get busted by midnight, and quite a few people have gotten arrested off campus. The best bet if you are under 21 is to drink in the dorms. Though its a dry campus, its safer too drink there, you'll still get in trouble if you get caught, but not arrested ."
College Freshman,1,"If I would decribe Valparaiso ""atmosphere"" I would say that there is little to nothing to do becides school work. I feel that as a freshman without access to a car there is nothing to do. Valpo provides little to no campus entertainment, the Frats do not provide many parties because of fear of the campus police. Valpo sports are a joke becides the basketball team and they dont have a homecoming dance or any dance sponcered by the school."
College Freshman,1,"Drug Scene-Unenforced â€“ We are a smoke free and dry campus...or so they tell us.  I cannot go a day without smelling smoke and many freshman become intoxicated in their dorms, even the underage RAs drink.  The second floor reeks of pot and other illegal substances."
College Freshman,1,"VUPD is awful â€“ VUPD basically has a ploicy of ruining all the fun you would normally have at college.  If you do not go to fraternity parties and spend the night there you have about a 25% chance of getting arrested. The RLC of Alumni is also terrible.  He had a kid arrested, because he had drank a beer and went out to smoke a cigar (he thought it might have been weed)."
College Junior,1,"Okay, but Very Expensive â€“ I personally like the dining services. The food is good, not great, and there's a decent variety, but it is nowhere near the quality you should get for what you pay. There is also a tax for meal card money, and a mandatory amount onto your meal card for students living on campus. If you don't spend it all, you lose the money. And the mandatory amount is almost always too much money, so many students lose hundreds of dollars. I give it a low grade mostly due to the financial reasons. There is also a small store for your meal card to use (also expensive)."
College Sophomore,1,"Outdated Operating Systems â€“ Almost every computer at Valpo is still using Windows XP. It is really frustrating when someone tries to send an office file to a professor or colleague, because almost every student has a newer version of Microsoft Word. The speed of the computers is also lacking."
College Senior,1,"The commuter lot by the engeneering and meteorology building always has someone hawking around trying to get a spot and parking tickets are not really given out to much, the lazy people go and park there when they dont have a pass and never get caught."
College Freshman,1,No Selection â€“ Valparaiso only lets you live off campus if you are a senior.  If you are a junior then you can live the university apartments which are ridiculously high.  $1000/month per person.
College Freshman,1,"Crowed Dining â€“ Last year all dining halls were closed down and one central dining building was built.  The whole camps, 3,900 ppl, all craming into one building at lunch time is annoying.  Not to mention all the unhealthy foods. No healthy foods unless you like rotten fruit."
College Sophomore,1,"Dry Campus = Crappy Alcohol Policies â€“ The campus police are becoming less strict, but if you get busted by them you'll definitely get an underage.  In the dorms, RA's won't call the cops unless you're really messed up but they can hand out some pretty dumb punishments.  In the end, you can't lose your housing because we're all required to live on campus until we're seniors (a policy that also sucks)."
College Junior,1,"Spirit Lacking.  Talent Lacking â€“ ----------------------
Student Involvement In Sports-
Our basketball games are pretty well attended, but all of our sports are a joke and everyone knows it.
----------------------
Team Performance-
Reliably terrible
----------------------
Fan Support-
Well you will find people more supportive than I, but overall the support is little.
----------------------
School Spirit-
Ask any student how our school song goes and I guarantee you they won't know it... unless they were a part of freshmen orientation where they lie to you about things such as School Spirit.
----------------------
Athletic Facilities-
For non-sports people there is a new workout facility that is completely free AND it isn't half bad (not great though).  +0.52 for Valpo.  For athletes I have no idea what you get. It's better than what I get. That's all I know.
----------------------
Don't come here for the athletics, and I don't just mean for people in the stands.  Potential athletes beware.  We really aren't a good place for you to be if you want to go somewhere with your sport."
College Junior,1,"----------------------
Looks-
Men:   Average
Women: Poor
-------------------------------------
Dress-
Casual mostly.  You won't find hipsters here.  A few bro's and a few fashionable women.  It's pretty lax in that regard.
----------------------
Social Life-
It can be hard to find things to do on weekends.  The frats will have parties, but if that stuff isn't for you your best bet is a movie or game with friends.  You will learn to make your own fun.  Keep in mind that this is a DRY CAMPUS, so if you are doing anything with booze you have to be careful at least.  OR you could actually follow the rules set by the institution you decided to give all your money to.
Additionally, this school can also be a little strange.  I have been stopped from playing Poker by the RA's because gambling is not allowed and other pretty silly things like that.
Members of the opposite sex cannot be in your dorm room after 2:00 a.m. typically. But again if you do have someone in your room later just be careful not to do something stupid and you should be fine.
----------------------
Relationships-
Not going to lie, a lot of women are here to get their Mrs. degree...
----------------------"
College Sophomore,1,"TOO STRICT â€“ If they were a little less strict, things wouldn't get so out of control."
College Sophomore,1,"LIGHTEN UP! I feel that they take their job WAY too seriously. Honestly just let us have some fun once in a while. There isn't a huge threat, and they keep us safe, but it's a little obnoxious."
College Freshman,1,"Mostly White â€“ Mostly white, hardly any international students."

Junior,5,"It’s hard but the professors are getting better at using online learning tools. They try to help you, or al least my current professors do. Very tiring without breaks tho"
Sophomore,5,The professors are exceptional. This past year the online classes were amazing. We transitioned to online learning due to COVID-19 it was challenging yet rewarding. Zoom learning was not what I envisioned when I applied but I felt like. Ryan’s falculty made the transition very well.
Sophomore,5,Bryant is an amazing school. The atmosphere and diversity is what separates the school from others. The professors are easily accessible and accomadating. This year was challenging with COVID-19 but I feel that it was seamless  and rewarding. I wouldn’t change a thing!!
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely loved my Freshman year at Bryant University. I made so many friends during my first year, and when I say that 95 percent of the people you will meet at Bryant are great people I'm serious. All of the professors care a ton about the students, and they are super nice and understanding. I am very happy that I chose Bryant."
Sophomore,5,Only took online courses during the pandemic. But they were just as good if not more interactive and motivating.
Senior,5,"I love going to school here. Small enough that it feels like a tight knit family, but enough to meet new people all the time!"
Senior,5,Bryant was one of the first schools to adapt to a remote model and immediately they did a great job. People we’re connected via Blackboard only a week after being sent home and they changed to P/F grades for those who wanted to accommodate everyone.
Freshman,5,awesome school! I would recommend anyone to go to Bryant. You will get a great job after and make friends for life.
Freshman,5,"Although I am only a freshman, I believe that Bryant has provided me with the resources I need to succeed. I have had excellent encounters the staff at Bryant University and I feel that they truly want their students to succeed. I love the small class sizes and I feel that I can create a personal connection with all of my professors."
Freshman,5,"I like almost everything about Bryant University. I love the fact that they are moving in the right direction with the future looking brighter and brighter every day. I also like to see how they earn their respect from the students, by giving them the exact same respect. Everything there is clearly kept at well maintenance from the classrooms with the clear whiteboards, to the gym. The teachers show the same respect as well. They give just the attention the students need when they need it. These elements all show why Bryant gets the respect it deserves."
Junior,5,I like the small school culture and small classroom size. Bryant does its best to place you in the career of your choosing and to develop the skills in order to succeed.
Freshman,5,"Bryant is a great school with a beautiful campus, great academics, and caring students that make you feel at home. If you appreciate being able to say Hi to five people you know on your way to class in the morning, this is the school for you. It has become my home away from home. Most of my professors so far have been extraordinarily talented and are dedicated to helping their students understand the material. I am beyond excited to continue studying here for the next three years."
Niche User,5,"When I went to tour the campus, it was a really well delivered speech about the college and a beautiful campus."
Niche User,5,"My experience with Bryant University was great. I loved the atmosphere of the school and how welcoming everyone was. When I went to visit the campus, everyone I met mad me feel like I was already apart of the school. My experience was slightly different, because I visited twice. The first time I met with the tennis coach and took a campus tour. The second time I visited, I met the whole tennis team and all of their friends. If you are looking here and have a friend who goes there, I would definitely recommend spending a whole day there with them, then spending the night. This is what helped me get a good feel for the school."
Freshman,5,"Bryant University is a school primarily focused on business but it does offer the the arts and sciences. I am a business major and I can say that I love Bryant University. The professors are good and the dorms are very nice and spacious compared to other colleges/universities. It is a PWI so there is not much diversity but they do offer the 4 mile program for multicultural and international students so you get a chance to meet people. There are many D1 sports teams and the food is average, but it gets repetitive."
Sophomore,5,"Bryant is truly one of those schools with a work hard, play hard mentality. The students and school has a high focus on succeeding and getting a great job, but sees the importance of having fun and living your best life. Often a question in the work place is “who would you rather be stuck to in an airport for hours? Either a really smart ivy-student, or someone who is relatable, funny, interesting, and decently smart.” Bryant students are definitely the latter."
Sophomore,5,"Bryant university is a farley small school, but has a great community feel. The campus is beautiful. The professors really want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Bryant University is not only a beautiful campus, surrounded by trees and water and many plants, but it is also a place where learning is the priority. Everyone on campus is there to learn, and everyone has the same desire to graduate. The teachers and their classroom's create a safe and fun environment for the students to excel and reach for their goals."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Bryant. The social life is great and the academics are even better. I feel like I will get a job after college and that Bryant has trained me well. I wish that they had better food however. It is college though not many schools have great food.
Sophomore,5,"The faculty here are super helpful and are always willing to answer question! There are lots of opportunities here! Only downside I would say is the food, there are little to no choices in food."
Freshman,5,"Bryant University is a college where you can receive excellent education on Business. Therefore, I chose to major in International Business. This is my first year at Bryant, I fully feel involved because there are so many events going on in the campus. Such as Gateway sessions and different cultural festivals."
Freshman,5,"Bryant really gets you prepared for the business world and all other fields connected to it. I myself am in school to earn a bachelors degree in  communications with a double minor in psychology and business administration. One amazing perk at Bryant that many schools don't have is that you are required to have a major as well as a minor and it's all planned into your schedule, so you don't have to take extra classes. So you graduate with not only a major, but also a minor. Everyone at Bryant from staff, professors, and students, they're all accepting and helpful in every way you could imagine. They have lots of connections and can get you ahead of the game as soon as you start."
Niche User,5,"It was the perfect schoolfor me. It is well rounded with academics, extra criicullar activies, and sports. It is the school that will nourish and guide me throughout my four years and will make me a better human."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the atmosphere at this University, it is a small campus so when you walk around you see the same people all the time and bonds develop. I can't think of anything I would change, maybe the cost but I don't have control over that. Expensive or not Bryant University is a great place to be and a great school to get a degree from."
Alum,5,"Great school, would highly recommend the executive center courses. Great value and a worthwhile investment.  This school has got it right."
Alum,5,Really appreciate everything this school and it's people have me. I went to Bryant when it was Bryant College back in the early 90s. It was the times of change when a small not a well-known school was beginning to change. I am happy to see more and more Bryant  graduates taking executive positions with the national companies as well as embarking on the entrepreneurial paths. Great work!
Niche User,5,"I love everything about Bryant University. The class sizes are just right, and having a small community is great for the students and professors. I am thrilled to say that I will be attending Bryant this year!"
Freshman,5,I am loving my experience here at Bryant. The course load isn't that bad and the parties are awesome. Providence is literally right there with all these cool bars and other fun schools that you can visit whenever you want. GO BULLDOGS!!!
Niche User,5,"I applied to and was accepted to 10 universities.  After my initial college visits, I narrowed my search down to three schools of which Bryant was one of them.  I was looking for a smaller school with a strong sense of community.  After a second round of campus visits to my top three schools, I decided on Bryant.  Knowing that I wanted to concentrate my studies in some area of Business, but still unsure exactly which area, I liked the fact that at Bryant, I do not have to officially declare a major until the end of my Sophomore year.  In addition, as a requirement for graduation, Bryant requires every student to select both a major and a minor.  If your major is in the Business School, your minor must be in the College of Arts and Sciences, and vice versa.  I think this will better prepare me for the business world by making me a more well rounded individual."
Alum,5,"Small school centralized around business, but is quickly growing and adapting to an ever-changing world.  As the business world changes, Bryant is quick to adjust its programs."
Senior,5,"I think Bryant is an amazing school with amazing people. Whether it be students, teachers, advisers, etc. everyone at Bryant is concerned with the success of students.  I transferred to Bryant and am beyond thankful I was giving the opportunity to do so because I feel that this school pushed me to my limits, in a good way, and helped me succeed in every aspect possible. I started as a second semester sophomore and only regret not starting sooner.  I have no negative things to say about this amazing school."
Freshman,5,"Bryant University is a great school overall. Its community is warm-hearted and welcoming to new freshmen. Although it is a great school, academically, sports are one of my biggest concern. As a Bryant University cheerleader, it brings to my attention that cheerleading is not a sport. By introducing scholarships for the cheerleading team, the university can attract more female students and also people interested in cheerleading. Therefore, i would like to school to change the rules, and consider cheerleading a sport."
Sophomore,5,I love the small college life. You know almost everyone and there is always sonething to do and never bored
Junior,5,I Love the psychology department. Everyone is so friendly and kind. It makes you a well rounded person. I live off campus and there is still so much for me.
Freshman,5,"Bryant University is a university built on a sense of community and helping each other. This translates to great job opportunities after graduation, which results in an over 99% job placement (or grad school placement) rate."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community feeling of being at Bryant. Being a small school, you get to know the same faces really well, not only colleagues but your professors as well. Almost all of the professors I have had were very personable and got to know me. 

I also loved the great variety of clubs and organizations that are offered here. Personally, I was able to branch myself out and discover what I like versus what I don't like."
Freshman,5,"Bryant University is an excellent school. Most of the teachers there are talented and are amiable individuals, so if someone needed help, they were generally there. The dorms could be better, because they are all crammed together, but the positive side is that the students who live there are very community oriented, and are very kind individuals."
Sophomore,5,"If you ache for a small community feeling, this school is for you. No matter where you go or time it is you will always see a friendly face you know."
College Sophomore,5,"You will meet people with very similar views to your own and very different. Despite this, most people are very accepting of who you are and what you believe."
College Sophomore,5,I am very connected with business development groups and am confident in my future.
College Freshman,5,I've heard that it is exceptional when it comes to this part of the school reputation
College Sophomore,5,Campus housing is great. There is a really great community atmosphere here.
College Sophomore,5,Bryant University draws in employers. They understand what our degrees means and they actively recruit every year. This makes it very easy to get great internships and job opportunities.
College Sophomore,5,"Health Services is open a majority of the time, free, and very helpful. There have been very few sexual assault cases and they have been handled appropriately."
College Sophomore,5,The lottery system for roommates is almost perfect. I had a great experience in freshman housing. The bathrooms were often very unclean but that was expected. The rooms were not that small and I did not have as many concerns about space as expected entering college.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a sister of Alpha Omicron Pi at Bryant University. It has been a great experience. Occasionally there are problems with the rest of Greek Life but administration is careful and efficient at fixing problems. Non-greeks are not allowed at our parties so the rest of the school does not rely on us for the party scene. There is a somewhat negative impression of Greek life on the rest of the Bryant community, I am not sure why because we do great things for the community."
College Sophomore,5,"Bryant is truly the best example of a small, close knit community working perfectly. It is refreshing to know almost everyone and to foster close relationships with professors and administrators. It takes less than 10 minutes to get from one end of campus to the other. We have so many dedicated students that work hard, and their partying habits do not discredit that. I have found a home at Bryant and I would recommend it highly to absolutely anyone who asks, or doesn't."
College Freshman,5,"I am very pleased with the school I chose, I would never think about transferring."
College Freshman,5,"Students who graduate with a degree from Bryant University are very valued in the business world, especially the international fields, as we have one of the best international business programs in the country."
College Freshman,5,Our Department of Public Safety is very involved and they are very serious about their jobs.
College Freshman,5,"This school is the best that I could have chosen. All the professors have worked in the fields that they teach about, so you know that you are learning real life information and skills."
College Junior,5,"Career fairs are held twice a year and open to all the students

Lots of companies go and it's a very beneficial event

in addition the amica center always puts on events for networking and presentations and workshops on how to get a job"
College Junior,5,Very different than what you see in the movies and shows because we are a smaller campus. It's a relatively small community - where everyone knows everyone
College Junior,5,"small campus

friendly students and staff 

everyone knows everyone

small classes 

food is average

lots of opportunities to get involved and network with alumni"
College Freshman,5,This is a stupid section. If you don't do drugs then you're safe. Other people doing drugs doesn't affect you.
College Freshman,5,Very safe campus. Have not heard of any sexual assault
College Freshman,5,"Getting a degree from Bryant is worth the money, and that's something that can't be said about many colleges in today's age. Put in effort and you will leave with a job."
College Sophomore,5,"Since its so small, it is really safe"
College Sophomore,5,International Business Program recognized nationally
College Junior,5,"I love being at Bryant University, my teammates have helped make this place a home since the first minute i was on campus.  I love that I know someone in every one of my classes, and how I can relate and build real relationships with my professors.  I wish that the school wasn't ridiculously strict on the weekends, and that the food was at a standard that I would feel comfortable eating every day."
Junior,4,Not very diverse but is def getting there slowly. The food is so much better than it was my freshman year!
Sophomore,4,"Bryant Univerity is an up-and-coming school. Well developed community with a very diverse faculty.  Students tend to get along, and classes are in small groups, so it is straightforward to interact with each other. You have to be very careful with what professor you decide to go along, because no matter how easy or hard the class material is; the professor is a vital element in your learning process and grade in Bryant. Residence life is average, they lack some remodeling in dorms and the common rooms. Nevertheless, the university facilities are fully remodeled and filled with technology advanced. I will recommend this school for someone that is looking for a school that everyone knows each other, like some type of high school edition but with the great college experience."
Sophomore,4,"I decided to take the Fall 2020 semester online full. As we were all obliged to do the last semester online, I was convinced that doing another one online wasn't going to affect my education because of the way the professors and the faculty adjusted to my necessities, and concern was very well done. The professors really tried to get the student's attention, and almost all were willing to give high-quality classes throughout the semester."
Senior,4,It is a great school with a lot of resources. There is a lot of pressure to excel and find jobs but that is a good thing. The advisors listen to you and work with you to make sure you get the right classes. Professors get to know you well.
Sophomore,4,"The online experience at Bryant was academically very similar to being in a classroom setting. The only real difference I noticed was that math was a bit harder to follow due to the nature of the setting. There was no semi-functional board to write on in Blackboard's online classroom. Besides math however, the experience was very much the same as the classroom, and it was an overall easy experiance."
Sophomore,4,"I love the culture, classes, and faculty. There is an immense amount of activities and ways to get involved. My only complaint is once people find their friends they don’t really stray from their groups which makes it difficult to make new friends in the later years."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Bryant. It is a small school and can have a high school feel to it at times. However it is large enough that you can always make new friends. The professors are amazing, but that can really depend on what program you are in. They have a ton of activities going on all the time and it is super easy to find something you want to get involved in. Big sports school and athletes are treated well at the school. The campus is beautiful especially in the nice weather and you can set up your hammock by the pond. Overall, had my ups and downs here but I am very happy with the people I met and what it taught me."
Freshman,4,"OK Bryant. The academics are remarkable, the return on investment starts with a minimum of 60,000 a year. The campus is clean and facilities makes it able to work well. The school holds a zero discrimination rule. If someone is being discriminatory there will be consequences. The University also holds Academic Services for improvement like that the students that are struggling can get tutoring that is part of Bryant. The teachers all are entertaining, engaging, and keeping the student in mind. Except for a few like all other Colleges. The school is predominantly White male but there are groups of people and help that is available to feel at home. Such resources include Counseling Services, Religious Presence for those who want to get involved, Intercultural center, Pride and Women's center. And did I mention that all of this and more are available for free simply by being a Bryant Student."
Junior,4,Bryant University is a good school with a strong campus life.  The Professors are all very knowledgeable.
Senior,4,Bryant pushes its students to excellence and helps their students become prepared for the professional world ahead of them.  I am going into the finance sector and Bryant offered CFP courses which means that I do not have to take these courses after graduation.  This saves me time and money.  Bryant offers many other opportunities like this to help make their students stand out.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a person who does not like to be away from home, after my first year (living on campus) I found that I've really evolved as a person. I love the community Bryant stands for. I'm glad to call it my home away from home! If there's anything I would change it would be a better interview/analysis of some of the professors. Some of the ones I had my first year sucked, and need more training to better teach/help the students with material."
Freshman,4,The school is beautiful and the teachings are excellent. The university have a policy that it makes you major in one of the schools and minor in the other school. The school food is not as good as one expects because the variation of it is bad. Student lives other than studying is fair but not too exciting because there is not many entertainment facilities.
Senior,4,"I transferred to Bryant as a junior. My experience was challenging in that  the work load was a huge increase form the community college. In addition, I am a part time commuter student so I found it challenging to feel like I was a part of the Bryant community. Overall, Bryant does have a great community. Most of the teachers are great and the campus is beautiful!"
Freshman,4,The best thing about Bryant is the people and the community. Everyone is so friendly and willing to help each other succeed. I was a little skeptical about this at first but it really is true. Professors are always willing to help you during office hours or with emails. I would say the dorms and food are average but there are plenty of other options on campus.
Sophomore,4,"What I like the most about Bryant is you meet a lot of different people from different cultures.  Also the class sizes are smaller so you get to learn at a smaller setting and teachers get to know you at a personal level.  What I don’t like is that the housing for sophomores and juniors are really dated and they don’t have A/C.  In the summer the housing gets really hot, especially if you live on the top floor of one of the dorm buildings.  Also I feel that the amount that that we have to pay for food is really not reflected in the quality of food that we get from the dinning hall."
Sophomore,4,"Bryant University is an exceptional school. I am very impressed with how up to date they are in regards to their technology and events in the business world. This is very beneficial to me because I can take what I am learning in the classroom past the graduation stage and into the real world. I am also amazed by how everyone at this university treats each other like family. This university is very close and interwoven together, which helps it stand out."
Junior,4,"It's a good experience overall and a family environment. Small school so you know everybody and you're friends with everyone. However, the school should invest more into making students happier with simple amenities."
Sophomore,4,"I like the class choice that are available at Bryant. The environment at Bryant is motivating and inspiring, most of the faculty appear to be invested in the success of the students.  The classrooms are very modern and most rooms have computers available for students.  Some of the classes focus on presentation skills to prepare college students for Business presentation.  The presentations are great experience and learning opportunities.  Bryant does need to be better when it comes to communicating activities for Student Life as well as to increase the availability of sport intramural teams."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman and have to say the overall experience is positive. Most teachers really care about their students and take time to know everyone's names. Small classes make that easier. Good school.
Senior,4,"I loved my time here at Bryant. The campus is beautiful, and there are so many different clubs and organizations to join. There isn't much of a party scene anymore, and if you want something fun to do off campus expect at least a 20 minute drive. The professors are okay depending on the subject. For example, history professors are awful, but psych professors are wonderful. We're top rated for marketing, accounting, and finance, but all business majors are pretty good. You get a very well rounded education if you go here, since if you major in business, you have to have an arts minor, and vice versa. All in all I would say Bryant is a wonderful school to go to."
Sophomore,4,"Bryant University was a school that I chose based on the outstanding academic program that they had for Actuarial Mathematics Majors and the fact that my father attended the university himself. Lead by President Machtley, Bryant should be considered one of the up and coming business schools in the country. The President has made great strides to the school including new dorms and academic facilities for everyone to use. The only thing that could use a bit of improvement is the food program. Options tend to be limited sometimes and the main dining hall, while improving, is still not the best. The campus itself is a beautiful place to be at as the campus is gorgeous. The area around Bryant is great as it is right next to Providence and only an hour from Boston.  The professors are mostly good as Bryant seems to pride themselves on having a great staff as there has not been one bad professor I would not recommend."
Freshman,4,"Bryant University is a great school for business. However, not only is it a good school for business, but for liberal arts as well. Bryant does a really good job making sure their students are all well rounded and prepared for life after college. The connections that Bryant has are also tremendous."
Freshman,4,It is a great college. It small but not very diverse. The education is great and I really like most of my teachers. There is not a lot of events that happens on campus tho.
College Freshman,4,"I love it here!  My only concerns are that the acceptance rate is quite high, but the caliber of student is relatively high.  The career programs are fantastic and the people are friendly."
College Sophomore,4,Most professors want you to succeed and will work with you. Your advisers do their best to get you where you need to be class-wise.
College Sophomore,4,Bars/Clubs are lenient with fakes. Uber/Lyft can be a hassle because campus is so far out of the city.
College Sophomore,4,"If you want it, you can get it. And if you don't directly know someone, any person on campus WILL know someone. So in that regards, I rate it 4 out of 5. It's great."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Bryant.  There were many times throughout my first year that I doubted that fact, but I always came back to being happy with my decision.  I love the academics, facilities, and some people.   I wish there was more diversity in interests and fewer rich white people, but it's new england - I should have expected that."
College Sophomore,4,"It's the average dorm experience, which I am happy with.  I feel bad for incoming freshman, though, because there is extreme overcrowding."
College Sophomore,4,"I really don't know because I don't care about sports, but we are devision 1 and have the best facilities in new england."
College Sophomore,4,"Great for business. I would have chosen somewhere slightly more liberal if given the chance, but I'm very confident I will find a good job."
College Freshman,4,It is a zero tolerance policy.
College Freshman,4,It is quite a welcoming and secure environment
College Freshman,4,This is almost like a dream campus. My only real problem with it is that it has very little room.
College Freshman,4,"Bryant University is a fantastic school to go to. Back in early July, I went to an orientation for the university. The community is a very inclusive and friendly environment. Because the school is relatively small, most of the current students knew each other extremely well. At other universities I've been to, it was not like that. So far, I do have a considerable amount of hope that when I enter into the campus in the fall, I will not regret going there."
College Sophomore,4,It is a D1 school so sports are huge. Our arenas are big which is great for games. We have both an athlete gym and a gym for average students
College Sophomore,4,"I really like the school. I am getting a great education, the only downfall is that it is hard to relate to some of the other students that go there because they can be rich and spoiled."
College Freshman,4,"Great education, a awesome atmosphere, and better yet everywehere you go on campus is close so it doesnt make for bad walks ad the campus is well kept and beautiful"
College Senior,4,"People stress about group assignments but if you have good enough communication skills, you'll be fine. As a marketing major, classes aren't at all difficult, just time consuming."
College Sophomore,4,I do not personally go to or participate in athletic events but Bryant puts a lot of effort and money into having top-notch athletic facilities.
College Junior,4,"I would choose Bryant again and again each time over. It is an incredibly beautiful campus with a very close-knit community including the staff and faculty. Professors are eager to help you succeed and enjoy teaching. I have learned so much from each class I have taken, dependent upon my own effort. The curriculum is incredible and the professors do a great job of teaching the information. It is challenging but very rewarding. There is always something to do on campus whether it is a night time activity, volleyball, clubs or organizations- you name it, we have it. Bryant is a very well-rounded engaging campus looking to better their students in every way possible."
College Junior,4,"The exceptional programs are International Business and Actuarial Mathematics. For any other major, you can go anywhere else and get an equivalent or even better education."
College Junior,4,Amica prides itself on setting up internships/jobs through its connections... if you want to stay in New England right after college
College Freshman,4,The dorm rooms are bigger than at most schools. Bryant's all suite lifestyle is very beneficial. It allows for a great social atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"Our varsity teams are some of the best in the region and country. All of our teams win over half of their games, meets, or matches."
College Junior,4,"I've enjoyed many of the classes I've taken at Bryant - there's a wide variety of classes. A lot of students complain more about the Professors especially history - many of us aren't history majors or minors and are only taking the class because we have to, not because we want to"
College Junior,4,"Having one entrance to the campus makes it very, very safe but at the same time some students find loopholes when sneaking on guests. The dorms are only accessible to students with IDs and after 11pm only accesible to the your own halls"
College Junior,4,School just added new facilities - great if you're on the team
College Freshman,4,"There's a couple good bars in the area, tons in Providence that are filled with college kids if you don't mind taking an uber in. There's usually plenty going on on campus though, especially if it's nice out."
College Freshman,4,"Campus can be really hit or miss depending on the weekend. Some nights there will be insane rages down at the townhouses with open doors flooding out into the streets, usually when it's warm out. When it's cold out during the winter there will usually be a couple parties with closed doors where you have to know someone, and if not then you'll probably just drink in quads and suites with friends. If you have a fake or are 21 then on nights where not much is happening on campus you can go the few nearby bars or uber into Providence where there's a ton. So overall if you're not 21/don't have a fake you might get bored some weekends but more often that not there's plenty going on."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors are good but some not so much, overall no complaints really"
College Freshman,4,"A lot of international students, most are wealthy"
College Freshman,4,"There's definitely some bad professors just like any college. Freshman year it can be tough to find good classes to take, definitely get some gen-eds out of the way. And despite what the teachers tell you, use rate-my-professor. The ones who say otherwise are just salty. It's a great resource and is usually accurate."
College Freshman,4,"It's your typical college housing. Freshman year can be a drag with cramped doubles and RA's, but living in suites and townhouses as an upperclassman is a blast."
College Freshman,4,"D1 for all sports, mens lacrosse and baseball are nationally ranked. Intramurals are super fun too."
College Freshman,4,"Definitely some things I would change but it's a great school to get a degree from, is fun enough for most, and most importantly, you will almost certainly leave with a job if you put in some effort."
College Sophomore,4,They have a lot of connections
College Freshman,4,we get our own laptops
College Freshman,4,i go to  a couple of games
College Freshman,4,I am having a great experience
Freshman,2,eh it’s ok. At first I loved it then the year went on and it wasn’t that great. Some people love it though.
Niche User,2,"Food is horrible and costs about 6 grand a semester.  Absolutely criminal.  People only go here because they didn't get into Bentley, or they didn't realized Bentley existed when they were applying to schools."
Freshman,2,"I went to Bryant University for my freshman year. I thought it would be a great change for me but I found the environment to be too much like high school due to the small amount of people. The classes were fine, I was a part of the honors program which is pretty good and they give out good scholarships. However, if you don't want to be stuck for all of February on campus it is hard to expand beyond the area since it isn't in Providence. I was an IB major at first and when I decided to change majors it became difficult to do what I wanted there due to their Business/Liberal Arts major minor requirement. I ultimately left for a number of these reasons and more but I don't regret going there, but I have found a better school to suit my needs and am happier now."
College Sophomore,2,"You're in the middle of nowhere surrounded by people from the middle of nowhere (broad generalization, but that's essentially 90% of the school)"
College Freshman,2,"I had an awful experience. I thought that the food was horrible to start. The dorms were trashed each weekend by the kids in the dorm. I felt as if the only thing you could do on weekends to have fun is go to the townhouses and get trashed. After the third or fourth week it became repetitive and I started going to different schools on the weekends. The faculty was all over the place. In total, I had ten teachers my freshman year. Out of those ten teachers, maybe 3 of them actually taught well. One of my professors let me design the test the way I wanted it, questions and format. There are several people I am friends with that are also transferring. If I had known a year ago what I do now, I would not have put the economic burden on myself to attend Bryant University. I would have rather gone to a community college."
College Senior,2,"Townhouses remind me of high school, dorm parties are usually broken up quickly. The party culture here makes it seem like everyone has a burgeoning alcohol addiction"
College Junior,2,"Oh wow, it is an evening on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. Should I go to Rentes? Or should i zombie walk through the townhouses. Yay."
College Junior,2,It's whatever. If I'm feeling in a party mood I visit friends who go to school in Boston or New York for the weekend.
College Sophomore,2,Gateway program was a bad move on bryant's part
College Sophomore,2,the gym for the non-athletes is horrible. It is sooooo small. Barely any equipment.
College Sophomore,2,If you want to go back to high school go to bryant
College Junior,2,"There's no pulse on campus.  Right after you leave the classroom, you're a 5 minute walk to your dorm or 10 minute walk to your townhouse and it still feels like you're perpetually in the classroom setting. The academics are fine, but if given the choice, I would not go back here. If you asked me 1000 times if I would go to Bryant, I would say no every single time."
College Freshman,2,Im transferring for many reasons.
College Freshman,2,The college excepted too many students this year. Many students are in forced triple. They are living in rooms that were only meant to occupy two people.
College Freshman,2,school is all talk / very little action when it comes to diversity
College Freshman,2,"cocaine, adderall, alcohol, and pot are prevalent"
College Freshman,2,"very cliquey friend groups made based off of living arrangements... once you make friends, you're stuck living with them

when something in bathroom, laundry rooms, or dorm rooms needs to be fixed - nobody cares

some of the RA's are horrible at their job

rules are poorly enforced. people get in trouble for small violations but get away with big violations

no common rooms... honors rooms can only be utilized by honors kids on the honors floor"
College Junior,2,"Freshman hall 16 is probably the best housing short of the townhouses.  The usual college style doubles are small and don't have anything to offer.  You have no kitchen availability until Senior year which is horrible, and the showers in the soph/junior halls are made for toddlers.  facilities usually does a good job with fixing things"
College Junior,2,"Our ranking for being one of the druggiest colleges in the country is justified.  Want access to something? You can get it.  I have never partaken in that kind of activity and if you do not want to be part of it then you're generally fine, but it is present all around campus on the weekends.  To ignore it would be to be naive."
College Sophomore,2,Very few people live off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Congrats! High school parties for 4 more years.
College Freshman,2,Too less options and too expensive
College Freshman,2,DPS does not really break up the parties or things they should. The noise level is very loud always and is never kept under control.
College Freshman,2,Not really available unless you go into providence which can be pricey.
College Freshman,2,"If this is your dream school, and you live close enough to commute, do it. The dorms are pretty bad, the internet is spotty so it is hard to get connection in your room. If you want sleep, you shouldn't bet on it because there is no rule enforcement what so ever here. Yes, we have an RA on each floor, but they mind their own business and don't say anything to the students here. There is constant parties on the floors in the halls and at the townhouses located right behind the freshmen halls. If you like to party this is perfect for you, if not you will hate this. There is no cleaning staff friday-sunday so you do not have clean bathrooms, and you are lucky if they come monday to clean them. The bathrooms get disgusting over the weekends because of the amount of partying that takes place. There is always beer cans, bottles and condoms all over in the hall, outside the halls, on the way to class everywhere. It is not an ideal place to live what so ever. As far as space goes, the rooms are the average college dorm. The lottery system the school uses is proven to match you pretty well. But I know a lot of people that don't get along with their roommates at all. Personally, the switching process is not as easy as they say either. You overall are paying a lot of money and won't enjoy the experience much."
College Senior,2,"If you are coming to a school looking for a great Greek scene, this is not the place for you.  Most people seem to fall into greeklife, and non-greeks find them very annoying most of the time."
College Junior,2,"I don't like the food, but we are switching vendors for next year."
College Freshman,2,The pathways are super dangerous and icy in the winter. Beautiful campus when it's warm out...
College Freshman,2,Ripta sucks badly need to find people with cars
College Freshman,2,Needs an additional dining hall and more variety for international students. Furthermore there is only one solitary option for late night dining on campus. 
College Freshman,2,Not enough parking spots for the growing student body and almost everyone has a car
College Freshman,2,"Nothing really makes it too special for me, too much like high school if you ask me. "
College Sophomore,2,"Almost every student here is upper middle class, New England suburban, conservative, Republican, and preppy. This is how it is at any prestigious school, however, I do with there was more diversity. "
College Sophomore,2,"Bryant is in a suburban town with no available apartments near by. The city of Providence is the closest area with available housing, which is expensive because its in a city and a hassle to get through every day. "
College Freshman,2,"Personally, most of my teachers have been lazy. Haven't gotten much back or even learned a ton yet. Its all business here and everything else seems to be forgotten. "
College Freshman,2,"Professors are mostly lazy, workload is not that bad, its all business. "
College Freshman,2,You need a car to go anywhere and even still there are not many options.               
College Freshman,2,Everyone basically goes to the townhouses out behind the campus and parties there. It gets boring real fast.
College Freshman,2,"I think the culture of the students here is very poor in general. Seems just like high school except with more partying, always at the townhouses. Boring, small, all business. Some people might like that, not me. "
College Sophomore,2,You see the same people at every party
College Freshman,2,The only people that move off campus are seniors on sports teams. There really isn't a need to though because the townhouses are beautiful.
College Freshman,2,"Except for the freshman dorms, the townhouses, and hall 17, all the dorms are exactly the same"
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife isn't that great. Theres nothing around for miles so you have to drive everywhere. On campus parties are the same thing every weekend, and its either a hit or a miss and gets old really fast. Agreed that if you've been partying throughout high school this school's nightlife isn't that great"
College Freshman,2,"Greek life in Bryant is very small, not too many frats or sororities."
College Senior,2,"Smithfield is a small, rural, residential town. Bryant is located off a main route with only one bar, Parentes, in walking distance right off campus.
Although there is a small plaza down the route with a few restaurants, it is not within walking distance. Most students shop at the Lincoln Mall, which is about 10 minutes away by car, or at Providence Place which is about 25 minutes away by car. There is no atmosphere or night life in Smithfield, and so students go to Providence or Boston. Fortunately, for those without a car Bryant provides the BTA, a low cost van service that runs daily routes between the Lincoln Mall and Providence. Bryant also has a RIPTA public bus stop with regular service to Providence. Although there is little interaction with the local residents, attitude is presumed to be bad as residents severely limit where the school can hold concerts and other events due to noise complaints. However, these seemingly negative factors also make Bryant very attractive to students who want a rural campus that is extremely safe."
College Sophomore,2,"The Department of Public Safety is very responsive to drug situations and will be prompt in  executing discipline and safety. However, there is a lot of alcohol consumption, especially among the fraternities."
College Junior,2,you get bored quick with the food and it is never quality options
College Senior,2,There are a limited number of close spots to residence halls because of village style housing. Many students park illegally because they do not want to walk far. While it is a smaller campus and it takes only 5 minutes to walk to the furthest parking lot students still get annoyed by the parking situation.
College Junior,2,"Athletics are not very big here, even with the recent movement into D1 athletics. People still attend the games every once in a while but the school is always trying to obtain a bigger turnout."
College Sophomore,2,Not that serious. Few parties. No housing for Greek life to throw big parties.
College Sophomore,2,"A huge majority of students are white, upper middle class and from New England/New York/ New Jersey. Bryant makes a point of recruiting students from outside the US to encourage diversity so there are quite a few international students"
College Junior,2,"The campus experience is heavily influenced by the weather. When it is warm out, students heavily embrace it by creating large gatherings on the main areas of the campus. During the early fall and late spring, the townhouses are lively and fun, however during the winter, Bryant University sucks. There is no fun, everyone is miserable and there is a lot of rain here, regardless of season."
College Senior,2,guys are immature and stuck up; very rude and do not have manners for the most part. some of very driven and focused. all seem to just want to make as much as possible. feels like high school. girls are very catty and immature. they all dress and act the same. many of them do not seem driven.
College Senior,2,"I don't know a lot about the greek like at Bryant. I know they exist and are an option, but I do not find that most of the students here are involved in greek life."
College Junior,2,"Not as Diverse as Thought – This school promotes that they are very diverse, yet there really isn't that much diversity among the population. There are many different kids from different areas of the world, yet most of the people admitted all fall into the same categories int terms of ethnic and racial backgrounds, with a few people sprinkled in from other areas. The economic background is similar throughout, most people have money at this school."
College Freshman,2,"Not Many Options – most people just stay on campus because it;s way easier. Off campus options are very limited, and quite expensive."
College Freshman,2,Would Go Elsewhere – food sucks.  too much alcohol abuse. weekends are the same boring thing.
College Sophomore,2,"Never Let of Free – Bryant University is required to report all cases regarding any drugs to the Smithfield Police. This makes it very difficult for students to use the ""get out of jail free card."" As for alcohol, Bryant is slightly more lenient. If caught and cooperative with DPS, you are usually let off with a warning. Key is: to respect DPS."
College Senior,2,Not as Big as Other Small Schools – The lack of participation and interest by Bryant students is a big deal. No one pays attentions to varsity games unless they offer lottery to get free prizes for attending the game. Ipad's may be included!
College Senior,2,"Although it isn't a dry campus, DPS can bother you whenever they feel like it."
Alum,1,"I'm writing this review in hopes that I can prevent a single person, with similar circumstances to my own, from attending Bryant University. 

I transferred to Bryant from a 2 year college where I was top of my class. As a marketing major I was excited to learn new concepts but quickly realized that the marketing content was outdated and purely repetition of concepts I learned previously. I graduated in 2012 and only had a single class(during a single lesson) that talked about social media marketing. Not a single mention of SEO, PPC, A/B Testing, Email, Mobile, etc—it's like the professors believed that Madmen was relevant to modern day marketing and digital wasn't a thing.

Currently a marketing director I can attribute none of my success to Bryant. Everything I have learned has been self taught or gained through experience. If you don’t come from a wealthy background and have to pay for your education, please, reconsider—worst investment of my life, don't let it be yours."
College Freshman,1,Professors could not care less about their students for the most part.
College Freshman,1,"Stinks. Nobody outside of New England recognizes Bryant University. You call it ""BU"" and people think its Boston University."
College Freshman,1,The school officers do not have guns.
College Freshman,1,There was poop on the toilet seat several times throughout the year. The showers had gnats in them.
College Sophomore,1,"After 3 years at Bryant University, not a day goes by where I don't think about how I got into other schools. I would do anything to take back my decision to go here."
College Junior,1,I hear about some frats but they are not that big of a deal on campus.
College Junior,1,Are there even apartments near Bryant?
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do. You have to be happy going to a small school that only interacts with the student body
College Freshman,1,The school is all business all the time. The teachers are lazy. The school seems more like high school to me. Boring.  
College Freshman,1,Gateway program is pointless and requires way too much stuff that is not needed. 
College Freshman,1,Everyone is a business type major. Boring.
College Freshman,1,I would not repeat the program I am because of personal preference. There are not a lot of options. 
College Freshman,1,There is really nothing to do. Most people just go in the back of campus and that gets old after a few times. 
College Freshman,1,Greek life seems to be looked down by most
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is almost nonexistent and if you do participate, you are not accepted with the rest of the school. "
College Sophomore,1,There are very few options for close off-campus housing. On campus housing is very expensive.
College Freshman,1,"Guys and girls here for the most part have the same types of personalities. If you're on a sports team you don't really experience this so much because your teammates are from all over. If you're not on a sports team, good luck. most people stick within their own groups. Bryant university aka next four years of high school"
College Freshman,1,"I advise that incoming freshmen choose to live in suites. Those who choose otherwise usually regret it. I do not believe that living in a suite limits the amount of friends you will make, which will likely be very few considering the overwhelming ""cliquishness"". Overall the dorms are spacious but not exactly great quality compared to other schools. The security in the freshmen halls is ridiculous and you will likely be displeased if you enjoy partying."
College Sophomore,1,The only off campus places that are available are in Providence which is not that close to campus and it would be a hassle to commute every day.
College Junior,1,"Greek Life at this school is extremely cliquey. I'm not in Greek Life and never will be, but it's clear who is in what sorority or fraternity. Greek Life has an entire Hall specifically just for them. A hall in which they are usually partaking in activities that students in normal housing would never be allowed to do (painting the walls, etc.) There is hazing that goes on and because this school is small being in greek life automatically sets you up to be in a certain ""group"" of students. The greek life activities do not engage any other students at Bryant except for other Greek life students. You can probably ask anyone on campus and I highly doubt they would say anything positive about the Greek life here at Bryant."
College Sophomore,1,Teams are terrible and the fields & stadiums are poor. My high school had more pride and better fields.
College Junior,1,Small school so not big on athletic facilities. The restaurants are VERY limited.
College Senior,1,There is very little and they don't promote or gives options to students.
College Senior,1,"It is far and not many people go, but it can be nice to get away from campus rules, especially if you smoke a lot"
College Sophomore,1,"Very few options and extremely unpopular. Tough competition for appartments in Providince with PC, Brown, RISD and RIC students."
College Senior,1,only a few people live off campus and it is not very close.
College Freshman,1,"The closest area you are going to find apartments is in Providence which is at least 30 minutes away. Its not worth it to live off-campus when campus life is actually pretty good. In Smithfield, it is mostly full of residential families and a couple hotels."
College Freshman,1,"If you enjoy partying, don't go to this school. It is the same things going on every weekend. Every party is on campus. The only thing good is a bar called Effins on Thursday nights, but even then not many people go except upperclassmen. It's a hassle finding people to go anywhere because everyone is a little girl. The girls love the black football players. the dudes outnumber the girls 60 - 40 so everywhere is a dudefest. The food is horrible, the gym is always packed and you can never get on a machine. The school automatically arrests you on the spot for a leaf of marijuana, the RAs love writing kids up for drinking...except a few. The on-campus cops are extremely strict about guests and fighting and whatnot, its really hard to get away with anything because they are everywhere and always trying to break up the fun. Everyone is very clicky and everyone finds out your business.... it should be called Bryant high school. The Frats are losers without any friends and their parties suck. That's the social scene. Otherwise its a very intense school that is great for business. 98 percent of people who graduate have job right out of school making 50k. so if you love having a miserable life for hopefully a better future after college, this is your school. I'm transferring after this semester."
College Sophomore,1,Bryant has more athletes than Greek members. Greek life is not very popular.
College Junior,1,Lots of White Students – There is some diversity but needs to be waayyyy more.. especially Hispanic population.
College Junior,1,The cafeteria food offers no variety. Also there are no healthier options.
College Junior,1,"I know of one place in Smithfield, otherwise you are going to Providence."
College Freshman,1,"Why Are We D1? Bryant U. recently went D-I. Everyone seems to be involved in a sports team, but no one goes to watch."
College Freshman,1,Everyone is from Connecticut or Massachusetts at Bryant.
College Sophomore,1,"Bryant tries to come off as diverse by posting many pictures of international and minority student on its Web site, but they clearly are trying to seem more diverse than we actually are. Bryant is almost all white, upper-middle class kids from New England. The Center for International Students is very good in bringing these students together, but there are simply not many of them. Also, my gay friends say they do not feel comfortable on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,It's impossible to find a spot.
College Junior,1,"I recommend joining Greek life. The sports teams are all lame and just suck money out of the smart non-athletic kids. If you are thinking of Bryant as a school, here are a few things to consider: Public Safety is cracking down and you will get in trouble; it is way too small and everyone knows you; on-campus groups are good in comparison to other schools; and it costs way too much money. I say don't go here."
College Senior,1,I Only Know of One – Off-campus housing seems nice but is so far away. No one lives off campus anyways.
College Sophomore,1,"Food Is Really Bad – There are no vegetarian options that are edible, the menu is never kept up to date, and it costs way too much. It does not provide the services promised. It should be optional to have a meal plan or have more dining dollars instead of meals. There should be more flexibility and options."

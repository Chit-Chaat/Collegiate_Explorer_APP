Freshman,5,"All the people I have talked to said their professors made the transition to online learning very easy, which is a relief after hearing horror stories from other colleges."
Freshman,5,"The student to teacher ration was very enticing for me. From what I understand, your professors actually know your name and interact with you. The campus and the living situations are amazing. Also, the softball team is 100% the best part."
Freshman,5,Rider University has been the best fit for me so far and they continue to prove themselves through this pandemic. All of the professors were supportive and understanding of our times at home and moving to online learning. The school continued to update us through email and keep the students in the know of how the rest of the semester would pan out.
Freshman,5,I like Rider it's a great school. I am applying to this scholarship opportunity to able to continue to afford to be able to go there.  I really need a little boost.
Freshman,5,I would highly Recommend High School Seniors to apply and get into great opportunities provided by them!
Junior,5,The faculty and staff at Rider University are always extremely helpful and dedicated to students success academically and professionally.
Niche User,5,I like rider university because of its diversity and willingness to accept everyone. The staff is amazing and the CA's of the dorms are wonderful too! Anytime I need help with anything I know exactly where to go and if I don't there is always someone to help me.
Freshman,5,"I just started my education at Rider University in the fall of 2019. I decided to live on campus my fall semester and get a feel for everything. I love Rider. I love living there, the friends I have made, the activities, the campus life, the professors, the classes, and the fact that Rider is family. I cannot wait to continue my education at Rider and to graduate with a Bachelors in Elementary Education in Multidisciplinary studies with a minor in Special Education and Theatre"
Sophomore,5,"There are so many opportunities to get involved. I am part of several clubs and organizations, and I believe that this school wants you to succeed. The professors are accommodating, resourceful, and helpful. There are ways to get help if you are struggling academically and mentally. This school prepares you for a future career in your field."
Niche User,5,"I really enjoy the feel of the campus.  The cafeterias are clean and offer many different options, the dorms are comfy and cute, and the students seem so friendly."
Junior,5,I’m currently a Junior at Rider and I wouldn’t change my mind about going here. The atmosphere is great the people are great and there is just so much to love about the campus. It makes you feel like you never left home.
Junior,5,"I love Rider University because I really delved into campus life. I work on campus, have joined several clubs major related and not and live on campus with all of my friends. I also had the great opportunity to study abroad and now I want to teach abroad!"
Sophomore,5,"Rider University has already opened up opportunities to better me professionally and as a young woman. Since being at Rider University, I have been challenged to go beyond what is expected, allowing me to achieve things I haven't dreamed of achieving. With my major, Rider University allowed me to learn more about the world of politics and law, seeing how intriguing and fascinating it is. The staff at Rider University are helpful and kind people who will help you succeed. At Rider University, you are not just a number. The Campus itself is not too big but it allows students to be a little more connected and more familiar with the people who are there.
For a school prioritize the students' success, Rider University holds a very pristine mix of professors who work well with students.
A school I have fallen in love with for a multitude of reasons, Rider University was without question the right school for me."
Freshman,5,The classes are small and you will get to know you professors. You will make a lot of friends and join a lot of clubs. You can get a lot of help from staff members and  tutors Everyone is friendly. I wouldn’t change anything on campus.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Rider University has been indescribable. Rider University is home because it makes you so happy and comfortable to be here. The students here are so fun, outgoing, and super nice. The broncs is the school mascot but they're family. The school spirit here is ridiculous because everyone is proud to wear the Rider University apparel which just makes you want to be a part of all the clubs and school activities."
Freshman,5,"I am an upcoming freshman. I visited many colleges and this one stuck out the most due to its small campus and smaller class room settings, I find that this will help me with my education as a business major and my athletic career. I would like to open my own business and continue my efforts with the homeless and children with cancer in honor of my friend who passed away when he was 15. I current do an annual fundraiser to help find a cure for cancer. My friend Sean Patrick did everything to enjoy his life and help others as well while being sick. I hope to continue his tradition thoughout my life"
Sophomore,5,"Initially, Rider University seemed to me like your run-of-the-mill private university; however, that quickly changed. Not only is the curriculum engaging and worthwhile, but the student body itself is unbelievably welcoming. I have found a home at Rider University, and while the school has its quirks, I would not rather be anywhere else."
Junior,5,Rider University is an solid school and has provided me with many opportunities that I would not have gotten anywhere else. The location is great for what I was looking for from a college and the professors are top notch across the board. It offers the specific sports media communications major that I could not find almost anywhere else. I can't say enough about how positive my experience has been at Rider University.
Sophomore,5,"I’m going into my 2nd year but my first year was very eventful. There isn’t much to do on campus but when there is, it is so much fun and you would never want to leave. I just wish that the SGA and administration had more events throughout both semester because on the weekends the campus is pretty dead and all everyone does is stay in their dorms all day."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely am loving my time here at Rider. The training I am recieving is superb, the friends I have made are lifelong, and being extremely close to the big apple is pretty sweet as well! The only thing I believe could be improved immensely is the housing and dining arrangements. If they were able to fix these things just a little bit, it would make Rider rise above the rest! It is a great school, it just needs to be at it's full potential."
Freshman,5,"I love Rider University because it's a small school that has an amazing business program. Even though it's small, it's diverse and I'm able to interact with people of all different backgrounds, including international students. There are a lot of opportunities to study abroad and there are so many clubs to join. The small classes allow for connections to form and for professors to interact directly with every student. Also, there are so many awesome resources for students including academic support, career counseling, and so much more."
Freshman,5,"Rider University is extremely well diverse which shows how welcoming the campus is. Rider University and its staff make it their job to make the students their priority. Rider University demonstrates every day that our physical, mental, social, emotional, and educational well beings are a part of their main concerns. The Bronc Family is what the university calls its students and that is what each graduating class feels like."
Freshman,5,"This is a great school for those looking into the business or education field. It’s a small, but humble college that really let’s it’s personality really grow on you. If you like near the Central New Jersey area and are looking for a business/ education degree, then this is the school for you."
Freshman,5,"Rider University is diverse, challenging, motivating, clean, and safe! The professors are informed, well connected, and invest in each of their students individually."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Rider is very exciting. Here at Rider you can easily be active on campus with all then opportunities the school provides to students. For myself,  I love being active in clubs, sports, and on activities and events and the school does a good job making sure that your campus experience is fun. The food is delicious, the classes are easy, (some can be difficult) but the overall academic experience is great here. With many schools being bigger than Rider, and Rider being called a relatively “small university”, it creates more of a campus bond with the students because the school being small makes students interact with each other more which can increase your morale on your campus experience. I love it here at Rider, and I highly recommend attending here."
Senior,5,Rider is a great college and the counselors are super helpful in helping you plan your future. The professors are willing to help you whenever and the education department provides a wonderful area for students in this major.
Junior,5,This school is truly amazing. When it came time to applying for College I had many choices and I can truly say that this was the best decision of my life.
Freshman,5,"I love how Rider is a very close community school. You make great connections with your teachers and other peers throughout the years. Its like a second home. There is always something to do on the weekends and during the week. Very close to Princeton and Trenton, so you can go out for the night. Also, its an hour train ride to Philly, so you can go and have a day in Philly enjoying some cheese steaks. Rider could improve the variety in good options and its professors. Some professors seem too old to be teaching."
Graduate Student,5,"I received my Undergrad from Rider, I am going back fall of 2018 for my MBA.  The Advisors are very supportive and I believe give great advice and positive direction for a clear path to career goals.  I think the cost is in line with pretty much any University in NJ.  In anycase the cost is worth the price of admission for a great education!"
Sophomore,5,Rider is one of those schools that you either love or you hate. Theres never a moment when you feel unsafe or unsure about campus. Theres always familiar faces no matter where you go. You'll know if its the school for you the second you arrive and are greeted on campus. Classes are very manageable as Rider offers many resources to support and overcome any academic difficulties during your time there as a student. Financial aid are always willing to sit down and help those students in need. I can't imagine my college experience anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"Rider University is very a diverse school. The professors are truly amazing, and if help is needed in classes, Rider always seeks out to give evryone helps, lets everyone knows there are so options, such as the writing studio, or tutor trac for so mnay classes."
Senior,5,"My overall experience at Rider University has been enriching in a multitude of aspects of my life.  With Rider being such a small school; no more than 5,000 students at that, I was able to test my academic, emotional and physical character in a reasonable playing field.   Academically, the professors have pushed and motivated me in a competitive yet fair way, giving me ample opportunity to take in all that the school has to offer.  I ran track and field here and was able to balance my school work as well as the calm but energetic vibe amongst the student body.  Last but not least, Rider offers a variety of social groups that help you find and narrow your focus and extracurriculars."
Niche User,5,"I love rider university! I have been in the community of Lawrenceville for over 10 years, and I am proud to say I have decided to be a part of riders business management program. I never thought I would stay close to home, but I am thrilled to have this experience."
Freshman,5,It is a great school and the people are all so nice! I love the campus and all my new friends since starting!
Freshman,5,"I love Rider University's tight-knit community, it feels like my second home! The teachers know your name, and the small class sizes make sure that all students understand the subject material. My largest class has 24 students."
Sophomore,5,Rider university gives me a lot of opportunities to find myself and help me get a better understanding of what career path I want to follow while also giving me the resources to achieve my goals.
Junior,5,Love the school so far. Never been anywhere where the staff is so nice and helpful. Really hands on and want you to succeed. Beautiful campus.
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman going n so far it's been a very great experience going to school and checking it out can't wait for fall
Sophomore,5,My first year at Rider was unbelievable!  As a Student Athlete my first year flew by because I was so busy with studies and sports.  The small school atmosphere is exactly what I hoped it would be.  Professors take the time to work with you on an individual basis.  The only thing I wish would change is that the dining areas would stay open later.  I would be training and many times miss my opportunity to eat!
Alum,5,"As a 2015 graduate, I can tell you that my coursework and professors prepared me for my career in education. Two of my professors throughout college have served as mentors. When I needed some career advice, they were willing to advise even though I had graduated two years prior. Professors at Rider truly care about your success and you can develop genuine, professional connections with them."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved every minute here at Rider. This school allows you to own your entire college experience. You get out of it what you put in to it. The small college feel allows you to get comfortable with the people at the school, yet it is large enough that you are always meeting new people and having new adventures. It truly is an amazing place to be and I loved every moment I have spent at this school"
Niche User,5,Absolutely loved erverything about this college when I went for a tour the atmosphere is great. The people are very welcoming. I didn't want to leave when I got there!
Junior,5,I love home rider university is a family community and very nice professors working there. I would change the dorms because some of them are out dated.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are experts on what they are providing to the students
College Sophomore,5,The health and safety is very up to date
College Junior,5,I feel very confident that I will be receiving a job out of school.
College Student,5,The school is ranked as one the best so I think the academics at Rider are really good.
College Student,5,"It's diverse enough to me, there is a good representation of every culture."
College Student,5,The is a very dry campus not a lot of drinking and I've never seen drug use.
College Student,5,"Having a degree from rider gets in a lot of doors, just me saying I attend the school give me from respect from successful individuals."
College Student,5,"I don't have much experience as I am incoming freshman, but what run-ins I did have with they were very helpful."
College Student,5,The campus very safe and an extremely positive environment.
College Student,5,All the buildings in my opinion are in great condition.
College Student,5,Athletics are division one and extremely competitive!
College Student,5,"So far I really like the campus, everyone is very welcoming. The school to me is unique because I never an environment where the staff cares so much and its just not about a number. I really love the way the campus is set up as well."
College Junior,5,They really go out of their way to aid the disabled students and the staff are really helpful.  I love this college to the fullest.
College Sophomore,5,"Generally, I feel safe walking around campus. Campus Safety is always patrolling, especially during the night."
College Freshman,5,The party scene is good
College Freshman,5,"Our school is very accepting and very diverse. There tends to be no challenges in regards to race, sexual orientation, potitical, economic, or religious backgrounds."
College Freshman,5,Health and safety is highly enforced and revered here at Rider.
Freshman,4,I have been at Rider University for a few months now learning remotely. I enjoy most of my classes and my professors are kind. The campus is gorgeous ad the other students are pretty cool.
Freshman,4,"I have been learning remotely for a few months now and it's been going well. The professors are nice and tech-savvy. Fortunately, the professors are extremely understanding of the circumstances and balance the workload."
Freshman,4,My classes this semester were either through zoom or completely online and all professors still made themselves available at all times. The school and professors realized this was a huge change for all students and they helped up adjust well. They were all super supportive and understanding with course work and deadlines.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Rider University is more diverse than I originally thought and i'm extremely grateful for that. For the most part Rider tends to listen to the wants and needs of students, although I cant speak on behalf of students living on campus in terms of dorm life and dining services. I think the school is great academically, as they provide tons of services to help students succeed both now and in the future. They hold annual Job Fairs for both current students and alumni, while also providing resume building programs."
Freshman,4,"Rider University thus far has been an exceptional experience for me. Lots of friendly students and staff, and plenty of courses in the course catalog to pick from to allow for a diverse set of graduating students from here."
Junior,4,"I like how small the campus is, the connection you can make with professors, the campus is also gorgeous, and the academics are really good especially my experience with the psychology department.
It needs improvement in its food and dorms. Rider does not prioritize their money very well."
Freshman,4,"Rider University has so many opportunities offered for all students. Students are offered the chances to commit to doing many community service projects all around campus. Rider has many D-1 sports teams and selections offered for Rider colleagues. The professors here are so sweet and nice and are willing to help you through every step of the way. Rider has a broad selection of food places around campus. I enjoy attending Rider, because it makes a positive impact in my life. Rider is such a fun filled experience to have in life."
Sophomore,4,I like the environment and the campus. It is very open and there is always something going on. The people are diverse. The food is good. The dorms could be better.
Sophomore,4,Rider was a very comforting school to me. Especially as a freshman that made a huge life change. It was a good school that was not too far from home but just far enough that I could go home almost every week if I needed to go home that week. The faculty are very nice and friendly. By the first day of school I had a nice group of friends who were very supportive. One thing I would change about Rider is the dorms are very old and need to be remodeled. The second semester my dorm had a mouse infestation so that was not fun. I would also say that they need to upgrade the food quality at the cafeteria. Other than that attending Rider has been a very positive experience for me.
Junior,4,Very expensive school but great professors and opportunities. Food could be improved as well as dorms.
Senior,4,I picked this school for multiple reasons. I loved that it is a smaller campus. I like the size of the campus because that means smaller classes as well as less traffic on campus overall. I also like the numerous opportunities they provide to get involved on campus. For example freshman year I was apart of two organizations before my first semester even started. I am currently in a sorority as well and it has helped my social life tremendously.
Junior,4,I would like Rider to be more inclusive for those of Christian faith. Right now the school seems to be anti-Christian.
Junior,4,"I'm still a student, so my experience isn't over yet, but so far, Rider has given me necessary tools to grow as a student of Psychology, which includes the confidence I have for my time after I graduate. On the flip side, the dining hall food can be improved, as well as the entertainment at the school over the weekends, being that everyone goes home most weekends. Otherwise - I love it here. Tuition is also too much for the quality of certain things we are given, but luckily Rider gives out financial aid when it is needed."
Junior,4,"I love the fact that due to the relatively small student/faculty ratio that I get to form a relationship with my professors and learn from them to further enrich my studies. I also enjoy all of the resources, both education and career-wise, that has helped me improve my individual character into becoming a professional for my eventual career."
Freshman,4,The campus life looks good and it takes good pride in helping new students who decide to apply to their school.
Sophomore,4,"What you make of your experience is what you you are going to get in return at Rider University. By creating friends and being involved on campus is fundamental in your journey throughout these four years. The connections you make with faculty, students and teachers really do have an impact on yourself and will always cherish. It is what you make you of your experience and although some things could be changed at Rider, it is up to you to make the best of it during your time there."
Niche User,4,I fell in love with the Rider campus its location and the school size is perfect. Rider is surrounded by many different shopping centers which benifits the students that way having a income wont be a problem. The size of the school is perfect its small that way everyone knows each other. Also Rider makes sure to prepare students academically for there life after college by giving them many internships opportunities.
Freshman,4,"Three things that made me choose Rider were it’s location, size, and engaged learning. Rider is only 5 min. away from my house and it’s in a good location surrounded by variety of amenities (mall, various shops, restaurants, entertainment etc.) it’s also surrounded by various big companies such as Deloitte, Black Rock and Brystol Myers Squibb, which makes it convenient for students looking for a job or internships. Second, rider is a small school which is why I chose it because it allows students to get to know everyone easily (faculty and other students) and Interact with them. Lastly, engaged learning. Rider’s not only focused on the academics but also ensures students get the experience they need that will help them with job interviews etc. Engaged learning allows students to be involved  on campus by giving them a list and options of organizations and clubs they can join and other activities available like study abroad or co ops and internships."
Sophomore,4,"Rider University is a smaller campus, with many ways to become involved in campus life. Class sizes are also small so you are able to get to know your professor, and are actually able to get that classroom experience."
Sophomore,4,"Rider University is an above average institution. They specialize in numerous majors and have one of the highest quality educational programs in New Jersey. Outside of the classroom, Rider University could seek further improvement. The dormitories are poor and campus safety could be made better. I would not hesitate to recommend Rider University to high school student, but only if they would benefit from studying a specific major."
Alum,4,"I loved when I was at Rider University for my undergrad. I plan on going back soon for my teaching certificate and my Masters in teaching.  The campus is beautiful and so easy to learn how to get around. Luckily, all the classroom buildings are right near each other, making it easy to get from building to another. Most of the teachers are great, I had an easier time at Brookdale Community College finding great teachers than I did at Rider. There are some great teachers with good reviews and there are bad teachers with bad reviews that I recommend staying away from. ratemyprofessor.com was how I chose what classes I was going to take. I highly recommend using this website. The school is financially doing poorly, but there is still a very high number of students that enroll every year. Being it is a private school, the tuition is extremely high. I recommend going to a community college first and transferring in to get more scholarship money. Making it a cheaper way to get a degree."
Junior,4,"Overall, this is a pretty good school. Most of the staff is friendly and easy to approach. As a transfer student, I do not experience with most classes not related to my major, but the classes are overall fun and engaging. The few events I've been to outside of class were very enjoyable and I very much liked the guest speakers and other activities. As a commuter, I did not have much issue with the food either, which was usually of a fairly wide variety. The only issues I have are that some of the teachers, namely those for gen ed or language classes do not seem that qualified for teaching."
Sophomore,4,Tough academically if you are working a full time job while taking 16 credits. Be prepared for lots of teachers who do not care about what grade you get despite the effort and attitude you have towards their course. New food service coming this year (2018) so we will see about that.
Sophomore,4,I love how they really emphasize engaged learning.  It helps everyone prepare for a job in the real world.  The one thing I would like to change is the amount of people that stay on the weekend.  A lot of people go home on the weekends.
Sophomore,4,"Rider gives me a lot of room to grow. Though it has its faults, like any school, the positives outweigh the negatives. The environment is friendly and I feel like people really want each other to grow and succeed."
Sophomore,4,"My school is great. The campus is large enough to meet so many people and the diversity is outstanding. I feel like I meet someone new everyday. Additionally, I always feel safe on campus. There are blue boxes all over campus that you can call public safety if you need them. There is always public safety cars driving around campus as well, so I always feel safe. Also, the classes are mostly small so it is easy to make connections with professors. They always open doors for opportunities and make sure you understand that you can come to them whenever you need help or advice. They know what they are talking about and are very educated. The buildings are mostly clean and campus is always clean. Everyone you meet makes you feel welcome and a part of the family."
Junior,4,"Professors are helpful and respectful, they really want you to pass. The campus its self is very nice and I enjoy the fact that it is a small school."
Junior,4,I think Rider University is a great school when it comes to teacher education. They give you a chance to go out and experience what teachers do in a classroom. I believe that Rider is just too expensive sometimes. They should work on lowering the price to attend here and I think that would allow more students to be interested in going to Rider.
Graduate Student,4,I love the School Psychology graduate program. The attention you receive is unlike any other and I feel prepared for the schools.
Freshman,4,"It is a quite campus that allows you to focus on your studies. The Professors here are very kind and will help you with almost anything you need. Rider gives off a community feeling and students tend to get along very well on this diverse campus. However, there isn't much of a party life on campus nor many activities for everyone to join in on, on the weekends."
Freshman,4,"Rider tries really hard to keep students active and involved. Every weekend they have some kind of event, whether it be a school tradition like the R Factor or special student sponsored events like the time I got to make a mindfulness jar with my friends. There is always something to do and there is very little reason to stay cooped up in your dorm room on the weekend. The food at both the dining hall and the mini restaurant they have on campus, Crans, is delicious. The food has plenty of flavor and there are even vegan and gluten free options. Rider offers free tutoring and writing lab services for those who need extra help. The only issue would be the dorms are a little out dated. For most of them there is no central air conditioning and the bathrooms are kind of grungy. They are in process of renovating all the dorms so this problem won't be relevant tin a few years but for now the dorms are just kinda ""eh""."
Freshman,4,I love the welcoming atmosphere of the campus we well as the faculty and staff. The diversity of majors also adds a cool relationship between students.
Sophomore,4,"Besides shaping my academic knowledge, I have found Rider very useful in helping me develop my time management, organization, communication, and networking skills."
Freshman,4,"The overall academic feel of the university makes every student feel as if their academic career will be a success. The professors are very flexible and develop a personal connection with each and every student. However, the social and residence life is lacking, a large portion of the student's commute and the dorm halls need renovating."
Junior,4,"Rider University has been great. In my short three years here I have gained so much. I gained best friends, close peers, professionalism, and confidence. I am currently pursuing an education degree, and I love everything about this major. In my education classes I have gained great opportunities, such as teaches lessons and gaining confidence in the classroom. I love being a Rider student. Go Broncs!"
Freshman,4,I like that I have the opportunity to have close connections with my professors. This allows me to academically succeed. I would change the activities that are provided on the weekends. Rider should focus on making campus more active and sociable.
Junior,4,"Rider University is a great school and environment to be in. The students and professors are great. The classroom sizes are small which makes learning easier and more personable. However, it is very expensive. Most students are on scholarships, which is helpful, but the prices are still high and it is very likely you will be in a lot of debt once you graduate."
Senior,4,Professors are great. They do everything they can to help you succeed. The campus is like a large family. The events are campus try to get everyone involved.
Junior,4,I am a incoming junior at Rider University. My first two years were pretty good. Rider is very community oriented. It is more for those who prefer a tight-knit community. The professors are very helpful and the class sizes are usually no more than 15-30 students. There are many services that students can avail themselves of from career services to internship opportunities.
Senior,4,Overall Rider University is a very good school a little expensive however the education specifically for the Westminster choir college is exceptional.
Alum,4,"One thing that I liked about Rider was the opportunities that were available to me. Regardless of major and year, students can gain internships, externships or research assistant positions (if space is available in professors research labs). Due to the small class size, professors are readily accessible. A student can only be bored if she/he wants to be bored. There are 100 clubs and organizations on Rider's campus. If there isn't one of interest, no problem. A student can simply make their own club/organization and become the president of it."
Freshman,4,"I'm an acting major, and the theatre program here is absolutely fantastic and is a large part of my score, but overall, I do think it's nice here. I love that it's a small school. None of the classes are very big at all, which is awesome. Of course, the school does have its problems, mostly things like the heating going way overboard in the dorms, or the broken water filters not getting fixed for a long time, but pretty much any school has smaller problems like that. It is expensive, and it does feel like we're paying a bit too much to go here, but I still really do enjoy it here."
Freshman,4,"I love the small family community.  Professors are very caring.  If you have a car almost every thing you need is within 5 miles.  Campus life is exciting, always something to do.  The only thing I would change about rider is the food.  Overall I rate Rider 4/5."
Sophomore,4,"Rider is what you make it. If you prefer a small campus lifestyle, then Rider is a good option. It would be great if there were more food options at Rider, but there are some within driving distance."
Freshman,4,"Rider University is a great college to get adjusted to and becomes a second home for you in a few days. It has great staff, a great recreation center, and a beautiful campus full of nature. It never fails to keep you busy with education, events, performances, and makes you eager to be active in the community. The dining hall has improved, but a permenant solution to dirty dishes and repeating meals is needed. All in all, Rider is a great university to have an education in and will continue to be a great learning experience"
Junior,4,The experience at Rider university is something that every student should discover. Rider University has great professors that want their students to succeed. The student body is great as well. The campus is small but it gives any student the opportunity to meet new people easily.
College Student,4,The school spirit at Rider University is high. Basketball is the main sport that is followed at Rider and the gym is always packed on game nights. Students paint their faces and participant during half time when there are activities. The athletic facilities are in great condition and comfortable to be in.
College Student,4,Rider University is a great school. The only down side would be the price of the school. Since Rider is a Private School it is very expensive. What I like about the school is the Equal Opportunity Program which I participated in in my undergraduate studies. This program was for students who were financially challenged. This program allowed Rider to be more affordable for me to attend and graduate.
College Sophomore,4,Greek is also good at our campus because they give a lot back to the community
College Sophomore,4,The Athletics facilities in out school are up to date and open for all of ours students which is great.
College Junior,4,"The courses are always interesting and its because to professors show true passion for what they teach.  And the professors are willing to help students, even meet with them after class outside their office hours if a student can't make it to them"
College Junior,4,A degree from this school would look great on job applications since they are so well diverse in majors and courses
College Junior,4,"The security is really great at school, they are willing to drive you from campus to other places or from a place to your door building."
College Junior,4,"There are a variety of sports and club activities.  There are a lot of things on campus for students to be active and interact with the other students.  There is a gym and in door track on campus that anyone, student or staff are able to use."
College Junior,4,I would chose Rider again because of what they offer during and after my attendance of the school.  They help you with the job hunt and help find you jobs.  And during classes their professors are always available to help you because their top priority is see you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"You can find people from a variety of different races and ethnicities on campus. Students seem very accepting of people of different races and ethnicities, economic backgrounds, political beliefs, religions, and sexuual orientations. There are political clubs, religious clubs, racial/ethnic clubs, and LGBTQ clubs on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"There are strict policies. If you are caught underage drinking on campus, you will have to perform some type of community service on campus and you may lose your on campus housing. If you or someone you know is intoxicated, there are services that you can use to help you or that person return to their dorm safely."
College Junior,4,The academics at my school is overall great. I think it's one of the best things Rider has to offer.
College Sophomore,4,"Some course are more challenging than others. However, most of the professors want you to do well and encourage you to contact them and go to their office hours if you have any questions or need help with the material."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not sure what the student career prospects are or what the value of a degree from here is. There is a Career Services building on campus where students can get help with their resumes, prepare for interviews, and even borrow business attire. There is a Career day every semester where students can meet prospective employers."
Sophomore,2,"I'm gonna be straight up, it sucks if you do not do anything on campus. If you want to have a good time at Rider, unfortunately, joining a sorority or frat will make your time worth it at Rider or just joining a ton of clubs in general. I have not had any fun since attending, it's very much a suitcase school and it's practically a ghost town on weekends. There isn't much to do outside of campus besides visit TCNJ (if you have friends there) or go to Princeton which is like a 20-minute drive. The professors and the administrators are great when it comes to seeking help but that's only bc Rider is a small school. I will be transferring because I did not enjoy my time nor will I in the future. 

Also, financial aid SUCKS if you do not get anything in on time, so make sure to stay on top of that and everything. Very disorganized."
Niche User,2,"Way overpriced which they offset by giving EVERYONE scholarships (and still overpriced by comparison to other schools).  Just lower the price for God's sake!  If the dorms were even a cheap hotel, I'd check out.  Many professors so heavily-accented as to be indecipherable and guidance suggests ""You'll get used to it"".  Mostly online classes for 20-21 school year and limited options for dining but no reduction in tuition or fees to compensate.  And on Fridays the place empties out except for the out-of-staters.  Definitely a backpack school. If you're looking for quality, look elsewhere."
Niche User,2,"Poor organization, several ""no show professors"" for scheduled classes, unpredictable wi-fi to connect.  Might as well have dropped the semester."
Sophomore,2,"Rider is a small school, fit for those who are comfortable with knowing everyone and all of staff there. Rider can have a depressing mood, but it is one of those schools were you have to make the best of it. There are some good aspects but one has to make the most of out them. Rider is full of life lessons and learning experiences when dealing with not so nice people."
Junior,2,"As a business major, even I feel that too much effort is being focused on the business school so much so that it is unfair to the other schools. Definite favoritism there. Some staff are incredibly helpful, but majority is not. Dorms are awful and food is even worse."
Alum,2,"Administration is terrible and it's so overpriced.  The professors are AMAZING but I wish all the student debt I've accumulated was going into their pocket, not the administrator.  Their sale of Westminster was a travesty."
Alum,2,"As someone who just graduated from Rider, I definitely had good and bad experiences. Rider, right now, is extremely poor and has a serious financial crisis. I earned an academic scholarship from them and never received it because they put a cap on my financial aid and told me they could not give me the scholarship. They are not generous about financial aid and I have heard many students encounter problems and lose scholarship money. However, professors were amazing and helped me make a decision about what graduate school was the best fit for me. Campus is outdated and located in the middle of nowhere. In terms of social life, many parties were exclusive to fraternity and sorority life. As someone who was a part of Greek life at the school, I would join elsewhere or not join at all. Overall, Rider is just too poor and too outdated to keep in competition with other private and public schools."
College Junior,2,Rider night life is boring.
College Junior,2,Most students go off campus to party Rider is a dry school.
College Junior,2,I dont live on campus because it's like sleep away camp. If you're not living in a greek house you're SOL.
College Junior,2,I commute. I would not want to live on campus at Rider-the dorms are glorified concrete closets.
College Sophomore,2,There is no sports team that really represents the school well.
College Junior,2,I do not think I will do much with my degree. I am just a business major trying to get my bachelors degree to get out of school. I put too much stress on myself and the stress is not worth it for me.
College Junior,2,"The rooms are extremely small for two people. There is not enough of storage space, specially for a girl with money pieces of clothing. It is very expensive to live on campus. I was considering it to get the experience, but the amount of money is not worth it and I did not want to share with a stranger. I would rather pick my roommate, but coming into this school middle of junior year is tough on me."
College Freshman,2,I don't believe this school prepares you well for a career.
College Freshman,2,The students keep the dorms filthy and don't take care of them so they naturally are not nice.
College Freshman,2,"Although being a University, the school is very small and has little funding at all so there is a lack of technology for science students and little opportunity to do research. Very small variety of classes you can take."
College Senior,2,"The rooms are small,expensive, and ugly. The dorms are old and there are not many quality options. It is way too overpriced for what they offer. Just rent off campus. You will get a far better deal and you won't have to pay for the drunk graffiti on the walls."
College Sophomore,2,It is only driving distance chain restaurants that provide crappy food that is easier to eat on campus then off
College Freshman,2,"You need a taxi to go anywhere which is expensive or at least a DD. Parties always get caught, and cost at least 5 if you are a guy and some cheap parties even charge girls too. Dorm parties are better if you have good friends , but arent much better either,"
College Freshman,2,The dorms are terrible unless you live in a suite or off campus housing. The dorms are older than my parents and you will sweat to death closer to the summer time. You don't get what you pay for.
College Freshman,2,Finding some where to live off campus and not at home is very difficult and expensive.
College Freshman,2,"For the considerable amount of money I pay to attend this school, the housing options and quality are incredibly poor and disappointing."
College Freshman,2,"The party scene on campus is small and a bit lame, but not the worst considering the size of campus."
College Freshman,2,"When it comes to the general education requirements, the curriculum is unnecessarily large and strict. The gen ed professors are almost all adjunct and do not take into account the amount of work our majors give us. General education classes are more stressful than my major courses and mostly do not correlate to any information I will need in the future. For example, as an Arts Administration major, the need for World History from year 0-1500 is not needed and gave me an unnecessary amount of stress."
College Freshman,2,"Rider is not a school that is extremely well known for its sexual abuse, but that is not due to a lack of abuse. It is 100% due to the fact that many, or most abuse cases are not brought up to higher authority."
College Freshman,2,The administration are very hot and cold about how strict they are. One day they will violations slide and the next they are too strict about slight violations.
College Sophomore,2,Far too expensive for what you get
College Freshman,2,The Greek life is only really for academic groups. The academic groups are extremely helpful for finding jobs and internships.
College Freshman,2,Rider teaches to a low level. If you are a smart kid you'll easily manage a 3.0 even if you're lazy and skip once in a while. If you want a 4 you'll need to put in a fair amount of effort. It's difficult to fail. Rider doesn't have that great of an academic reputation.
College Freshman,2,"I go out almost every weekend, the parties are subpar and you need a car to get to them, unless you're willing to cough up $40 for a cab. The frat parties are sketchy and not too fun, the sports teams throw pretty decent parties but they're nothing to write home about. Occasionally there will be a really awesome party, but don't count on it."
College Freshman,2,"Most parties are off campus. If you don't know the right people, you won't know about a party"
College Sophomore,2,I only say bad because Rider doesn't host a lot of parties. It's usually just get-togethers or gatherings.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is much better at Rider than Westminster
Recent Alumnus,2,Some of the classrooms & dorms are falling apart
College Freshman,2,Rider and Westminster are pretty strict with drugs and alcohol.
College Freshman,2,The buildings we live in were supposed to be torn down in the 70s... They are still in use.
College Freshman,2,"Relatively dead all the time. Your best bet is to be ok with the Jerky jocks, or go to TCNJ or Rutgers."
College Freshman,2,I suggest you bring your own car.
College Freshman,2,Unless you get a chance to get premium housing the other buildings are all hot and super old.
College Sophomore,2,Rider floods a lot and it sucks. When it snows parking is a real struggle.
College Junior,2,You can;'t get anywhere in this area without a car.
College Junior,2,For the amount of money i am paying to be here it's not worth it.
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do ever. Unless you have a car you are going to be super bored.
College Sophomore,2,"Daly's dinning hall is the main hall, you must purchase a meal plan (very expensive). The food at Daly's is bad, most of the time the food tastes bad. The pasta station is my least favorite, the sauces taste like water.The food is always the same and most people do not eat healthy. The other option is Cranberry's, it is better than Daly's but you must use your Bronc bucks to purchase it. In cranberry's there is also a convenience store that has a subway inside, which you must use your Bronc bucks for as well. Most students keep a lot of food in their dorm rooms and cook in their building kitchens."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is so annoying. All students must register their car and they get stickers that specify where you must park. If you are a freshman who commutes parking will suck. The parking for commuting freshman is behind our turf field. It is not too far from the academic buildings but it is far away from everything else. Most freshman feel like outcasts for having to park there since they are the only ones that have to park there. Freshman residents get okay parking far away from the dorms and academic buildings but at least they are around other people. Most people do not like parking where they are supposed to and take spots closer to the buildings as possible which causes students who are supposed to park in those spots park further away or in a spot in which they are not allowed to park in causing them to get tickets. Public safety gives out tickets like nothing. Some students have gotten tickets even when they park where they are supposed to. Freshman residents have to pay $300 for the year and after that getting your parking permit is free.
College Sophomore,2,Barely any wifi at times
College Sophomore,2,"Yeah, aesthetically Westminster is not too great."
College Freshman,2,They are constantly out to ruin a good night of ole college drinking. You can't even have an empty shot glass in a dorm on display. (What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas- even the souvenirs).  A girl got in trouble for posting a picture of a bottle of vodka on her instagram in her dorm. Be very sneaky and very quiet and you should be fine.
College Freshman,2,ALL THE GUIDOS. And the girls either look like they rolled out of bed or are trying to be Kim Kardashian. 
College Sophomore,2,"Very bad! Not much to do ever!! Very remote, and totally awkward at times."
College Sophomore,2,"Shuttles have limited schedules, it goes to the mall only on the weekends. Public transport is never on time and expensive. Taxis are ok. The procedure for zip cars is lengthy and they are expensive."
College Freshman,2,Dining is disgusting. For what you pay it should be of better quality. 
College Student,2,Commuter parking is so far
College Freshman,2,Greek life is boring! All they do is party with their fellow Greeks and they don't know what strolling is (all Greeks should know that). They don't step or have battles.
College Freshman,2,I need more aid because I can't afford what I have
College Freshman,2,Housing is okay but it could be easily updated and definitely cleaner.
College Freshman,2,Ive only ever used my own computer but the connection is fairly slow.
College Freshman,2,There is always public safety driving around but its mostly students who are blasting music and not really looking for trouble.
College Freshman,2,There is basically no social life especially on the weekends. Everyone gets crazy drunk like at any other school. People are mostly from New Jersey so everyone dresses the same and sort of looks the same too.
Alum,1,"Rider bought Westminster Choir College promising that they would never move the campus. This has turned out to be a lie. They are moving the WCC campus because of Rider's financial mismanagement. I recently paid to get a transcript sent to a college I'm attending for grad studies this fall. Rider farms out the service to a scam company, and a problem occurs, they point fingers at the other, telling me I have to get a refund from ""the other party"" and when I call them on it, tell me I have to pay all over again.

My spouse and I both graduated from this garbage school posing as a reputable university. DO NOT waste your money. This university does not give a wet slap about you. They just want your money. Well, this was the final straw. Over $7, they just lost all of our support. That means not only financial support through alumni giving, it also means support of the school in the industry we are both still very actively a part of. I hope that $7 was worth it, Registrar's Office."
Freshman,1,"If you are planning on going to Rider University, please make sure you read the award letter (scholarship, work study etc).  They will add your work study program and it will say you will get paid 2300. Its a BIG FAT LIE.  Its not guaranteed. My son applied to numerous jobs and dint get any.  I don't why they lie about these things in a  offer letter.   They want you to go to their college and when you find out they scam you into it, its too late. I wont trust them"
Niche User,1,"Terrible on a financial level.  They decrease aid and increase tuition every year.  My now senior student should be graduating this year, but CAN NOT afford to return to Rider to finish her education due to the decrease in aid, and increase in tuition, room and board.  
Do not be fooled by how they try to get you in as a freshman."
College Junior,1,"Too strict, always looking for money through fines"
College Sophomore,1,"Greek housing is just a few floors of a few dorm buildings. They are visible on campus but don't do much, no one really notices them."
College Sophomore,1,"It's terrible, but the dining commons staff are always friendly!"
College Freshman,1,The administrates are extremely strict.
College Freshman,1,The parties are hard to find and you have to find someone to drive to all the parties.
College Freshman,1,No one on campus likes the greeks except for the greeks themselves. Their parties aren't that great and they have a bad rep around campus for being sort of weird...they also like to pick fights with the sports teams more often than not.
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties here, you would have to leave town to get to some decent parties. Of those parties you would need a car or have a friend that has a car to get there because everything is pretty far from here."
College Junior,1,The area is very expensive and not worth your time. 
College Junior,1,TERRIBLE! It is a very expensive school with nothing seeming to be clean.
College Junior,1,They seem to offer little to no help for me!
College Junior,1,There seems to be nothing for people with diet restrictions like I have. I can only eat salad or meat since they offer little for a carb free diet.
College Sophomore,1,The food stinks not gonna lie. It's just not consistent.
College Sophomore,1,We're all musicians...nobody has time for sports other than for fun. Ultimate frisbee for days.
College Freshman,1,Professors are normally dinosaurs who don't care and constantly try to put you in you're place. Students often don't try at all or even take notes in class.
College Freshman,1,"The campus is absolutely dead on weekends. Everybody goes home.  On the off chance there is a party on campus it is in the upperclassman apartments on campus, but they often get busted because of Rider's awful nazi-like alcohol policy.  There are some off campus house parties but they are at least a 10 minute drive on the highway which proves to be very dangerous. "
College Freshman,1,Z lot is so far from everything. I hate the walk from there to anywhere on campus.
College Sophomore,1,My school is in New Jersey so the weather is all over the place it is either really terrible or really good.
College Sophomore,1,There is not much off-campus housing.
College Freshman,1,Financial Aid at this school is not helpful what so ever. They are strictly just trying to get more money out of your pocket. 
College Sophomore,1,"Rider University is HORRIBLE. DO NOT COME HERE. It is honestly a prison and I would NEVER tell anyone to come here. It's like they don't want anyone to have fun!!!! It is obvious that people are going to drink and go out at college but Rider's alcohol policies are disgustingly strict. They'll fine you for being too loud without a warning just to make a few bucks. The parties suck. There's no where to go and nothing to do. Again, if you came here you'd be making the worst mistake of your life."
College Freshman,1,After calling multiple times and harassing the financial aid office I finally got the aid I needed in order to attend my college.
College Freshman,1,There really is no night life unless you have a friend with a car who can drive to Princeton.
College Freshman,1,The facilities are okay; the dorms are a bit dirty and could use updating. 
College Sophomore,1,"its always hard to find parking at this university even though i currently dont have a car, my friends and i always struggle to find a parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,Its hard to get into you programs here not much competition but they make it seem like one.
College Sophomore,1,I hate my program and im not fond of this school at all!
College Junior,1,Unless you live in the buildings or apartments that have parking right behind them good luck finding a spot! There are never any spots when you come on campus and you must be prepared to walk a good distance to class.
College Junior,1,"Okay so here is the thing about Rider, some students live on campus but far away from classes so we must walk. But the thing is that people driving around campus pay no attention to you and speed through the school! I have almost gotten hit at least four times in a solid week!  Another thing, is the alcohol rules on campus are very strict.  You can't have anything out in your room or shot glasses, or anyone under 21 in that room."
College Sophomore,1,"They're really annoyingly strict. You can't even be in a room with alcohol in it, regardless if you're drinking or not. They are like nazis. I feel like im in a friggen prison- not college."
College Freshman,1,For students under 21 there is almost nothing to do! There are maybe 2 parties (if that) and they are all off campus. Parties get busted by the cops pretty early. You'd also need a DD or a taxi just to get there.
College Junior,1,After a student died from alcohol poisoning 6 years ago Rider has been incredibly strict.  Any underage drinking is resulted in a huge fine.  Second offense you probably lose housing.  With the frats saying the word Pledge can get you in trouble and there are very strict hazing rules to the point where it is ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,Super Strict – You have to be careful what you post and what you do. You can get in trouble on campus for an incident that may have happened off campus. There excuse is that you represent Rider and are giving them bad name. So be very careful! They are super strict about alcohol and drugs. If you are under 21 and caught with alcohol they have a whole process and punishments and EDU class you must take. You even have to pay fines.
College Junior,1,"Where Is There Any? The only reason it isn't getting an F is because there are some rentals available in the area, but they are all prohibitively expensive and the school is no help in getting them. The same 3 houses are advertised in the dorms every year, but otherwise, good luck finding any place to live. And unless you want to live in the heart of Trenton, the rent will still be way too much."
College Freshman,1,"Our transportation on campus is not convenient at all. The waiting times are ridiculous and there is only one mini bus running at a time, which forces students to use public transportation. With our tuition we should have more opportunities for on to off campus transportation."
College Sophomore,1,"I received a $10,000 scholarship from Rider when I first applied, but I do not receive any need-based aid. My parents struggle because my sister and I are both attending four-year expensive schools and not receiving the help we deserve."
College Sophomore,1,The Shuttle Bus – I took the shuttle once and will never take it again. The times I was given as to when I would be dropped off/picked up did not match what the driver had. I found myself waiting for over an hour in Princeton to be picked up.
College Sophomore,1,I haven't heard of any clubs in the area or transportation to them. I usually don't hear about parties until after the fact.

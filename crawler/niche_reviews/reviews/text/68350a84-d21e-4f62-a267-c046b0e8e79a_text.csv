Sophomore,5,"Great school to instill discipline in your life and get the chance to be the change you wish to see by partaking in a Regimental position in your junior and senior year, getting the chance to be a part of a well-oiled team of professionals."
Freshman,5,"Going to Massachusetts Maritime Academy is one of the best decisions of my life. No, it was not an easy road to be recognized as a cadet and go through two weeks of boot camp. But it was 100% worth it. This school is not for everyone. It takes a certain type of individual to come here. It hard to go to school here because of the regiment.We believe in three simple things: Discipline, Knowledge and Leadership. Those three words define us as cadets at this school. You will succeed here because of the family you will have in your company, the professors that truly care about you and the squad leaders(you will know what I mean if you come here) that are supporting in everything you do and helping you succeed in academics. Come to THE Massachusetts Maritime Academy, if you are up for the challenge."
Alum,5,"I graduated with a job waiting for me after an internship with a multi-billion dollar, Fortune 500 shipowner with 70k+ employees  - when I started working w/ other recent grads from elsewhere (especially the high tuition places that get listed on Barstool's top party colleges) you'll find many of them are incredibly ungrateful. Many are not taking the bull by the horns at work or look to excel in life- they count down the days every Monday and just wait for their paycheck to go off and have fun on the weekend. 

Maritime makes you one hell of a 22-23 year old adult. We start the game with a maturity level far above many other people our age and the results are the 23 y/o analyst, the 25 y/o Sr Analyst, etc. Where we are when we graduate is where most people start to get their s*** together at age 30."
Sophomore,5,"This academy is unlike any other college. Students start their days at 5 am and end them at 10 am. There is no partying. We wear uniforms to classes and have a regimented structure. The school has many leadership opportunities to get involved with. The median pay after graduation is 90,000."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman in my second semester here at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, I have learned ten times the values, life lessons, and traits here in one semester than I would have at an entire four years somewhere else. I have learned how to be a leader and a great person from going here so far. I would strongly advise attending this Academy if you would like a great career after graduating and a lifetime of respect from everyone surrounding you."
Freshman,5,"Attending Massachusetts Maritime Academy is one of the best decisions I have made, whether it’s due to the structured lifestyle the school provides or the discipline, knowledge, and leadership skills the school continues to teach me. It was a big decision to leave my home in  Florida and to live up here full time but by sticking with my motto “4 years of hard work for a lifetime of fun, doing something I love,” I hold an unbreakable drive to become the best I can be and make a difference in this world and I owe part of this to the Massachusetts Maritime Academy."
Sophomore,5,I'm a sophomore at Mass Maritime currently. I think Maritime was the best choice of my life. I'm already seeing the benefits of all my hard work paying off. I think the school is extremely challenging but fit for anyone who is driven to succeed. The regiment can be difficult but the structure of the school builds character and integrity.
College Freshman,5,99% job placement within 6 months of graduation
College Freshman,5,"There are great resources with health services, campus police, and people standing watch. However, there is no tolerance for this sort of behavior and there have been almost zero incidents."
College Freshman,5,The career services department is great. They are really helpful in assisting students. There are amazing cooperative opportunities that everyone takes part in and there are career fairs that most people attend with hundreds of employers from around the country that come specifically to hire Maritime Cadets.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are mostly very open, very knowledgeable in their fields and are willing to help you. Class sizes are typically 10-20. Most of them are traditional style of teaching, lecture and note taking. However some teachers do ""reverse-style""."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the school. The regiment and the lifestyle is a perfect fit for me. The structure of the regiment, the challenging classes, and all of the learning opportunities allow me to get the best out of my learning."
College Sophomore,5,"The opportunities I now have now that I am a cadet at MMA are amazing and the structure really helps me focus on my studies. In addition to the hands on learning and experienced staff, I have made the best relationships with other cadets of all ages and majors because of the requirement to live on campus and the orientation we are required to go through. Maritime was the best decision I could have made."
College Junior,5,Businesses value the structure and discipline that the academy instills in their students and that is why they are willing to pay the big bucks to hire fresh graduates.
College Junior,5,Even though i hate my major and have average grades I still believe that I will be able to find a suitable job after graduation.
College Junior,5,Greatest school in the country based on return on investment. No where else in the country can you get this great of a job right out of college.
College Junior,5,My program is extremely hard however it will pay off and already has because I received my first co-op this summer which pays extremely well.
College Junior,5,Getting into the programs is competitive but extremely rewarding.
College Junior,5,Almost everyone here has a job before they come out. The professors really care and develop an interesting curriculum.
College Junior,5,Classes are small so there is always a teacher student relationship. The workload isn't too much especially with the amount of time we get to turn in assignments.
Senior,4,"First off do not come here for any major that is not a license or engineering degree; unless you love acting like GI Joe in your free time, have excellent financial aid, or enjoy standing in cold weather for 30 minutes every morning. ""Easy"" Majors such as Emergency Management or MSSEP make little more money than a regular college when they graduate, if not the same. Make no mistake, being at this school really is painful. Surrounded by 90% males, you will most likely not have a shot at one of the desert queens of this school. In addition to no female interaction, your shipmates will consist of hardos who swear to uphold the regiment and think the whole 4 years is a marine corps boot camp. The two-week orientation is horrible. 19 hour long days with kids only a couple years older than you playing god. Come here for a degree worth your time. Don't waste 4 years to make 4k/year more than the kid from UMass."
Freshman,4,It's been difficult so far. The lifestyle takes time to get used to but when you do you just have to put your head down in the books and study as much as you can. Keep reminding yourself that in 4 years it will all be worth it even though its going to suck for the first months and even your freshman year.
Sophomore,4,The academy is a great place to get a good education and great experience and network for a future career in the maritime industry. If you are looking for a fun and party filled college experience you are not looking at the right school. The whole purpose of the school is to prepare you for a career.
Niche User,4,Mass Maritime Academy is one of my top school choices because of the preparation it can give me for my career. The discipline is strict and has all the programs I need in order to prep for joining the navy as an officer.
Sophomore,4,"Mass Maritime isn't you typical college. If your looking for that ""college experience"", it's not the school for you. Its a regimented, military based school. None the less a great school if your looking to be successful and want a structured lifestyle."
College Junior,4,Great curriculum and learning experience
College Junior,4,Happy that I chose MMA for college. It has been tough but I know that it is worth it.
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Junior,4,MMA is tough but I know I will be prepared for my future endeavors.
College Junior,4,"The academy is becoming increasingly more difficult because of the desire to send out the best of the best into the work force. We have built up a very good reputation in the maritime world, and the faculty and staff only want to build on that. With that comes tougher professors, and a greater workload set with higher standards. Many kids attend this school to come out with a degree that pays a lot of money, so they are willing to make their major their life for four years in order to be able to enjoy the rest of their lives being financially stable while doing what they love to do. The professors expect five to ten hours a week of studying for their class a week, and do not hold back when testing you on if you had fulfilled their study requirements. These professors are professionals in their fields and have years upon years of experience under their belts and only want the best cadets to represent them upon graduation. This regimented academy does not offer an easy college lifestyle, but it is very rewarding in the end."
College Junior,4,"Campus police are everywhere you turn. Walking around campus, you will find that one out of three cars will have an orange slip on it. The cadets are aware of the severity of their punishments, so the campus is quiet most of the time. Campus police have nothing better to do than give illegally parked cars tickets."
College Junior,4,"I had attended three other schools prior to attending MMA, and in choosing this school, I have opened doors the my future are career options that no other school had offered to me before. Within my first semester, I had accomplished more than I had in the previous three years  at other colleges because of the lifestyle. There are no chances to goof off and act irresponsibly, and I am thankful I had the chance to grow an appreciate for that by attending your ""typical college"" where drinking and smoking was all anyone did in their spare time. I became very involved on campus taking on squad leader position, becoming a Navy midshipman, being cross-country captain, all while studying hard as a marine transportation major. Many cadets complain of the lifestyle at Maritime because most of the student body is male and the night life in non-existent, but if you ask any graduate if they were thankful they had attended Mass Maritime, almost every single one of them will say they are so thankful they had attended."
College Junior,4,"In order to make the most of your experience at Mass Maritime, you need to be prepared for a lifestyle that you have never experienced before. Located in the blue collar coastal town of Buzzards Bay, Mass Maritime sits on a beautiful, isolated piece of land at the tail end of the Cape Cod Canal. Waking up every morning at the crack of dawn to clean toilets, mop floors, and taking out trash and later, being forced to sit in their rooms for two hours at the end of the night to study isn't what the typical freshmen looks foreword to at their first year of college. The school offers leadership positions within the academy for cadets that have built up appropriate and dedicated reputations over the years of attending. If you were to step foot on the campus, you would realize that the cadets run the academy by serving on honorary boards, training the incoming freshmen, and running the training ship. Offering maritime business, marine safety and environmental protection, emergency management, and facilities engineering as non-liscense majors in addition to marine engineering as well as marine transportation as license majors, narrows down the type of applicants that get admitted into the school. This administration specializes in studies centered around marine occupations, and therefore offers courses and opportunities that no other school offers. As for the night life during the week, Cadets tend to culminate in TJ's, a small run down bar just a little over a mile from MMA. As for weekends, the schools becomes almost like a ghost town with the exception of cadets obligated to stay, whether they are from out of town, on weekend watch, or for disciplinary reasons. It takes a special person to choose this school as an 18 year-old fresh out of high school, but the job placement when coming out at 21 years old earns most graduates up to six figures, but is definitely well earned after attending the unique and regimented lifestyle at Massachusetts Maritime Academy."
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school, but they could have better communication with the student body."
College Junior,4,The staff of the financial aid office are very understanding and try very hard to help out students in need.
College Freshman,4,"Many Sub shops/pizza, Chinese and regular restraints"
College Junior,4,Classes are good and teachers are interested in helping.
College Junior,4,Computer availability is great. Wireless is average.
College Sophomore,4,There are no drugs on school along with no drinking on campus.
College Sophomore,4,They could take it down a notch with the parking tickets.
Junior,2,"The quality of life at this school is awful. You hear at least one person joke about suicide every day. It’s the kind of place where the response to “how’s it going?” Is never positive. 
Academically, this school is a joke. Maybe not for engineers or marine transportation majors, but for other majors, it is hard to fail. Teachers overwhelm you with work all semester and keep you in the mindset that you are constantly failing and need to catch up, then scale your grade so everybody passes. If you pass in a paper that’s barely worth an F, you will get a B. While you try to keep up with classes, you will also have to deal with room inspections, personal appearance inspections, nightly check ins, morning formation, and standing watch. They allow you to have a social life, but without drinking or girls. 
They teach a lot of life lessons, and make use of their alumni base to ensure excellent job placement and salaries, but during the experience, you will doubt your choice"
Alum,2,"Pretty much everyone at this school has the same background with the same narrow minded viewpoints and the instructors are no different. The view book gives the impression the school is diverse but it's not. If you're white you'll be welcomed with open arms if you're not be prepared to experience subtle racism, isolation and talked about as if you're still in high school."
College Junior,2,"Athletics are put on the back burner at Mass Maritime for obvious reasons. The average cadet runs on 5-6 hours of sleep every night and finds themselves spending every spare hour hitting the books. Their lifestyle leaves them little time to carve out a few hours out of their day to meet their mandatory practice time as an athlete. Most kid's use that extra hour or two to hit the small and overcrowded weight room to ""get big."" With the help of the new athletics director, the athletics department is undergoing changes to better their facilities and programs, so there are improvements being made."
College Junior,2,"I hate business, there are courses where I have learned nothing of use. Death by powerpoint seems to be a popular trend."
College Junior,2,I am very biased because I want to study something completely different than the school offers. The business teachers are alright.
College Junior,2,"They have to bribe students to go to football games. Which, in my opinion, shows how much our teams are subpar."
College Junior,2,"Pricey, and not very close at all"
College Junior,2,Not much variety at all.
College Junior,2,"It's bad in that we are given a set of strict rules, however, they are actually not implemented and the people who shouldn't be here stay but the people who do minor things get kicked out. It's ass backwards"
College Junior,2,"It is comparable to the drama of high school, only worse since you get to live with everyone!"
College Senior,2,Having the same options over the course of 4 years is not enjoyable
College Sophomore,2,"It's just not a fun place to be, its drains you. The surrounding area isn't all that nice either unless you have a car then there's not much to do"
College Sophomore,2,"Very small rooms not much to them. Only allowed a tv or a mini fridge once you're a jr., sr. year you can get both. It's very cloudy, rainy and windy and the people year can be less than friendly."
College Junior,2,Near impossible to do the forms and they keep sending me numerous letters with fancy writing that contradicts itself throughout and is useless.
College Junior,2,"Its a niche school so diversity is a tough thing to judge, but from the outside it must look bad."
College Junior,2,There is about 15% girls here. Guys don't come here to find girls and vice-versa. They come here to get high paying jobs.
College Junior,2,We're located in Buzzards Bay so there is nothing to do around however our school is on the water so there is always something nice to look at.
College Junior,2,There are mostly only fast food places and few pizza shops around.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is a horrible place to be but if you stick it out for the four years, you will come out with a great paying job."
College Freshman,2,The food is awful and it makes it very hard to eat healthy. but the safety is just fine.
Freshman,1,"If your dream is to go to school with the whitest trash in the northeast, this is the school for you. Have fun freezing at morning formation!"
Sophomore,1,"Possibly the worst school you could ever attend. Quality of the classes are awful for the limited degree you'd get from this place. Forget this place if your from out of state, they don't care about you. Save your time and your money."
Sophomore,1,"Mass Maritime is the worst decision I have made. You hear about great paying jobs after you graduate but it is just a bunch of false advertising. The whole math department is horrendous and you would think they would hire math professors who give a damn about your grades since math is heavy in the curriculum. Everyone is stubborn at this school and think they are above everyone else. Juniors and seniors abuse the power they have over freshman and hand out tap sheets left and right. The food here is disgusting and there is nothing around here to do, if you are even allowed to leave campus. Haven't got a full 8 hours of sleep since I have been here, since I have to be up 3 hours before my first class at 8am to clean the building. Is it Friday yet? Oh wait I cant go home I have to stand 24 hours of weekend watch!"
Alum,1,"The academy is full of fake people. The academy takes so much pride in producing ""good people,"" but all they really do is produce professional liars. I saw more lying at this academy to get out of the strict punishments than you would see at a regular university. Everyone at the academy drinks just as much alcohol as any other school. Very misleading information about the cadets this place produces. Its reputation is all its good for"
College Freshman,1,Greek life is non-existent because the school is regimented and para-military.
College Junior,1,"We are a dry campus and drug testing is a frequent occurrence, so that leaves little to no trace of fun stemming from drug use. Many cadets have figured out a system to stealthily drinking int their rooms because they understand that getting caught results in immediate punishment and possibly expulsion from the school."
College Junior,1,There are absolutely NO parties at school seeing as the only housing opportunity is in the one dorm building or the ship.
College Junior,1,"The night life is very disappointing, but students are either too involved in their studies and don't have the time to go out, or they are too young to go to the one bar available down the street. The campus is dry and doesn't tolerate any drinking or smoking."
College Junior,1,Most cadets come from the same background and that is mostly influenced by the area they grew up in (coastal towns).
College Junior,1,"Almost barren.

Cadets go to other colleges to party.

There are a few local bars, but that's about it."
College Junior,1,"There have been afew incidents where cadets threw ""parties""  in their room and there were big consequences 

Most of them were expelled"
College Junior,1,As I said the school is 90% white males. I can't say there are more racists or misogynists than other schools but they seem to be much more open and accepted about their views.
College Junior,1,There is not much variety. It's about the same meal every week. The quality of the food is horrendous.
College Senior,1,"The school has nothing to do with off campus housing, you have to find it on your own"
College Senior,1,"No one comes to our school for night life, everyone travels to other schools on weekends"
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties on campus and very very few off campus most of the time people go to other colleges to party.
College Junior,1,Dear god is it bad. There are 2 antique shops and some old boutiques. Is it Friday yet so I can go home?
College Junior,1,There is no greek life here at the academy. We are one big family.
College Junior,1,Cadets come to school here to get a job not to party. If they want to party on the weekends they find another school.
College Junior,1,As a regimented academy the student population is required to live in the dorms.

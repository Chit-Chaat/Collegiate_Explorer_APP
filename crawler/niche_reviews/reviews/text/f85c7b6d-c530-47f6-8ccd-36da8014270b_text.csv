Freshman,5,All professors are willing to work with you on technical difficulties. They try to make it as simple and as effective as possible. I have had little to no problems with my online learning. Some classes are both in-person and online which creates a better learning environment compared to completely online.
Senior,5,"All of my classes were taken online and will continue that way. I love the online classes. It works better for me because I work but I am also disabled. The professors are awesome. They answer within a day. Most of them answer right back, even on Sunday's. The course material is easy to understand and to maneuver through. I think they do a very good job."
Graduate Student,5,I have enjoy NCWC the professor have taught me a lot in psychology and Religion and CJS studies.  I have worked very hard to get my degree's and plain on getting my Masters.  Because of covid-19 It will not hinder me from getting a good job.  I wanted to attend NCWC because I love the school it has a lot of opportunity's and I will work hard to achieve my degrees.
Sophomore,5,The online learning is on of the most organised and work is always graded on time. Lectures are also done on time.
Freshman,5,I am just started my education at Wesleyan and what ive seen and heard have been amazing. I am playing football at this university and the campus life is amazing. The professors  really care about you and they have an open door policy so anytime you need help and there door is open you can just go get help for free. Also the students are so friendly and it is a great environment to be in and the campus is gorgeous.
Freshman,5,i like how everybody is willing to help one of another and there proffessor and and administrators are helpful too
Niche User,5,My experience at NC Wesleyan was great. I was on a official visit for football and I loved the campus. They have a very nice campus and the students there were very friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,I like the online classrooms and how they are set up to help you succeed. There’s always someone in reach to help you and guide you in the right direction
Junior,5,I thoroughly enjoy this college. If I ever have questions or concerns someone is always available or able to answer them. I love the environment and how it is a christian college.
Freshman,5,"Everyone there is really nice and they will try to help and work with you in any way they can. The campus may be small compared to other colleges, but it is really nice and very easy to get around once you learn all the buildings."
Works Here,5,"Wesleyan is a beautiful campus with a great atmosphere. This small, private college offers one-on-one attention with professors in order to provide a personalized education."
Freshman,5,Its is a very nice campus but it is very small. One of the perks of a small school is that is provides more one-on-one time with your professors. Its a great school overall.
Freshman,5,I like how friendly the teachers are and how the campus is set up.  I would like to see an improvement in the food.
Sophomore,5,This school changed my life. I have grown closer to God and also developed several friendships with great people. Professors are there if a student needs help and really care about student success.
Senior,5,"I am part of the Aspire program.  Being a working mother and wife with three kids, NC Wesleyan provides an enriching and flexible program for me to earn my degree without sacrificing my family.  The work load is manageable and professors are knowledgeable."
Junior,5,I transferred there my sophomore 2016 year it’s been home since I have joined two clubs since I’ve been there even became apart of each of those executive board . NCWC has taught me how to be more social and vocal
Junior,5,I Love This School. This is by far the best college I have ever attended ever. From the students to the professors this school is top notch. They do any and everything they  can to help there students out. If you are looking for a small Campus this is the place to be.
Junior,5,"I love my schools atmosphere. It is a quiet campus with great teachers. Since, this is a Christian school you are surrounded by people who are a lot alike. The classes are challenging but the professors make sure they are there to help you succeed!"
College Sophomore,5,The professors are great and are willing to help anybody at any given time and the courses are a lot easier then they seemed at first. There are a lot of courses offered so you have a lot to choose from. The class sizes aren't to bad.
College Sophomore,5,The value of a degree from my school is very important to not only me but to everybody. Internships can be found everywhere on campus even in the community.
College Sophomore,5,The safety and security on campus is great. Nothing happens on my campus and not to many colleges or universities can  say that. There are no crimes on campus so everybody is safe no matter where they are
College Sophomore,5,The dorms are just like being at home and the best options are the single rooms because that makes you feel like you are living on your own and it makes you responsible for yourself instead of mom cleaning up for you. The cost isn't bad and the atmosphere is the best you could ever ask for
College Sophomore,5,The Greek life makes the campus even more funner when their around and the Greek students are viewed by non-Greeks as role models and they want to follow in their foot steps
College Sophomore,5,The athletics at my school are supported very well even if the games are off campus. The team are the best in the country and the facilities are made for everybody to use and everybody will have something to do
College Sophomore,5,What makes my school unique is the fact that everybody is like one big happy family and everybody is protected no matter what whether it's on or off campus. I would choose this school again because its the best school in the world
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are security officers on campus at all times, and we have a live-in local cop. Parties on campus require ID to be shown, there are check-in policies, and I haven't heard of any thefts in the past few years."
College Junior,5,It has great people and professors!
College Junior,5,"All students are treated equally on campus.  Many are identified by name and not student ID.  As for LGBT, they are not discriminated. However, we are all human and was created by Christ.  Regardless of the different religion our beliefs to whom we serve doesn't separate the campus.  Political standards are ofter discussed , but never degraded.  When financial hardships approaches, no man is for himself, however we exalt being ""My Brothers Keeper!""  The financial aid staff is remarkable and understanding in terms of delays from federal agencies."
College Junior,5,"Everyone that is an Athlete keeps their grades up. There is a lot of school spirit at the games from the President and his wife,faculty and students."
College Sophomore,5,"Most people at NCWC are pretty friendly and easy to get along with. The school is packed with foreign students so you get to meet people from different backgrounds and with a different style. As far as relationships,the school is just too small. Everyone ends up dating everyone and finds out everything."
College Sophomore,5,"It is different than most schools.In bigger universities you just get lectured, then you get a couple of quizzes, a paper, a midterm and a final. At NCWC you actually get a decent amount of homework, which in my opinion is good because you get to practice the subject more. It's sort of like high school as far as the classroom environment and the professors. The school is also great about helping you find internships, they email you weekly or any time a new internship opportunity opens"
College Sophomore,5,"There is PLENTY of parking at NCWC. The only thing is it can get difficult to park because everyone decides to drive to every building instead of walking. The campus is not big,at all,really, so there is no need to drive to a building that is walking distance."
College Junior,5,They were very helpful getting us started on our financial aid paperwork. They have a document financial tracking system that will let you know if you are missing some important documents.
College Freshman,5,The academics are wonderful here at NCWC.  I plan to major in Biomedical Sciences.  The teachers are very helpful and they want you to be successful.
College Freshman,5,The academics here are wonderful and the professors are as well.
College Freshman,5,There are tons of resturants and other dining options around town in Rocky Mount.  Many fast food options as well as sit down types of resturants.
College Sophomore,5,great for those who are interested in art or music majors
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of options and in close distance, the students dont have to worry about driving out too far."
College Sophomore,5,"Rocky Mount, NC is an up and coming city and the weather is fine and the professors are great and the atmosphere at the school is very comfortable."
College Freshman,5,"Wesleyan College is very strict but somewhat relaxed at the same time. I say this because you are given 3 chances before you are suspended for a semester. When plagiarism has occured the student does not get credit for the work involved. Second offense the student is withdrawn from the class receiving a ""F"" in the class. Third offense the student is suspended for a semester with a report of the plagiarism in the students permanent folder."
Freshman,4,"Enjoying the individual-centered environment. You can be as social or as anti-social as you want, no pressure. All staff I've come into contact with are friendly, understanding, and willing to compromise. Love the small but beautiful campus, would recommend to anyone."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Wesleyan College. I have interacted with incredible professors who have taken an interest in my education and future. I have developed good relationships with office staff who have assisted me with managing my schedule and my financial aid. I have worked full time the entirety of my time at Wesleyan, and I've always felt supported and felt that I had a place to turn to should I struggle. I've found the courses that I've taken to be practical and easily applicable to my future career."
Senior,4,"I took the majority of my classes at Wesleyan online because I am an adult, full-time working student. The professors that I've learned from have been helpful teachers and communicators. The assignments are useful and proportional to the length of each session. I have always felt well connected to the college and well supported even while attending part-time."
Senior,4,"This is a very caring and supportive college. I am disabled and have endured many challenges while here at school. They have supported me every step of the way. I have never had a situation where they ignored me or made me feel less than. You are always treated with the upmost respect. I have only been with the college for a year and a half and will be graduating this December. During this short stay I have not encountered anything that I do not like. We do run on an 8-week schedule, so if I were to mention something that I did not like it may be hard it would be that. Time goes by extremely fast so you have to  keep up with the course material. Otherwise I have no complaints."
Sophomore,4,"With a very peaceful environment that offers you a catalyst to perform in class at a high level, the college has dedicated professors that are willing to help every student improve. The sports facilities also provide athletes with the great talents to improve."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman so far the school is great, classes are fine, campus security is very thorough, though the food could be better in the cafeteria but don't get me wrong there are some good days in the cafe too. Rocky Mount is a small town so there isn't much depending on the kind of person you are but there is a lot of food choices in town. If you get bored with little ole Rocky Mount, NC Raleigh has a lot more things to do and is about an hour away I go just about every weekend. If an hour is too far Greenville is a bit closer and still has things to do in the town and if all else fails your going to have to start making your own fun when you can't drive an hour away. Though back to Wesleyan I could definitely see my self graduating from here."
Freshman,4,North Carolina Wesleyan College is provides a great atmosphere for those who want to earn a degree in smaller class sizes. The only downside as a student is that there is little to do on campus and outside of campus.
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Wesleyan went very well, personally I did not expect it to go so well since I was so nervous in the beginning. The professor are so nice and they are willing to go the extra mile for you. The students are great as well, everyone is friendly and they do not make you seem out. Overall, my first semester was fun and I am glad to say that I will be attending the spring semester."
Sophomore,4,It does not matter whichever college. I feel that this college will make you do something by yourself
Sophomore,4,"While North Carolina Wesleyan College is a small school, it brings so much to the table. Staying engaged in student activities is a great way to get involved. while it's not in a big city, which most people prefer, NC Wesleyan college will surprise you and keep you on your toes if you make the most of it. Finding that right group of friends and staying active you'll fall in love with the small school. It feels like you know everybody because you probably do, it makes you feel at home. Dealing with classes, you get that one-on-one time with each professor where other schools lack. Having a small number of students in each class gives you a great learning opportunity to really achieve your best. It has everything you need to be sucessful when you graduate, everyone cares about each other here."
Graduate Student,4,"North Carolina Wesleyan College is a great 4-year college to attend. The Administrator, Laura Brown is a wonderful person at the Goldsboro campus. The staff and instructors are very helpful when you face some type of crisis during your time of studies. The college have a variety of classes to choose from and instead of just completing one major, you have the opportunity to complete two or three depending on your own pace. I completed two which was Religious Studies and Criminal Justice. I enrolled again to complete Psychology."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at NCWC majoring in math and secondary education. The main attraction to me was the size of the campus, it was small, which put me in a smaller teacher to student ratio. The student life there is amazing, everyone is friendly and the teachers are super helpful. Overall I would recommend NCWC to anyone looking at small private colleges."
Freshman,4,"North Carolina Wesleyan College is truly a wonderful school. I have been here for 2 months and I love it so much already. My favorite thing about the school is definitely the tight-knit community that exists on campus. With less than a thousand students studying at Wesleyan, it is easy to make friends and build a family in a short amount of time. The international student body also makes Wesleyan's campus very rich and vibrant. No matter where you're from, you can always find somebody you identify with at Wesleyan. Students are given the opportunity to share their cultures, values and languages with everyone around them and this fills the campus with a melange of young men and women from different walks of life. Unlike many Southern US schools, Wesleyan has a student from every continent in the world. (except Antarctica, of course!) What I would like to see at Wesleyan is a change in the cafeteria menu and a serious renovation for the Nash Hall, which is where i currently live."
College Freshman,4,"over all it great, but some teachers arent"
College Freshman,4,"My School is well rounded, we are a big family"
College Freshman,4,for the most part it's great they offer free std test and other test
College Freshman,4,not all but most staff here will help you with no problem
College Freshman,4,good class size good people
College Freshman,4,it's one of the few good things at the school
Recent Alumnus,4,The Student Success Center is great if you need any additional resources. Professors help if you ask for it. The workload isn't too difficult if you manage your time and there are some good areas to have individual or group study sessions.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is so much diversity! We have a lot of international students who bring very different viewpoints.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The only thing I've seen is drinking at off-campus parties. Nobody really pressures you if you don't want to partake. We're a dry campus and have a zero tolerance policy for drugs, so doing anything illegal on the grounds is enough for at least suspension, probably expulsion."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Class sizes are great, professors genuinely care, and there are no TAs."
Recent Alumnus,4,Almost all of my friends who have graduated from Wesleyan are currently employed. Internship availability has gotten better and there are graduate degree fairs throughout the year for anyone interested in continuing their education.
Recent Alumnus,4,"One of my professors changed a class just because I needed his and another professor's, and they were offered the same day at the same time. Because I know my profs, I was able to go to them and get a class switched around which allowed me to graduate on time! Most people know a majority of the people on campus by name, and there are tons of support options. We're right between Greenville and Raleigh, so big city life isn't far away."
College Freshman,4,"We have everything here. International, North Carolina natives, people from out of state etc"
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus and have not had or heard of any incidents. If there ever is anything the campous security is sure to email, call, and text us.. even for weather warnings"
College Freshman,4,"Teachers are the great, course are decent, class sizes are great!"
College Freshman,4,"Majority of the student body are athletes, so it's a pretty big deal here. Because we are a like a community on campus, all other the athletes and non athletes attend each others games to support. Although they support in numbers, they don't do much spirit type things like black outs, face painting, or things of that sort. The athletic facilities are decent here; we have a workout gym, an auxiliary gym, and a main gym."
College Freshman,4,"So far I have had a great time here at school! There are always opportunities to get involved and get active on campus. If you show effort, the teachers will meet you half way. They are very willing and open to assistance. My academic adviser is the absolute best. I am comfortable going to see her about anything whether it is school related or not. I was proactive about scheduling so for me, it was easy to get the classes I wanted at the times I wanted. However, they have yet to begin online registration methods but word around is that we should have it for next fall. One set back is that the business office and financial aid offices are not very efficient and are not always on the same page. I had to keep going back and talking with both of them to get one simple thing done that turned out to be a slack on their part. Also, there seems to be some unnecessary general education classes, but that is expected being though that this is a Christian, private school. Other than that I have had a fine time here. I like the small campus and class setting, so this was a good pick for me."
College Junior,4,"Wesleyan recently adapted a new Head of Security in 2015, and he's made significant changes and improvements on campus. I haven't heard of any significant crimes or assaults so far, and I believe that it's because of the policies that he's implemented in his short time here.

The counseling services are fantastic, and I know dozens of students whose experiences at Wesleyan have been drastically improved by visiting them.

I have no idea what the health center is like on campus, I have literally not seen the school nurse on duty once in my three years here. Supposedly she had a baby or something and was on maternity leave, but I have no idea. If I get sick or injured, I'm more likely to drive myself to the hospital than knock on the health services door and see if she's in."
College Freshman,4,"The Caf could be better, but I love the area, and I can't complain about the dorms. It's college, it's not going to be perfect."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone in the financial aid office was nice, I just wish I could've recieved more money."
College Freshman,4,"I love the sports at this school, and I love how everyone gets involved."
College Freshman,4,"It's good, I would love to live off of campus just for the extra freedom."
College Freshman,4,"I love the parties here, they're great."
College Freshman,4,"Overall I love the campus, I stayed in Edgecombe my first year and they're very nice dorms. I love the social atmosphere and how everything is just right there around us. I the cost of the school is very high though, that is one thing I do dislike."
College Junior,4,"I have not been a student here before, but I know students that have been a member of a sport and it is big. Everyone on campus intends the events."
College Junior,4,"I have no idea about the Greek life at college, but I know that everyone gets along with each other and the whole campus is like one big family."
College Sophomore,4,Fan support is very good.
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of majors to choose from with many professors in their respective fields.
College Sophomore,4,Curriculum and work load is adequate.
College Sophomore,4,Follow the rules and policies and you will be fine.
College Sophomore,4,Many activities are available for students.
College Sophomore,4,Activities for student life are abundant across campus.
College Junior,4,It's pretty good; I can't really complain.
College Freshman,4,"We have students from everywhere, canada, germany, napal, japan, and other places. We have a small amount of homosexuals, but they are accepted by most."
College Freshman,4,"I love the small classes and the professors seem to really care about there student by taking all questions during class, giving us the home phone numbers, and email. We do not need to to make appointments to have meetings with our professor and can walk into their offices when ever we please. The only problem is that so far none of my professors seem to put all of our grade online until the end of the semester, and when they do, they only put the cummulative grade up and not what you got on all the assignments."
College Sophomore,4,i have not attended this college program yet . but the administration and ease of registration is superb
College Senior,4,"Some of the computers could use an upgrade, but there are plenty of computers available for the students to use."
College Junior,4,The classes are small so you can get the attention you need. Registration process is quick and easy. The workload depends on the Major and how many credits you have per semester.
College Sophomore,4,"Being that it is a liberal arts school,the majors are limited. But it has a great classroom environment"
College Sophomore,4,"As a student with a double major, Accounting and Business Administration, I am very pleased with my programs of study. I would choose the same majors again at the same school. My career goal is to change careers at the age of 45 and open my own accounting firm. I don't have any concerns about finding a job in my career because Accountants and C.P.A.s are needed every where every day."
College Sophomore,4,"There are several restaurants available in the Rocky Mount area. There's a Chili's, Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday, and several fast food restaurants such as Hardee's and McDonalds. There are a few steakhouses available such as the Texas Steakhouse and the Outback Steakhouse. There are plenty of good restaurants available."
College Sophomore,4,"Rocky Mount is a nice place to live and attend school if you like a small town atmosphere. The streets are rolled up at 10:00pm. There are not a lot of local activities available for young adults. Two larger cities are within 50 miles away, Raleigh and Greenville."
College Sophomore,4,"great for those who wish to major in arts,music, or computer related fields"
College Sophomore,4,"The facilities are good. There are some problems at times with the heating or cooling, but the buildings are really old so that's understandable."
College Freshman,4,"Well most people here at my school, they really dont care how they look but you have some that will wake up early enough to make sure they look good. That makes their day! I honestly dont have a problem with it because i dont care how they look. As, long as you make sure your on t he same page as i am and that's being in those books we can be great friends!"
College Freshman,4,The strictness is good. It let's students know that its time to get serious and we'er not little kids anymore. It's time to start acting more like adults and take responsibility about your actions!
Recent Alumnus,4,The best part about parking is that it is free! You can park just about anywhere on campus and be fine. There are no assigned parks so if you get to campus late you will have a small walk but it is only a couple feet.
Freshman,2,"North Carolina Wesleyan College has mildew growing in the corners and ceiling of dorm rooms which has been reported to the resident assistants and advisor and still has not been dealt with. Also the dorms resemble a prison with white brick walls inside, destroying and feel for creativity. students to steal from other dorm rooms because the door room doors can be easily opened not to mention that some room keys can open other room doors and has led to several rooms being broken into  and having students personal belongings stolen, items such as game systems, jewellery, money, etc.. And the campus security does practically nothing about it. However the professors are great but the school lacks tools and resources to fully exemplify a good college learning experience and the college is dirty because they have the football team;(i play)Clean the campus every Monday which doesn't make sense because they pay people to do that."
College Freshman,2,All this school cares about is money and getting  people to play for the football team which is under bad coaching
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not very prominent at all on campus. There are only a few groups and they do not do much that is broadcasted widely.
College Junior,2,"The internship/career services woman spams your email daily about fast food positions and local dying companies in the bustling metropolis of rocky mount.

I'd be surprised if 50% of graduates can find steady employment"
College Junior,2,"Things break all the time and take ages to get fixed.

The rooms are tiny and the furniture is low quality, but whatever it's a dorm.

Residence Life staff is garbage.

If you're a girl, your dorms will be nice and pretty and refurbished.

If you're a boy, you'll be stuck in a horrible decades-old dorm full of destructive loud asshole kids that always smells of cheap body spray full of broken furniture"
College Junior,2,"Tiny chapters, and the members are mostly mindless idiots"
College Freshman,2,"Edgecombe residence hall is one of the nicer dorms because it was newly renovated. Nash, Collins, and Petteway are nasty, you cant control the air condition so the heat stays on until they decide to turn it off, the bathrooms are horrible, and there isnt a lot of room in the rooms themselves. Boddie and Centura residence halls are single dorms, they are pretty nice but you have to pay 1,000 extra a year to stay in them."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the dorms are really old and need some serious work for a private school.
College Sophomore,2,"Rocky Mount is a small town and there is not much to do here.  Raleigh or Greenville has more to offer in regards to shopping, events and recreations."
College Freshman,2,"very bipolar weather.it snows one day, then its nice and sunny, then its storming, and it continues as such"
College Freshman,2,"The faculty gives us ""strict"" rules but they don't really punish those who ignore them. from what i saw, as longs as you don't bring attention to the school in a bad way(involving the media), you wont be in much trouble."
College Freshman,2,"Because the school is so small, Greek Life is also pretty small. we have 2 fraternities and 2 sororities, the largest having 25 members, the second, 16,, third like 8 and the smallest has only 2. But we are growing."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is eh. They used to have a section where you could get international food,but they no longer have that. I tried to stick to vegetarian meals since the meat sometimes could be flavorless or cold."
College Sophomore,2,"The Freshman Dorms Are Not Great – The dorms at this school are a working process. The AC in the first year dorms isn't all that great. Always breaks down. But, it's somewhat understandable given how old the buildings are. How ever, the school offers many great opportunities.they help students when it comes to finding internships and jobs"
College Sophomore,2,"They're Okay – The only sport everyone is into is tennis. But it's hard to be part of it.During orientation they tell you that you can join and learn even if you've never played the sport.WRONG.Tennis is the most important at NC Wesleyan,if you're not amazing they don't want you. The football team doesn't even have their own field,they have to use the one of a nearby high school"
College Sophomore,2,"joining is a popularity contest,doesn't offer equal opportunity"
Recent Alumnus,2,The majority of NC Wesleyans students are a minority.  The school is made up of mostly African American males because of the football team introduced in 2004.
College Junior,2,Co-Ops Offer an Average of Real Experinece – The school will send job announcements to all the student's email address but none of those jobs pertain to my major. So its no good to me.
College Sophomore,2,"Wouldn't Know – I am an adult student who works during the day and takes classes at night. I wouldn't know about the nightlife on campus, but there isn't much to do in town."
Freshman,1,"Horrible experience here! They pick and choose who they want to discipline, and who they'll allow to get away with things. The campus is beautiful, but the administration needs a LOT of work. Most of the professors are okay, and take their job seriously. My advisor was a huge help guiding me and my class choices."
College Sophomore,1,The teaching there in terrible and they only care about sports and have no time to rest and get proper food to eat
College Freshman,1,I just don't think it's what it could be
College Freshman,1,The class sizes are ok but besides that I really dislike this school. They give out false information about lots of things that you would really consider when coming to college. I really dislike everything about this school besides the class ratio.
College Freshman,1,"Our nurse usually just tells us to go to the hospital for almost any problem. Theres has been A LOT of theft and vandalism during the past semester, including soccer feild being trashed and cars being messed with. Honestly, people are aloud to do whatever as long as the news gets involved, then you're out."
College Freshman,1,"The faculty say that there is a bus that comes and pics up students to go into town but during the whole year I've attended, i have not seen the bus once."
College Sophomore,1,There are no parking spots for students .Students are just like the public we cant park across the street. We have to use the side parking in the streets of downtown. We do have a public parking lot down the corner.
Recent Alumnus,1,Campus housing in a few words is run down!  The need severe rentavation and makeovers.  The doors could use a much needed paint job with some matching furniture.  Nothing excessive just cleaned up a bit.
College Senior,1,"Everything Is Reallyyyyy Outdated and Old or Just Too Small – All of the buildings are too small or super old.. like from the 70s!  even with the addition the library, it's still to small, especially if you need a computer!"
College Senior,1,"The classroom buildings are very very stuffy especially in the bathrooms, where there is no AC or heat. In all of my classes there is no central AC which is totally unacceptable for the price we pay to go here. I'm pretty sure there is no heat in the classroom buildings. If you go to class without a jacket in the winter, you'll freeze!  These problems can make it hard to concentrate in class!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Not at Home – Visitors have to be signed in and out as if they are visiting violent prisoners. We are not allowed to choose when we are cold, the heat is only able to be turned on by the college and it has to be under 70 degrees. Students often had to sleep in sweat pants and hoodies. Many bugs, water and wifi issues."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs at Wesleyan – Horrible. The school is working on fixing the problem, but it's still horrible!"

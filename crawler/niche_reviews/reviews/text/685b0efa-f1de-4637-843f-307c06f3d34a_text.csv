Freshman,5,"This school is great, the staff are very dedicated to their jobs and make sure they help in very way they can."
Sophomore,5,"Bay State offers hands on learning that actually correlates to the profession or interests you may have when attending. They also provide many resources such as career fair days, internship connects, and other outlets to help open doors to furthering one's career or fashion. I love Bay State, for the teachers are really willing and dedicated to ensuring the students' success both in the classroom and in the real world. Bay State does their best to prepare each and every student for the work place post graduation. Speaking from my own personal experience, Bay State will not let a single student leave their school with confusion or doubts, their number one priority is to ensure and give their students the best possible chance to succeed in life post college."
Sophomore,5,"In the short time I have been at Bay State, I already feel proud to attend this school and nursing program. The faculty are competent and are well-receiving of our thoughts on the school. I feel very much a part of the community."

Sophomore,5,I am sophomore my major is health care business management Bachelors of science . The school is very nice right in the heart of Boston Massachusetts. The college provide a great education .
Senior,5,"Bay Path has been a life saver for me. It has helped provide me with an opportunity to reach my goal and earn my bachelors degree.  The way the semesters work I am able to take more classes then if I were attending a college with traditional semesters. I am on target to graduate in the spring. I was able to finish my degree in just two semesters. My first semester I took online classes for my first two sessions. I took an on campus course during my third semesters. At first I was nervous and dreaded it. As the class went on, I was able to connect with fellow classmates in a way I never expected.  Everyone was very welcoming and encouraging.  I love the fact that a lot of my classmates are in the same situation as I. I am an adult learner, I work full time, I am a wife, and a mother. Juggling everything all at once is a difficult task, but it is more manageable when I have a great support system."
College Junior,5,Studying Fashion I am able to work with professionals who are too passionate about fashion. The courses are related to your major including academics needed to pass or graduate from your major.
College Junior,5,I have a better understanding of it
College Junior,5,I love it the staff is so helpful and I can talk to my professors about anything
College Freshman,5,The professors are great and personable. They all have experience in their respected fields. The advisors are very involved and care about your academic career.
College Senior,5,There is a good team of academic support that helps students with internships and support about what their careers.
College Junior,5,"The one downfall of the school is that it does not have a library nor study area, therefore it does not encourage students to stay past school hours and dedicate additional time to their studies."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a lot of diversity, and a lot of international students as well. Everyone is very career-driven and unique."
College Junior,5,Love my major (Entertainment Management). It's awesome! Most of the learning is hands on. The professors work or have worked in the field an have many connections. I chose this school because of the major and I'm glad I did.
College Junior,5,"Since the school is located in the city there are easy ways for the school and yourself to get jobs and internships, they have helped me with getting both jobs and internships very quickly."
College Sophomore,5,"Responsibility, Hardworking, Independent – My major is really good when it comes to handling work and being the school that needs to be on top for everything.

That's where the independence comes and try to keep those internships and that is where the hardworking and the responsibility comes as well."
College Sophomore,5,"Sociable, Energetic, Capitivating – The school has a lot of lounges that we can go to and also we have a lot of friends that stay in dorms so it's great! We have a lot of stores we can go to, also a lot of food places and we just have a really good vibe and energy from the students here at Bay State College."
College Senior,5,"One on One – Because Bay State College is such a small school, the teachers give one on one to their students. The classes are small and not intimidating, there for, you're not embarrased to ask questions. And if you don't understand something, the teachers will ask it as many ways as you need to help you understand. They challenge you just enough where you aren't frustrated."
College Junior,5,Bursar's Office – My school participates in the yellow ribbon program and they are very helpful for veterans  returning to school.
Niche User,4,Bay state college faculty were always available for questions and very supportive during distant learning.
Junior,4,I like the class room size not a lot of student com-packed in one class so you can hear the professor and students discuss the class lettuce. Also love the location in the downtown area your able to get the whole city atmosphere.
Junior,4,"In the department that I am obtaining my degree, I have had great professors and not  professors. The environment is great and welcoming on a normal day to day basis. Money wise, it seems to be expensive for really no reason, other than that's because rent is high."
College Junior,4,Bay State College is a great school to learn your degree.
College Junior,4,The first day I mad new friends

College Senior,4,Teachers really provide help with studying materials that help understand the materials.
College Senior,4,I enjoy Bay State for the hands on professors they have teaching us the materials we need for the real world.
College Sophomore,4,I'm a returning student to the school
College Junior,4,"Bay State has a great PTA program. However, there is a big workload and students need to be prepared for it as soon as they come in. The curriculum is great. The internship process is very unorganized and students don't get much of a choice as to where they go. However, the locations for the internships are usually pretty good."
College Junior,4,There are a lot of classes offered at the school. I have liked all of the professors I've had so far. They really care for the students and take extra time to help the students that are struggling during their office hours.
College Junior,4,good small school in the city
College Junior,4,good for a small school and great location.
College Junior,4,I feel I have learned a great deal from my professors.
College Junior,4,Class registration is made easy due to my advisor's help.
College Sophomore,4,"It depends on the major, but the students are very diverse, lots of different kinds of people in each of my classes. Most students are really focused on what they are going to do once they graduate school and are interested in learning about their majors."
College Sophomore,4,It's different because once your in your major they make an outline for you to go by so you get all your classes. You do get alot of work and when i mean work i don't mean homework. I mean like you have to study in order to pass your class.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience has been fun. I have really fun and great roommates who understands privacy. The teachers are assailable when i need them. Nothing in my eye is wrong about the school.
College Sophomore,4,"My experience at this school has always been fun and exciting from day one. All the staff try to help you when ever you need help or if you need someone to talk to. When it come to things like test and homework they are very understandable if you give them a few days or even weeks notice. The people at the school want to see you achieve greatness. 

  The students are very nice as well, i have never met a mean person throughout my schooling here."
College Sophomore,4,Bay State is one of very few schools that offer a PTA program.
College Junior,4,"The professors are amazing and very helpful if you are specific as to what type of professor you are looking for. The curriculum is the same. Class registration process is easy and simple, can be completed either online or in person at the reigstrar's office upon completion of a 1:1 meeting with your academic advisor whom happens to be the dean of the nursing program. The workload is heavy. The professors are great about allotting additional time to help you with special study options."
College Junior,4,"The academic flexibility is great in every aspect. For example, my nursing classes contain students with full time jobs, families, or simply other priorities and the professors and dean are flexible to accommodate every student in every way possible. The transfer of credits process was simple. I transferred a course from a community college into Bay State College."
College Junior,4,"I would rate Sabis International Charter School as one of the best high schools in the Springfield, MA area. The education and curriculum is exceptional and challenging as well as the teachers. I felt over-prepared for college after leaving Sabis."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of hands-on experience in class and in the entertainment field.  The professors in each major really know their stuff, and they care about their students. General scheduling, as well as computer availability, and the gen-ed experience could be better."
College Sophomore,4,Doug Sherman and Tom Corrigan are very helpful in helping you find job openings/building your resume.  They are almost always available as long as you schedule a meeting ahead of time.
College Sophomore,4,"For all courses that are related to your major, you get real-life experience working in your field.  But, most general education classes are taught by professors that are not there (at the school) all of the time, and my hardest time has been with gen-ed professors/courses."
Junior,2,This school is ok. Is  for the people who like to work along. Some professor are friendly and some are not. Most of students are nice and well respected.
College Freshman,2,"This school is extremely expensive, especially for the quality of education we're receiving."
College Junior,2,I think the student body is average. People are friendly but at the Middleboro campus people are coming from their day-time jobs so they mostly want to get in and get their work done. Most people are friendly though and the class discussions are good.
College Freshman,2,"Good Classes. Terrible Experience – This college is very small. It feels like a high shool, good luck if your living on campus! Its basically where the losers come a get a second chance in ""dominating"" a small high school-like atmosphere. the girls here are either valley girls, or freaks. And the guys here are punk-emo rock band or wanna be gangsters. The Location of this school is beautiful. The professor know what they are talking about. Homework load isn't crazy but it isn't non-existing. Laundry on site is awesome! BUT.. Dont live on Campus. If you want the full college experience.. choose a different school. This is a very below standard commuter school. The dorm services suck. Slow Wi-Fi, barely any computers on site, Dusty, cold, and disgusting study rooms. Your not allowed to have a microwave in your room, yet they provide one that barely works and has been burned on the inside prior... Security guards are creeps. Mail is impossible to get. R.A's take every opportunity that get to rat you out. Don't get me started on the food here! It gets everyone in my room sick. either diarrhea or puking. Oh but it gets worse, the people who serve your food&nbsp;play favorites with a couple of old students and faculty. If you are not either prepare to feel unwanted. Everything is so dusty here. Sinuses all semester long. Oh and they provide you with metal military bunk beds, a desk and a closet. Those three things including the room itself is ALL YOU GET. not the only material things you actually get, i mean overall ALL YOU GET out of dorming here. If you are considering this school. good luck! If you are considering dorming here. Re-consider."
Alum,1,"Very disappointed with my experience. The Taunton campus has professors that assign textbooks, but do not use them. Teaching is in the form of a chit-chat. Standards and rubrics do not exist. 
Internships and  job placement were a big draw for me, but did not materialize. For my $60,000 student loan debt, and a perfect GPA, I was given a list of search engines to look for a job. 
A waste of time and money."

Graduate Student,5,VCU is a diverse environment that fosters your creativity and desire to learn. I love it so much that I've stayed for three undergraduate degrees!
Freshman,5,It is going well i actually enjoy online more as it is less of a trouble and they do it in an easy fashion
Niche User,5,Professors at the school of business leveraged both in-person and online learning. The content is always easy to find and video lectures are recorded by the professors themselves. The great thing about it is the ability to connect with your professors via online meetings if needed.
Niche User,5,"VCU is an excellent experience for those who want a balance of a great education and living in a city. The professors in the school of business are incredibly skilled and knowledgeable about what they teach and use real work examples and experiences to bring your educational experience to life. Grading can be tough, but staying on top of your work is the key to your success at VCU."
Senior,5,"It depends on the class, some are in google classroom, zoom, top hat, blackboard collaborate and others just don’t meet."
Freshman,5,"VCU's education is extremely good, I am fully satisfied with all my classes and professors. I am majoring in arts and I appreciate how broad this career is. It is also nice to see the diversity of this school, it makes each student to feel comfortable in it. The campus is very nice and it also offers many helps to students. For example, its library is extremely helpful and available for everyone on campus. VCU is a very goo school that includes everyone and students grow."
Freshman,5,My experience with online school in VCU has been great so far. Teachers make an effort to create online classes in a good way. They are considerate of each student and are making online classes less challenging. I have learned many things from my online classes and I am excited to learn even more.
Junior,5,The online learning experience has been fantastic. I was able to complete a whole course over the summer at home. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Junior,5,"My experience with online classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, has been one of the best school experiences that I had. I am a transfer student and recently transfered from a community college. I can tell the difference in the amount of time and care that is catered to each students individuality and online preferences."
Sophomore,5,"The experience I   have been able to have at VCU has been an eye opener. The first thing that attracted me to this campus was the city and the history that Richmond holds. When I was picking a school, I   knew I wanted a diverse campus. VCU welcomes anyone, it just felt right to attend VCU. I   have grown as a young woman in college, I   have experienced a few humps in the road but  I  was able to get up and grow from my mistakes. One of the biggest transitions that helped me my freshman year was having an Academic Advisor, this is someone who checks in with you every 2 weeks and helps you balance college life but   importantly school work."
Junior,5,I love my school. I met two of my best friends in my freshmen dorm and I am so grateful for them. I really like my teachers and classes. VCU has a very nice and beautiful campus. Richmond in itself has so much to do and love living there. I could not see myself anywhere else.
Junior,5,"I finished my spring semester online and I have also taken summer classes. I did not think I would like to take online classes. However, I really like them. I am able to work on many of my assignments on my own time which is great. My classes are interactive enough where I feel as if I am truly learning. My teachers also email me back very fast which is great."
Junior,5,My online experience with VCU has been great thus far. My professors are kind and are always willing to help. Some of them give very valuable feedback.
Sophomore,5,I HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOING TO VCU ESPECIALLY IN SO MANY AREAS OF INTERNSHIPS.
Sophomore,5,ALL OF THE TEACHERS ARE VERY UNDERSTANDING AND HELPFUL IN EVERY SINGLE SUBJECT AREA. THIS MAKES LEARNING VERY EASY.
Senior,5,I haven't had a whole lot of online experience with VCU but with the few classes I had and the classes that moved online due to the pandemic i felt it was very nice. Zoom was used and it was a great lecture replacement. if there wasnt zoom calls then there were video lectures posted. Professors online also let you move to more of your own pace which was a nice change of pace from Germanna.
Graduate Student,5,I have yet to attend school at VCU but I hope my experience will be excellent and I will be prepared to enter the work force as a therapist.
Graduate Student,5,I will be starting in the fall so I can't answer but so far they have been helpful and friendly.  I believe the faculty are excellent and there a lot of resources for students.
Sophomore,5,"I love the school, lots of diversity on campus. I had a great freshmen year unfortunately it got cut short because of the COVID-19, but the refunded us some of the money."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes through VCU in a purely online format. However, throughout my time at VCU the classes I took would draw upon internet media, as well as other forms of media that were more specific to the area of study. For example, I improved my ear training and composing ability using computer programs that were specifically designed for that purpose."
Alum,5,"Virginia Commonwealth University offers a wide variety of majors, from the Health Sciences to the Arts, VCU ranks among the top colleges in the nation. I majored in Classical Guitar Performance. I believe the music performance education I received at VCU to be on par or better than any other music program out there."
Senior,5,It was so diverse from my hometown and I was not use to the city like. I was able to grow as a person and extend my personal beliefs and views. I love how opening the university was to me no matter what my background was.
Freshman,5,I have not yet started taking online classes at Virginia Commonwealth University but I will take some this fall.
Sophomore,5,VCU is a lively campus filled with knowledgeable professors. The campus is very diverse and offers numerous opportunities to get involved.
Freshman,5,"The professors at VCU did an excellent job to transition classroom to online learning upon the pandemic. Gradings were less strict because they understand that everyone is going through a tough time, the my the gradings were fair. We also had the choice to choose pass/fail instead of the alphabetical grading system if we wish."
Freshman,5,"To me VCU is like a little Brooklyn, NY. The tuition is really reasonable compared to other colleges in America. The teachers, for the most part are actually under stable and want you to succeed, unlike most of my AP teachers. I'm a sociology major and compared to high school, this college is hard enough that you need to put good effort in, but absolutely not impossible. My experience here has been amazing, although I do wish that they give back meal plan money that were not used during the pandemic."
Senior,5,After corona virus everything went online and my professor handled it surprisingly well. I though I would have a lot more difficulties than I did. My professors were really there for me to help manage everything.
Alum,5,"I took a lot of classes online at the end during the pandemic, but the learning curve wasn't too long and the classes were still engaging."
Freshman,5,"Choosing VCU was one of the best decisions I have ever made! It is a place where definitely see diversity and inclusion, it is very open and comforting."
Freshman,5,"I took an online Nutrition course and I loved it! Everything was already laid out for you, there was an agenda with all assignments uploaded, and there were also weekly reminders of what was due for the following week!"
Junior,5,This school has allowed me to go at my own speed and not feel pressured to have a certain amount of credits for each semester. They care more about the student then they do about the grades. They also have a very diverse community which is very important to me since I come from a different background then a lot of the people I know.
Senior,5,"Virginia Commonwealth University gave me a life, stable relationships, education, and strength. Throughout my education, the courses at VCU, and my hands-on experiences, I can enhance my career applications from past experiences including laboratory work, patient care, child care, and working as an assistant for various health specialists. I love the diverse culture everytime I walk on campus. Smiles, greeting, and support from my peers encourages my every day. I love going to class. Professors at VCU do really care about us and our future. They were patient with me and worked with me until I am well prepared."
Senior,5,All my professors helped me finished strong. I know they were stressed as well since they were helping hundreds of students but they manage to keep everyone on task. They were willing to help me every day until I understand the materials. They are dedicated and supportive.
Sophomore,5,I loved VCU and I can not wait to go back for my second year. I did have a rocky start when I got assaulted because I went somewhere off campus at a late time.
Freshman,5,"I love VCU!  You can’t go wrong here.  The students, classes, professors and city of Richmond are great!  The freshmen dorms are all good.  The dining hall needs a little improvement, but there are plenty of places to eat on the dining plan. Online classes have been good, but can’t wait to go back in the fall!"
Junior,5,The campus at VCU is absolutely beautiful and the staff is extremely nice and helpful. all of the classes are well put together and the professors are well versed in their area of studies.
Graduate Student,5,"I love VCU because of diversity! I have currently a lot of international friends who are from different countries. VCU has many opportunities for students who want to attend various international events. Teachers are kind, nice, and friendly, they are ready for supporting/helping students anytime."
Sophomore,5,"VCU is a great university that has a diverse culture. The college is integrated with the city of Richmond, which allows the students to feel like they are a part of the community."
Graduate Student,5,I have liked the education and the teacher in the rehab counseling program. I would like to see more scholarships and lower costs for the program.
Sophomore,5,"I personally haven't went to the school yet. But I will be attending for the Fall 2020 semester. I believe that the semester will be filled with new experiences and new lessons. And for that, I believe that VCU is a great school."
Alum,5,"Amazing school! My whole time here was great all-around. People sometimes feel like they are settling by going to VCU instead of other historical schools in the state, but then they get here and realize how amazing it is. You get a great education from some of the top professors."
Freshman,5,I haven't yet attended the college but from the way they stay connected with the freshman I've thoroughly enjoyed them. They make me feel secured and informed. I've also made relationships with my roommate and they also mad that possible for me. So I couldn't be more happy with my decision.
Freshman,5,VCU's academic resources are top tier. It's very easy to get assistance in anything you are struggling with.
Freshman,5,"I like that VCU is very diverse, there is something for everyone. You will always be able to find a friend because the people and the professors are all so friendly. The professors all seem interested not just in you passing the class but also in your well-being. Many time they are willing to wait and talk with you after class to answer questions. I also like the campus, it does not even feel like you are at school when you actually are."
Freshman,5,"I am a current freshman at VCU and I have loved every second of it. Unlike my high school, VCU has one of the most inclusive and diverse student bodies I have ever seen. All the professors, especially the ones in my arts foundation programs, are very passionate and encouraging. The dorms are cozy and inviting while campus facilities offer a wide range of places to study, relax, and exercise. Since campus is situated in the heart of Richmond there are plenty of networking opportunities to take advantage of. The city is also rich in culture and history making sure you always have something to explore and immerse yourself in."
Sophomore,5,Virginia Commonwealth University is an extremely diverse campus and allows students to grow as individuals. VCU has many different programs and clubs to keep students connected to each other on campus and off campus.Located in the heart of Richmond there is always something to do around the area. You'll never get bored. VCU and MCV pride themselves with their impeccable academics as courses prepares students for their future career. VCU also has a wide range of majors and minors to chose from
Senior,5,"I loved the instructors and the students I worked with as I was taking my courses. I enjoyed the course content, and I felt it was challenging."
Freshman,5,"Amazing campus! It has the perfect size, not too small and not too small, very homey! The gym is the second biggest in the country, and all the university is in an amazing location, you can do lots in the weekend, like going hiking in the mountains or Washington D.C.! The employees are incredibly kind and helped me so much when applying there. The dorms are awesome too!"
Niche User,5,I like that Virginia Commonwealth University is only a couple hours from my home and that they have the major that I would like to study in college. Virginia Commonwealth University offers a large selection of majors so that many people can attend their school and I like  that about them. This school is hopefully the school I will be attending in the fall of 2021.
Freshman,5,"It's a great school and the people there are friendly. They have a lot of good programs to choose from and even if you don't know exactly what you want to do, there are people to help you make a decision based off your hobbies."
Niche User,5,Amazing campus and nice people. Virginia Commonwealth university has amazing and great major for the science field and the medical field.
Junior,5,"I like that there are a vast amount of resources available to help students that find difficulty handling class material whether it is simply getting help with time management, tutoring, or tips for stress relief."
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere is amazing and different from usual college campuses. The urban campus always has something for you to do
Freshman,4,I really love vcu it provides students with the correct amount of resources and other things. The only thing that isnt the best is anything technical is not their strong suit but it still is a good college that I can proudly recommend
Alum,4,"VCU made me a more independent individual. I grew as a person outside of the classrooms mainly because it's in a major city. Life off and on campus was an experience I will never forget. Specifically, classes were difficult and 8am classes are not for everyone. Parties were regular, but VCU wasn't cheap so putting classes before extracurricular activities is a must. I did however love my experience in the dorms and making lifelong friends at VCU was easy. You see new faces every day for the whole time you are at VCU. It really has its own culture."
Freshman,4,despite the pandemic right now the campus life is pretty awesome!!! The campus is in the city which i absolutely love and they have so many historical landmarks.
Freshman,4,Its pretty good the teacher are qualified and the learning environment is comfortable. social distancing has been implemented and the university is keeping the amount of corona cases down.
Senior,4,"It’s really nice in Richmond, the only thing that bothers me is that VCU does not have plus or minus system for the gpa."
Junior,4,"The courses are outstanding. The location (downtown Richmond, Virginia) is not the best. There is much crime in downtown Richmond, especially since all of the riots began this past summer. The housing situation is not very good either. It is over-crowded, and most of buildings are run-down. 

However, the professors are excellent. They are easily approachable, and provide very good guidance. I communicate with my professors on a regular basis. 

Overall, the school has provided me with the education in mathematics that I am pursuing. 

Thank you."
Graduate Student,4,It was an adjustment but they did their best to make it as smooth as possible. We still had tons of access to our professor and information. zoom classes were fun
Alum,4,"My program at VCU was really rigorous for an undergrad, but it was a great experience; I learned a lot and felt very prepared to sit for boards and to enter my field."
Sophomore,4,"I love VCU, it's in the heart of Richmond City, and coming here to studying is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I love the atmosphere, the diversity of the students, and the energy of the ""Ramily"". Even though it is largely a commuter school, the campus is still alive on the weekends which is rare for most commuter schools that i've seen where the weekends are usually quiet but not VCU."
Sophomore,4,Love the atmosphere and learning experience in the city. Can't complain about professors and classes so far!
Sophomore,4,"I originally was taking all of my classes in person, but when the school closed for quarantine and classes were moved online the professors did an excellent job of reaching out to students and keeping us updated, preparing lectures or having online class meetings and setting up virtual office hour to make sure we were able to still be successful. online classes did not affect my ability to fully learn the material."
Sophomore,4,"When there was a shift to online classes for Spring 2020 semester, my professors were all over the place in terms of setting a plan for how students will be assessed. But, as weeks went by they become more settled in a plan. This was all understandable considering the timeline and circumstances for changing gears. For Summer 2020 I took an online course for SLWK 230 and my professor was articulate in the syllabus from the start and class ran very smoothly and was understanding of each students needs. It will be interesting to see how online courses will be set-up come Fall 2020."
Sophomore,4,"Overall a decent experience thus far. I am currently a second year and hoping to graduate in three years overall. My advisor has helped me very much to navigate this process. Professors are very willing to have a conversation with their students so long as students initiate the conversation. Fellow students are very welcoming and kind, most of the time. Can't wait for the semesters to come!"
Sophomore,4,I would like to see more of the money that the school receives find its way into the buildings and facilities for students
Junior,4,I am a new transfer student at this university and already they have shown so much care in how they handle their students.
Sophomore,4,"Having online classes through VCU were very challenging but I  was able to push through. VCU kept every parent and student in the loop of what was happening with online schooling and reminding us that we are not alone. I  was still able to meet with my tutors, advisors and professors. The only difference was not being face to face. VCU made sure students had smooth transition and reminded us that they are going to make sure every student succeeds even into these difficult times."
Sophomore,4,"I love my professors and my classes, but when we were sent home due to COVID-19, the university was stingy with their government provided money and hardly distributed any to the students as they should have."
Sophomore,4,"All of my online classes have gone fairly well so far. With transferring all classes to an online-format this past semester, all of my professors have been really accommodating."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Virginia Commonwealth University. So far, my experience has been good. This schools offers lots of different classes, is very diverse, and the city of Richmond brings a lot to the experience."
Freshman,4,"While the campus is located in the middle of Richmond city, which isn't the safest place, everyone is extremely friendly. It's also a known fact that this school is also very diverse. Personally, I am not doing well in this school because of the sudden transition between High school and college life. Because of the sudden transition, I am now living by myself. Because I was never really an ""Independent"" person, my grades crashed. But because there are helpful courses and advisors, I am willing to change and push harder. These supportive people are really motivating me and I am not going to let them and myself down in the next semester."
Senior,4,I've been at VCU for a year now and I love it there. They care about their students and want to make sure everyone gets the best education and stay's safe during this pandemic. There isn't a lot of school spirit but I personal love it there. There is so much to do right there in the city and even if you're out late you always feel safe.
Junior,4,"VCU is a diverese schoool where you have many opportunities in whatever field you choose. I personally think our arts and health sciences department are amazing.  VCU is not a traditional college town because it is in the middle of Richmond, but I love he city because there are countless things to do."
Freshman,4,"I just enrolled at VCU and although there were issues due to COVID and not being able to have an in person orientation, they are having each student enroll in an online orientation that is helping me understand the university."
Freshman,4,"It has been hard to get ahold of someone on their office of admissions number, however, when we got ahold of someone, they were very nice and helpful."
Freshman,4,I have not yet started taking online classes at Virginia Commonwealth University but I will take some this fall.
Sophomore,4,Professors are very flexible and understanding when teaching courses online. All the classes I've had online have been very clear and organized.
Freshman,4,There is a lot of diversity. You will hear many different languages and the people come from all walks of life. The art program is phenomenal but challenging. Be ready to be thrown into things you have never even heard of before!
Junior,4,"As a VCUArts student, I loved and genuinely enjoyed Art Foundation (AFO) in my freshman year because the program forces you out of your comfort zone in creativity and allows you to explore a wide variety of concepts, mediums, and skills. I moved onto the Graphic Design department, and felt the department curriculum was well structured and faculty were very supportive when I struggled."
Sophomore,4,Virginia Commonwealth University was actually my first choice and it was everything I expected it to be.
Junior,4,"I've had a great experience so far! I've made great friends, a number of my classes have been pretty fun, and most of my professors are great!"
Senior,4,"I really like VCU. I am still getting to know people so its a little rough. The cafeteria really isn't the best, but besides that VCU is a nice to go to school, Richmond is beautiful"
Alum,4,"It was a good school, their engineering program is great and the professors want to see you succeed post graduation. Career services was always very helpful and involved."
Alum,4,Excellent Staff and studio opportunities. I had an amazing experience in the art school and I loved the city. The studio amenities and settings were awesome for creative production during the program. My teachers did a good job of challenging me in my art visually and conceptually. Unfortunately there is not a lot of guidance for what to do with your art degree after graduating. A lot of the senior seminar felt dated.
Alum,4,I did not take any online classes. As an art major our classes were all on campus and we had to work in studio to finish work for in person critiques. I had a decent experience with the VCU eservices. They made it pretty easy to check updates on my account and stay informed about scholarships and campus events.
Sophomore,4,VCU has much to offer to every student that attends. I love the diversity within the school itself. I have gotten to learn about many different cultures from the many students I have met. It is truly amazing when you get to meet students from different backgrounds because you get to hear their opinions and perspectives on various topics.  As a transfer student it was very reassuring to enter a school that welcomes and accepts students from all walks of life.
Junior,4,"VCU is a way better school than some people make it out to be. Just because it has a high acceptance rate does not mean it's a bad school. In fact, in my experience, there are tons of great professors and great classes. The campus is awesome, especially if you like city life and being able to walk to most places. VCU students also get to ride the bus for free.

VCU also has a diverse community and overall the students (and professors) are really friendly. The library is good too, if that ever opens up again.

I'd say that some things I'm not too excited about with VCU is the meal plan - there really isn't as much variety as they advertise, especially if you have food restrictions. If you have the choice, just don't get a meal plan, because there are plenty of good food options around campus, and honestly it'll probably cost less in the long run."
Sophomore,4,"Onlin learning has been inconsiderate of the bigger situation going on in the world, however most of my professors produced organized and easy work."
Freshman,4,"I had one online class last semester and it was good. Then we had to finish the semester online and that worked out ok too. I do like being on campus and taking classes in person, but taking one or two a semester is good."
Junior,4,It’s a nice campus that is very well organized. Good Professors and tutoring that is ready to help. Great school.
Junior,4,It’s a nice campus that is very well organized. Good Professors and tutoring that is ready to help. Great school.
Freshman,4,"I throughly have enjoyed my time at VCU, not only are there plenty of clubs and organizations offered, but it's genuinely one of the most diverse colleges around here. The food and student life at VCU consist of many different cultures and as an Asian-American, it's very much appreciated. The professors and staff are willing to help you succeed and the variety of courses are great. VCU also has some of the best arts and pre-health programs."
Freshman,4,"Virginia Commonwealth University is in the middle of Richmond, which provides lots of activities, scenery, and museums to visit and be a part of. Moreover, the campus and people in it are very diverse and understanding. The academics could be a little more student centered. I also wished that they had more jobs and opportunities for internships as well."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at VCU. The campus and Richmond area is a great place to live, the students and professors are amazing, and the overall atmosphere makes for a great choice to spend your college years."
Junior,4,Virginia Commonwealth is an amazing school to further your education. The faculty and staff are all nice and respectful and the school makes me feel like home.
Niche User,4,I was admitted to VCU and currently committed. First time I walked around campus I noticed the diversity and great communication between students. I got to see that there are many different personalities and many activities to do. And the attention the school staff gives you is incredible.
Freshman,4,"VCU is an incredibly diverse school, with a very artsy environment in the middle of Richmond. They have an incredible arts program with some of the best professors you could ask for. They have a lot of opportunities to get involved in the school and feel apart of the community."
Freshman,4,"My first year at Virginia Commonwealth University has its ups and downs like any college freshman. There were doubts and struggles but I always found something/someone there who could lift my spirits or offer me the help I needed. One thing I think VCU can do better is split their anatomy course into two semesters. A lot of other Universities do this so students can actually retain information and not rush through everything. Other than that, VCU has a lot to offer within the city of Richmond. There is always something to do, a club to join, or a professor to talk to."
Alum,4,My tenure at VCU was excellent! My major was Exercise Science and ALL of the professors were more than willing to help if you did your work and attended class. My only complaint with VCU is the lack of funding for the science building as its extremely old and smells funny. MCV campus also has WAU better food than the main campus.
Sophomore,4,"I really love VCU's diversity and ability to grow here! You meet so many people from all walks of life, getting a feel for how to interact with people in the real world. They have many resources at students disposal to achieve the success they desire. However, as a computer science major it is difficult to get out of class tutoring. They recently started offering tutoring classes for coding, which I really appreciate as the curriculum can be difficult to learn at times. One area I really find lacking is with advisors. Talking with friends and other classmates, the most their able to do is enroll you in classes, give advice on life difficulties, and point your questions to another department to ask. I find this quite unhelpful as that department normally tells me to go to another department and I end up going in circles. It would be much more helpful for them to be able to call or email someone right then and there to get a direct answer on what actions to take."
Freshman,4,"Virginia Commonwealth University is surrounded by the beautiful city of Richmond Virginia, Offering plenty of opportunities for students to volunteer and impact the local community. VCU prides itself on diversity and ensures inclusivity amongst its students."
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed being apart of the VCU family these past two years. In high school I knew I wanted to continue my education but had no idea where I wanted to go. VCU was my first stop on campus stores and I remember asking my mom for a t-shirt and her telling me, ""now we're not going to get one at every school,"" and I said, ""I know."" I knew from the first time I stepped foot on campus that this school was for me. I love the real aspect of college life in the city. I started working at the university gym my freshman year, I believe that has helped make my experience here what it has been. I have grown so much as an individual, student, professional, and person since moved to Richmond. I truly feel like I have found my forever family here in Richmond. I have never experienced such school pride before enrolling with Virginia Commonwealth University."
Alum,4,I loved completing my undergraduate degree in Religious Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. The architecture of the old buildings around Richmond provide a historic and homey feel to the campus. My professors were dedicated to bringing out the best in their students and I was able to obtain an internship followed by a full time position as an archaeologist from my VCU network. You will be hard to find another university that has quite as much diversity and inclusion as VCU. Go Rams!
Senior,4,Great place to attend college!! I've been going here for about a year now and I love how diverse it is!
Junior,4,Throughout these three years at VCU I have been pretty pleased with how things have been going. I live off campus so the only time I am around the school setting is when I have classes myself. The classes are pretty straightforward and I hadn't had any trouble whatsoever with any staff or student while attending. The people around VCU are so helpful and outgoing
Freshman,4,"Virginia Commonwealth University is an institution located in the heart of Richmond Virginia. I was initially worried that the place wouldn’t feel like a proper campus at first and access to nature would be limited, but my intuition was disproven rather quickly. The city doesn’t get in the way of the campus, it blends rather well, and the James River provides the opportunity for adventure near campus. 

All of my professors thus far have been very enthusiastic about what they are teaching, and supplementary education is very accessible, as it is already included in the bill. Many (maybe 1000+, don’t quote me on this) student led clubs exist, each fulfilling their own specific niche. 

 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday classes have 10 minute travel spaces, making it difficult to get to class on time if you have lectures  back to back on the opposite sides of campus. Food is okay, but I wouldn’t call it great. Healthy options are available but not in abundance."
Sophomore,4,I am in the VCUarts Theatre program as a stage manager and I love my professor! Great school if you are interested in the arts!
Sophomore,4,Virginia Commonwealth University has always been my #1 school to attend. What I love most about VCU is how much I learn and gain from my major. I am currently majoring in Photography and Film and this experience has allowed me to blossom in ways I've never imagined in such little time.
Sophomore,4,"The experience here so far is overall pretty positive. It's hard to really rate something like this experience due to the huge range of factors that could contribute to it. But with that being said, being a part of the art program has provided so much industry readiness and general skill improvement that it leaves me awaiting the future. The faculty I've interacted with are wonderful and are really looking to push you and make you a better artist and person."
Niche User,4,"I like that this college is in the city, it really gives the students a great chance to get more involved locally while creating amazing friends."
Junior,2,VCU uses Blackboard and is transitioning to Canvas. It is very confusing because some professors are on Blackboard and some are on Canvas and it is hard to keep track of the classes and I have never used Blackboard.
Junior,2,"I was able to get my work done and get good grades. However, it was very hard to know when something was due and when it was due and it was harder to learn the material."
Niche User,2,"I did not take any courses online, but this survey won't let me skip this section and instead is making me write 100 characters about online courses that I didn't take. The end."
Sophomore,2,A huge school with an overwhelming amount of Pre-med students. I found it difficult to feel welcomed or supported. Others had better experiences but I feel that it lacks a lot. Also not a fan of the open campus and advisors can be extremely harsh.
Junior,2,Virginia commonwealth university may seem like its a awesome school and in some ways it it but with constant tuition rises that I personally feel are not being used to better the student experience I have to ask what are you doing with are money?
Senior,2,Feels like a factory. I go to class and go home. The professors don’t care and their mission to improve education.
Junior,2,"It's a great school, if you're ready to challenge yourself. However, it's just not worth it. I pay all this money for nothing. The professors don't care about you. I just wish this school lived up to its reputation of being a great school."
Junior,2,VCU academic is great but there programs and event suck. you don't hear anything that going on unless you know people and it makes it hard for some to get involved.
Senior,2,"My freshman housing experience was awful. I was placed (along with a couple hundred other students) on the medical campus, which is a 20 minute bus ride from the rest of campus, where all of my classes and activities were. After 4 years in the school of engineering, I am still no closer to my degree than I was 2 years ago as a result of poor advising. With that said, a lot of people love VCU, it just wasn't a good match for me."
Freshman,2,"The University has so much money, yet they can't provide adequate housing for students. The housing lottery is a joke so do not expect to get on campus  housing after your first year. Not that it is worth it anyway because it's cheaper to live off campus ad get the same benefits."
Freshman,2,"The environment of Richmond is terrible, as well as the crime, the air quality, and the economy. Only a few classes were engaging, and the dorms were mediocre. Wouldn't recommend going here."
College Junior,2,The dorms are discusting and too small. They are barely clean and when moving they expect the place to be so much cleaner than you received it. Housing for non freshman is difficult to get unless you're in a specific major.
College Sophomore,2,You don't really see enough internship opportunities at VCU. Most students have to go elsewhere to get internships and part-time jobs.
College Sophomore,2,"Personally, I feel like VCU Police doesn't do enough to make students feel safe whatsoever. So much more could be done, but just hasn't been."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life isn't exactly popular at VCU. Only 7% of the school population is involved in Greek life and half of the ones who are involved don't even like it after a while.
College Junior,2,"On the social level, my freshman experience with on campus housing was great. I made a whole bunch of long lasting friends. Speaking to many of my peers, however, I gather that my experience was not the norm. Many people were vastly more isolated than myself in the dorms.

More importantly than the mixed social experience, I have to comment on the abysmal handling of housing for new students this year. VCU doesn't have the facilities to house all of its new students. Its solution was to deny housing to a huge chunk of incoming freshman, including people (so I have heard) who should have been guaranteed housing."
College Junior,2,"I don't know enough about people who pay for their friends to adequately comment on them, however, I don't hold them in high esteem."
College Sophomore,2,"When living in the residence hall last year, all of us were all freshman, which means we were all underage, but a lot of girls were drunk at 3 in the morning."
College Junior,2,"I don't know much about it, but theyre bascially the worst people an highly disrespected amongst non members"
College Freshman,2,"Only 1-2 dorms are decent and the rooms are very small in all. Also very very expensive, not worth the price."
College Freshman,2,"Underage drinking and marijuana use is very common among students. There are stores that actively sell alcohol without carding. Marijuana is not difficult to acquire, but the use of both are not tolerated in the dorms whatsoever. On only a few occasions have I passed someone carrying an open bottle or smoking weed on the street. The usage peaks every week and dwindles down in the beginning of the week."
College Freshman,2,No one outside of those involved in Greek life really care or like it.
College Freshman,2,I have had a bad experience with dorms so far. Living with five other roommates is a struggle. No one ever does their chores and there are always disagreements and arguments.
College Freshman,2,We are in the city...what do you expect
College Freshman,2,"There are various issues with the current dorm I'm residing in, including mold, plumbing issues, and noisiness of other students, especially during finals week."
College Freshman,2,There are tons of stories that go unheard of.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are pretty gross and over priced. They have way too many rules. Also, Cabaniss is really annoying and not convenient at all. Taking the bus to class and to see my friends is a hassle and I hate it. The housing application is weird and make sure you turn it in before 12 that day or else it's late."
College Freshman,2,Dorms are very small and outdated. Elevators are extremely slow.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is very insignificant on campus and typically only mentioned in regards to parties.
College Freshman,2,"Peer pressure low, usage is high, rules are strict."
College Freshman,2,Already hoping to transfer after my first semester here.  Not challenging at all.  Seems like a glorified high school.  Strongly do not recommend.
College Freshman,2,The police presence on campus stop people from having parties.
College Freshman,2,"I am in the very frustrating ""middle-class"" bracket, the one that on paper looks like my parents can afford to pay $10,000 a semester, but in reality that is just ridiculous. It feels they are just using that as an excuse to not give me money for my education. I was told that if went to school, and got good grades, I could go to school and the school would even help me pay for it."
College Sophomore,2,"Crap, all i can say"
College Sophomore,2,"I personally, did not receive substantial funds for my aid."
College Sophomore,2,The meal plan isn't that great because food isn't prepared to the best. The price and portions are unfair while rollover swipes/ dining dollars are nonexistent.
College Freshman,2,They read the numbers wrong.
College Sophomore,2,"Scholarships are only accessible to new students, not continuing"
College Sophomore,2,"The people can be rude. The financial aid ""generalists"" do not like to cooperate and claim to know just as much as an actual advisor. Most of the time I've dealt with them I have had to come back to financial aid multiple times becaise they gave me bad instructions the first second or third time."
College Freshman,2,"VCU Police should stop trying to arrest students for having alcohol in their dorms and start doing something about all the sexual assault that occurs on campus. The two are not related, regulating alcohol wont affect the numbers of rape on campus. I come from a country where the drinking age is 18 and you don't hear about girls getting violated every other weekend. Why do I see people loosing housing for substance abuse and not sexual abuse?"
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are pretty awful. They're expensive and loud and not particularly clean. The roommate matching service is horrible and the lottery isn't much better.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid office is the worst. They give you very little aid aside from student loans and take forever to process outside scholarships. They are usually fairly unhelpful and uncaring of most issues.
College Junior,2,"I understand they want students to be safe and do not want any weapons on campus, but I feel I should be able to protect myself when I am downtown at night leaving class."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is pretty frowned upon by everyone that isn't in greek life. Personally I don't care to be in it but I also might rush a few places next semester.
College Sophomore,2,"You're in Richmond, walking alone at night is not exactly a smart thing to do"
College Sophomore,2,The staff at a lot of the eats are pretty rude. Housing won't help you if you have an issue.
College Freshman,2,Safety is a huge issue in the city but that's expected. Police take necessary measures to ensure the students' safety.
College Freshman,2,"The campus housing is completely unacceptable. There have been several accounts of roaches, black mold, and many other disgusting living complaints."
College Freshman,2,The education here is probably not as bad as community college. However I do not feel like I am getting a higher education nor the education I am paying for.
College Sophomore,2,The school is a loan based school so they don't even bother to sit down and help you figure out options. and they are evry cold and uncaring.
College Senior,2,It's not easy to get financial aid here. It seems to be stigmatized towards international and out of state students more than students who live here. I recommend searching other scholarship sites for outside help.
College Junior,2,"I am 27, married, and out-of-state.  It's very expensive and every time I try to apply for financial aid they assume that my parents are going to help out a lot with the cost, which is not the case.  What is offered doesn't cover all of my tuition and I have been denied in-state status, even though I have fulfilled everything asked.  It's beyond frustrating."
College Senior,2,"My financial aid for my sophomore/junior year of college was excellent. However, my junior/senior was barely enough money to cover tuition. I kept my GPA high to try to receive grants, especially a VGAP, which they did not provide me with which is causing a major problem with paying for school."
College Sophomore,2,Sometime the school is a little too strict. It gets annoying.
College Sophomore,2,"It floods badly, and forget about class in snow"
College Sophomore,2,"I undertan some things take time, but the financial aid department kept losing papers that I had already turned in. When I needed help some of the advisors had an attitude and didn't seem like they were there for the right reasons. They never got back to me, so I had to basically is it the financial aid department everyday just to push towards some answers as to what was taking so long. For get me wrong there were a few advisors that were nice and helpful and I appreciate them, but VCU definitely needs to reevaluate these people."
College Junior,2,"I don't know much about the Greek life here, but I have heard stories. Although hazing isn't allowed anymore, I still feel like some of the things they make them do, might as well be called ""hazing""."
College Senior,2,The few times I have dealt with the Financial Aid office it went OK...but I wasn't able to receive any financial aid for a study abroad I wanted to participate in.
College Sophomore,2,It took me forever to get financial aid. I don't know why it was so difficult for me
College Sophomore,2,"Very cheap, but also not very safe"
Sophomore,1,"Online learning could be done on your own. Theres nothing about it that warrants the 1,000+ dollars that it costs."
Sophomore,1,The online experience wasn't very good. Students as well professors had internet problems and it was very difficult trying to get the work done.
Niche User,1,"While I was a student in 2008 - 2010, a major issue I faced was the people I was surrounded by. My roommate was a toxic person - examples included having sex in our dorm room while we were sleeping, defaulting on rent payments on our apartment because she dropped out and ran off to live with a boyfriend, stealing my phone to go through it, lying and manipulating, etc. Another time I came to class, started to feel horribly sick with the flu, and another student berated me for wanting to leave early (professor said nothing). Due to my trying to juggle my roommate, heavy workloads, a work-study job, and some family issues, I was struggling academically. One professor pulled me aside about my performance in her class and sneeringly asked if I was struggling because I'd ""broken up with a boyfriend or something."" I wish I had more room to write here, but it was such an awful experience that I ended up transferring to RU three years into my education. I couldn't take it at VCU anymore."
Freshman,1,"VCU presents an image of a diverse campus that caters towards all potential student's obstacles. However, they are not inclusive and treat their students as opportunities for money. The student's voices are not heard."
Alum,1,"The fact is that this school advertises itself as something which it simply isn't. It tries to market itself as a ""top-tier public research university"" when it is anything but that. The ""main campus"" is literally just 4 buildings: the library, the gym, the commons, and the cafeteria. All of the other buildings are where classes are held - but most of them are old and moldy. Everything is constantly under construction. The education is hit or miss. It varies greatly by department and is always more difficult than it needs to be because of the lack of faculty organization. Parking is awful and expensive. Tuition rises by $700-$1000 every year. The dining plan has very limited food options. Housing is very hard to find on AND off campus. The crime rate is high and you'll get daily e-mails about a shooting, armed robbery, burglary, sexual assault, etc. happening on campus. Pretty much all parts of the city with the exception of the fan and the compass are unsafe."
College Freshman,1,"VCU housing is so bad, especially for freshman, I stayed in Gladding Residence Center my freshman year and it was just awful. The rooms were so crowded and there was mold everywhere which made me develop awful allergies, I was sick almost everyday! There was always something wrong, either the toilet would clog or the stove wouldn't work, there was always something, and we had a huge pest problem, it was so gross and we were paying almost $7000 for that dorm. It was so ridiculous and not worth your money at all! VCU has all this money but can't provide proper dorms for us. Thats why I am living off campus for my sophmore year, and the guest policies are so annoying"
College Freshman,1,"Because VCU is located in an urban setting, their always is some sort of crime or incident going on, such as shootings and burglaries, which create a dangerous setting for students to be around."
College Freshman,1,I just think greek life is pointless
College Senior,1,Thank God I am not part of greek life that would have meant.
College Sophomore,1,"Only a few options for ""swiping"" during the day and EVERYTHING is unhealthy."
College Freshman,1,"Housing has been a nightmare for me, mostly because I live in Cabaniss Hall and all of my classes are 30 minutes away. I don't understand why the school is even allowing freshmen to live on MCV when NO freshmen take classes on MCV, it's a campus almost entirely for graduate students. It puts me at a disadvantage with everyone else in my classes, I have to get up an hour earlier than everyone else to get things done. Maybe life would be easier if RamRide ran later than 9PM on weekends or maybe if RamSafe was actually reliable."
College Freshman,1,"I could probably count the number of places that I can use my VCU ID with my fingers, there's a lot of restaurants around campus that I can go to, but if I'm forced to get a meal plan I'm going to use it, oh but wait, I've already gone to Shafer 5 times this week and 7 times to Canes/IHOP. And the only place where I feel like swipes are truly worth it is in Johnas but most people don't live on MCV like I do. I'm not sure how much of a roll the school plays in which off-campus restaurants take swipes or not, but if there were more, I'd maybe consider getting a dining plan next semester. But with my current options there's no way."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office here is absolutely awful.
College Freshman,1,"I'm not affiliated with Greek life, but I've been to parties at some of them. I've heard of many huge issues that have come out of the Greek life at VCU including assaults (both physical and sexual) and drugging. Both myself and people I know have seen these issues first hand. Frat parties here are what they are, which are textbook excuses for frat parties and nothing more interesting than that."
College Junior,1,I had to constantly request information about transfer and change of major. I even had to hand deliver my paperwork after it sat for two weeks from initially turning in to engineering department.
College Sophomore,1,"Living on campus (at least the upperclassman dorms) is the WORST decision you can make. You will pay a lot more money living here to live no closer to your classes then any of the apartments about a block away. You will pay more money to share a bedroom and bathroom than it would be for most 1 bedroom apartments. If you have an issue with housing good luck getting it solved, they stop caring about you as soon as your contract goes into effect. Once that happens you become screwed because they will not let you break it without paying the entire balance for the rest of the year. LIVE OFF CAMPUS, do not even think about living in the upperclassman dorms, it is probably the worst mistake I've ever made."
College Freshman,1,"Anything coming from VCU including money was a pain to get. The most money I got was from the state. But when I went to the financial aid office to see if they could help me with the rest of my cost all they said was ""there is nothing i can do about that."""
College Sophomore,1,I find it a bit annoying that scholarships/grants are based off parental income when my parents do not support me financially for my academics.
College Junior,1,"This year the process dragged on and on until finally I got my package. It took them over 3 weeks to review one document less than 50 words. They also don't update E services in a timely manner. You find out things quicker when you call them. Instead of waiting for them to update Eservices on the status of your financial aid process (which they advise you to do). They gave me the bare minimum package - nothing but federal loans for my aid. I'm an out-of-state student with high need. I received much more aid in previous years. My need was definitely not met. Only 5.6% of students get their need fully met. (Collegeboard.com) If you don't have any scholarship money or no way to get additional loans, be very weary. This school doesn't have much money. (Even though they're renovating Cabell library...)"
College Sophomore,1,"The most common form of precipitation is rain and because the land is rather flat, there are many annoyingly large puddles to walk around when going to and from class. Moreover, the geographical position of VCU campus protects it from the extreme weather conditions near the area - this in turn leads to VCU being the only campus in the region that doesn't close during adverse weather conditions."
College Junior,1,I just transferred for the winter and the school doesn't care at all if it's 50 below and the snow is up to your knees. It really pissed me off that I still had to risk my life to go to class in the freezing cold ice and snow and I ended up ripping my favorite pair of jeans because I slipped and fell on a patch of ice and tore up my knee.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office tends to be a stressful bunch to deal with. At first I though it may only be my unique situation but i know other students that constantly complain about the financial aid service from our school. I just think that they need to be more considerate for the struggle that the current generation of students have to go through in order to completely pay for school.
College Freshman,1,"Shafer is our only dining hall and it is terrible, and other food options on campus are fast food. "
College Sophomore,1,"Campus dining just feels unhealthy and although there are efforts to make it more so, the fact that food is often cold and visually not fresh is off-putting. "
College Freshman,1,"specifically talking about the campus internet, it is the worst thing ive ever used."
College Freshman,1,It's hard to find parking and it is very expensive.
College Freshman,1,They over charge for the meal swipes. 
College Sophomore,1,Drugs and alcohol aren't that visible. Every once and a while a freshman will have one to many and get reckless and get arrested or kicked out of school.
College Sophomore,1,"parking is horrible. its downtown, so the only parking is street parking or deck parking which has a high price. If you cant parallel park you are out of luck. If you stay in a spot past 2 minutes of your meter, you will get a ticket or towed for sure. The parking police dont play."
College Freshman,1,The permit cost is outrageous for a semester. The ticket enforcers mark your tires when they are clean and shiny. The cost of tickets are outrageous too.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is TERRIBLE if you don't have a parking pass. This makes it difficult for visitors to find spaces to park in for more than two hours.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is pretty horrible unless you get a parking pass.
College Sophomore,1,This isnt so much the university's fault but the location it's expected when downtown richmond is right around the corner and there are hobos everywhere you look
College Junior,1,You'll get a ticket in a minute. Parking is rough in the city. You mostly have to pay if you don't want to be searching everywhere for a parking spot. And parking is expensive.
College Sophomore,1,God luck finding parking on Richmond's busy city streets especially broad st
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Virginia Commonwealth University stinks. There will be days where there is no parking or the parking is limited outside of the parking garages. In order to park in the parking garages one has to buy a parking pass and can only park in specific garages. Outside of the garages one can park on the street where one has to either pay to park, or is only allowed a certain period of time to park in the spot."
College Freshman,1,This campus is super super strict when it comes to drugs and alcohol especially in the dorms. Its a zero tolerance policy. The RAs will call the police if they suspect you have either and you will end up on probation trying to fit community service hours into your already busy school schedule making life extra stressful and potentially lowering your grades. And on top of that you may also get kicked out of housing. It really should be dealt with on a case by case basis but it isn't. Seriously the consequences of this policy have ruined people I know's whole college experience. College kids make mistakes. Hardly anyone hasn't gotten drunk underage. Its just a really bad policy and the punishment is unreasonable in relation to the crime.
College Freshman,1,Their should be more parking for students who work fulltime and attend school in the evening
College Senior,1,Parking is horrible and very expensive. There are parkometers on campus and your car will get towed if you stay a minute over the 2 hour period.
College Sophomore,1,"I enjoy my classes, but I do not like how scarce the sections are for each class. I have to get overrides for every class in my major"
College Sophomore,1,"there are never enough sections for exercise science majors, so it takes 4+ years to graduate"
College Senior,1,Parking is horrific on campus. It's expensive to get a parking pass and street parking is often limited and on poor hourly schedules.
College Junior,1,"Permit costs are outrageously high. Ticketing and fines are outrageous as well. Parking is so scarce and enforcement is strict. If you're in a space ten minutes longer than your allotted time, you'll easily get plastered with a $60-$100 fine. It's really tough to find a spot and even tougher to find a spot to park for a few hours. Most spots you will find are 1-2 hour parking and that's really inconvenient when you have multiple classes back to back."
College Sophomore,1,dining hall sucks. there are some good deli's though and Richmond itself has good restaurants around campus
College Senior,1,Parking can be a nightmare if you don't have a parking pass. Those can be expensive but some people say it evens out compared to a couple parking tickets. Recently many of the streets surrounding campus switched from unlimited parking most days to 2 hour parking limits. This can be very inconvenient for those of us ho have classes that are longer than 2 hours or for those who work on campus. However unless you live really far away you really don't need a car. Buses get you most places you need to go and you can get a free bus pass thru the university. Otherwise get a bike Richmond is a big biking city and there are bike racks everywhere as well as free air pumps and repair stations!
College Senior,1,Parking is very limited on campus. Due to the strict parking rules a lot of student cars are towed everyday which is very unfortunate. It is wise to pay attention to the parking signs and give yourself at least 45 minutes to find a space depending on the time of day.
College Sophomore,1,I get a security alert every other night. It seems to me the cops are only there when parties are happening.
College Junior,1,"Campus Police – As a resident of Richmond, Virginia for the past 5 years and a student at VCU for 4 years, I have noticed there has been an increasing number of robberies, assaults, and batteries on campus. There are plenty of VCU police (with full police authority), but instead of monitoring the Monroe Park and MCV campuses, they go downtown and arrest of-age people for drinking. Instead of keeping the campus free of sexual offenders and muggers (many of these crimes happen in daylight), they arrest people that have small harmless parties, write tickets for jay walkers, and make students feel like criminals when they have done nothing wrong."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial Aid at VCU is for lack of better words outright frustrating. The most noticeable aspect of the flawed system is the lack of financial aid Representatives in the school. There are only a hand full of administrators, and over half of them simply sit at desks in the front of the office and don't know enough about the overall process from a general standpoint, so that when students come along with extremely personalized situations (and this happens nearly 100% of the time in college) they flat out cannot give you clear answers, or even general guidelines of what your next one to three moves should be. To tag an analogy onto the experience, its like going into a 5star restaurant expecting to be apart of all the hyped up dining experience, and when you sit down at a table to price out your meal the waiters all seem to know nothing about the menu, about the specials, about the history of previous restaurant goers and their experience, or anything helpful to guide your tastes and needs. Not to mention they can be very short, and bleak about everything. In order for your experience at this ""restaurant"" to work, you must know exactly what you want, along with the cost, the time it takes to cook and spices need to go into the dish that is your financial year with VCU or you will be met with confusion, run-around and frustration. Haha, this is my third year at VCU and I can say that this is my best year financially but it still is no walk in the park. I hope this helps!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Campus Police Are Serious – Due to the fact this school is in the middle of the city, campus police take there jobs very seriously. It's too the advantage of the students but a drunk night in town can lead to a night in jail and possibly being kicked out of school."
College Senior,1,Money??? Where! Financial aid for me personally sucks. I always have to request additional loans because of my class supplies.  Its hard getting in touch with financial aid also. The lines in the financial aid office are also pretty long. I would say this is the only downfall at VCU is how the financial aid office is set up.
College Freshman,1,"Not So Great – We have parking decks, but they are expensive.  If you don't have a car you are better off.  Free parking is very, very hard to find."
College Sophomore,1,"In order for someone to visit, since I live off-campus, they have to find a street to park on where they won't get towed because we don't have a parking pass for the school.  The parking garages are almost always full or say that they are for students with parking passes only."
College Freshman,1,"Every Man for Himself – Living here, even in the dorms, is like having an apartment. It's like being thrown into the city to fend for yourself. There is no real sense of school unity, aside from basketball which only got big after they made it to the Final Four. The academics aren't hard and while drugs aren't used by all, they are pretty prevalent on campus. Richmond is not the best at all; many homeless people sit in the center of Monroe Park and almost weekly students receive emails about people being assaulted or robbed. Better to apply somewhere else..."
College Freshman,1,"Crime in the Park – There is a park right in the middle of four campus dorms that something always happens in. All day there are homeless people that hang out in there and though they seem calm, anything can happen. One girl told me she saw a man doing drugs in the park and just a while ago there was a shooting in the park. Being that my dorm is literally across the street from this park, I feel my safety is at risk."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is awful. Most of the parking decks are located pretty close to classes but if you get unlucky, you're in trouble. They give away tickets like nobody's business and trying to figure out where to park outside your parking deck is a terrible hassle"
College Junior,1,"Education Program – As much as I aspire to be an Elementary Teacher, my ultimate goal is to become a Reading Specialist! VCU only have a bachelors/masters program for Education, and there plenty of positives about obtaining one's bachelors/masters degree at the same time.  But my trouble is, a student cannot teach without both degrees compared to other university colleges where students can teach with their bachelors degree only!  I would love to get my masters degree as well, but the masters I need is the masters in Reading Specialist not in Education!  What this means for me is I would have to obtain both masters degree in Education in order for me to teach and then later obtain my masters in Reading Specialist. I do not 2 masters, I only need 1! I cannot afford to pay for 2 masters since I am a non-traditonal college student who is living pay check to pay check without any guardian help.  It is excellent for VCU since that will bring more revenue for them, but for some students like me who do not want to go the route of obtaining their masters along with bachelors because it does not benefit them."
College Freshman,1,"There is very little parking on campus.  The school provides a few parking decks for the main campus, but those are only useful if students with a parking pass are not in the mood to go to school that day.  The Parking on the street is extremely limited and what little there is generally has a one hour limit which barely leaves enough room for getting from your car, to class, back to your car, finding another space, and then to your next class.  It would not be so bad if more passes were offered but there are 30,000 plus students at the Monroe Park Campus and only 1000-2000 permits for sale.  If you have a bike, you should bring it to college with you to get around, it really is the best mode of transportation."
College Freshman,1,"It's ridiculous, and honestly most of the people are genuinely shallow. It can be an alright way to make friends, but there is a lot of drama and unnecessary hatred."
College Junior,1,"We have the GRTC that runs frequently and VCU escort which mind you there are those drivers that do their jobs and are great at it but then there are the drivers who care nothing about what the escort is for. It is to ensure the safety of students, but when a driver takes hours just to pick up one student or simply forgets about them, the student is left outside at night due to this negligence."

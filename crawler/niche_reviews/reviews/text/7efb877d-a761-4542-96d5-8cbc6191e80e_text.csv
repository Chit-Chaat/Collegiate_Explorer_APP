Junior,5,The online learning experience is simple enough for me and my professors are very accommodating and organize their classes nicely.
Sophomore,5,"With COVID-19 taking away so many opportunities for college students, I feel like the online experience with Texas State University has still been beneficial. I'm still learning and the process is easier than expected."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Texas State University in San Marcos. The town has such a home feel to it and the school is amazing. My professors have been wonderful and I wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else.
Freshman,5,Its been pretty good as great as we can all except getting adjusted to online learning. My professors at least have been really helpful with online learning posting extra information and helpful resources.
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed all my professors, any entry level professors were average, but it was clear they didn't enjoy what they were doing. My teachers were always very supportive of my goals and did whatever possible to help me."
Junior,5,I have really lucked out with the professors I have gotten. They are all very understanding of how hard these times are so they are patient. I have yet to miss an assignment because my professors keep in contact with me out of the goodness of their hearts.
Junior,5,"Texas State is a beautiful campus with amazing professors! I would like to see more diversity included within the school, but I can see that they are working towards that."
Freshman,5,"Understanding, professors and councilors understand the difficulty with being online and adjust to help students succeed."
Sophomore,5,"This past spring semester, we had to transition into online delivery due to the pandemic of COVID-19. as it seemed like at first, teachers who were teaching face to face had to over come struggles of transitioning into online classes but made it a bit simple on students. I just wish it wasn't all rushed onto us."
Junior,5,"Texas State is a good school, Professors are all unique in their own way, some are hit or miss but that doesn't take away from the Overall atmosphere, In my program, we all were competing against each other but we all worked together and always helped one another become better than we were before. ."
Junior,5,"It is amazing, everyone there is so friendly and they make you feel like you belong there. i wouldn't change it for the world."
Senior,5,I transferred to Texas State for my junior and senior year of college. Especially coming in as a transfer student I appreciated the welcoming and spportive environment. I was blessed to have some of the best professors Ive ever had. I was constantly inspired by my peers and instructors and have been molded by my time at Texas State.
Senior,5,"I am a dance major, which makes online learning especially difficult. My professors were gracious and understanding as we all learned to navigate online learning. They found creative solutions and made us as students participants within the planning process."
Junior,5,"I love Texas State. The campus is really big and beautiful. The buildings are all old, but they all have their own style and it makes them unique. I love the school and everything it has to offer. The school has so many courses and clubs. Student involvement is amazing."
Alum,5,"I cannot honestly rate an online experience, because all of my classes at Texas State were taken on campus. I graduated in 2007 with a Bachelor's in Visual Communication. I spent a ton of time in the art building, which had amazing facilities. The faculty were also really great there."
Sophomore,5,I love everything about Texas State it is a very diverse campus and anyone and everyone feels welcome and free to be who they want to be. The programs on campus are great and there are so many ways to get involved and make a difference.
Sophomore,5,"I have only been at Texas State University for a year. I am starting my sophomore year in just about a month, but overall my freshman year was pretty good couldn't complain. I loved going to texas state even though second semester was a big change because of COVID-19. Switching to online was not too bad, all of my professors communicate very well. I can't wait to start the new year."
Alum,5,"I loved undergrad at TXST. I was involved on campus, apart of two organizations while still maintaining a good GPA. The campus is walking distance from the best food spots in town."
Alum,5,Professors care about your personal life and academic life. They help at any time of the day and night.
Junior,5,It is a very diverse school. Everyone is friendly and loves the school. It is also in a very beautiful part of Texas next to so many rivers.
Junior,5,I took classes online for the first time due to covid. It was something to get used to but the professors are there to help you as long as you do the work and ask.
Alum,5,"I don’t have enough good things to say about Texas State University! This school provided to me an incredible education and great college experience. My classes were applicable, interesting, and kept my full attention! I loved being involved in Greek life on this campus. Everyone has Bobcat pride and spirit. Years after graduation, I still have fond memories of many of my Business school professors. I had relevant job opportunities presented to me through frequent job fairs. I even had an opportunity to travel to Missouri as a part of our Texas State University SIFE team. We competed in the sales competition, and Texas State is a regular national winner. I have so much Texas State pride! San Marcos was a very positive experience for me. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in college to apply!"
Alum,5,I took a few online college classes and had a wonderful experience!!! The professors were very involved and gave detailed assignments. Highly recommend!
Senior,5,"I love San Marcos it has been my home for the past four years and I honestly couldn't have picked a better school. Texas State University help me discover what I wanted to do in life and gave me the degree for it. Also I made the most amazing friends, found an amazing church, and had the best tacos I have ever had."
Senior,5,My online experience was great. My professors were very timely and got my grades out on time. I was able to learn at my own pace and retain the information a lot better than sitting in a classroom.
Junior,5,Texas State had a very welcoming aura to it; I was able to enjoy my time walking through the beautiful campus and making new friends.
Alum,5,I did not take any online classes but professors did utilize the Texas State database for class resources.
Alum,5,"Amazing college experience. Great location with a river running through town. Fun and beneficial school organizations. All the basic services, health, career, educational. The classes were not overwhelmingly tough and the fun outside of school never stops."
Sophomore,5,I took two classes online and it was a great experience! Both of my professors clearly outlined what they expected and it was easy to balance my online and in person course work!
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Texas State has been overall positive! The campus and faculty is amazing, the professors truly care for their students and want them to succeed! There are several clubs and organizations as well as student organized events to attend. Me and my friends constantly attended nights at Georges for karaoke and ping pong!"
Sophomore,5,"I am currently taking two correspondence courses that are really good but can be difficult if you do not have good self-accountability. Since I have yet to complete them I cannot rate them in full, However, what I have complete so far has been excellent. I will also be taking some during my next term. I look forward to taking them because I have heard great things about the professors in charge of said courses."
Sophomore,5,"I love Texas State University because of the beautiful campus and knowledgable staff who work there. All the professors have taught me valuable lessons I will carry with me. Any time I have had problems arise with my Major I can always find someone who will point me in the right direction so I can solve the problem with ease. For the past two years, I have had a great time meeting a diverse amount of people and I love how accepting they can be. 

My only negative about the school is the amount of parking catered to students who live off-campus. I would like if there could be more spaces and lots added because sometimes it can be difficult to park later on in the day if you have a late class."
Senior,5,"Due to COVID-19, every college was forced to switch to online classes. I have taken online classes before, but was never with Texas State. My first online learning experience with Texas State did not fail me, they provided even more resources, especially the professors. They made this learning experience so much more easier for us due to the circumstances. It was a big change and of course challenged me at times, but in the end I got through it."
Senior,5,"My experience at Texas State University has been so liberating and educational. I started going here in 2016 and like any other new freshman, there were hard times I went through. Once the first year past I found my routine and what I enjoyed doing and did not enjoy. What helped me was the many resources Texas State had to offer for us students on campus. They have 100+ resources, probably even more, to help guide incoming students. Resources such as tutoring centers, extracurricular activities, entertainment, meet gatherings, etc. What I love about this college is it ensures everyone feels safe and feels as if they were back home. The staff/professors care about their students and want everyone to succeed in whichever major they choose. If I were to suggest a change in this campus it would be to implement more student life activities such whether it is outdoor or indoors, just a couple more ways to meet new people and get more involved with the school."
Sophomore,5,"Last year, I only took one class online. The class was a sports medicine class. The instructor was very laid back given COVID-19 was in full effect. The class was easy to manage and the workload was pretty minimal."
Sophomore,5,"I have just completed my first year at Texas State. Overall, my time there was awesome! I enjoyed the teaching staff, desk staff, and the financial aid staff. Whenever a problem arose, help was easily accessible. The college life is unbeatable. The campus has many activities to offer while providing a safe and clean environment."
Junior,5,"My freshman year at Texas State, I took a hybrid course which is one day a week face-to-face instruction, and one day online. Online courses for me for this course and throughout lock down in quarantine due to Covid-19 seemed to be my cup of tea! I can confidently say that every professor I've had for an online course is quick to help a student one-on-one with the material if they need it. Also, Texas State's course site, TRACS, is extremely user-friendly."
Junior,5,The online classes are informative and user friendly.  The university offers great selection of classes.
Junior,5,"The classes offered are great.  The campus is nice and easy access to classes.
Could offer greater financial aid assistance."
Junior,5,"The only cons to my online experience were because of myself. Not being able to motivate myself and procrastinating. My professors were wonderful, they truly gave their all during this pandemic to see all of their students succeed. I ended this semester with a 4.0, without the help of my professors pushing me to the finish line, I wouldn’t have finished."

Freshman,5,My overall experience at Texas State University can be described as a blissful adventure that has equipped me with meaningful memories that will last for the rest of my life.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the campus and everyone a part of it! Great peers, great professors, amazing campus and very spacious too. I wouldn't change anything, everything is great as is!"
Sophomore,5,Texas State online is very consistent. All professors keep up to students online and is very efficient with lessons and exams online.
Alum,5,I did not enroll in any online classes but friends who had done them enjoyed it.  Texas State does a good job in offering many online classes and additionally has a fully online program for people who may be interested.
Alum,5,"Texas State was a wonderful institution for me. I transferred and completed my degree in 2 years. The campus is ABSOLUTELY beautiful and there is always something going on. There are a lot of ways for students to get involved within organizations and also to find a job on campus. The institution is very diverse with students, faculty and staff. San Marcos itself is a very lovely town in the middle of two huge cities, so you get a hometown feel but you can venture out to larger areas. 

There's good transportation, apps to keep track of it. The school has beautiful traditions and I really enjoyed my time there!"
Junior,5,I absolutely love Texas State!! I love that there is a great focus on diversity on campus because I feel so welcomed and confident in being myself! The professors are all amazing and do their best to help every individual student. They will make time for you and offer many extra credit assignments and aid if you are struggling. There are many clubs/organizations on campus which makes it easier to make friends (always something for every person). I will be a Junior this year and look forward to hopefully returning to our beautiful campus in the fall!
Junior,5,"Learning online is not easy if you have taken in person classes all your life, but Texas State made it very easy and worked with all their students to ensure academic success. My professors were exceptionally helpful and went above and beyond to keep in touch with us and maintain that classroom environment online. Although I miss our beautiful campus, the online learning went smoothly thanks to the amazing professors!"
Junior,5,"The staff are always willing to help and their methods of teaching are engaging. Furthermore, the counselors will work with you to help you find/make the best degree plans that work for you. Also, there are multiple resources available to aid students with their studies."
Junior,5,"Professors go above and beyond to help students in theirs online experience. They will hold conferences, provided additional resources, and modify office hours to meet with students."
Freshman,5,"classes online are great especially for students that suffer with anxiety 
I would consider doing some if I needed to"
Freshman,5,I love Texas as a state and Texas state university has a very big campus and it has everything you need to further extend your education
Junior,5,"Texas State university has one of the most beautiful campuses I have seen. The location truly feels like a little college town where everything is catered toward the students, from affordable food to local coffee shops, it's a great place to be."
Junior,5,"Everyday I am more and more impressed with the Engineering program at Texas State University. The courses are very hands-on and directly related to real life work after graduation. They have countless equipment to use such as #D printers, laser printers, milling machines, lathes, and they go through everything step by step."
Junior,5,I loved my time at Texas state university in San Marcos! The campus is so beautiful and the river was always my favorite spot. The faculty was always amazing and I was well prepared for nursing school!
Graduate Student,5,"AMAZING SCHOOL! Go Bobcats! Professors are amazing, facilities are safe and clean, always cold for those Texas summers, and the student life is really great. Though we aren’t great at sports, we maintain a strong school spirit."
Junior,5,"As soon as I stepped on to the Texas state environment I was hooked. It is such a friendly environment there. The professors I’ve had so far are great and are there to see each and everyone of their students succeed. The campus is really big but you get a workout in while walking up the hills! There are so many spots on campus that you and your friends can go and hangout such as LBJ, Jones, etc. I can’t forget about Sewell park and the river! Any student can just go and jump in the river after class if you feel like it!"
Alum,5,"Everyone gets back to you quickly via email, which is nice .( No teacher answers your exam questions at the last possible minute , for example.)"
Senior,5,I liked everyone helped in this time and how we all communicated over email. Not having face to face interaction was new to me and so the zoom was helpful and teachers tried to have meetings on what was going on. I wished they didn’t reduce time limits on test. I felt rushed and unprepared because I couldn’t read the question fast enough. When typing answers on test their should be more time and have more time to think.
Alum,5,"Texas State University is an excellent school that I would recommend to anyone. Like any other university, it has its flaws but overall I wouldn't trade my experience and education for anything! The FCD development is amazing with amazing professors who are there for their students. There are a ton of organizations to join and events going around campus. GO BOBCATS!!!"
Freshman,4,"I have gone to Texas State for 2 years now and I have loved it very much. There is so much diversity here and it feels like a mini Austin, which is where I was raised. Also, there are so many On-Campus activities that the university holds for us which is amazing! One thing I dislike is that even though is that I fall in the middle class category, and middle class gets the worst part of the stick. We aren't considered poor so we don't get help like those people do, but the rich college students have enough money no matter how much help they get. I think Texas State needs to look at that and figure out something that will help middle class students more."
Alum,4,Texas State is a great university. It is near Austin and easy to commute to. I found the faculty very supportive and felt as though I received a high quality education. Highly recommend!

Junior,4,The school itself is a great value and the atmosphere is very friendly. I felt very welcomed during the transfer process.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Texas state and I've come to love it. There are some downsides like the dormitories and the food, and some of the professors can be a little overbearing at times too. But the location is gorgeous, and the weather here fluctuates which is nice."
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity throughout Texas State. This university also offers many resources to students to help them succeed throughout their college experience. There are many opportunities to enhance one's education, and with the help of the many professors and staff, there seems to be unlimited support from the school!"
Freshman,4,"With most classes being held online, most professors use Zoom as the main platform to teach and lecture. Although this remote way of learning was something I wasn't very familiar with, the professors are helpful in teaching us how to navigate online school. Pre recorded lectures are also helpful and available through the online platform, and is a good resource that aids in studying and learning new materials at your own pace. Overall, I think my online learning experience at Texas State University has been very positive, and i have been able to efficiently focus on my school work at my own pace and time."
Freshman,4,Considering I started my freshman year during covid its been great over all. I've had professors who are extremely helpful  during this time and on average most of the other student here are pretty friendly. I don't regret coming onto campus for this semester one bit.
Alum,4,"My undergraduate experience here was great. The atmosphere is very positive and progressive, but the President of the University does struggle to understand the environment of campus."
Sophomore,4,"I fell in love with this college the moment I stepped on campus. If you hate the city style most colleges have adapted, this school is for you. The campus is compact and filled with trees and is walking distance from a park with a spring-fed river. The professors are committed and helpful. I am in the Honors college which allows smaller class sizes for certain classes and even options to take interesting forms of basic, required courses. There is plenty of research and job opportunity available and the college encourages it through financial aid and events. There is always a club to join and the list of intramural sports seems endless, you will find your people! Overall, I love attending this university and would never regret my decision to attend."
Alum,4,The art program was excellent for becoming an art teacher.  I really enjoyed the art professors and their talents.  There was a lot to learn and I had a lot of fun developing my portfolio.
Alum,4,The classes had an easy access to all of the online features provided at Texas State.  I was happy with how simple the online part was and how quickly the professors would respond to communication.
Freshman,4,"So far, I really like being here. It's really nice and there's a lot of nice people here. They staff are very understanding and helpful."
Freshman,4,I have some of my classes online and so far it's been pretty well. The professors here are very understanding and helpful.
Freshman,4,"Although it is a tad bit difficult, it can be managed if you stay on top of your work. Texas State makes online experience learning fun/ tangible as long as you're organized."
Freshman,4,"I like it here so far, the school itself is wonderful and the people here are wonderful as well, if you're thinking about going here go for it! the teachers genuinely care about you you'll meet new people as well. the town is even beautiful."
Junior,4,I am taking all my classes online currently my instructors are very helpful and aware of the Internet issues that may arise from having classes online they are very understanding.
Junior,4,What I like about Texas state is that it’s so pretty here at the campus is beautiful there ever a lot of hills and a lot of stairs and then the Texas heat it does not mix some thing I would like to see changed at Texas state would be the student perspective I would like for them to take in more consideration for the students for what we say what we want.

Alum,4,I had a good experience with online learning with Texas State. I was lucky enough to get attentive professors who cared about the class they were teaching and it made it easy to learn
Freshman,4,"So far my experience with Texas State has been very good, they have been helpful and supportive if i ever needed help."
Senior,4,"Texas State is a great university with an equally amazing history and journalism department. There are also many events that take place throughout the semester, so you can always find something to do. The University is also a short walk away from the square where you can hang out."
Junior,4,"So far it has been a delight, they have been very communicative so far and answering my ridiculous questions"
Junior,4,I am going to be taking one this coming semester and the professor is patient with me and my odd questions
Sophomore,4,Very diversified school with plenty of oppertunities to meet lots of people and studying here amazing. they have an amazing group of staff that help 24/7.
Junior,4,"I've taken classes mostly in person but online courses are just as good as being there in person, the school utilizes tracs and each course is up to the professor to format, so there really isnt an overall consistent structure"
Junior,4,There are some very hard-working professors that make learning a lot of fun. The campus is beautiful and there is a lot of diversity. With that being said some of the faculty at Texas State are not always understanding towards students and their situations.
Junior,4,A lot of online professors are very understanding of their students and make it easy to ask for help. They do a great job at adding every resource you may need for the course. Many of the teachers also want to help by finding free online textbooks for their students.
Junior,4,You have to be accountable for all of your work. If you don't have discipline i would not recommend it.
Junior,4,"Online learning has been a challenge with coronavirus, but it is manageable. Before coronavirus broke out, online classes were simple and easy to pass."
Sophomore,4,It was a great experience overall they really have professors that truly care about making sure you understand everything. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is simply because of the design of the campus can get lost pretty easily and all of those stairs were horrible when it hit triple digits during the summer or when it rained.
Sophomore,4,My online learning was good I feel like I had many resources and ways to learn online. In the beginning it was a bit difficult to locate but once professors explained more it was easy. I would do it again because it was also flexible with my schedule and I had time to get projects and assignments done in a timely manner.
Sophomore,4,"Switching online was a drastic change that I thought I would be stressed out about, but turns out it's not too bad. My online experience was very different but still manageable."
Senior,4,"I have/currently taking 9 online classes. Not really a problem, only that deadlines are sooner than usual."
Senior,4,"Texas State at San Marcos is a beautiful school, in a beautiful city. There is so much to do, it makes you want to stay longer than 4 years. Which shouldn't be a problem if you go down a harder degree path than physical therapy. Tuition is more expensive than I consider normal, if you don't have a steady stream of income, it is hard to live here. On the bright side, it is a great environment for those who want a good college experience without leaving Texas, or a good Texas experience without the crowded city."
Sophomore,4,"I will start by saying that no college is perfect. Every college has its issues, the bad things that it's known for. When I first moved down here about 2 years ago, I was a senior in high school, looking for colleges to attend. I applied to Texas State, and got in, as their acceptance rate is very high. Though there have been some ups and downs with classes, professors, students, and advisors, the overall environment at the institution is welcoming for all. You don't have to be an ""elite"" to attend. Everyone, no matter your major, is treated with some level of respect and dignity."
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful (but very hot during the summer months. Duh. It's Texas) and for the most part, everyone is nice and helpful. I only see people crying during exam time. The river is refreshing and easy to jump into between classes. Out of the 20 some-odd professors I've had, only one has been trash personified, which is pretty good in my humble opinion. The desks in the English building are minuscule in size, and when the heater turns on in Flowers, it smells like there's a fire in the attic, which is cozy as well as concerning. In the quad, there is usually free snacks (the Christians have the best snacks) as well as other goods to buy. The Paws and Go has the best pecan roasted coffee in the whole wide world, which can be yours for only $2! I dream of that coffee. One star taken off because I was attacked by a squirrel while I was eating a $4 Kind Bar while trying to read on a park bench. Beware of the squirrels. Be aware of the overpriced granola bars."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the campus and the students. There are many opportunities here at TXST and to say the least there is never a dull moment here at TXST!
Alum,4,"I took a couple of online/ hybrid classes but not too manny since I do prefer learning in class. However, the online classes I took I made easy A's in. I did the basic studying of reading the material I needed to read and did the assignments and everything went well."
Alum,4,"I went to Texas State University starting in 2015 to 2019 for Psychology. This college is sadly tainted by the reputation of being a ""party school,"" which detracts from the education it has to offer. I loved Texas State and my core professors. They really do try to be there for you and challenge you throughout the year. I think the improvement this school needs is higher entry level requirements so the education can be more rigorous."
Junior,4,I love the campus and students are super nice. I'm going to miss walking on campus with all the beautiful scenery.
Junior,4,I love the campus and students are super nice. I'm going to miss walking on campus with all the beautiful scenery.
Sophomore,4,"So far, I feel welcomed and loved in this community. I do feel that they go a bit overboard with all of the prices for apartments, parking passes, etc. but overall the environment is very beautiful and relaxing."
Alum,4,"I personally only took one online class at Texas Sate, and it was considered a ""hybrid"" course, however, there was no official class time, only an optional office hour, which, I actually preferred. I had a good experience overall."
Alum,4,"My experience with Texas State University was that is was good. I really enjoyed all of my classes and professors. I would like to see maybe some change in higher up administration, however."
Junior,4,"I am heading into my junior year at Texas State University as of Fall 2020. My experience here has been refreshing, as I would say 90% of the professors that I have really love their job and teach with passion. This makes it easier to want to go to class and do well for a lot of students! I believe that the freshman advising program - PACE - needs to be improved upon. When I was a freshman, I can confidently say that I left most of my PACE advising appointments more confused than I came into them. Because these advisors work with every freshman and they are not specialized in a major, the appointments seemed to me as a chore. PACE advisors did not prove to be very helpful, except to students with undeclared majors."
Junior,4,"Texas State overall is a great school to attend, but has drawbacks like all schools. If you are looking for a normal, no-fuss education then Texas State is a good match. I've had wonderful instructors for classes in and outside of my major. While there is a ""party school"" reputation that follows it, if you don't want to participate then it probably won't bother you. San Marcos is also a wonderful city that's tucked in its own area, while also being a reasonable drive away from Austin and San Antonio. I have more positive things to say about Texas State than negative, and the negatives are mostly just personal preferences."
Freshman,4,"I personally have not taken any online classes at Texas State University. Based on the all of the helpful resources provided to students by the university, im positive that any online experience with Texas State University will be seamless and smooth."
Alum,4,I cannot speak to the quality of Texas State's online classes because I did not take any. Not applicable
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my experience at Texas State. My professors were fantastic, great people. I met people that became important mentors and friends.

I wish there was more free parking however."
Junior,4,I have loved all my classes at Texas State and the faculty I have encountered is awesome. The campus is beautiful. The location is perfect between Austin and San Antonio. It is a big small town and the locals are friendly.
Sophomore,4,"Texas State University, while average when it comes to academics, it has a friendly and diverse atmosphere that any student would feel comfortable in. Not only is the atmosphere great, but the campus itself is beautiful and the city of San Marcos is homey."
Sophomore,4,The professors did their best to adjust to online learning in light of the pandemic. There were many opportunities to contact them during office hours and tutoring services were still available.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the tutoring services that are given. All of the professors I have had are extremely intelligent and professional.
Junior,4,"I like the size of the university, the location and surrounding area. No better place to be in college than right next to some of the clearest water . However just like any other college , youll meet a few proffessors whose priorities align more with their research than their teaching ."
Freshman,4,I really admired how teachers were able to adapt to online classes at a quick pace. Even though I personally struggled with online classes I can’t deny that all my professors tried their hardest to help as many students as possible.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I really like the campus it is always clean and friendly. Another thing I like is the diversity in Texas State. A lot of professors are extremely passionate and it shows."
Senior,4,"The professors were great and provided a high quality lesson plan, given the time frame that was given to assemble it."
Senior,4,The university provides great education and genuinely cares about the student body. There has also been so much growth with new buildings and opportunities for students as well!
Senior,4,"Academics are sufficient to make me feel good abt my job chances. Course offerings are varied and intensely interesting. Most (tho not all) professors are amazing, fair and well-qualified. Some of the students are fake, superficial and irritating (but that's every college). Lovely campus. Worth the price of admission."
Junior,4,I’ve only taken classes online because of this whole pandemic but the professors did everything they could to make sure we understood our material. Offering as much resources as they could to aid us!
Alum,2,"Texas State University is a good school, run by selfish people. Could be a lot better if the president actually cared about students and their well-being rather than profits."
Senior,2,"I am a social being with a poor work ethic. If I'm on a computer, I better have Cheetos in hand and a streaming service in front of my face, NOT school. They offer classes that are half online and half on campus. That would've been fine for me if I had realized that half of it was online at that time. If this is your vibe, online classes for sure, but it's not my scene."
Senior,2,"Genrally, online classes are average. However, in light of the current pandemic, the school wiffle-waffled about whether or not they would be moving online for two weeks, and then announced it one day before spring break began, giving professors (many of whom had never taught an online class) just two weeks to figure out how to move their class online. Additionally, even under normal circumstances, when taking online classes you are still charged fees such as ""transportation"" or ""bookstore"" fees."
Senior,2,"The online learning experience was terrible. That being said, I can't blame the professors for that; the classes I took were all in liberal arts and discussion-based and not easily adaptable to an online format in such a short time-frame."
Freshman,2,If you don’t have friends you’ll hate it here.  The city is so boring there is nothing to do here so all everyone does is party. Parking here is TERRIBLE. Do not leave because you will not find a spot to park.
Sophomore,2,"Texas State is not in the best area for young, college kids. As a college student at Texas State, I feel unsafe in my community with all the crime going on. If you are looking into going to TXST, look at the events that have been happening recently- rape, robberies, shootings, breaking into cars, and more. The tuition price is very good compared to most schools, but you pay for what you get."
Freshman,2,"Nothing about this school is likable, every time a new semester is approaching, i always receive a hold on my account and a balance that they couldn't even tell me why its on my account. Academics wise, they don't try to help me, i struggle and my professor literally told me, ""well I'm not giving extra help outside class hours, so see you back next semester"". How does that help a student?"
Sophomore,2,"This university is average at best. Clearly, this is subjective, so based on my decisions I have certain opinions on this institution. In my humble opinion this university is not academically rigorous in the slightest sense. I try very minimally and have a 3.54 GPA. This university is decent at best, but it is not for me. I recommend this university to students who want to do well easily, or for students who seek to party."
Junior,2,The facility want you to work for companies that sponsor the programs not for companies that fit your personality and what's best for you. The curriculum is also made to focus on those companies.
Freshman,2,Extremely liberal. Shunned if you are white. Academics are extremely easy and a blow off. Greek life causes surplus problems.
Junior,2,"Beautiful campus on the San Marcos River. Be prepared to wear comfortable shoes and carry a light weight backpack because there's A LOT of walking up hills and long distances.  Very large classes in the pre-requisite courses. For ex, 1330 Biology had 300 students. 
Take undergrad courses at a local community college bcz it's too expensive and too cramped at Texas State University. Professors are pretty harsh when it comes to attendance. A lot of professors locked the classroom doors 15 mins after class start time. In my opinion, this was very discouraging because if a student were to be a few minutes late, then they wouldn't attend class at all knowing the doors will be locked.
This school really doesn't offer online courses or evening courses. Not the best school for working adults."
Junior,2,"The student body is the largest problem; I'm sick and tired of having classes with illiterate morons. Other than that the campus is gorgeous and the professors are usually fairly good. Tuition is fairly cheap too, and the university offers a TON of scholarships. Go here if you have no money and can put up with morons."
Freshman,2,If you decide to go to Texas State I recommend you find friends quickly. I know college is suppose to be where you have fun and meet new people but Texas State isn't like that if you don't know the right people. They stress diversity but the campus is very cliquish and if you don't fit into a group or social group you are pretty much a lot all the time.
College Junior,2,Struggling in football haven't had a winning season in 20 years in basketball
College Senior,2,There has been many sexual assaults on campus
College Sophomore,2,Our school spirit is lacking. Our atheletic temas arent too good.
College Junior,2,"There are many sexual assaults and robberies on campus. During my freshmen year, multiple people were held at gun point in front of my dorm and were robbed of all their personal belongings."
College Freshman,2,"I'm very against greek life, but for those that are in it, do indeed love it."
College Freshman,2,Walking on campus alone at night os very scary because there is not adequate lighting in some areas.
College Freshman,2,"The sports are not very good, so people do not have much interest in them."
College Senior,2,the student job fair for STEM majors only had people looking for engineers.
College Freshman,2,"We do not have the best athletes, sadly. Lol. We do Have a pretty supportive fan group however."
College Sophomore,2,The school does not try to help individuals.
College Senior,2,Nobody really goes to any sporting event. The fans are only there when we're winning. Everybody goes to tailgate just to get drunk.
College Senior,2,"There are crimes that occur, mostly muggings. My bike has been stolen twice. Some of it is student on student violence, but I am proud to say that sexual assault is a non issue."
College Senior,2,"I am against the elitism institutions and how they operate, especially greek systems. Texas State is a good 'ol boy school in this manner."
College Freshman,2,"A LOT of crime happens. Murders, theft, and assults."
College Freshman,2,Recently there have been a lot of problems that are making lots of people nervous.  There were two armed robberies in one week and multiple robberies this past semester.
College Freshman,2,No one stays the entire game because they are itching to go to the parties.
College Freshman,2,"The university puts a lot of money into athletics, as with any school, but there are simply no results. Our football team is absolutely awful. We are getting a new coach, so hopefully things will change, but it will not be sudden and as for a school our size, it truly is sad how our athletics do not represent us better. Until something changes and some time passes, athletics are not the biggest thing at our school. We have a huge stadium that seats 30,000+ that never fills up. I would love to see Texas State athletics grow and be more successful, but it will not happen in the time while I am still at Texas State."
College Junior,2,I had an 89 in a class and my professor wouldn't bump it to an A.
College Freshman,2,I am a big fan of football and the schools football team is not so great that is why not a lot of students attend them.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshmen go into the start of college with the determination to not gain the ""freshman 15"", but with the extreme amount of unhealthy food compared to healthy food it is nearly impossible not to gain weight."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is no off-campus housing that is in relation to Texas State University - round rock. There are a few apartments near TSU, but they are in no way affiliated with TSU."
Recent Alumnus,2,"At the Round Rock campus of Texas State University, the meal options are very limited. It's vending machine snacks without the vending machine. A few options include sandwiches, burgers, and frozen meals (burritos). The frozen meals would be ""ok,"" except paper plates and/or napkins are not provided to place your meals on in order to heat up in the microwave. Very limited variety of healthy food (only a few fruit plates available in the refrigerated section.) Foods mainly consist of chips, candy, ice cream, etc. If you don't bring your own food to class, you're going to pig out on junk food."
College Sophomore,2,Not very strict with anything other than parking!
College Junior,2,"Not fun, everybody underage. More likely to get arrested than have a good time."
College Junior,2,"They automatically choose the worst rates for you. You have to call multiple times to have your aid adjusted to what is correct, necessary, and cheapest if you get a loan."
College Junior,2,I try not to eat on campus unless I'm desperate and have a short amount of time.
College Junior,2,I don't party so do not know where the best party scenes are
College Junior,2,It is such a hassle to set up any financial aid. Most of the stuff needs to be done online and I would rather it be able to be done in the office if possible.
College Junior,2,"I am not a party person, but most of the stories I heard were the majority of them got busted or they were really bad."
College Freshman,2,Met with financial aid too many times before help
College Freshman,2,It's realllllllly expensive to live in San Marcos.  Multiple roommates needed.
College Freshman,2,"My financial situation is no the best. My families Income last year was just above 25,000. So I received the most money that a student can get for financial aid. Which was still not enough. i still had to pay from my pocket about 3000 last semester and 4000 this semester."
College Freshman,2,"It took forever for the university to tell me what I needed and didn't need to turn in for financial aid. They kept saying they had too many documents to handle so I never got an answer back until weeks later. They don't tell you if they received documents or not - they will just tell you at the last minute like ""oh yeah we never got that sorry"". I had to talk to the supervisor just to get things straight. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have gotten my aid. It took 3 months to get everything sorted out. 

Have more organization and faster reply times. More work study availability would be nice too for the people who actually need it."
College Freshman,2,The strictness is not a good thing. I feel like I am in high school again with double the rules.
College Junior,2,"I find Greeks to be elitist. They are very close minded to the people they include, and then half the time are knocking down the people they do include. If you ask me, Greek life is an expensive way to buy friends who don't really like you at all."
College Freshman,2,I had recieved my aid at the end of the first semster and made it such a horrible experince this whole year for me.
College Freshman,2,"You hardly see campus police and there have been reports of sexual assault and threats on campus. I do feel safe when walking in a group, but at night I will never walk alone. One good thing about Texas State are the Bobcat Bobbies and you can call them at nigh to take you to your destination if you ever feel unsafe walking alone."
College Sophomore,2,I'm personally not friends with anyone in Greek life.
College Freshman,2,I am not part of the Greek life. They are all over campus and to me its still just causing lots of cliques and they only talk to other Greek life members.
College Sophomore,2,I don't like living in the dorms because of the community bathrooms.
College Sophomore,2,"I tried to apply for different financial aids, however I did not qualify for a lot of them because of my house hold income."
College Freshman,2,"Attendance is pretty low at varsity games, they practically have to beg us to go."
College Junior,2,Non-Greeks and Greeks rarely interact due to the scheduling required of Greek life.
College Senior,2,"I am not a fan of the fast food offered at the campus cafeteria, nor am I am happy with the places around campus to eat. If you are looking for more alternative, healthy options your best bet is to cook at home."
College Sophomore,2,"food is kinda bad here, wish they had more options"
College Freshman,2,"I dont feel women are very safe here or anywhere    I feel i have to be smart & careful where I go, at what time of day or night & who with    There are always men around who are thinking of hurting a girl or woman so women must be careful not to become a victim"
College Freshman,2,staff are few and far between so getting a live person to help is not worth the effort
Niche User,1,"I would give zero stars if I could. This place is unsafe. Every night there would be gunshots, robberies, break-ins, or creeps following/assaulting women. The dorms are falling apart and the buildings are dirty. They say they are for women and equality but I heavily disagree. I do not know how this school is still running. The only thing they have going for them is their affordability, but honestly go to a commuity college and transfer to a school that will give you a good experience. Do not waste your money on this school. Parents keep your children safe and do not send them to this school. Not to mention there is a huge drug and alcohol problem here. In my opinion, this school needs to be shut down. I had a bad experience and cannot speak for everyone but this was what I saw for the barely one year I was there. I wish I never stepped foot on campus."
Graduate Student,1,"Pre-Course selection does not give you much description to know what your getting into, until class starts and you get the syllabus.
Courses have much breadth. Not depth. Many do not follow a path, especially for professional licensure programs.
Some Professors set up curriculum as they know it, not from the perspective as a learner. The (I know it, you should know it attitude)
Online courses are an extreme example of the aforementioned. You are at each course Professors mercy.
Party school laid back? YES
Cost comparison to other texas universities? Comparable"

Junior,1,"Online classes from Texas state went smoothly for the most part and the faculty tried to do everything they could to make the transition more simple. The university however handled the situation poorly in my opinion. Changing courses to emergency passes upon requests and approval did almost nothing to help the students, especially considering many programs/ grad schools don’t accept EPs as grades on transcripts and many students could not receive an EP therefore hurting their GPA. This was the only thing done for students and many could not receive the help. Many faculty also continued to fail students without taking the pandemic into account and offering no additional help for courses."
Niche User,1,"It was a very unsafe place to be. Drug deals everywhere and lots of theft. The academics were very disappointing and profs can't even get teach the facts. I gritted my teeth and transferred to an Ivy League school the following year. That was so much better. So yeah, the crime and academics were what made my experience terrible."
Junior,1,A lot of the kids and professors are white and they indirectly discriminate against kids who aren’t white.
Freshman,1,"Lawyer Wright is the reason I hate my life.
Terrible food 0/10
Great Parties 10/10
Food is whack 0/10
Did I mention the food is bad 0/10
Lawyer Wright is 0/10"
Freshman,1,"If you're a person of color, turn around. They do not care about you. They just want to use your skin to plaster it on some advertisement. We have had too many racist things happen now and in the past. There has been murders, rapists, and white supremacists on campus and we get nothing but a vague email. Plus it's not that great of a party school unless being stuffed in a tiny apartment or drinking in fraternities floats your boat."
Senior,1,I am deeply disappointed in this university's ethics. There is nothing but political biases and conflicts of interest among faculty. What has hurt me more is the fact that there is a lack of confidence in the students’ abilities and knowledge. Professors should be humble and be willing to accept that maybe there are those students who despite being younger than them and hold no PHD could indeed know more about a particular subject and the professor should respect and thank the students for their contribution rather than humiliate them with condescending remarks or belittle their existence.
College Senior,1,"The rooms were too small to share. I was constantly bumping into my roommate. However, all of the dorms are close to classes!"
College Sophomore,1,"I am not apart of greek life, but some of the people I've met that are in it are very rude and snobby towards others. Greek life members tend to do worse at school than non greek."
College Freshman,1,"There is no fan support and ZERO school spirit. The teams are relatively good I guess, but I wouldn't really know because they are never talked about on campus. There used to be a football team but it got cancelled back in the 80's. The athletic facilities are relatively new and nice. But all in all, the athletic scene on campus is nearly nonexistent."
College Sophomore,1,old dorms are so horrible. they put you in the worst droms ever
College Freshman,1,I hate my housing only because I have one of the oldest dorms and the size of my dorm is tiny! and with two girls its hard finding your own space with eh room being so small!!!
College Freshman,1,"Greeks are not respected at TXST, mostly by their own doing."
College Freshman,1,"I was granted federal work study, applied to 5 different places online at Jobs4Cats like instructed and heard nothing, fomr anyone."
College Freshman,1,"I'm sorry, I HATE my dorms. I didn't even get to choose where I reside. PLUS, it is at the lowest part of campus."
College Sophomore,1,The professors need to be watched way closer.
College Sophomore,1,Greek stuff is all just annoying.
College Freshman,1,"I stay at Bobcat Village Apartments, and it is not worth the money I am spending on it. I have spent a total of about $9,000 on housing and when we moved in it was extremely dirty, there were holes in the wall and on furniture, there was a short in my bathroom light, the stove handle was just sitting on the counter, our sink was and still is leaking, and the neighbors are very loud. My roommate and I turned in a work release form at the beginning of our stay and about 5 months later they came to fix the stove handle, but nothing else! It really isn't worth all that I am paying for it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
College Freshman,1,"Excluding the few good ones, they are all crazy and don't do anything Greeks are supposed to do for the community."
College Sophomore,1,"One professor that I had belittled me and didn't let me explain to her why I felt my paper didn't deserve an F. I have never received an ""F"" on a paper before. I loved her class so I went off on what I was taught. She was a really picky grader and absolutely rude. She asked me why did I care so much about the class. I was shocked that a educator would even ask that. She was an older woman, which seemed like she only was grading all of us out of her misery of being old."
College Sophomore,1,I can't stand the greek life. They are all jerks.
College Freshman,1,"Some of the dorms seem very nice. However, I live in Jackson hall and it is always very dirty and is so small it feels like a prison cell."
College Sophomore,1,I have gotten about $1000 worth of parking tickets
College Junior,1,"The only issue I really have as far as the strictness of Texas State would be the parking enforcement. It's like they are out to get all of the poor college students and trying to make every dollar they can. It's hard enough having no available parking because there are too many passes sold and not enough spots, but it seems like every time I can't find a spot and I'm on the verge of being late to class I just park anywhere i can that's close for a short period of time and they find a reason to give me a ticket. Because of this i now resort to taking the bus to and from class, but I feel bad for the people that commute from Austin or San Antonio because they don't have that luxury."
College Freshman,1,I did not get a single pell grant. Or any money at all from this school. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE you will no t get any money!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Freshman,1,I rarely received any scholarships.
College Freshman,1,"I hate my dorm, but I am grateful I have a place to stay. It has to be one of the oldest buildings on campus. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable at times. There are sometimes bugs. It is a very convenient place on campus, as far as my classes are concerned."
College Freshman,1,Financial aid and scholarships here are an absolute joke.  It's extremely difficult to focus on academics if I don't know I'm going to make it through the week.
College Junior,1,The process for financial aid has been headache inducing on the best days. There is a lot of paperwork to do and you must over produce criteria that shows you are eligible or in need of financial aid for them to maybe consider offering you financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you even consider Copper Beech, think again. I moved here for my last semester at Texas State and do not have enough words to describe how rude, awful, and decrepit the management and apartments are. It has added so much stress to my life having to deal with them and I tell anyone I meet to stay FAR away."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Joining Greek life will suck out the life you once knew, turning you into an individual with no sense of identity and very low morals."
College Senior,1,"Horrible process!!! They always are at ""high volumes."""
College Junior,1,They only look at the institution GPA and not your overall
College Sophomore,1,Parking passes are overpriced and prices continue to rise. Usually there is no parking spots and you are most likely to get ticketed if you park in a red zone.
College Freshman,1,from what i hear it's horrible...
College Sophomore,1,"Permit rate are ridiculous. There are rarely any spots available. There is not enough spaces available to begin with. Tickets and fines are also unreasonable. Going through the parking permit process at the parking service office is not very pleasant. The staff doesn't seem to want to help and answer questions. Confusion is normal amongst students because of poor communication about policies from parking staff. Having a car or driving to school is not worth it whether you live on or off campus, with or without a permit. Parking garage prices are poorly priced as well, however you have a better chance just paying there by the hour."
College Junior,1,"All other majors are fun, and all the college students seem to really enjoy their college career. However, biology is horrible and everyone that I talk to either just don't have a life, or hate the fact that they picked this major. Those who love this, best of luck!"
Recent Alumnus,1,Tough as nails to get in.
College Senior,1,I do not hardly get any money even though I do need it!
College Freshman,1,Parking is terrible! The cost for a parking permit is outrageous.
College Freshman,1,its extremely hard to get around san marcos unless its decent walking distance.
College Sophomore,1,permits are way too expensive. they ticket way too much. trying to find commuter parking spots is bad because they fill up and are a walk away from campus
College Freshman,1,Parking SUCKS. If you don't have a permit don't leave your car in any parking lot on campus for more than five minutes because you will get a ticket immediately.
College Sophomore,1,Never any spots and they fill up quickly
College Freshman,1,"This would have to be one of the main reasons why I dislike my campus so much! Campus crime, safety services, personal safety and special security measures are so low, it gets scary walking around on your own at times. "
College Freshman,1,"I do not believe the campus I go it is Drug and Alcohol safe. Drugs and alcohol are super easy to find and they are used by over half of my campus. It's really sad. Plus, people come in the next day to class looking like they had the time of their night, the night before and always brag about it to everyone. 
Peer pressure is a maybe there, simply because you really don't get pressured into doing anything. People just do it. And the policy enforcement is there, but is totally not respected."
College Freshman,1,They basically think they are above everyone else and too good.
College Sophomore,1,"It absolutely sucks. I  came here in hopes of being exposed to a healthier lifestyle but turns out the food is 10 times worse than back home. The only thing that is not smothered in butter and seasoning is the salad bar. My diet can't only consist of lettuce and cucumber. I need lean protein but the only thing they offer is pizza and burgers.
"
College Sophomore,1,"There is never any parking on campus. Usually commuters and even students have to park off campus and have to go on the tram system to get on and off campus. Permit cost is very high & fines aren't too bad. You don't really need a car at all on campus, just mainly getting to the campus. "
College Senior,1,"I do not have a parking pass since I live close enough to walk to campus and because there is a university tram. However, I do drive to the rec. There is only one small part of the street which has free parking spots. Though these are usually occupied with students' cars who live in the dorms near the rec. The parking passes are expensive and amount of free parking is EXTREMELY limited."
College Junior,1,no parking at all or you have to pay extra 
College Senior,1,not well organized or suited for the size of the student population.
College Senior,1,Parking permits are double the amount of spaces available so finding a parking spot is almost impossible & not to mention how expensive the parking permits are.
College Sophomore,1,The parking is HORRIBLE! Its better to say that there is no parking. They have a great bus system though which is your best bet when going to class.
College Senior,1,Parking is very scarce and always crowded and awful.
College Junior,1,"Mostly everyone don't care at all what they where mostly girls and guys where shorts with a simple shirt. Even from ""goodwill"" they don't care. Guys are usually blond and tall and girls as well."
College Junior,1,The parking permit for people that live in the dorms is about $500 it increased 50% in less than an year. The parking is a nightmare no parking even after you got that $500 parking tickets. There is parking in parking lots but for a few 2 hours its 8 dollars. Its just not a good experience so I ended up moving close enough so I can walk and forget about the parking. The only way you will find parking if you go at 5-6 a.m.
College Junior,1,"Most students won't dare move their vehicles because they know that once they move it will be almost impossible to get another parking. With this Fall's new outrageous parking permit prices, I'm sure there will be less students parking on campus."

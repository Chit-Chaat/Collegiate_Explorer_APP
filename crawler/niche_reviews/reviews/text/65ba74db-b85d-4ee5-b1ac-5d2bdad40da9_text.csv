Sophomore,5,"I love the size of the campus, it is just right for me. I enjoyed all of my classes and professors very much, and I would definitely recommend UAS for an incoming freshman. I just wish that it wasn't having all of the financial trouble that it is having right now. I wish we had the funds to remain a separate college from UAF and UAA. Other than that, I enjoyed my first year as a student there, and I can't wait for this next semester to start."
Graduate Student,5,I love being able to take classes through distance education. I am to take classes from the comfort of my own home after working all day long.
Graduate Student,5,I love going to the University of Alaska Southwest! It allows me as a nontraditional student to be able to take classes in the evening.
Freshman,5,The professors and staff are really friendly. It's super easy to get a job on campus and all of the different classes that they offer is amazing and worth your time and money.
Alum,5,I am just starting at UAS and am happy to be able to have an opportunity to take online distance classes from home. There is nothing I would change.
Junior,5,"This is a great college for anyone who wants to attend college, whether online or in person. So glad I chose to attend UAS."
Senior,5,Great school! Has amazing views and lower tuition costs! Their B.A. education program is top notch and the faculty is easy to get ahold of and help in any way possible!
Sophomore,5,The University of Alaska Southeast is a great college to attend. The teachers are very helpful and honest want you to succeed.
Niche User,5,University of Alaska Southeast has been a great university system to take distance delivery courses through.  The university and particularly the education department staff have been very helpful in getting courses set up in a timely manner and have been available when I have needed to ask ask questions and get clarifications on programs.
Sophomore,5,"This campus has understanding and kind professors! I'm going into my second year. Some hard obstacles came up, but not because of the college itself."
Senior,5,"I love my university for it's tight knit, caring community. The professors and instructors are very helpful and willing to work with you to make sure you succeed. The class sizes are small, with a 5:1 student to teacher ratio (I think). The campus setting is breathtaking and peaceful, right on Auke Lake overlooking the Mendenhall Glacier. The culture of the campus life itself is so diverse and rich. There's a place for everyone at this school which really helps boost student morale in my own experience."
Freshman,5,My overall experience with the University of Alaska Southeast(UAS) has been really good. They are super understanding about my work schedule and they let me choose what I want to do by just giving me information. The one thing I really like is that it is filled with the Native culture. I love it here!
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,5,"The options to obtain a degree in the class room or online are very high. If I have any questions the student adviser is always willing to help or sends me in the right direction of who can help me. Books are affordable, the online websites gives options for cheaper books, which helps out financially a lot! No complaints about this school yet."
College Sophomore,5,"Our Rec Center is amazing, and UAS doesn't really have any sports teams so Residence Life/Student Activities Board plans camping trips/hiking trips to keep us entertained. Juneau has more than 100 trails, some of which are walking distance from campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Juneau is this quaint little hub of great seafood, Pel Meni, Saffron and Chan's Thai, as well as countless cafes and bakeries that are all excellent."
College Sophomore,5,"The Freshman Residence Hall is a brand new dorm and exceeds my expectations of college dorm life. The rooms are HUGE with big windows, if you're on the upper levels facing the campus you can see the Mendenhall Glacier, or if you are like me on the ground floor facing the forest you can spot Southeast Alaskan Wildlife on the daily."
College Freshman,5,"Occasionally, you'll see students smoking marijuana, but it is not much of a problem."
College Freshman,5,There's always an open space.
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid office was very helpful. I applied for a scholarship at the school and actually got it.
College Sophomore,5,There is a bus stop right in front of the library building.
College Sophomore,5,The atmosphere is amazing. The nature around us goes perfectly with the people that live here.
College Freshman,5,All of the teachers I've had seem interested in their subject matter; I really enjoyed my classes. 
College Junior,5,"In the Elementary Education Master's program, they are accommodating with having evening classes so I can continue to work. They also allow teachers to complete their practicum and student teaching without having to quit their job."
College Junior,5,I feel that the instructors are very knowledgeable and provide effective instruction. The academic advisors are helpful and know my interests and needs. They are quick to respond to e-mails and questions.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my university! Juneau is a beautiful city that offers activities indoors and out. With a small population you do have to be creative at times, but I wouldn't change it for anything. The people at UAS are fantastic as well. Everyone is so friendly and inviting; you feel like you're apart of a huge family with many many cousins. If you love nature, you'll love going to school in Juneau, Alaska."
College Freshman,5,The academics here are over the top amazing. You are constantly learning fantastic rings no matter what class you take. All of the professors and enthusiastic and love what they teach.  This school is the ideal of academics.
College Freshman,5,"The people he are the best people in the world. There are not that many, but everyone is super friendly and kind to eachother. You always find safe and welcomed."
College Freshman,5,"This school is wonderful in every category, especially finding financial aid for its students. They want you to find aid as much as you do and they work with you until your questions are answers."
Recent Alumnus,5,"As a distance student, the availability of classes after normal working hours for my degree are awesome. I can get into any class that I need. Professors willing to take time out of their day to respond to emails and questions. Have had more interaction through the internet with my professors than I have sitting in the actual classroom!"
Recent Alumnus,5,Some of the best professors in Alaska teach at UAS. The networking within the university is great.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I believe that the location of off campus housing can be tricky to find close to the Campus, but the public transportation is top notch."
College Junior,5,I am an English major and I love it here. There are many different English professors and a majority of them are good at what they do. I have learned so much here that it takes a while to process. I feel like I am given awesome opportunities and the professors have got my back!
Recent Alumnus,5,"In Alaska, people are wonderful.  As far as the men go- we say that, ""Alaska is where the odds are good, but the goods are odd!"""
Recent Alumnus,5,"Excellent!!!  Computers are everywhere, access is easy and the help desk is fantastic!"
College Freshman,5,I love the snow.  The weather is okay. Some days it rains but it is very beautiful.
College Freshman,5,"I love Juneau.  The landscape is so beautiful.  I have made alot of friends.  I also love the native culture.  Being a Hawaiian from Hawai'i, they made me feel so welcome.  The school is like a home away from home.  The people are very friendly and welcoming."
Recent Alumnus,5,The online distance MAT program is incredible. I have interacted more with the students and teachers in this program than I have at a traditional university!
College Junior,5,You can find a parking spot no problem as long as you are not afraid to walk a little. There are plenty of parking spots compared to how many students actually have cars. Considering you can walk most places most students go without cars.
College Senior,5,"Since there are no dorms and limited on-site classes, parking is plentiful, close, and free."
Sophomore,4,"As I am sure many people are aware, when Covid-19 happened, all of my classes switched to online delivery methods. I have taken online classes before, but these were of course a little different as professors and students adjusted to a new way of teaching and learning. I would say that under the circumstances, the online classes were delivered very well. I wouldn't say that I would want to repeat the experience, but given the material and time that the professors were given to work with, they did a really good job of transitioning and making things work."
Niche User,4,"The campus is good and it is in a small city. The advisors are very helpful and they send me emails that include useful deadlines which can help me stay up to date on what is going on. The admissions counselor was a big help to get me applied and in the Associates of Applied Science degree. I would not have been this far into my applying process if it was not for them to help me get this far. Also they send me emails including scholarships I can fill out, so I wont be in debt with the school. I know they would be excited to see me go to this school and I do not want to go anywhere else."
Niche User,4,The teachers can be hit and miss but they all are very supportive and helpful in the academic process.
Freshman,4,"All of the professors I've had so far have been very passionate about their area of expertise and promote a positive atmosphere in their classes. This extends to the prominent number of tutors around campus who are always willing to assist students with whatever assignments they’re dealing with at the time. The only thing I would currently like to see changed is most likely beyond alteration due to the schedules of the drivers. I am currently largely reliant on the universities shuttle service for transportation around campus. Although this service is reliable in regards to weekday classes, the fact that it is unavailable on the weekends makes attending extracurricular events more difficult given my disability."
Alum,4,"A small campus with a great student-teacher ratio.  The faculty and staff are excellent.  Most of my professors I knew on a first name basis and felt very comfortable approaching them outside of class for advice and help.  The campus is located on the edge of Auke Lake, and is an ideal location to gain inspiration for your studies."
Freshman,4,"Everton one is extremely friendly and understanding, strongly enforced rules that protect you from harmful acts."
Graduate Student,4,So far so good. I would recommend longer advisor hours for financial aid dept. and easier access to advisement
Sophomore,4,"Absolutely breathtaking campus in Juneau.   I believe that the University will overcome its budget shortfalls that are currently effecting the courses and programs available, which is currently the most negative aspect of UAS."
Freshman,4,"This university is perfect for those majoring in anything relating to biology. The environment is perfect for studying outdoors and going on hikes with friends. The staff is very helpful and they give students the opportunity to apply for internships and local jobs on campus or within the local community. Housing is beautiful in the middle of a rainforest right next to a large lake. I recommend this university is for anybody who wants to be close to nature and not in a large community. Again, it is perfect for those majoring in the biology field."
Junior,4,"University of Alaska Southeast's main campus is located in a community based around Auke Lake and Auke Bay. Along with the amazing views, hiking trails, glaciers, and a welcoming community UAS offers great academics with a top notch faculty.  Professors are always willing to help and a lot of them go out of their way to help you be successful in college."
College Junior,4,Class sizes don't seem too bad. Seems like towards the end of the semester the number starts to decrease. Online courses have been somewhat easy so far. I have had positive interactions with my professors
College Junior,4,"UAS provides a lot of online classes which is nice for the working student. I feel that it would be nice if they offered more afternoon classes. UAS does not provide not provide the degree I would love to achieve, and it is the only college school on the island so I have no choice but to use them. The reason being is because I love to work in class and not so much online."
College Freshman,4,i like the dorms. just enough space.
College Freshman,4,get to live near the ocean.
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus. We're a small and quiet campus. We've had little campus crime. But when we do, a majority of campus crime is stealing. We security cameras and adults you can turn to."
College Junior,4,There's a variety of courses offered and the professor's are experts. They are some that are unfriendly but most of them are friendly and helpful.
College Junior,4,Campus is very student friendly. They have free wifi and coffee for the students. The tutors in the student center are very knowledgeable.
College Sophomore,4,"I am going in to my second year at the University of Alaska in Juneau Alaska and I am very excited. UAS has been  an amazing stepping stone out of my home town of about 2,500 people. The class sizes are small, the professors know you by name, but the material and content of the classes offered here are perfect for students who are looking for a small university to commit to for an associates degree."
College Junior,4,I intend to do an internship.
College Junior,4,it's small but worth it
College Freshman,4,"Everyone here at the university cares about the person rather than their religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or race."
College Freshman,4,"I love the size of Juneau, for my upbringing in a small town. It's a nice place and very relaxing. It would be nice to have more events and activities available for students."
College Freshman,4,"I love walking, and take late night strolls. During these walks, I never feel uncomfortable or in danger. The dorms and the campus are both a safe place during the evening."
College Freshman,4,It's a smaller campus so they don't offer as much benefits as bigger schools. The university doesn't offer much in terms of clubs and groups
College Sophomore,4,"I do enjoy my program. Im going for my associates in business administration online. UAS offers this whole degree online, which is very helpful to me since I'm a single mom. The classes are pretty cut and dry. We read out of the text, have discussions about what we read or on a specific question. We have midterms and finals and quizzes."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of outdoor activities that you can do.
College Junior,4,I have my own laptop but when i needed a certain program that i didn't have the money to buy the school had computers in the labs with the program so it was helpful.
College Junior,4,"I dont partake in any drugs, so i don't really see it, and i also don't really see people that look like they are on drugs."
College Junior,4,"Its a place for someone that loves that outdoors and all that it has to offer. Mountains, glaciers, lakes, ocean, and wildlife."
College Junior,4,"Its easy to get into the major the only issue i have encountered was that to get my degree, there are quite a few online classes that you have to take which at first was hard and made my GPA drop."
College Sophomore,4,"There are some things UAS could work on, but I think its a great school."
College Student,4,"Ketchikan, Alaska is an outdooors mans dream, there are plenty of trails to walk including one right on campus.  There is fishing, Shopping is just right down the hill from campus.  The comunity is very much an artist paradise as well, with so much local talent."
College Freshman,4,"I have no issues with the health and safety services, but I also haven't used them much. "
College Junior,4,"My time on campus was positive, in that I could access technology easily."
College Junior,4,There is a wide variety of cultures and attractions to keep anyone interested.
College Junior,4,"People in Juneau are very friendly. There is a lot of attractions to visit, and the views of the mountains and water are phenomenal. "
College Junior,4,"I am an online student at this school, but I have visited the school, and enjoyed my tour of it."
College Senior,4,I think they are very reasonable when it comes to punishment and enforcing policy.
College Junior,4,I got into the program without any issues or paperwork! :)
College Junior,4,"I have been given financial waivers without asking for them or having to fill out paper work!  But I have had problems with communication with financial aid staff, I am expected to know/understand certain processes or paperwork when I've never heard of the processes or paperwork"
College Junior,4,"While I have never felt unsafe, this is Alaska! You have to watch for bears, and sometimes moose since the University is kind of close to the end of the road! Dorms are safe, secure and the view is beautiful. I have never lived in the dorms, but they are close to campus. :)"
College Freshman,4,Technology is very available. There is always enough to go around. There is a place free for printing as long as you do not print out too much. Speed is good for internet on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Since UAS is a reasonable small school, it is much more easier to get in contact with advisers and professors. They are very supportive and encouraging, and some are even very understanding."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am a distant student so I am unaware of the local atmosphere at UAS. However, I have been to Juneau and it is a wonderful city!"
College Junior,4,Most of the English professors are amazing! Professor Neely loves what he teaches and it makes you excited as well. Professor Wall is an amazing Creative Writing Workshop teacher because she really knows what she is talking about. Professor Chordas' classes are always fun because she knows a lot about the history of literature. All the teachers are amazing but because of that be prepared to work hard because they will expect you to love their subjects as much as they do.
College Junior,4,"It was not that hard to apply for financial aid but make sure you don't pay for any classes before the first day of school. I did and their systems messed up and I lost about 1,000 dollars."
Recent Alumnus,4,Drugs are used but it's certainly not noticed.  There's more positive attention paid to learning.  It's a really good scene.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not live on campus, but from what I have heard it been safe, you have people in the dorms you can go to and ask for help, ect."
College Sophomore,4,"The public bus system goes right to the campus, and then to the rest of the town.  cost is 2 dollars for a bus ride and you can transfer buses at other locations."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are always emergency updates sent through email and text messages if there is a security or safety issue.
College Freshman,4,Computers are fine most Of the time. Just slow logon speed.
College Senior,4,"Not a Lot Here, but Distance Available – The professors are all very engaged and helpful, and if this campus doesn't have a class you need, you can usually find a distance course through another location"
College Senior,4,Psych/Soc BLA Distance Program – UAS has a unique distance program that makes it easy to get your bachelor's degree in remote locations
College Junior,4,There are rules on housing: quiet time is at ten pm and drinking underage on campus will get you in trouble (duh). The officials like to give second chances but if you break a rule more than three times than you will be kicked out!
College Sophomore,4,"Growing up here, UAS is great because I knew the area already. It's a very small campus, so it's easy to find your way around. With the scholarships offered here, I've been able to go here almost free."
College Junior,4,"The People and Places Make the Difference – UAS has a nice athletic center with all the basic recreational ammenities, there is also a climbing wall and outdoor equipment rental.  The athletic center is free for students and you can rent snowshoes, bikes, kayaks, etc. pretty inexpensively.  UAS also offers a wide variety of PE classes for outdoor activities.  The library is small, but books can be ordered from other campuses.  The Learning Center is remarkable, however.  Students can come in and get tutoring in math and english anytime during working hours, and it is a great place for students to connect and study in groups."
College Junior,4,"Everything a Student Needs – UAS in Juneau has excellent resources for students.  There is a large computer lab with free printing, scanning, and laptop hookups; free services are pretty uncommon, even at universities.  The lab is almost never completely full.  Wireless internet can be accessed anywhere on or near campus, and it's reasonably fast.  In addition, tech support is available anytime during operating hours and they are more than willing to help.  They may not have the most expensive and advanced equipment, but a poor student could easily get by without a computer of their own."
College Freshman,4,Parking on campus is amazing. There is no permit required for parking and you can always find a place to park fairly close to the entrance.
College Sophomore,4,"Check Out Southeast Waffle Co. There are quite a few yummy local places to eat out at in Juneau, but unless you have a vehicle you may have a difficult time getting there. Luckily there are a few good places walking distance from the university, and those are Chan's Thai Kitchen and Southeast Waffle Co. The Waffle Co. has delicious waffles, drinks, sandwiches, and soup. There is free WiFi there so it's a great place if you want to work on some school work and the prices are pretty reasonable. Chan's Thai Kitchen is a few doors away in the same building. Expect a bit of a wait if you want to go there because they don't take reservations and it's a popular place for the locals. The wait is worth it though their food is delicious and while it is a little more expensive there it's worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"Egan the Heart of Campus – The Egan building houses the majority of class rooms, a coffee shop, the library and learning center.  It is the place where people spend most of their time while on campus.  It is a nice facility that is up to date and well loved."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of healthy options.

I only purchase food as a last ditch effort because I am hungry."
College Sophomore,2,"Theres a club, but Juneau isn't as so much a party scene as it is restaurant scene. We are right off the ocean and you can always enjoy fresh Alaskan Seafood, plus Pels is this dainty little restaurant that serves Pel Meni (Russian dumplings) in only two options but both are incredible."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you want to eat breakfast, there is not much in terms of places to eat Off-Campus."
College Sophomore,2,We don't have many sport groups at UAS.
College Senior,2,Housing in Juneau is very expensive and competitive. Hard to find if you don't already live in Juneau. I've heard a lot about landlords just not caring about their properties or tenants.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are only 2 restaurants within walking distance. The Thai Restaurant is awesome and a good price. The Southeast Waffle Co has tons of waffles, sandwiches, coffee and soup. It is also pretty good but not as healthy and there are less dinner options."
College Junior,2,"It's public transportation, which is cheap but the times aren't the best and you're S.O.L. if your class isn't around the bus schedule or late into the evenings."
College Junior,2,"Seems to be geared toward younger students, students living in the dorms, at home with the Rents, and those without too many outside interferences (you know like jobs, children, homelessness, funding)."
College Junior,2,"Alcohol Everywhere – It almost feels like all people talk about is drinking or partying but if you refuse to drink or party about one hundred times people stop bugging you about it. You still get to listen about their drinking though. Roommates also may try to pressure you into drinking. It is more of a local, easy-to-get-into college so there are people who just do not care here. If you keep on your toes and respect your own boundaries you will be fine. People are not trying to harm you- they are just more interested in having fun than studying for their next test. Also, a plus is that they usually leave campus to go party."
College Junior,2,"it takes some time for them to kick you out of housing if you caught underage drinking, if you are not from Juneau. If you have family in Juneau they wont hesitate to kick you out for any violation. If they do find alcohol in an underage dorm room they will take it away but it has to be in out in site for them to do that."
College Senior,2,"From previously attending UAS I did not find the computer lab sufficent for doing school work. There is only one computer lab (since I attended there) and the network speed was pretty slow. 
I will be taking distance courses so I will be doing all of my work on computers."
College Freshman,2,Not That Great – University of South East Alaska is extremely boring and lacking in many activities. the strongest attribute of the university is the small classroom size and personal relationship with proffesors
College Sophomore,2,The school has only on Fraternity and it is for community serves.
College Sophomore,2,"Juneau, Alaska – The town is a lot like a ghost town during the winter, very depressive. During the summer is when all the stores open up and the tourists come in."
College Freshman,2,"Wet and Drury – Juneau is known for its rainy and overcast weather, so you get use to your shoes and bottoms of your jeans always getting wet.  The weather also cant seem to make up its mind about if it wants to snow or rain during winter, so it ends up being a gross slush on the ground.  When it is sunny, it is very beautiful and everyone heads outside."
College Freshman,2,"The campus parking lot is big for the campus, but the problem is that it is hard to find parking close to campus unless you get there early or is lucky enough to find an open spot."
College Junior,1,The UAS does not have a sports team
College Sophomore,1,It is hard to get a decent place at a price that a student can afford
College Junior,1,No sports teams even though they used to back in the 80's. Would be nice to have at least basketball teams even if they participated against community colleges.
College Freshman,1,"The university of Alaska southeast is located in Auke Bay, where there is one bar and one restaurant. Some love it some hate it."
College Junior,1,"We have one co-ed frat/sorority. They are a great group of people but you barely hear about them. Their main goal is to do community service, they are not really the party type or the type that gets you high-end connections with people. If you want real Greek life, do not come here."
College Junior,1,"There are no official teams. You can play intramural sports but do not expect much from there. The main sport is ultimate frisbee. There are no swim, football, soccer, basketball, or major sport teams."
College Junior,1,"Housing is extremely expensive off-campus. Also, it is near impossible to find a place. Basically it is cheaper and better to stay on campus."
College Senior,1,"There Is Very Limited Night Life Here – This is Sitka- there are a few bars and pubs, but no clubs and nothing for people under 21"
College Sophomore,1,Deep fried everything.  There are no healthy options and the service is poor.
College Sophomore,1,"No School Sports – At UAS there are no varsity or competitive sports available and not much of a athletics scene. There is a great Rec center available to students though. It has a basketball court, indoor track, and a weight room."
College Sophomore,1,"With the location of the University, it is a bit spaced out from the rest of Juneau.  There is a couple restaurants that are close to the University, but they don't hold the best hours and do host a large variety of options."
College Freshman,1,There are no parties or any sort of night life what so ever. Really boring campus

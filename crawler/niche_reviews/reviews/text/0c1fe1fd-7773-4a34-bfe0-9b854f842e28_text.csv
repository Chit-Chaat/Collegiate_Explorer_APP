Sophomore,5,"Erskine College is a great college.  I am a returning sophomore, and I had a great freshmen year.  The professors were all very helpful in my transition from high school to college courses.  The classes were challenging but rewarding.  The sports programs at Erskine are competitive, and there is a feeling of belonging on the campus.  I am glad I choose to become part of the Erskine Fleet."
Freshman,5,Teachers are available to help whenever they can. They are very helpful and appreciated. This school uses every resource to its advantage. This means that you don’t have to worry about being left behind because they will walk you through it of show you ways to get the answers you are looking for.
Senior,5,"Erskine is what you make it to be.  If you want to be miserable here, you most definitely will be.  However, if you take the time to get to know classmates, professors, administration your time at Erskine will be more enjoyable than most.  The people here actually care about you, do they have their faults-yes- but don't we all."
Niche User,5,"Amazing school, great people! Just being around the people in due west makes you feel good. its a small town where everybody knows everybody. and everybody makes you feel welcome. they truly make you feel like family. Great experience."
Works Here,5,WARNING! Please oh God Please do not go here! If you thought you were inprisoned in high school you thought wrong. The Classes are even dumber and the teachers are communist sympathizers. If you want to be taught by Masonic devil worshippers go to Erskine. P.s go to snappers if you are hungry
College Freshman,5,"The courses are challenging and the professors are incredibly smart. The class sizes are small, which makes learning easier."
College Senior,5,"Erskine is one of the top 5 safest campuses in the country. I feel safe at all times, even walking alone as a young woman at night. The campus police are also very present around campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Most of the students are student athletes, which is attractive to me."
College Sophomore,5,I am a biology major - premed - challenging curriculum.  My professors are very helpful and encouraging.  They are willing to assist those who make a sincere effort.
College Sophomore,5,Challenging curricula - professors willing and available to help.  SI available for most classes.
College Sophomore,5,"Very Happy – I have thus far been extremely happy with the biology program at Erskine College.  The professors are knowledgeable, helpful, and very encouraging."
College Sophomore,5,"Great Program – Erskine has a great biology program, and will be very helpful in my preparation for my interviews and standardized testing for admission to graduate school."
College Sophomore,5,"The process of getting into my Biology major was easy.  My pre-admission counselor was very helpful in my course selection, and my counselors since and the instructors have been very helpful."
College Student,5,"Who Am I to Judge – I am mearly human, I do not need to judge how my future classmates physically look.  Though the times that I have gone and my fellow future classmates, who I am friends with through Facebook, all seem to dress nicely and are really friendly.  Many of the former students remember my name the times I return."
College Freshman,5,"Erskine College offers lots of parking options. Although most students walk to class, Erskine offers parking lots for each building with multiple options for parking."
College Senior,5,Campus Safety Team and Police – The campus Safety team work with the local police authorities to make all students and local residents feel safe.
College Freshman,5,"Erskine College athletics are some of the best in the South. Though some sports are overlooked, the athletes still perform to the best of their ability."
College Freshman,5,"I really like Erskine. The professors are friendly, I have a great number of circles of friends, and despite the sometimes boring nature of the food, I don't go hungry. There are great activities and super music events."
College Freshman,5,"Since Erskine is a small school, there are always parking spots somewhere close to where your dorm/class is. Parking is not that much of an issue though because most of the campus is so close together that students normally just walk everywhere."
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience was very challenging but it was rewarding.  This was a new style of learning for me, but once I got used to it and familiar with what was expected, things went very smoothly.  The professors were very helpful and knowledgeable to help me with online learning."
Freshman,4,It’s a very quite and chill environment. The staff is very cool and outgoing they are always trying to help and get to know all the residents and students by name. The athletics are great working to make Erskine a school to be at. The school in general is a good school just takes Somme time to warm up to how quite it is.
Freshman,4,"I really like Erskine. I came from a smaller high school, so Erskine's small size and tight knit community made the transition from high school to college way easier. The class sizes are very small which makes it easy not only to get to know your classmates but also your teachers really well, who are available pretty much always through office hours and email. The majority of the students are athletes as well, and since I'm an athlete it's nice to have many people you can relate to. There are also students who aren't athletes who enjoy it here too, as there are many on campus activities (foam party, halloween party, etc), and you can even join a literary society. A couple downsides are that we're so far away from the nearest big city, so for some it's easy to get bored. Also, the dining hall isn't the best. It starts out alright but usually goes downhill near the end of the semester. All in all, I love Erskine and think it's a great school."
Junior,4,Erskine College has a very small town feel to it. The dorms are very clean and comfortable not super fancy but clean. The professors are nice and outgoing. They are very willing to meet with you and help you on the course. There I'd no party scene in the town of Due West and the nearest town with stuff like bowling alleys or anything to do is 30 mins away. The school is good at doing some events for the students but not a lot of variety with the events. The cafeteria food is not very good and doesn't have a lot of variety. There are not a lot of restaurants in town or that are within walking distance.
Sophomore,4,It is a great place to interact with others. The small atmosphere familiarizes you with all your classmates and professors.
Sophomore,4,"I've loved by experience so far at Erskine College.  The community of students is wonderful, helpful and supportive when trying to get things done on Campus. The academics are challenging but the Professors are willing to work with students. Since Erskine is small, everyone gets to know everyone making for a great diversity and community among students and staff. The campus/facilities are beautiful, the food is average & the dorms are not too bad. The only thing that I would like to see change is to have something open on campus after 11 for students to hang out or eat at."
Junior,4,One thing i like about it is that it isnt too big but also a beautiful camus. One thing i would change is that students could be a little more involved with activities and organizations.
Freshman,4,"Erskine College has given me great opportunities to advance and make my future prosperous. All the professors are kind and everyone here treats you like family. It's an, overall, great choice for higher education."
Freshman,4,"Erskine is a very small, Christian school. It's a close community and with the nicest people you'll ever meet. Being in the middle of due west sometimes it gets a little lonely and quiet but sometimes it's a good thing. You get your peace and quiet with no distractions. The classroom environment is for the students to be able to have a close relationship with their professors and to have an opportunity for a one on one learning experience."
College Freshman,4,The campus police live right in the middle of campus. It is easy to get in contact with the police if anything goes wrong.
College Freshman,4,Erskine employees help students to make connections so that they have career prospects once they graduate.
College Freshman,4,Housing is great! It's a lot better than I ever imagined housing to be. It's clean and can be spacious if the furniture is put in the right spaces.
College Freshman,4,The Greek life at Erskine is great... It's different at Erskine because they have literary societies instead of sororities. These groups support each other and helps the community with different community service projects.
College Freshman,4,Since Erskine is such a small school there is a lot of school spirit shown from the students.
College Junior,4,The police monitor our campus very well!
College Junior,4,Buddy is GREAT at the alumni network!
College Junior,4,Greek life is not big but I enjoy being in one.
College Junior,4,I like the campus ministry's here at Erskine.
College Freshman,4,The school is located in the middle of nowhere so safety is pretty good. I have had no problems. There have been some false accusation reports of sexual assault.
College Freshman,4,"I am a freshman girl and currently in the nicest dorms on campus. Other students do complain about the quality of the dorms. Also, you must live on campus all four years."
Recent Alumnus,4,Erskine is a good school with great welcoming people. All the teachers help you wherever they can. If you know the right people there is also sth to do nearly every evening.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the athletic facilities here at Erskine. The fields and courts are open to anyone and are usually open.
College Sophomore,4,The student teaching jobs I have had through the school have been a great experience The education department does a great job with communicating with the students and the schools they area assigned to.
College Senior,4,I think that most of the programs do a great job of preparing students for life after college at Erskine.
College Senior,4,"I think that the campus strictness is well enough to ensure safety, yet lenient enough to allow for forgiveness."
College Senior,4,The weather is usually beautiful.
College Senior,4,I met a wonderful girl at Erskine and I believe that there are a lot of great people to date here.
College Senior,4,I feel very safe on campus.
College Senior,4,There are usually plenty of open spots to park in.
College Senior,4,"We're supposed to be a ""dry"" campus, but people sneak alcohol into their rooms anyway. Other than that most people hide their drinking & drug use. A few people do smoke cigarettes."
College Senior,4,The application process was normal and did not have any added difficulties. I think the most important criteria for admission are GPA and standardized test scores (SAT and ACT).
College Senior,4,"I am a Biology major, and have had an internship at a county police department because I am interested in Forensics. While finding the internship and setting it up was completely my own work, the professors were very supportive of it. The majors at Erskine are difficult, but appropriately challenging."
College Sophomore,4,"No actual Greek life - Erskine has Literary Societies, which are similar to Greek fraternities and sororities.  This is a good way to socialize."
College Freshman,4,Erskine College is an academically challenging school that knows the students by name. This is because of the small amount of people who attend the school. As a student you can have a close relationship with your professors who will help you as you progress in you enducation.
College Sophomore,4,"Erskine prides itself on its recent placement as the 5th safest school in the nation. No major campus security policies or reforms have been implemented so I am inclined to believe the lack of crime is due to the isolated area in which our school is located (not that I'm complaining). Being a church-affiliated school, you can rest assured that the students on campus have no real interest in causing trouble for anyone (besides the occasional harmless prank). As far as the infirmary is concerned, it seems as if it is never open. I believe the nurse from the local clinic is there from 7-9 am but if  no one shows up by 8, she leaves. There is an elderly lady attending for the remainder of the morning and she does the best she can. My only real complaint is the hours I suppose...and maybe taking the bathroom scale out from behind the door (it gets a little squished)."
College Junior,4,"I'm from North Carolina and appreciate mild weather. The weather at Erskine can be unpredictable, but for the most part, it's extremely mild with very little snow ever. The temps are nice for this area, and while it's hot in August/September, the air here works wonderfully. It is in the south, so take that in consideration, as it's usually always humid."
College Junior,4,The town is great and makes me feel very safe and protected. There is literally cops everywhere!
College Junior,4,"Erskine College offers majors that are provided by most colleges. Since it is a smaller school, they don't have as many as your major colleges/universities. I've heard all the departments are good."
College Junior,4,"There are usually plenty of places to park. If it's one of the smaller parking lots (like between two of the girls' dorms), then you'll have a problem & you'll have to go to either the bigger lot behind the other dorms or one across the street from the one of the girls' dorms. This campus is relatively small & the majority of people walk or ride bikes everywhere."
College Junior,4,"It's not so bad once you get used to things. The police (not just campus, but city) will pull you over even if you go like 1 mile over the speed limit (no lie). Also, if an area is marked as no parking or has a time limit, heed its words. They will put a ticket on your car! Also, heed alcohol &amp; other policies and you won't have problems. Obey the rules & you'll be fine."
College Junior,4,"I find that being the Education department at Erskine College, our program is top notch compared to friends who are at other ""state"" schools. We get one-on-one teaching with the small class sizes and help with any questions we may have. I've also heard that schools will hire an Erskine graduate over a state school graduate, which is what I'm hoping for, because the reputation is so good."
College Sophomore,4,"There are several restaurants within ten miles of campus, including a Mexican restaurant, Subway, and a cafe called Lou and Perry's, which is decent and is open 24/7."
College Freshman,4,Theres plenty of parking all around school. There are always many bike racks
College Freshman,4,"Due West of Nowhere – Erskine College is located in a very small town, Due West. Everyone knows everything about you. The campus is beautiful and small. The atmosphere is very peaceful and relaxing. The grounds are perfect for sitting outside to study or just hang out with friends. This is a very beautiful school!"
College Freshman,4,Great and Beautiful Campus – The campus is small making everything in walking distance. The natural and historical beauty of the campus makes this college a great place to live and learn. The athletic facilities are great for those students that like to workout. The science building and the math/music building are modern and are well maintained.
College Freshman,4,Small Town – Due West is a very small town but everyone is very friendly and Greenwood and Anderson are close.  We have many activities on campus.  I chose Erskine for the small town life.
College Sophomore,4,Weight Room Is Great – The weight room here is nice because of its location. You can lift weights and be able to watch the games at the same time due to a glass wall.
College Sophomore,4,"Erskine's academic challenges are very tough. I've taken summer courses elsewhere and had friends go from Erskine back to ""state"" schools to tell me that those schools are sooooo much easier than Erskine. Hopefully, that means someday, when applications for jobs are looked at, that my degree from Erskine will be worth a lot more."
College Sophomore,4,"When you arrive at Erskine, they tell you there is ZERO crime in Due West SC, and if you look online it's true. I do feel very comfortable walking at night or even alone. I ride my bike everywhere and the police are always around. Only drawback may be that the police are a little over done with a 25MPH speed limit in the town itself and a little too eager on writing stop-sign tickets. Seems they fund their force with parking tickets in town, speeding tickets for going less than 5 over, and stop sign violations."
College Junior,4,"Save Gas – Permit costs, ticketing and fines are very reasonable. The dorms, classes, and dining halls are a reasonable walking distance so a car really isn't necessary. The only reason a student might wish to have a car on campus is to go grocery shopping or to enjoy some food other than the dining hall. You never have to waste time driving around in circles looking for a parking spot."
College Junior,4,"Erskine is tiny.  With only 600 students, everybody really does know everybody.  Some people run away from this after freshman year, but those who live above reproach learn to love the support and accountability such a small campus offers.  It makes all students grow and stretch in some way or another, whether from academic accountability, social/moral accountability, or spiritual accountability."
College Junior,4,"Small Classes Having Pros and Cons – The classes are small, for sure.  This is pretty great as you can learn well with the extra attention each student gets, but it also allows the professors to be more attentive to your weaknesses.  This helps them to stretch and grow students far outside their comfort zones."
College Freshman,4,There is not many parties on campus because its so small and the only place to have one would be in a dorm room. Most people just ride together with one student who has an suv.
College Freshman,4,"Guy-Girl Relationship – The guy-girl relationships at Erskine College are very public. Because Erskine is so small, news about relationships travel fast. However, the guys are girls at the school are fairly average."
College Freshman,4,"Erskine College is located in the small, sleepy town of Due West, SC. There is not much to do, but it's academics are challenging and the best rated in the South. The campus is clean, beautiful, and very safe."
College Freshman,4,"Literary Societies – Erskine is not big enough to have sororities or fraternities, but it does have small literary societies. The societies have Rush and throw a few parties or things throughout the year. Most of them have positive reputations, and everyone gets along, Greek or non-Greek."
College Sophomore,4,"Mainly White Student Body – There is a majority of white students at EC, but there is also a somewhat small percentage of other races."
College Sophomore,4,Professors Rated a - a+ – The professor ratio is great for students.  Professors are willing to help you when you go to them.
College Student,4,"I have never felt threatened or insecure at Erskine. Although we had a few episodes of stealing within the dorm, the administration and police were on top of it and I was never truly worried."
College Student,4,Professors are kind but demanding!! The academics are well respected. I came to be in the dual-degree program with Erskine and Clemson. I have been confused about some things but the director at Erskine College has been very helpful and he spends a lot of time helping me figure out my class schedule even though he is not my advisor.
College Junior,2,People feel that if there's no party then they don't have anything to do that weekend.
College Junior,2,Living space is small and they aren't nice places to live.
College Freshman,2,I have not been able to take my basic general education required classes because they were either full or not offered multiple times. Students are disrespectful to the staff and teachers. Students do not participate in class discussions or seem to care about their education. Erskine is a small liberal arts college and the teachers will work closely with you. It is possible to get out what you put into the college but my overall experience has been unsatisfactory.
College Senior,2,Nightlife is not that great at Erskine.
College Senior,2,We only have two places to eat off campus.
College Senior,2,"We have Literary Societies, which means we don't pay overly expensive dues to national chapters. Some societies have died out, others thrive and grow each year... just depends on the students & which society they choose to rush. So people try to pressure you to join their society and make you feel uncomfortable during rush, while others are pretty laid back & don't make you do anything the members themselves wouldn't do. Sometimes tension forms between & within the societies... but it's usually nothing too major. Be a Greek or a Geek!"
College Senior,2,"My first few years went by well. I received enough to cover the costs of the school year, and enough extra to do a summer term. However, due to the loss of one scholarship and rising tuition costs, the last two years have been in the red. It is difficult dealing with the financial aid department: most of the solutions involve extra loans."
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing exists, but in short numbers. Not many people actually live off-campus and commute."
College Senior,2,"There are only a few options for off-campus apartments and houses, and most students are not permitted to live off-campus anyways unless they have medical reasons."
College Freshman,2,"The town, Due West, Erskine College is located in is very small and quaint. The town has only three places to eat. Subway is the only chian restaurant that is very close to the school. There are no shopping places other than Dollar General and the small gas station. All of these factors are what give Erskine a lower grade. The town of Due West is a nice small campus that is eaesy to get around. The people that live around the school are very nice and friendly. Erksine College is a  Presbyterian college and is sponsered by the towns ARP church. The community is very geared towards the college's presence and attraction. Overall, Due West is a good place for people who want to be completely focused on their school work and not more active towns."
College Junior,2,"Sometimes they seem to do things for no purpose: like tearing up the grass to plant more, or letting the sprinklers break/flood areas of sidewalk. I haven't had as many problems this semester, though."
College Junior,2,"The choices in food are very limited. The campus offerings are the dining hall, the smaller restaurant run by the school, and a few food items at the campus coffee shop. Outside, there is Subway and a slightly expensive local restaurant. Of course, one could buy groceries at Dollar General, but that is not always a viable alternative, with the student needing a personal fridge to ensure the safety of the food items."
College Junior,2,"We don't have any fraternities on campus: we have the older, better precedent in the literary societies. There are five available for women, but only two available for men. Both groups for men are supportive, community-oriented organizations. The women's groups frequently do work for the community in the college and at large around the town."
College Junior,2,"Very Small Without Businesses but Beautiful – I love the small town atmosphere and there not being too many distractions; but the drawback is when you need something, you do have to drive 25-40 miles to get it. There is a Dollar General store, small hardware store you can barely walk through, a mexican restaurant,a Subway, and one gas station. There are plenty of churches to be had, and the streets are beautiful. Also, the local police are sticklers about really trivial things which cost college students alot of money (ie if you roll through a stop sign you lose 4 points on your license and $255 fine). I love Erskine College, but many students just can't do this small-town life."
College Junior,2,"Personal Computer Required!!! The wireless system works in parts of the campus and in dorms and there are places to print if needed. I'm having trouble with my printer and the wireless network, so I bought a cord to fix that situation effortlessly. All college students should know they need a laptop by now though. If you take a Mac like mine, be sure and get the Microsoft Office product to go on it, because some instructors do not have the conversion tools - which has been my only problem (and I'm getting the software this summer)."
College Junior,2,"Ladies Freshman Dorms - Big! All Others - VERY SMALL – I dreaded my freshman year and dorm living, but other than some overly joyous people in the halls, I loved my dorm and the space in my room then. Since, I'm in Bonner and it's a mild and mildew filled small space.  I fight allergies, so this becomes an issue every year as there is always mold on my registers. The rooms are small in every dorm except for women's freshman dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"Lots of Whites – there are many ethnicity at Erskine, but there are predominately white students. In my opinion and experience, the African American students get treated different from the teachers and other students."
College Sophomore,2,Not Really the Actual Greek Likfe You Want – The greek life that everyone thinks about is the Divine 9 and Erskine doesn't have any of them. They have literary societies to take place. They are NOTHING like the fraternities and sororities at other schools.
College Sophomore,2,"Guys Are Ok – The majority of guys on campus are either athletic or just geeks. More than likely, the athletes are going to date another athlete. And the geeks, they are not looking for anyone. There might be some good guys, but most of them don't want to get to know you unless you are around them all the time."
College Sophomore,2,"Strictness Abound – Here's the scoop - it's a religious school. No one of opposite sex in the dorms before noon on any day. No one after midnight Sun-Thurs, and no one after 1AM Fri-Sat. They have cameras, and they will catch you apparently. I left one night at 12:04PM from another dorm and had to do 20 hours community service for it. Seriously, we are consenting adults and it's a little ridiculous. Also, some professors are just awful about attendance and some get away with not showing up for class ever other than to turn in items and take tests - while I'm there every class busting my butt. Frustrating is really the word for what happens there."
Niche User,1,"Erskine College is a terrible school. It will make you depressed and you'll die of boredom. It is a dry campus and anyone that is even associated with alcohol is fined. The administration is filled with horrible people that bleed students dry of all their money. DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL HATE IT! The food is awful, the people are awful, and you will be broke, fat, and lonely at the end of it."
College Junior,1,"Since we're in the middle of nowhere, we (if you go to a party) have to drive 30-45 minutes to get to one."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid officer, ML, has no interest in helping students unless she chooses to. She is difficult to get in touch with and takes weeks to answer e-mail and calls, if she answers at all. She has been my worst experience at Erskine. Rude and unsupportive. If it weren't for some of her colleges I would not have gotten any help at all."
College Senior,1,Public transportation is not offered at Erskine because it is not needed.
College Senior,1,"There is no night life to speak of. Most people go off campus to party. Some people stay behind and do fun things, but mostly the campus is quite at night."
College Junior,1,"This is the huge drawback to attending a small private college in a very small community. There is no nightlife at all, period. We have to travel to Anderson or Greenwood, SC (Anderson is better choice), and their over 18 nights are weeknights which make the 40 minute drive there and 40 minutes back a pain."
College Junior,1,"Very Little Acceptance – I come from a very liberal background and education in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools being in their magnet program. This college is not for someone wanting to come in and share this type of view. It's a private, ARP college and their views are narrowly confined to the Christian right. I have had gay friends here who struggle, as well in the fact that I'm a Democrat, and that's not something I make public here. The students are very narrow-minded for the most part, with a few exceptions of athletes. I feel like the students are bigots and don't accept much different than what they are."
College Junior,1,"Subway or a Mexican Restaurant ONLY – We have two restaurants in Due West, SC and that's a Subway and a Mexican Restaurant. Now in my third year, I don't care to go to either as it gets old. You can drive to Greenwood for a variety of chain spots (25 miles there and 25 miles back)."
College Sophomore,1,Not Heard of Any!! I've not heard of many internships via the college helping you find one. I've been trying to get one with Disney and Erskine doesn't seem to work with them.
College Sophomore,1,"The good thing is there actually is the Student Center for this small school, but bad thing is it only has a couple ping-pong tables and billiard tables, along with some televisions in the study/quiet area hooked to it. No one really uses the dorm areas, because it's so small and whatever they tell you CABLE does not come FREE at Erskine. They told me that, I asked if it was in my room fee and was told yes, but it's available if you individually sign up and pay for it at $60+ a month. Otherwise, you'd better like baseball, basketball, or soccer matches. That's what they have."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible Food & Nothing Around – I find the food in Moffat is really terrible and the offerings just aren't acceptable. Basically, now I eat fruit, salad, maybe a sandwich of turkey, and one/two other things there. The eggs are nasty, they won't let us take anything out such as a drink, etc. which frustrates me as I'm an athlete wanting to take juice with me. The little cafe that's open is all fried junk, and generally not good. The town offers only a Subway and Mexican (and the service there is terrible - food makes you feel bad). Otherwise, it's a 25 mile drive to Greenwood or 17 mile drive to Honea Path for again, fast food. The school feeds parents ""catered"" food, and us students suffer otherwise."
College Sophomore,1,"None? Very Little – Not much is available. Students must live on campus or be commuters, and it is very difficult to be able to stay in the nearby apartments."
College Sophomore,1,"Not many computers are available for use, and the ones that are available are quite slow and outdated. The printing service, WEPA, is pretty nice, though."
College Sophomore,1,"Erskine College tells you that each student is required to live ""on-campus"" and the only way around that is to have a circumstance. There are some that get the few apartments and homes for rent in this small town, but these places are far worse than the dorms for the most part. The only upside is they can have parties when they want, but campus police harass any students leaving from a party, and give them sobriety tests - so beware."
College Sophomore,1,No Life – Greek life is not prevalent on our campus. We have what are called Literary societies and needless to say they are kind of a bore...
College Freshman,1,Literary Societies – Greek life at Erskine are is very minute. There are only two male societies and five female societies. There are also a few secret societies that do things a few times a semester.
College Junior,1,"In Trouble Financially – This school is very expensive and they have a lot of hidden fees. Financial aid barely helps you. When you go into the office to ask for scholarship, all they tell you is that the school has no money to give to students and that the best option for the students is to take out a loan. Tips on getting financial aid; go online and fill out scholarship applications!!!"
College Junior,1,"Unfair School Policy – My school does not allow off-campus housing unless you have a serious medical condition, and even then, it is a miracle for the Student Services to give you permission to live off campus. There are a lot of available apartments and houses within 5 minutes of the school at very reasonable prices, however, the school policy states that ""all students must reside on campus."" This policy wouldn't be so bad if the room & board fee wasn't such a ridiculous price, costing nearly double or even more than other colleges. There are many students who take our loans every year just for this unfair housing policy."
College Student,1,"Normally they do not allow students to live off-campus. Only in ""special"" cases are people able to live ni apartments. I'm not sure why this is the case."

Freshman,5,"Alabama State University has opened my eyes and has been a wonderful help now that I have stepped into the real world. The academics have already proven to be challenging but extremely relevant and helpful as I continue through each semester. The school had the perfect hospitable invitation for me and that is why I have had a great experience being in attendance here thus far. Lastly, the staff has always been full of teachers that have had the will, the confidence, and the availability to help me with all the challenges I have experienced. Therefore, this all has made me highly optimistic of my prolonged enrollment at Alabama State University."
Freshman,5,Alabama State is a very outgoing place there's room for everybody to be who they really are. We put education first here at Alabama State but there's also time to bond. Professors are very understanding and are willing to help any student. At Alabama State everybody is somebody.
Senior,5,My experience at Alabama State University was wonderful. The staff and professors are very friendly and helpful. They ensure that you business is taken care of.
Freshman,5,"Being at Alabama State University for my first year of college was amazing! I met some of the most genuine and kind people and had some awesome professors throughout my year! I do plan on attending for the rest of college and high hopes of graduating in 2023 and also returning for grad school! It is such an amazing environment and very hands on! I appreciate everyone who helped me get through my first year of college, they truly made it a breeze!"
Freshman,5,All of my online classes were hands on! If something was misunderstood they would be more than happy to meet up with you either in a library or even emailing back and forth was worth it! None of my online professors made me wait for a response if I had questions about any assignments!
Sophomore,5,The education I found at the Alabama State University was delivered by a host of accomplished and caring professors and faculty. Our professors knew our names and wanted us to succeed. Many HBCU offered classes and extracurricular activities that could be harder to come by at other schools. The courses offered at Alabama State University give me a one-of-a-kind opportunity to explore African American history and experiences.
Junior,5,"I am an Art major so I don't have much to say about any art classes online. Pretty simple just take a picture of your work and submit it on Blackboard. We only did that due to Covid-19. Otherwise, Art classes are not online! I have taken Voice and Diction online and it went pretty smooth. It depends on the Teacher you have as well. Every teacher is different. My teacher took it nice and easy for us. We had weekly assignments and they were always due Friday by 11:59 pm. Due to the Coronavirus I ended up finishing my World History class online as well and it was not bad! He posted the study guide and the study guide was basically the test and you were good to go if you did the study guide. If you take any online classes and you never did it before, I recommend you set an alarm throughout the week to make time to do your work for the class. Just do not forget you have an online class to take care of as well. I made that mistake in my first online class."
Junior,5,"Alabama State, in my opinion is a great HBCU! The student body and staff act as a family. We have great staff members that really show a great amount of support to students. There are minor things about the school such as how they choose to spend the money around campus and with financial aid. We need another dormitory because we have so many students that attend! When it is time to apply for housing it is complete war! Once housing runs out there is always a long waiting list to see who ends up not showing up to their room when school starts back. My experience freshman year with housing was that the online portal to housing had crashed and my friend called me and told me there was no more housing within the first 5 minutes it had open. They hosted an apartment fair! I couldn't afford that. I went all summer applying to other schools to transfer. Thankfully last minute I got housing two weeks into the school year! One thing about this school you have to be quick to get a room!"
Junior,5,My online learning experience with Alabama State University was very nice. The professors made sure that the material was planned well and taught thoroughly.

We also got to see the cheerleaders and i think the hype squad. We meet the VP learned about financial aid and different scholarship opportunities. Also talked with other departments and was giving information for the students and the parents benefits. We also viewed the academe. The student union and the eating area. Very nice campus. My daughter cannot wait to get get started I have never seen her so excited about anything like this before. This is going to be a great experience for her. We are just waiting on her school to submit her test results. She is sweet bright young lady."
Niche User,5,"Alabama State is an amazing HBCU! They care a ton about our culture and the people who attend. The dorm rooms should be fixed up, but for the most part, they're decent living spaces. I love the interactions between the whole Alabama State community!"
Niche User,5,"I don't go to Alabama State, but after the tour of the school, Its almost impossible to say I don't want to go.  The campus is very calm and put together well. Coming to a new part of the country was really nerve racking, but the students here made me feel as if I was family."

Also, it built up my character to be a over achiever; to give it my all no matter how little or big. The faculty Further more, If there’s anything you want it life, work towards it with a 100 percent effort. The professors are willing to help you through any and everything. Moreover, everyone tends to uplift each other, so everyone will succeed. Alabama State taught me to never doubt myself  because, “if it is to be it’s to be me”."
Junior,5,"My experience attending Alabama State University has been amazing thus far. Transitioning from Southern California to Montgomery, AL was indeed a large change in pace but it was not difficult. I felt at home once I walked on campus. I had no problem in transitioning from what people call ""city life"" to ""country life"". The hospitality there is beyond amazing and a friendly environment. Here at ASU, professors care about there students, it is not just another pay check to them. Professors are able to get give and receive that 'one on one' connection with their students because classes are 20:1 and they are willing to work with you in order to not only pass classes but to obtain your degree.I am so grateful that I was not only able to attend this university but I am grateful for everything it  has provided for me thus far."
Senior,5,ASU is an excellent university to get a degree from. I have learned alot from there since being there two years.  The dorms need to be updated and thats about all.
Junior,5,"My experience here at Alabama State University has been very positive, also the school is very helpful and always helping others when their needs are available. Also, Alabama State University has a lot of events that help the students with their social life and etc.. While being in college I experienced a lot of things with the student life and financial problems. But majority of the time my problems are always getting handled constantly. A lot of students always complaining about the school offices and also complaining about the staff (professors). Lastly, all of my school years I have stayed on campus and enjoyed the campus life! But this year I wouldn’t be able to because of the tuition."
Niche User,5,"My overall experience with Alabama State University was honestly great. I felt welcomed to the campus, once I step foot on it. Going on the campus made me realize that I'll be on my own soon an that I can't wait for my college experience."

The students are advocates about their African-American heritage and learn more about the struggles  and advantages of being a Black educated man or woman in America. The teachers are willing to assist students in any way possible, even by sending students emails about job openings and internship opportunities. The university hosts job fairs every semester to increase the students' chances of obtaining a job or career after graduation. The university can improve the living quarters by updating the freshmen dorms."
Sophomore,5,Alabama State University is a historically black college with 150 years of educating young students. The professors are very knowledgeable and you are guaranteed to reach your highest potential along with getting to know yourself and others.

students. The small community like atmosphere really makes campus life feel ""homey""."

Alum,5,Alabama State University is an amazing university. The university has great teachers who are concerned about the whole student. The campus is beautiful with great parking areas. I have no problems calling the head people of any department talking to them about the concerns of my child who is a student there. It is so wonderful to have a school that is only a phone call away for parents. ASU also took care of all my needs when I was a student there. Go Hornets!!
Sophomore,5,I think that Alabama State University is great I can tell along with my peers that my knowledge has expanded tremendously. That has much to do with my professors here at Alabama State. This is only my second semester here. I feel as if I have made the best decision.
Freshman,5,"I really am glad that I made the choice to attend ASU! The school has been nothing but great since move in day back in August. From student life to the actual academic life, everything is great."

College Sophomore,5,From the time I been here I have not had any problems with any of my professors.
College Sophomore,5,"There are many options to get internships, because opportunity is here and Alabama state will do everything possible to make sure you get that opportunity."
Junior,4,Alabama state is truly a great school to attend. There are many fun and exciting activities to do on campus. The instructors are simple to get along with and very understanding. You are sure to be prepared when you leave.
Junior,4,"I currently take most of my classes online. My instructors provide me with the correct information in order for me to be successful. Although I have to take a little more initiative, it is preparing me for bigger things. I enjoy online classes for the most part, but I would rather be able to interact with others."
Senior,4,"No, I didnt take any online courses. But if I do I hope that the communicate skills be the same as in the classroom."
Graduate Student,4,My online experiences have been pretty good. My class material was easy to access and most of my professors provide timely feedback.
Graduate Student,4,I love the school pride. I have enjoyed being a part of the hornet family. I have had a pretty good experience overall.
Sophomore,4,Professors unload assignments and power points on time every week. If I didn't understand any of the assignments. I could  set up a meeting with  my professor  or attend one of their classes the next day.
Junior,4,"What I like about Alabama State University is that there is a family atmosphere as soon as you step foot on the campus. Everyone is super friendly, caring, and supportive. Professors are willing to work patiently with students to make sure that we understand the material that is being taught in class. Sporting events on campus are fun as well. Students come out and support their peers, no matter the sport. But, there is always room for improvement. The dorms need to be fixed, and we need to have better food options in the cafeteria. There are a lot of fights that happen on campus, and when we have problems with our Financial said, we barely get any help. People who work in Housing and Residence Life never answer the phone. I love attending Alabama State University, but we need to make changes fast."
Freshman,4,"Alabama State University is amazing. Nice people, great professors, manageable workloads,etc. There is always Something to do there. You will never just want to sit and your room. Parties are always fun. You will definitely make friends at ASU because most people there are nice and accepting and always willing to help."
Junior,4,I love the home feel of Alabama State University. The student body and staff are very welcoming and want to see you succeed. The only thing I would change about the university is the roads in and around campus and out dated dorm for the students that live on campus. They really need some help work.
Freshman,4,My experience at Alabama State University has been a very good one. So far everyone that I have met such as faculty and staff have been generous and helpful. The professors that I have had so far have been really well at being able to instruct on the material given and I have learned so much already in my first semester. Something that I would like to see improved is more subjects and areas having professors that can instruct well due to comments from other students.
Junior,4,Attending Alabama State University has given me the opportunity of meeting new friends and new and improved ways of paving my academic endeavors for a great lifestyle and career. Being away from home if rarely felt because of the “home like” and loving environment the university gives to each and every one of its students.
Freshman,4,"It is always a great time to be a ""hornet"" at Alabama State University. The Greek life is amazing. Even the cheer team has their own strolls! Our 
Volley ball team has been doing so good this season too. Every college/university has it's problems so ASU is not any different. The dorms could be better. We have been having problems with the elevators not working or only one is working. Also our cafeteria is under construction or something and it just look so ugly."
Freshman,4,"Although, I would like to see more activities on campus rather then off campus the overall experience is pretty good."
Sophomore,4,"Alabama State University is a historic university. It has many well credited programs to offer such as College of Education, College of Business, College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. Along with its educational benefits, the University, offers a great deal of history for its location in Montgomery, Alabama."
Sophomore,4,"In college, we expect a lot of things our first year: new friends, new life, new experiences. While ASU met my expectations, there are a few flaws about the school that could be fixed, but no one seems to care about most flaws. But overall, my experience at ASU has been nice thus far. Go Hornets."
Freshman,4,Very great experience so far with student government and meeting great staff. On the other hand my mother has ran into some faculty being not organize in the financial aid office since the end of may and different discrepancies going on with my financial aid to where it look likes I owe some money then turn around and a loan that I never received then look it back off then told my mother it was a mistake.
Sophomore,4,"I am only a sophomore and I would say ASU is a great school. Housing and financial aid is a major issue at ASU. The professors are nice and sometimes understanding. It is a great environment and the student body help each other. ASU is like a family, I have met amazing people here. I would recommend any high school senior, just like HBCUs  or transfer student to attend here."
Sophomore,4,I really My fellow classmates mostly the students but the housing and financial aid need a lot of work very unorganized .
Sophomore,4,I love Alabama State it’s the place to be. I had a very good experience with them and I plan on going back to purse my dream job. The people there was very friendly and helped me out a lot.  With classes and everything.
Sophomore,4,Its a nice size campus. Not very many students in class which gives the teacher a better chance to help you more if needed.
Niche User,4,"Alabama State is a public university located in Montgomery, Alabama. As a historically black college, Alabama State has a strong history of and commitment to the education of black Americans."

Freshman,4,"Thee Alabama State University is amazing. Campus is beautiful and historic. However , it is in montgomery."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman here at Alabama State and I can honestly say I am enjoying my experience here so far.

I would recommend ASU to any high school students, transfer students and anyone else looking to attend an HBCU!"
Freshman,4,"Alabama State University has a variety of enthusiastic students, staff, and professors. Everyone on campus is always eager to help you in your time of need. Since I have been on campus I have had many great experiences, especially during football season where all students get together as a family to have a celebration. Alabama State is one of the greatest Historically Black Colleges in the state of Alabama."
Junior,4,The campus always has something going on. And the teachers will always try to help on your assignments as much as they can. But overall my experience at Alabama State University has been fun
Sophomore,4,"When I first got to Alabama State University I was in a total amazement. I just loved everything about the southern culture by me coming from Indianapolis.  Also, my roomate was awesome and we just so happen to both share the same major and interests. The althletic teams were always fun to attend. When it came to football and basketball games everyone was always in. In addition, after the games they would always finish out the night with a celebration.  Eveything about ASU, whether it be academics,staff,students,etc.I always got the best experience. However, there are somethings I feel could be changed and made better. For instance, some of the dorms are in desperate need of remodeling. I say this because there is mold in peoples bathrooms, problems with elevators constantly, plumbing issues,etc. I could go on and on all day about the living situations in some of the dorms.  Overall, I have had a pretty good experience but there is definitely some room for improvement."
Freshman,4,I would like the deadlines to be extended. I believe that the students who were late to apply should be able to still apply for scholarships and housing. This would allow more studetns to apply here if it was their last option.
Junior,4,I will be an Junior this upcoming fall. My experience at Alabama State University has been very interesting. Attending an HBCU is hard because you don’t see diverse on a daily.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy attending Alabama state university (ASU) , because there is so much history behind the school and how it started . Also everyone is so kind and willing to help you out . The staff and faculty go out their way to make sure , any question or concern you may have are  answered ."

I personally want to become a dancer for their football team which are called ""Stingettes"". The mascot for Alabama state is hornets and that's the football team name."
Niche User,4,My Alabama State University visit went very well. I was introduce to man well-mannered individuals and escorted around campus.

Everything is very hands on working with the teachers to ensure you get the education you need is key at Alabama State University.
Sophomore,4,"As a freshman, I did not get out much and the school was pretty average to me. However, for my sophomore year, I stepped out of my comfort zone and I LOVE it here."
Freshman,4,"At Alabama State University, all of the staff were helpful and welcoming & made my first college experience very comfortable. They gave me a very detailed campus tour and made sure that I was aware of the location of all buildings to prevent me getting lost. I met students who participated in a little bit of everything such as athletics, theater department, campus ambassadors, honors college and Greek life- and they all gave high regards of the school. I can't wait to attend this fall!"
Sophomore,4,I attend the Alabama State University. Alabama State is a cool and exciting school. Just like any other school it has its days.  Most of the teachers there attended that school and they help us learn the history of our school. The changes that I would like to see from my school is organization. They just need to be a little bit more organized and they will have a high enrollment rate.
Niche User,4,I liked that Alabama was so kind and accepting. They give you a chance and believe in you. The people are so nice there and the area is also kind. The school allows and accepts students from many different backgrounds. Each person on campus is treated equally. The school is helpful when it comes to your future or career.
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the environment it brings but I would love to see the places around it beautified.
Sophomore,4,Alabama State University is a great HBCU. The atmosphere there is wonderful. You get meet different from all over the United States and other foreign countries. The people are friendly and kind.
Niche User,4,Great HBCU. Campus life needs improvement but a lot of great people come from this school. The history there is rich and the culture and love here is amazing. An experience I will never forget.
Junior,4,I have been with Alabama State University for several years and I love that it has come from behind to be one of the best looking HBCU's campus-wide. its rich heritage has to be one of the richest heritage hence-forth. I believe if Alabama State University works on its turnaround time with students paperwork it will be more efficient to the University and most of all the students and parents.  i enjoy being part of the Alabama State University and it Academic environment that it provides.
Sophomore,4,Going to Alabama State University is a great experience I love everyone school spirit there. And most of everyone is like family.
Sophomore,4,I attend Alabama State University and it is a wonderful experience. I do not live on campus and I have heard the dorms aren't that great but I can tell you that the professors that I have had were very good and they really cared about what they were teaching
Freshman,4,My experience here as a freshman was challenging but the staff were very helpful and encouraging. My RA became my mentor.
Freshman,4,"First off, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to apply for your college scholarship. My name is KarLee Turner. I am a freshman at Alabama State University majoring in Business.

My experience here at ASU have been phenomenal. The instructors are great and I have been doing well in my classes. My decision to go to college has been the best choice I have made thus far. My goal is to graduate and open my own business. However, right now I am having a hard time paying for college and really need help with my tuition.

Please consider me as your recipient and I will make sure I represent your establishment with dignity and honor."
Freshman,4,"My experience at ASU has been an overall eye opening one. ASU has opened my eyes to life as an full time college student, the culture of African Americans and how we can live, study, learn, and have fun together. I like ASU because it feels like home although there is some changes I would like to see happen which are the female dorms, more workers for a cleaner campus, and more chicken in the cafe!"
Freshman,4,"Overall, I just like the whole environment because you will never feel left out no matter where you are. It's an easy place to make friends and maybe find your true love, if you're patient. one thing that can be changed is the café food. We don't like to eat the same stuff once and a week or eating pizza that has thick cheese."
Senior,4,"The only thing i would like to see change is the cafeteria food. Besides that there isnt much else to change about this college. Student life here is awesome once you find the right people to hangout with and the right professors to take for courses, its full of great history and wisdom and some of the parties here make it that much better. Other resturants in and around campus makes up for the food in the college cafe but overall any student will really enjoy the student life experience at Alabama State University."
Senior,4,My experience at Alabama State University is great 👍🏽 I'm not finish but so far it's been treating me well.. Being on the football team seeing how that life is and also having the wonderful experience of running track as well.. Just the whole vibe and just being at a HBCU is priceless..
Freshman,4,"I love Alabama State university for many of reasons. One would be because it's an HBCU school & you'll learn things that you've never knew before. Also, I like the food choices in the cafe and on campus. I love how there's always something to do on campus no matter what day it is so you're never bored. "
Freshman,4,So far I like attending ASU. The professors I have are welcoming with open arms. They are always willing to help you with any problems you may have. The only thing I would like to see changed is renovating the buildings. Some of these buildings are so old and run down. Overall ASU to me is I good school to go to. 
College Senior,4,For the most part our sport life is ok. We aren't always the best but participation from students make it worth while.
College Sophomore,4,Being an athlete is very time consuming but even though athletes & non athletes are treated equally.
College Sophomore,4,"Parties are always off campus, they're pretty fun. The only problem I'd say is that people don't really dance and the Djs need to expand their variety of music."
College Junior,4,These departments work pretty well here at my university. Some of the staff can be a little rude but overall they're helpful. I remember the having a good experience with the recruiter who came to my high school and helped me apply.
College Junior,4,Most of my teachers are great and I built great relationships with them. I have only had one bad experience with a professor. The class sizes are also good. It's large enough to have a nice size group but not too big to the point where the teacher will never know your name.
College Junior,4,I don't know of anyone who has been sexually assaulted at my university. I know of some people who were attacked for money on the outskirts of the campus but that's about it.
College Junior,4,We have a group of students who are a part of a club organizatiowho basically cheer at main sport events like basketball and football. They are really fun to watch and keep a great energy at games.
College Junior,4,They help me and offer tutoring
Freshman,2,So far I would not recommend this university to anyone else. The customer service at this school is extremely poor and a handful of the faculty/staff that works here has terrible attitudes towards the student body.
Freshman,2,Alabama State University was like a second home to me. The students are always lively and volunteering to help each other. I'd love to see bigger and bolder titles on the buildings so newer students can know if they're going in the right direction.
Junior,2,"My experience has not been the best at Alabama State. The staff is not attentive as they should be, they had a very high turnover within the past year that has made financial aid hectic and enrollment decrease. One thing I can honestly say that I like about Alabama State is that it's an HBCU. One thing I'll like to see change at the university is more attentive staff, better communication when it comes to students and staff, just a better overall experience."
College Senior,2,Honestly the most our campus police are worried about is giving boots for not having a parking decal! The community around our school isn't the best but we deal!
College Senior,2,"campus housing is probably the worse thing about my school. I haven't had to deal with it in a while but when I did it was a headache. Its mostly just getting housing thats the worse, and some of the dorms really need an upgrade!"
College Freshman,2,the campus police will harass you for no reason
College Freshman,2,A lot of students don't really care about their grades and they just came here to party.
College Freshman,2,"Some professors seem like they don't care if you succeed, others seem like they do."
College Freshman,2,There aren't a lot of this to do on campus that catch my interest. The people here are kind of rude and look at you like you're crazy sometimes. This just wasn't the right choice for me.
College Freshman,2,"Housing selection process was very stressful. It say first come first serve yet it resulted in the website crashing twice then selection based on classification. Not everyone got to select housing. The dorms aren't very nice, they're small and not very homie. It cost ranging from $1,300-$2,800 based on which dorm is chose. I feel that every dorm should be equip with a kitchen for people's use. Elevator maintenance is a big issue. Roommate will be a person's biggest problem because of there living choices and way of life."
College Freshman,2,Every man for themselves here
College Freshman,2,It's all bad can't even explain
College Freshman,2,I have mold on the ceiling and the maintenance people have yet to fix and they never will fix it.
College Freshman,2,"I would've believed attending this school would be for me, but it's not. The lack of school spirit due to the university just attacking students just for the money. It's not right at all."
College Sophomore,2,They don't have many scholarship options unless you are an incoming freshman or an athlete. Those scholarships are great though.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm grateful I live off campus. The food choices are unhealthy unless you're really healthy already. Athletes struggle, people like myself with health issues struggle, and vegetarians to be well nourished on campus. Others often say they wish they had better and healthier choices. The cafeteria is often used because they have to, very few people look forward to it."
College Freshman,2,Alot of people tell me that its hard to find it.
College Junior,2,off campus housing is horrible if you do not have a car. The shuttles run too far apart
College Junior,2,finicial aid is the slowest department to me.
College Freshman,2,There are not enough places and the few that is near are very expensive.
College Freshman,2,"I the scholarship program is very poor, I have a good GPA and am qualify but was told that there is no money in the scholarship program. I was not offer any incentive or help scholarship wise. I really need financial help toward my tuition ."
College Sophomore,2,The workers at ASU do not care about your well-being and how hard it is to get financial aid. Students including myself are trying to stay in school but the workers make it so hard because they do not do their jobs.
College Sophomore,2,The food is terrible and sometimes not cooked all the way.
College Sophomore,2,No place is open after hours really.
College Freshman,2,I didn't get the amount of aid I needed. I am an out of state student which means I had to pay out of state fees and the financial aid that I did receive still didn't cover half of my fees. I had to come out of pocket a lot of money and it was a hassle.
College Freshman,2,"If your an out of state student, try to get a lot of scholarships to pay for this school."
College Freshman,2,Its not much to do but sit in the yard or union and look at the same people everyday.
College Freshman,2,The dorm I live in is bad.
College Freshman,2,"In order to insure that your financial aid was processed, you have to continuously contact them and stay on them in order for something to be done."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is not good, it is difficult to find close housing"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Each time I have gone into the financial aid office, I have met with someone who has given me a quick-fix to my problem, without looking up my account. With doing this, I have always had to come back because I hadn't received valid or enough information based on what the administrator gave me. Each time I have felt rushed and felt that the person was inattentive towards me."
College Junior,2,There is no help for students from the staff.
College Junior,2,"As an out of state, individual student, I am trying my hardest to get as much aid help as I can without taking out many private loans that I have no help paying back. It's hard for me to pay off college with having a large balance each semester, but I'm trying to get through it by applying for scholarships or anything I can to make it easier on myself."
College Junior,2,I think the campus needs to lighten up. They're strict for no reason. It is college and the students just want to have fun in a safe way and enjoy their college experience.
College Sophomore,2,"Students party at the same clubs, and it's pretty much just ASU students. Underage nightlife sucks, and the transportation to get there sucks if you don't have a car."
College Sophomore,2,"In the financial aid office, they are basically just there to have someone there. I don't know any time that I have went in there and they have helped me right away without sending me to a different department first. The university as a whole has money in trust funds and grants in which they can help more students that they do without us having to take out loans and owe them more money than what is intended."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at Alabama State is not the greatest. Anyone parks on the campus regardless on if they have a decal, or not."
College Freshman,2,our greek life on campus is very bad
College Freshman,2,"I hate being cold, and for most of the time that we are here it is cold."
College Freshman,2,there are a lot of crimes that go unnoticed and I feel that the campus police could do a better job.
College Freshman,2,They overprice for a ride anywhere
College Freshman,2,They do not know proper procedures
College Senior,2,"It comes as no surprise to anyone who's been this campus long enough that the Wi-Fi sucks. It goes on and off and is periodically shutdown leaving the campus without internet service except on school connected computer and even then sometimes it won't work. The labs get crowed fast as does the library. And in the old dorms such as Bessie Estell, there usually isn't any Wi-Fi or its severely broken. They are working on it but man. Pretty much all the labs have a 10 page printing limit and for some you'll have to pay."
College Freshman,2,It's pretty much everyone fends for theirself no one looks out for the students
College Freshman,2,I NEED a car on campus. Freshman are oppressed
College Freshman,2,There are not many things to do off campus. the local atmosphere can be very dry and it can also be a bit unsafe if your not careful. its a very small town but most people respect the college students . 
College Freshman,2,There is no consistent transportation except for when going to a party and you ride on the club or organizations free shuttle. The bus service is pretty bad and so are the taxis. Its a small city so there are not a lot of forms of transportation  especially on campus. it would be very beneficial to have a car.
College Freshman,2,overall do not attend Alabama state
College Freshman,2,im tired of paying money to go to parties that always gets busted by the police 
College Freshman,2,well its a hbc school so most of the students are black
College Freshman,2,there is only a sonic and burger king 
College Freshman,2,Doesnt really have a lot of choices 
College Freshman,2,There was a point that the whole campus wifi was out for like a month it was really terrible
College Freshman,2,its really hard to get financial aid 
College Freshman,2,I pretty much gave up on looking for a relationship down here 
College Freshman,2,They need help with athletic materials and the teams
College Freshman,2,"Housing is bad; all dorms, except New facilities, need to be desperately renovated. There are elevators that need to be properly fixed and some rooms have mold in them. Stay away from Simpson Hall if of male species and stay away frome Bessie Estelle if of female species."
College Freshman,2,there okay they keep you interested
College Freshman,2,"dining halls are nice, food sucks"
College Freshman,2,team performance is pretty good
Senior,1,"This university cares about us as a mass, as a collective group, because that is where your numbers, money, and other necessities are based on. But when it comes to an individual student, no one tries hard, no one asks questions, no one CARES. I promise I will let the WORLD know how you operate as a business, school, and as a family, and it is not pleasant. Not even to mention the shootings that they NEVER talk about. They try to cover up the bad to get more students but its dangerous here and your students WIL NOT be taken care of.People have died trying to attend an ASU party and its just not worth it for me. I am SOOO done with this school and I cannot wait til I leave here. It is has been absolutely the WORST experience of my life."
Junior,1,"Alabama State University has a wonderful student body. However, we happen to be lead by people who earned degrees for a paycheck. The faculty and staff could care less if we make it to be successful or not. Financial and and the cafeteria have to be the biggest flaws of the university. As much as we complain as students, no one hears us."
Freshman,1,"Small campus . That's is the only thing I like about the campus . If thing I would more things to do IN Montgomery Alabama. 
."
Junior,1,"I attended ASU for only one semester before leaving. A lot of people were dissatisfied with having chosen the university and were transferring.

The condition of the dorms were terrible. It was something you would expect from a third-world country.  There was dirt on the floors and walls, and the elevator was full of dirt, and always broken down. It was very common to find trays of food sitting in the hallways or stairwells. Also, the university's cafe was not sanitary due to students leaving their plates on the table. I often had to push plates of food out of my way, in order to  have space to dine. 

The university's staff, especially financial aid, was disorganized and generally disinterested in assisting students. They were very dismissive, slow-moving, and lacked a sense of urgency. 

In fact, this university almost destroyed my education. Before attending this place, look at all other options! You will thank me for the sound advice later!"
Freshman,1,"My experience has been bad the dorms are really dirty the class rooms as well and i haven't really learn anything here, admissions is very unorganized and rude many people are leaving here."
College Freshman,1,Hate living in towers its filled with mold and elevators always stop working on move in and move out day having kids have to walk stuff from the 11th floor down to the lobby
College Freshman,1,There is no diversity on this hbcu campus
College Freshman,1,the housing needs a major makeover
College Freshman,1,People will smoke anywhere on campus including the dorms.
College Freshman,1,People from the near by public housing can walk right on campus without being asked for any identification or being told to leave the area.
College Freshman,1,There's always something wrong with something in the buildings. They never come to fix anything. The visitation rules are too strict so students crowd outside and cause all types of disruptions. It always smells like marijuana and cigarettes in my dorm.
College Freshman,1,DO NOT STAY IN BESSIE ESTELL !!!
College Freshman,1,Mold everywhere and very nasty
College Freshman,1,Campus has mold in some of the dorms.
College Freshman,1,I don't really like fast food that much.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office is a headache. My mother had to call several times just to get the answers we needed.
College Junior,1,"I've been to many other college campuses and I can honestly say that State has the worse dining hall and staff. They are lazy and complain about serving the students food. The food is not edible on an everyday basis. I personally got sic from the cafe once and couldn't eat for 2 weeks. Also, it closes way to early and that is inconvenient for the school. Food is a big part of our nutrition, all we want is to be able to eat great food In the cafe without being insulted by the staff."
College Sophomore,1,The campus needs more space for parking that is not so far from the dorms.
College Sophomore,1,Alabama State revolves around the varsity sports. The school does not care about anything other than what brings them money.
College Freshman,1,ASU is a historically black college.
College Freshman,1,The faculty is very conservative. I had a teacher who was a preacher who hated white people. I feel judged constantly for being transgender.
College Freshman,1,Does not even exist here. Can't get off campus with no car
College Freshman,1,"Nothing happens on this campus solely because there is a ridiculous amount of rules. Freshmen aren't even allowed to have cars on campus, and there is no transit system."
College Freshman,1,Locals constantly come on campus but they are pretty friendly.
College Freshman,1,"I should be able to visit my friends whether guy or girl, I am NOT a child, and college shouldn't treat me like one"
College Freshman,1,"Its an HBCU, so there isn't much diversity, but my friends are the most diversified"
College Freshman,1,The students on campus are either in a gang or fresh out of jail
College Freshman,1,its hard to find rides down here
College Freshman,1,dorms are terrible i found lizards in my room almost all the time
College Freshman,1,Terrible they dont do anything to fix it
College Freshman,1,Its terrible its the same thing every day
College Freshman,1,not the type of college i expected 
College Freshman,1,There is nothing around except Sonic and Burger King and Subway; we have a Subway on campus so that doesn't make it any better. 
College Freshman,1,"It is terrible, we have the same things every week and there's no diversity. Cafe hours: 7-9:30; 11-2; 4-6:30. And thats Monday-Friday."
College Freshman,1,This city is for old people; everything closes after 7 and there is nothing exciting surrounding the campus within 10 miles. 
College Sophomore,1,The staff is not all that great. It was a pain trying to get my paperwork together so I can have my financial aid...and the amount I have is still not enough. 
College Freshman,1,There aren't many scholarship options available. I received the Dean's scholarship for full tuition fees and books. I took out a loan for my housing and for some reason they took some of my loan money for tuition that is covered in my scholarship.
College Sophomore,1,Parking permits should be apart of the tuition of school and more parking spaces available be available. In order to get to class on time you must arrive thirty minutes in advance to find a parking space.
College Junior,1,"I am at my limit for federal student loans and have to seek scholarships and private loans.  ASU does not have a lot of scholarships available to me, none this semester. I have had to seek outside of ASU for scholarships."
College Junior,1,The weather is very bipolar in my opinion. in the summer it is very humid but it can rain at any moment you just never know. There is also plenty of tornado warnings.
College Senior,1,Parking is extremely limited! The tickets and fines make it even worse. It is very important that they resolve the parking issue.
College Junior,1,"There are no 



 for students who lives off campus and do not have a vehicle"
College Junior,1,Our dining hall is lovely and if you dont visit often it  might look like a buffet.If your a frequent visitor you will soon get tired of the poor quality meals sometimes spotted untensils and unhospitiable attitudes.
Recent Alumnus,1,"the parking situation at Alabama State University is extremely high, because not only do they charge so many fees, now they want you to pay 100 a semester for a parking permit.i dint understand why they dont take it out the tuition."
College Freshman,1,"The cafeteria is horrible. It was recently reviewed by the state board and their grade was a 74. There are rodents inside the facility and it is very unsanitary. In addition to this, the hours are very inconvenient and there is no flexibility for students who have late classes. Primarily speaking, if you miss dinner (after 6PM), you must find your own way of eating for the night, or you could buy food inside the union."
College Freshman,1,The drug scene is terrible. It is not hard to notice the students who frequently partake in drugs and alcohol at Alabama State University.
College Freshman,1,"Public transportation at Alabama State is awful.. There is a city bus available to use, but it is very inconvenient. The buses run every 30 minutes, they do not run on Sundays, and you must ride several routes if you seek to shop at places that are not on the route. There is no flexibility with the public transportation system. For the most part, if you do not know anyone with a car, your experience with transportation is going to be very unfortunate. However, there are shuttles on campus, but for the most part they are unavailable to students."
College Freshman,1,Some days the café food is good. We recently found out that our school's café grade was a 74.
College Senior,1,"At times it seems as though no one knows what he or she is doing. You get the run around. You have all these nice new facilities and etc. but have the same old people doing the same old things......nothing. I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it has been an awful experience. As bad as the sounds, Alabama State may benefit by being run by white people. Some of these people are arrogant yet incompetent. My thing is, if you don't like nor want your job, move on to something else and leave the attitude behind. Not all are like this, but many are. You can't tell them that they are wrong. You pretty much have to stand over them to get things done and ain't nobody got time for that. I am in my 30's and I need my degree. They have a long way to go administratively and they also have too many unnecessary fees."
College Sophomore,1,The campus police can be strict on students but it seems like students can get away with a lot if they are semi discreet about it.
College Sophomore,1,"The dining hall does have options but not very many because they serve the same type of food on a regular basis, not very much variety. There is especially not a big variety of fruits and vegetables. The food is not always of good quality but I do understand they have to cook for a lot of people. It would also be better if it stayed open later than 6:30 pm."
College Freshman,1,"I'm from the city so the atmosphere is very different. You have to have a car to do anything here, but freshmen cant have cars so its very difficult to do whats needed."
College Freshman,1,Alabama State is not that diverse but i would think that that is because this is a HBCU. You will find different races other then just African American though.
College Sophomore,1,You have to stay on to of your account and make sure you're getting all you can get.
College Sophomore,1,Never Again – State is very slow when it comes to finacial assistance. Then they will mess up your finacail aid also
College Senior,1,Parking on campus can be really upsetting. You have to be on campus 30 minutes before your class just to find a parking spot. the parking is very limited and there are so many students with cars.
College Sophomore,1,financial aid at my school sucks. they are never there to answer the phone or never return your calls i still dont have financial aid here
College Senior,1,"Hard to Receive Money – Building takes most of the money, so most cant get work study or twenty hours. It kind of sad."
College Senior,1,"We most defiantly need more parking for students. This is a huge campus, and most classes are 10 minutes away walking distance from the dorms. For off campus students if they only have classes in one building, most of the time they] cant park close to the building, which can be very dangerous at night."
College Sophomore,1,There is next to nothing around this campus. They have no college town or anything like that. ASU was built in a bad spot. They are quickly losing space to expand.

Freshman,5,"So far Saint Anselm College has been an excellent small school. Courses are interesting and excel at stretching students to their full potential. Professors are knowledgeable, personable, and helpful. The community and social life is great, with new and interesting things happening every day, even during the times of Covid."
Freshman,5,"Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, Saint Anselm has been using a combination of in person, hybrid, and online courses. The hybrid and online courses run very smoothly and have been a great way to access material in new ways, making the best of the current situation."
Alum,5,"As soon as I first set foot on the Saint Anselm College campus in late 2015, I knew it was the perfect school for me. During my four years there, I got to know so many fantastic people, both fellow students and faculty, that have shaped my life and led me down life and career paths I couldn't even have imagined. I had the absolute best time here, and I strongly encourage anyone looking for a close-knit college community with tons of opportunities to take on leadership roles and get to know everyone on campus to apply here!"
Sophomore,5,"Saint Anselm College is such a community based school where everyone genuinely cares about each individual's happiness, success, and wellbeing. It has a good balance between a good education with connections for careers after your 4 years and a very fun party scene on the weekends. It is a second home, not just any college."
Sophomore,5,"Through Covid Saint Anselm College has put in tremendous effort to keep the education of the students up to the same standards as it was before. Although students are on campus, many classes are online and meet through zoom."
Senior,5,This school has become my home away from home! Through professors I have been able to access my true abilities and passions. I have created friendships that will last a lifeline. This school is a community built to support each other!
Niche User,5,"I'll be attending Saint Anselm in the fall and I've visited there a few times in the past year. Saint Anselm was the only college that I applied, to simply because I knew it was the school for me. I've never met anyone at Saint Anselm- student, faculty, or other- that have been anything less that kind, caring and compassionate. I've never met anyone associated with Saint Anselm College that has been in the least bit unpleasant. Its not just the people- Saint Anselm offers amazing courses meant to fit students of all backgrounds, interests, and learning capabilities. I believe that it's not only the perfect school for me, but for anyone seeking a quality, faith-based education. I couldn't recommend Saint Anselm enough and I can't wait to go there in the fall."
Niche User,5,"I have never taken any classes online, but I imagine the online options at Saint Anselm are fantastic."
Sophomore,5,"Saint Anselm is an amazing school. The professors, students and faculty are so welcoming and whatever personality you are and whoever you are you will find a group of friends who love and care about you and include you in anything. Academics are challenging but fair, and everyone is eager to help you if you are having any struggles."
Sophomore,5,"We did the best we could out of a simply bad situation, everything obviously was not ideal. This campus seeks and possesses an inherent value in face to face learning and online learning does not fit our mission statement nor our philosophies of teaching and learning, which is something I praise highly for the college."
Niche User,5,"When visiting Saint Anslem, I greatly enjoyed viewing the campus and the life of college students. I am looking forward to seeing what steps come next in my application process! I hope to be accepted into this school to begin my future degree. The campus is clean, organzied, and values the students present. I hope to discuss my potential presence at Saint Anselm College and potentially be accepted into the school next fall!"
Freshman,5,"Amazing, no negative things to say about this school. Everything from smiling faces and opening arms when entering the town to doors open and someone guiding you to your destination, absolutely everything is amazing."
Senior,5,Beautiful school. Has high expectations for students. Does prepare you for the real world. It is a must for you to get involved and be a part of the campus community.
Sophomore,5,The community in every sense is strong and great. The classes are a challenge that the students can take on and thrive in.
Alum,5,"The academics are challenging. You will have to put in a significant amount of work to do well here, but you will graduate ahead of your peers. Your professors all know you by name and truly care about you. Additionally, there are great opportunities for internships including grants for students in unpaid internships. Saint A's has some of the most genuine and kind people I have ever met. This place is special-- you won't regret making it your home."
Niche User,5,Nothing at all because it’s a good university to go to in the state of New Hampshire. The school is great and fun to watch their sports teams play.
Junior,5,"I love the community atmosphere the college has. You walk around and see familiar faces everyday, and that's something I love. The professors are also always willing to help if you ask for it."
Freshman,5,"Saint Anselm College is a small school on the edge of a small city. It is a close knit, religious community that will pick you up in your time of need. Students and faculty alike are very involved in academics, athletics, and in the community."
Senior,5,"Saint A's is a wonderful school. We have been rated in the top 100 friendliest schools. We are taught not only how to grow up, but how to grow up as Anselmian's. Whether that means holding the door for someone who is 100 feet away or inviting the person who is sitting alone to come join you for food in the dining hall."
Niche User,5,"This is a very nice college. People are very kind. The professors are always willing to help out. The student life is thriving, they also have very good facilities. There are many extra curricular activities  to partake in and the food is very good."
Junior,5,"Saint Anselm College is my home away from home. There is a huge sense of community there - with peers, faculty, and staff. The teachers there never want to see you fail; and the classes are small enough that you can easily get one-on-one time with a professor if you are struggling in that class. Everyone on campus is very friendly and easy to talk to; you can easily make friends on a daily basis. Getting involved on campus is also very easy, as there is always something to do. I strongly recommend checking out Saint A's; it's an amazing school that gives you so many possibilities."
Sophomore,5,"My decision to enter Saint A's is probably the best I've ever made so far in my life. I love my classes and my professors and I've made some of my greatest friends here. Even as a commuter, I have not felt disadvantaged or left out when participating in school functions. Saint A's has a very challenging curriculum with professors who want to get to know you and help you succeed. Everyone is so welcoming and accommodating  that it is hard to feel left out in the wind. My only wish is that they would expand their dormitory and dining facilities to help better serve the rapidly growing student body."
Junior,5,It's a good academic school. I really enjoyed it since I've been there. The food is really good and unique I really enjoy the closeness of the campus due to it's size. The people are very nice and the teachers are understanding and care for you education as they should.
Freshman,5,"Absolutely love this school. Everyone is friendly, students and faculty alike. If you are looking for a small school, definitely consider Saint A’s"
Freshman,5,Yes it was a great campus and amazing nursing program. Everyone was polite approachable and friendly.   The sense of community was inviting.
Freshman,5,"So far, Saint Anselm College has been a very good experience for me. People are friendly and there are lots of things to do. The Institute of Politics is a fun place to go to events if you like politics. The academics are challenging, but manageable. All in all, it is a good college."
Sophomore,5,Small enough that you don't feel lost. Yet large enough that you feel like your not seeing the same people every time you turn around. Campus is gorgeous too.
Sophomore,5,Saint Anselm was the best decision that I ever made. I feel at home here and I know that I am growing as an individual through classes and connections I have made here. I have become involved in a lot of activities on campus and have meet my best friends here. I feel that when I graduate I will not only be ready to face the work force but will be a great nurse.
Junior,5,Saint Anselm College creates a liberal arts monastic community inviting to people of all backgrounds. The school makes you feel at home from the first move in day freshman year and throughout your four years. The class size allows for an interactive learning style and comfort of your professors. 
Alum,5,Great place. Love the professors and food and campus in general. Basketball was very competitive and games were fun to watch. Close to Boston for weekend trips and Manchester is awesome as well
College Sophomore,5,Friends of mine got really great internships!
College Freshman,5,I love everything about Saint Anselm College and I can't imagine myself anywhere else. I've had enjoyable classes with professors who are passionate about what they teach. I've fallen in love with both of my on campus jobs. I've enjoyed the activities and clubs on campus as well! I have nothing bad to say.
College Freshman,5,"I loved living on campus! Nearly everyone lives on campus which makes it feel even more like home andplays a big role in our student life. I loved my residence hall, which was a typical double, single sex hall. My roommate was chosen at random and it worked out so well. The campus is small so the dorms are generally close to all classes which was also great."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Saint Anselm! I've had great professors in classes I've enjoyed. My favorite thing about the school is that everyone is knows each other and it is a tight knit community, because it is a small school. However, that being said, we still have opportunities that allow each of us to be a part of something bigger than ourselves; whether it's on a city level through volunteering in the Manchester community or on a national level through working for the presidential debates!"
College Sophomore,5,As a nursing major I'm pretty much guaranteed a job if I can survive this program
College Freshman,5,"The professors truly make the school. They are so great, they know you all by name and make a serious effort to get to know you. The professors are truly exceptional."
College Freshman,5,Feel very safe on campus at all hours.
College Freshman,5,Nice big room warn when they are supposed to be and safe
College Freshman,5,Campus Security is readily available. Students are also very supportive and also will stand up and help out in bad situations.
College Freshman,5,"Courses are challenging, but professors are very supportive and approachable."
College Freshman,5,"When I first visited Saint Anselm's I was take back by the incredible sense of community and friendliness that encompasses that campus. At first, I thought it was just a part of showing off the school, but with my freshmen year coming to a close I know now that these aspects at Saint Anselm are genuine. Saint Anselm College also showed to be more challenging than I expected. Teachers, faculty, and students challenge each other daily, not only in academics, but in being a better version of you."
College Freshman,5,"Again, it all comes down to the student community. And our sense of community is extraordinary."
College Sophomore,5,"Night life is what you make of it. Typically majority of students party on Saturday nights. Fridays most stay in to study or relax. There are definitely groups of students who go out Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Those students are often fatigued and dont do as well in classes. These students also get transported to hospitals for alcohol complications. Transportations can happen to anyone. If students dont plan on parting there are several other opportunities for weekend fun including: game nights, student oriented activities and more."
College Sophomore,5,I always feel safe and supported no matter the time of day or location on canpus.
College Sophomore,5,All of my professors have taught me a great deal about their field of workZ
College Sophomore,5,Most are determined to do thier best.
College Sophomore,5,"As part of the local Delta Gamma Zeta chapter, I would definitely say Greek Life at Saint Anselm College is wonderfull. it is a great opportunity to branch out and find a group of young women with the same/similar interests. If you do not choose the Greek Life there are plenty of other ways to make friends and branch out. Greek Life however is a great option."
College Sophomore,5,"Saint Anselm College provides students with opportunities to engage in countless opportunities which fulfill students academically, physically, emotionally, socially and spiritually. Professors are eager to guide and aid students. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Class sizes are small and effective. Saint Anselm College is the best College for me, and I would highly suggest this atmosphere to anyone and everyone."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love the department I am studying in. We have excellent professors who are passionate about their work, and about student success. I also really value Saint Anselm's philosophy, theology, and humanities requirements. I ended up taking classes with students and professors I wouldn't have normally interacted with, and that was very positive. Some of the classes outside of my major were some of the most life-changing."
College Sophomore,5,"Saint A's has one of the best local reputations around. Nearly all our nurses get hired immediately out of college, a ridiculously high percentage of students are hired or engaged in service within six months of graduating overall, and students generally feel very well prepared for life from their experiences."
College Freshman,5,I have never felt like I'm in danger on or around campus
College Freshman,5,The nursing program is wonderful and well known
College Sophomore,5,"I love Saint A's. It's a campus with a very family centered feel to it. It is a home away from home. My professors are great, my friends have the same goals and drives that i do and I could not imagine being anywhere but here."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience of college so far is great! I love my school so much i have meet great friends, professors and staff members, everyone treats one another like family and it has a great environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Saint Anselm College was the best possible decision I could have made. The professors are caring and help students work toward success, the community is fantastic with lots of emphasis on service and involvement, and the students are a hardworking and respectful group. I've made a strong group of terrific friends and have had new and informative experiences in my classes. One huge benefit to choosing Saint Anselm is that I can start right away with my major classes; as a double major I've already taken four classes out of eight toward my majors as a freshman. My only regret in the college process is ever applying anywhere else: I knew fro my sophomore year that I wanted to go to Saint Anselm and it has lived up and more to every expectation I had."
College Sophomore,5,"After my first year at St. A's, I know I picked the perfect college. I wouldn't change my decision if I got to choose my school again."
College Sophomore,5,"From the horror stories I have heard from the dining at other schools, this school has some of the highest quality college food around."
College Sophomore,5,This school takes everything serious especially when it comes to safety of the students.
College Freshman,5,Nothing beats home-cooked meals at college.
College Freshman,5,They have rules in place but they are not followed- I have no complaints!
Alum,4,"I had the second half of my senior year online due to the onset of the pandemic. My professors were all super helpful and did their best to help everyone learn. Obviously it wasn't as good as in-person instruction, but I feel like I still learned a ton in my classes and everything was organized very well."
Senior,4,"Online learning was a struggle, but it could have been harder. My professors were ready to help with anything they could. They responded to emails on time, were more flexible with deadlines, held extra zoom help, and so much more."
Freshman,4,I love the sense of community at Saint Anselm College. The people are always willing to help each other out and the professors will do anything to help you succeed.
Junior,4,"It is a great school! Close community, pretty well oriented within the community via businesses, families, individuals, etc. The curriculum is academically challenging, but there various resources to help with that. The professors are pretty understanding as well as all of the staff."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community Saint A's has, however the academics is very challenging. The teachers are willing to sit down and help you if you need it and if not then their are free tutors for every class. The rooms at the school are great, filled with wonderful people in the halls, its never dull at Saint A's. CAB is an organization that works very hard to provide fun things for the students to do."
Niche User,4,"Saint Anselm College is a close-knit community of well rounded people. Everyone on campus is engaged in some sort of extra curricular activity. The community of Goffstown, NH is amazing and there are grocery stores, a library, and entertainment nearby. It's a great college mainly based on politics and science, but everyone should look into it."
Alum,4,This campus is beautiful and the people are the friendliest in NE.  There are really cool professors that really care.  Not the hardest to get in but they make you work once here.   I played soccer and the team is great and improving.  I found a good mix for the student athlete.
Freshman,4,"Everyone gets along well, very much a hold-open-the-door-for-everyone kind of school. The only downsides are the academics: it's wicked difficult compared to other schools in the area. It's called saint Cs for a reason. To get into the Honors program you need a 3.0 GPA - which takes actual effort to get. Nursing and Politics are some of the best and more popular majors on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled at St. Anselm's one thing I love is the small close knit community. The professors here truly care about all of their students and take the time to get to know them and help them succeed. Some of the issues I've noticed here are the huge lack of diversity, as well as lack of housing for the increasing student sizes."
Niche User,4,"St Anselm is nice because it's got beautiful buildings, it's small and has a nice community.  The classes are super challenging, but you learn a lot and grow as a person."
Sophomore,4,"College is the perfect size. Professors are super supportive. All the college staff know one another and are extremely helpful. Dorm life is stressful for freshmen males due to large dorm size and small rooms with no AC. Weekends are a bit of a challenge due to cabin fever and out of control hormones. Food is really excellent, especially C-Shop. Academics are tough but fair. Professors should give a bit more feedback in support of the grades they give out."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Anselm College is my home away from home. I could not imagine myself anywhere else. This school offers amazing academics and a variety of sports and clubs to join on campus. You have to be willing to work hard as classes are not easy, but in the end it is definitely worth it. Saint A's has traditions like no other school and I will carry these on for the rest of my life. Saint A's will always have a special place in my heart and it was the best decision I have ever made when coming to college."
Alum,4,"Saint Anselm College is an amazing institution. It has a rigorous academic curriculum that challenges students. The on campus monks provide a sense of respect and community, whether its in the classroom or in the pub. The campus is constantly trying to be better and is always moving forward. Not to be undersold, the food on campus is amazing! Although the general student body is fairy homogeneous and middle class, there is an ongoing push for diversity."
Junior,4,"I am enjoying my experience at Saint Anselm College. The campus is beautiful, safe, and you feel at home here."
Sophomore,4,"I'll simply go over the pros and cons.
Pros
-Excellent Professors. I have had a few that were just alright but other than that they have been extremely knowledgeable and really care about the individuals
-Great community. Small school so you know a lot of people you live around. Everyone is very friendly with each other
-Provide students with good community service opportunities

Cons
-Wifi is terrible. On the weekends if you want to watch some Netflix or something there is a good chance you will not be able to
-Opposite gender is not allowed in each others dorms except for certain hours of the day. Yes you read that correctly.
-Some of the RAs are cool but a lot of them talk down to their classmates"
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed Saint A's so far. I like how all the students on campus are so friendly and nice to each other. However, I would update the freshman dorms as they are out dated."
College Sophomore,4,People make choices and they are responsible for those choices you cannot go to school here and have an addiction problem just won't work.
College Sophomore,4,No issues we see security all over campus
College Sophomore,4,"Diversity is a key component to the life of the campus with much diversity, acceptance, and of great reward if you venture outside of your dorm room. Everyone has a story and if it is shared among the campus community. The campus is known for its political involvement on all side of the political arena without prejudices, party followings, beliefs or agendas."
College Sophomore,4,Life on campus is great. If I had to commute I'd be late for class because of the traffic on the major routes around the college. Some of the dorms are the older but very functional and kept up well by the facilities management group. Activities are college planned generally on Fridays and from time to time there's a concert thrown in there. There are club teams students can join or just be a spectator and free skate is available at the ice arena on a scheduled basis.
College Sophomore,4,"The college has a great looking baseball field, newer football field, multiple soccer/lacrosse/field hockey fields, a hockey arena, and separate athletic field house. School support is echoed throughout the campus even in the bookstore. Campus is full with alumni supporters on game days. The greatest experience is Freshman Move In Day... The Hawks Football Team moves you into your dorm as an incoming freshman."
College Sophomore,4,There are no boundaries place on one's ethnicity we are one collective of students with a common goal to enhance our education so we can make a difference in our society.
College Sophomore,4,The campus maintains security phone/beacon poles throughout campus and much of the walkways are light at night. Campus Police (Campo) patrols the entire campus day and night by vehicles or bicycles and enforce college regulations and parking adherence to the letter.
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network is enormous and growing each year.  Some of the leading hospitals, science and research centers, government agencies, and local community businesses look to hire upcoming graduates.  The career center/services on campus puts the student in contact with alumni recruiters, local businesses, hospitals, and various outreach centers for volunteer, part time employment, internships, and even final placement."
College Sophomore,4,"The 18 to 1 average student ratio has been a big help in my studies. The professors genuinely care about the students and their retention of covered material. The professors are some of the best in their fields of instruction with longevity with the school. The class offerings are of a good number from Biology to Theology with classroom, lab and lecture style class environments. The college also offers study abroad programs and community outreach initiatives."
College Student,4,"From what I have seen and heard about, the security guards seem friendly and helpful to students."
College Student,4,I do not really know much about the sports here yet.
College Student,4,"From what I have seen, the people here seem really nice and willing to help with the questions I have."
College Freshman,4,"Alumni pride goes a long way, which is a great benefit to graduating students! Furthermore, the career services provide us help with resumes and cover letters to land the job of our dreams."
College Freshman,4,"I always feel safe on campus. We have a blue-light system in place which is a great asset to the campus. In orientation we had a lot of training on how to prevent, avoid and deal with sexual assault. There are some incidents that I've heard of, but they were resolved efficiently and properly."
College Freshman,4,"Sports at Saint Anselm are a great way for students to get involved. The teams are generally pretty good and a lot of people attend the games, especially the football, hockey, basketball, and baseball games. So many students are also a part of club sports for fun, which makes sports even more important to student life!"
College Sophomore,4,"I have had great professors. The work is back breakingly hard, but I'm going to leave this school being really well prepared"
College Sophomore,4,Saint A's is a fantastic school
College Freshman,4,"Not terrible, pretty average I think"
College Freshman,4,"Love the people, the professors really make it."
College Freshman,4,There are weekly opportunities shared by Careers Service for internships and jobs.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are greatly supported especially when there are events such as ""Pink in the Rink."" Faculty and students come to events to support their students and friends."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very accepting of all students. That is what attracted me to this school the most. Everyone is very friendly and accepting.
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school, but the number of classes needed to need fill the core curriculum and the difficulty of classes make it a tough school."
College Freshman,4,"I've always felt very safe on campus and have never had a bad experience. Students, the administration and campus security seem highly committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all of us."
College Freshman,4,The spirit of community among students has made all the difference to my first-year experience. The upper classmen and staff who worked with incoming freshmen to help us make the transition were outstanding and the programs were very effective. Opportunities to participate in extracurriculars are exciting. My only reservation [albeit a mild one] revolves around the regimented course requirements.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus. There are always campus police driving around and visible on campus. I do not know of any issues with safety.
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are great, just right for me. I wish there was more of a variety or more electives offered each semester. Professors are mostly great. If you find the right one you want to keep taking their courses."
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. I have a job close by so I have my car on campus. Parking is not the best however, across campus! 3 flights of stairs is not ideal. Close knit group on my floor is great."
College Freshman,4,Sporting events are a huge part of St. Anselm. Games are always well attended and a great time on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I love my school, classes are challenging, dorms are great, close enough to home for a visit when needed. Food is great!"
College Freshman,4,"When I first came to Saint Anselm College, I will be honest and admit that I felt as though I attended the wrong college. I was struggling to make friends, I had a hard time locating my classrooms, and the work load piled up so quickly that I felt as though I was drowning. After having one semester at Saint Anselm College under my belt, I love it here. I made a core group of friends, I mastered the layout of the campus, I accepted a job in the Psychology Department working as a teaching assistant, I joined an a cappella group, I've applied for a position in the Admission Office, I survived the first semester being in the Honors Program, and I attained Dean's List with a 3.58 GPA for the first semester. The sense of community here on campus is by far my favorite part of the college campus. Everywhere you go, the students are either smiling or holding the doors open for another student. No other college I applied to had such a strong sense of community, both in and out of the classroom, which helped me realize that Saint Anselm College is most definitely the college for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Saint Anselm College enables students to stay fit and healthy through variety of opportunities. Varsity sports, club sports, intermural sports, exercise classes, and a fitness center which includes an exercise room as well as playing courts for activities. Athlete or non-athlete fitness and healthy living ammenities are easily attainable."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was a commuter student, but I always felt safe on campus, even very late at night."
College Freshman,4,It's a small school but still has a lot to offer. It was a great choice for me
College Sophomore,4,I've found a bunch of good restaurants in the downtown area.
College Sophomore,4,My father said that everything went well.
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus is 10 minutes from Manchester center. Being a large city, the main street has many options to go eat from home-y diners to Mexican restaurants."
College Sophomore,4,My college is known for the great food and service. Employees are very nice and welcoming. The dinning hall is huge.
College Sophomore,4,"This college is super expensive, but it is worth every penny. I love the atmosphere and the people I am surrounded by."
College Freshman,4,As a freshman I haven't taken nursing classes yet but so far I have no complaints.
College Freshman,4,I got a wonderful merit scholarship. Thanks St. A's
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe on campus. Campus police are very nice and I have never had any problems with safety.
College Freshman,4,"I am a female freshman and live in Baroody Hall. The hall is quiet, clean, and welcoming. The common area and kitchen are dated, but it is not horrible. The dorm rooms themselves are the biggest I have seen, I feel very privileged to live in Baroody Hall freshman year."
College Freshman,4,Once you are an upperclassman the city scene is great. Freshman and sophomores tend to stay on campus.
Freshman,2,"The only reason you would want to go to this school is if you are very religious or you want to go into nursing. The campus is alright, it is small but it is a small school. Some of the facilities are extremely outdated for what you are paying for the school. It is needlessly expensive. The student culture was terrible, if you did not live on campus, you were a complete outcast. I have to say the food is actually pretty good."
College Sophomore,2,"Jocks go to the school expecting to be king, but we're a DII school"
College Freshman,2,You can only be in Greek Life if you are invited
College Sophomore,2,"I'm going to try to make this short, Saint Anselm College is not the school for everyone. Quick demographic of the campus, it's mostly middle to upper class Caucasians and the student body is mainly comprised of varsity athletes. With that being said, I feel like my environment hasn't changed at all since high school. Basically this college feels more like a high school to me and because of that I don't feel like I'm changing as a person here. To me, the college experience is about changing as a person so that you can become a leader in whatever field you choose. Despite my negativity, this is a great institution with a great name. But since I'm not getting the college experience here, I don't see a point in staying."
College Sophomore,2,"Most people that go to St. A's usually live on campus all 4 years, unless they commute from home. There is enough housing on campus; students look forward to living in Uppers senior year."
College Sophomore,2,It is the same food over and over with no variations.
College Freshman,2,"Since the school is so small there are few places to party and few new people to meet. People aren't welcoming and you can't get into a good party unless you know someone. Party scene for underclassmen is terrible, I'd rather sit in my room and watch Netflix."
College Sophomore,2,"People at Saint A's are not against diversity but Saint A's is about 97% white, it's not a bad thing but there isn't much diversity here but people are accepting of people with different backgrounds"
College Junior,2,We have a large political interest in general. The political views on campus are not equally split and that greatly affects how some people are treated. Some people are afraid to speak in class because the majority in the class will verbally attack them with other comments until the professor stops it. Sexual orientation is a huge issue.
College Junior,2,"There are too many cliques, it's a lot like a high school social structure. Many of the females openly admit to only attending college to meet their future husbands."
College Freshman,2,Campus is far from anything so if you don't have a car you're stuck on campus. Going out drinking is really the only option available aside from staying in.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are computers to use at the library, and then they are scattered throughout.  You definitely need your own laptop."
College Freshman,2,There is no need to live off campus when the on campus housing is good. There is suite style housing available to upper-classmen and nearly everyone finds themselves living on campus. 
College Freshman,2,Freshmen dorms are only co-ed at certain hours.
College Sophomore,2,Wish the people were nicer and there was more to do.  I love to be involved.  Have joined several clubs and still can't find my way here to loving the school or the people here.  I will come out with a good education but not much more.  
College Sophomore,2,Manchester is pretty spread out.  Has some terrible areas and average areas.  Has all the usual offerings.
College Sophomore,2,"Love my classes and happy with most of my professors.  Pretty campus, great food but this campus is lacking in things to do.  School has so little going on.  This is not the college experience you are going to get from any larger university where there so much more going on and so many kids to meet and do things with.  I would choose a larger school and one with a more diverse crowd.  If your not the cookie cutter average white girl with a catholic family, don't bother applying."
College Sophomore,2,"School is very strict on drinking.  No warnings.  First offense is fines, letters home to parents, meetings, and apology letters.
Seems over the top to me.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Girls are clicky here.  People are not outwardly rude but groups are small and they don't welcome bringing new friends in.  During the week, study groups and things like that are all good but the weekends are bad.  There is NOTHING going on on campus. The school is very strict on drinking so its all done in someone's room. There are just a couple kids in a room,  sitting around drinking...boring.  If your not into drinking, there is nothing to do..I mean nothing and no one to do it with because some kids go home and the clicks are behind closed doors.  I know some kids are lonely here, the social situation is just sad.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Most students are white, catholic and from New England.  Very little diversity here."
College Sophomore,2,"Manchester Airport is close by, no train stations.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Much of the housing is old.  Most freshmen are in forced triples which is so tight, no room to do much other than sleep and sit at your desk.  R.A's are nice but do nothing to bring the dorm residents together, its all half hearted efforts.  Doors are closed a lot in the rooms, not a fun welcoming environment.  The campus is small so walking to classes is easy.  Standard lottery system for housing applies."
College Sophomore,2,The parking on campus can get a little crazy come break and move in days. They recently just got rid of one parking lot which made it harder for the freshman girls to move in. There are other places to park but the commuter and student parking spaces are far removed from the class buildings so it's a bit of a walk to class if you drive to school everyday. Even visitor parking can be a hassle.
College Senior,2,"Eat on Campus Unless You Have a Car – Saint Anselm is set back in the woods, but is only a ten minute drive from downtown Manchester. Since there is no public transportation system, unless you have a car, you will need to eat on campus (which isn't a problem, our food is great!) But there really are no options within walking or biking distance."
College Freshman,2,"Good Quality, Terrible Quantity. This next year, I am one of 70 in-going sophomore girls without housing. The in coming freshman class is big as well, so there aren't really any places to put us, but they have to guarantee housing. So I'll be tenting it on the Quad.  Other then that, they do a great job of keeping it clean."
College Sophomore,2,"Bring a Car! There is public transportation in Manchester, but it is unreliable.  Everything a student needs is on campus, but if you want to travel off campus, be sure to bring a car or go out with friends who have cars."
College Freshman,2,Boring and Lame – I mean there are parties at uppers at stuff...but if your looking for a good college party dont go to St Anselm. The students think their partying so hard but honestly St Anselm parties are no better then any high school parties. There are no bars whatsoever there's The Grand thats only available to students Thursday nights. You can only get places if you have a car. They have no shuttles or anything.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are mediocre (besides the freshman girls dorm, which is nice), and the housing lottery process is absolutely awful. Sophomores are stuck in sub-par dorms without kitchen access or reliable internet connections. Once you become an upperclassman, housing improves significantly, although its ridiculously difficult if you or one of your intended roommates plans to study abroad, since the school does absolutely nothing to accommodate you."
College Sophomore,2,"If You Want to Stay Healthy Without Going Broke.... Good Luck. The actual meal plan idea is good, pay with ""dollars"" to get the food you want instead of swiping for every meal. However, prices keep going up, so you end up with not enough money and you have to add it yourself. The quality of food is usually pretty good, but very repetitive seeing as there is only one dining hall and they rotate the menu every 3 weeks. If you're a vegetarian, be prepared to suffer some severe protein deficiencies because the ""vegetarian"" options are usually limited to pasta and salad. There's not a ton of healthy choices and the ones that are healthy, are very expensive. The grill line is the only part that serves breakfast food on weekend mornings, and the line can get ridiculously long so you just end up skipping the meal altogether and getting lunch. The coffee shop is a good alternative for late nights, but money there runs out fast too, and the menu never changes and there are once again not many healthy options."
College Sophomore,2,"Transferring is hard than getting in – I am a current sophomore who tried to transfer out. 

Last spring I decided to transfer, but because this schools blows so much.. it is so hard to leave. The applying part is easy, its just trying to get Saint A's to send out your information and transcripts.. something always goes wrong and asking them to do it takes weeks.. you literally have to go see them on a daily basis.

Also, since we built our name around the ""Humanities"" program, trying to transfer credits is hard as well... because our requirements dont count as classes at other schools.. they count as electives. "
College Sophomore,2,"We have people who think they are ""Frats"" and ""Sororities"" but they aren't really. They are just people and created a group. There are about 5, but really only 4.. and only 2 are actually accepted by the school. The ""Greek"" life is a joke... they throw bon fires and have parties at the local club.. not the same. They are known as service groups.. because they have to do volunteer work through the year."
College Sophomore,2,"Gets Old – For the Freshman, when you first get here... the first maybe two months the food is good. but after, one would realize that they rotate the menu, and that they serve the same item more often. There is a sub station, salad bar, snacks and deserts.. but it really does get old. nothing ever new. Davison closes at 7, then students eat at the Coffee Shop, which is also the same. The menu never changes, and its all fried and greasy food."
College Junior,2,"Greek Students – There are no typical Fraternities on campus. The Greek students on campus are service groups that are funded by the school. There are about 5 different groups recongnized by the school. The do not have a ""greek house"" on campus but they group are able to through some decent parties."
College Freshman,2,"Not a Big Fan – I don't like it here. I came here because I thought the education was good, food was good, campus was beautiful and there'd be a great night life here. The education is good but so much to the point where you are buried in home work. The food is good but the meal plans are terrible as you have to have to budget your money and sucks if you're a big eater, especially if you're an athlete. The campus is beautiful but to small. Nothing happens on the weekends unless you're really tight with the upperclass men for parties. Rules are to strict. They need to get out of the 50s."
College Freshman,2,"SAC Sports Suck – The only good sports team is the Hockey team. The football games aren't even fun to watch. Most people don't even go to the football games. The best games to go to would be rugby, soccer, and hockey."
College Freshman,2,Living Off-Campus Isn't Worth It. I'm only a freshman but I have talked to many upper classmen and they all say that they have thought about off-campus housing at one point or another. 95% of students live on-campus simply because the housing is much nicer.  There are houses and apartments around campus but the rent prices are rediculous and the quality isn't as good as what you would get at school.  It's much easier to live at school because you are closer to everything and you don't have to drive all the time just to get to class.
College Freshman,2,"Sticklers for Rules – Underage drinking is taken very seriously on campus. Anyone caught is immediately written up and given either a fine or community service hours...sometimes both. The more times you get caught, the closer you are to probation. They do involve the police in extreme circumstances. If you're going to drink, drink behind closed doors or places where the RA's are less likely to frequent. Advertising your shenanigans won't get you anywhere good. The only other annoying thing is the intervisitation policy. Members of the opposite sex can be in each other's dorms during the week from 5pm-11pm, and on the weekends from 12pm-2am."
College Freshman,2,"Insufficient Options – The meal plan at Saint A's doesn't go by ""swipes"" - dollar amounts are deducted from a balance that should ideally last you the entire semester. There is only one cafeteria on campus...after it closes, you can use specially allotted money at the coffee shop. Food quality is great, choices can become a problem though."
College Sophomore,2,Drinking Is Fun – Pretty much everyone drinks. Not too many people smoke. A majority of the stoners get kicked out within the first two years
College Sophomore,2,"Fake Frats? There are a bunch of fake frats and sororities because the college doesn't want to be associated with them. They have some good parties, but they definitely do not dominate the party scene"
Junior,1,"Well where should I start. Residence life is horrendous. The security is atrocious. Completely open campus. Half the blue light security boxes around campus are out of order. Also, it is beyond cliquey. For lack of a better term, everyone is very “basic”. I do not recommend and if I go redo my college choice I would definitely go elsewhere."
Junior,1,Horrible!!! Professors had no consideration for personal circumstances happening in someone’s home. I am very disappointed.
Sophomore,1,"Gosh where do I begin. Housing is a complete mess. School cannot keep up with the growing student population which means all freshmen live in forced triples. College itself is extremely cliquey and made me feel like I was in high school again. Grade deflation makes it difficult to get anything above a C in any of your classes. Campus security SUCKS. Literally anyone can drive onto campus, which should not happen in Manchester NH of all places. If you want a school that will make you feel out of place, stressed out  24/7, and not safe, this college is definitely for you."
Senior,1,"Residential Life is horrible. They don't have enough housing for their existing student body, yet they keep accepting students. Soon freshman won't be guaranteed housing for all four years. I'm a senior guy; they mixed up my gender in their computer system and wouldn't let me participate in the male housing lottery, now I have to find a new roommate and apply for a room I don't even want."
Freshman,1,"the school is too focused on academics, rather than having fun. don't get me wrong, academics are definitely important but being able to relax and have fun in college is also important. All of the clubs are focused on academics. The professors have 0 personality and are not a huge help. I went to the academic resource center for help in a class and they basically told me they didn't have. tutor for me. most classes won't let you use your laptops in class which seems very antiquated. I've talked to friends in other schools and they all use technology in the classrooms. Most of the kids go out and party every weekend mainly because there's nothing else to do around campus.
I am not from New England, I live about 6 hours from the school. I've learned if your not from Mass. or NH then you don't fit in. its very cliquey and everyone stick to their friend group. its basically like high school all over the again."
Sophomore,1,They are known here in the area as Saint C’s and they live up to this name. The professors here are only concerned about keeping the class average at a 70 and will not be concerned for you should you struggle with anything.
College Junior,1,Greek Life is nonexistant unless you choose to be involved in the ones through campus ministries.
College Junior,1,Campus does not provide transporation. Their is a public bus that comes every day but it isn't very popular to use.
College Freshman,1,The wireless network on campus is very poor and slow
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to get alcohol.  Upper classmen have closed parties.  You can't just walk into any party scene around here.  Again, its all closed groups.  Hard to meet others."
College Sophomore,1,No one lives off campus because there is no close options for students.  
College Sophomore,1,This rating applies since i'm not 21 and can only go on what I've heard.
Recent Alumnus,1,"St. A's is accessible by public transportation, but there is only one bus stop on campus that goes to some obscure locations around Manchester and not many students use it.  You really need a car or a friend with a car if you want to go to some of the basic places in the area (WalMart, Target, restaurants, the mall, etc.)."
College Freshman,1,"Our sports teams are terrible. We never win any games at Saint Anselm. Our football team lost 45-0 the other day. It was a huge embarrassment However, intramural sports are fun if you do them with good friends, which is why this grade isn't an F."
College Freshman,1,"There are a few kids that manage to break the mold around here, but on the whole, the people are very cookie-cutter. Upperclassmen talk about how great of a community Saint Anselm is, and while people are very friendly on the surface, if you aren't a meathead jock, a socially awkward science geek, or a hot girl, you will feel very out of place here. Your social life will also be very dependent on whether or not you like to get absolutely trashed on the weekends. People head to the upperclassmen dorms (""affectionately"" nicknamed ""uppers"") any chance they get to drink, and they drink HARD. If that's your cup of tea, good for you! I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time at Saint Anselm. If you aren't what I just described, I strongly suggest you find another school to apply to, because finding your niche will be tough. 

Also, you better like Zach Brown Band, cause it gets played in the dorms every second of every day."
College Freshman,1,"Trashy Hicks, Dorm Parities, and No -21 Events. Trashy Hicks, Dorm Parities, and No -21 events. Nothing to do If you don't drink that much, no dance parties, lots of standing around, drinking beer outside of senior and junior apartments."
College Sophomore,1,"Dont Come to Play Football!! If your looking to play football, dont go! I played for 10 years and after 2 years with Coach Murphy, never again. I am now transfering to another D2 school to play. Murphy needs a physc eval! Most of the talent doesnt return for a second year. Possible steroid use on the team. Coach looks the other way. Players having rages in dorms. They need to get rid of him!! Tells us we'll get oral sex if we win. Who does that at a catholic school NOT COMING BACK"

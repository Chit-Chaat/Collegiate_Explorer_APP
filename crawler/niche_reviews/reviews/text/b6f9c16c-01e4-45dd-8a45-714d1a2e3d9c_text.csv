Freshman,5,I love the environment and the feeling of the campus. The people are so nice and friendly and the coaches are amazing.  I cannot wait unlit August!
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus, very helpful and cheery faculty! The tour guide was great, and the campus very walkable. Felt safe and the view is quite nice. The students seem quite engaged with the sports teams too! Very fun!"
Freshman,5,"I feel safe, cared about, and like my education matters here. If you get the opportunity to go here, please go!"
Junior,5,"As a student who has transferred to Le Moyne from a previous college, I can say that (aside from the cost) It has been an incredible experience. I would recommend this school for anyone who prefers a small community with very small class sizes and personable professors. Everybody is so friendly and walking around campus is just very comfortable and inviting!"
Freshman,5,Le Moyne is an incredible environment that connects its student through community. The community at the college is welcoming and more of a family than a college itself. The family community allows for connections to be made and friendships to be created.
Alum,5,I was a transfer student and it was a great school with excellent professors but mostly the students were caring and friendly. I am an alum now but am very happy with my decision to attend Le Moyne!
Junior,5,"Great experience! Professors truly care about your educational experience. Le Moyne College values diversity, academics, and athletics. Safety is huge. Security is constantly monitoring the campus at various hours."
Sophomore,5,"Le Moyne College has an excellent Biology program where the teachers go above and beyond to help their students understand the material. They are frequently available for office hours and even provide special hours upon request. The professors in the French program, however, are not the best in their field and the program itself could use some improvement."
Sophomore,5,"For those who like small colleges, Le Moyne is for them. It is increasing in its diversity and opportunities that it is providing. I would not change anything about this college; even the faculty and staff members are incredibly kind."
Freshman,5,"Le Moyne is a great environment. I have made such strong relationships after just one year. I'm sad when I leave, and am excited to return. In general, the professors are also very good. They know what they're talking about and care about students."
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at Le Moyne College. This was my first pick school after graduating from high school. It was close to my hometown where my friends and family lived. Since the moment I started at Le Moyne, I have loved everything about it.  The professors are wonderful, and the faculty are always willing to help students. I love going to school here."
Sophomore,5,"You feel welcome the moment you step on campus! The small size allows professors and students a wonderfully close relationship and students are afforded opportunities more on the scale of a larger university even though LeMoyne is small. While classes are rigorous, there also also numerous supports to help students meet the rigor."
Freshman,5,"Le Moyne is an institution that truly embodies social responsibility. They strive to create a compassionate community that is inclusive while promoting Jesuit ideals. Freshman year has been great so far, and the school is an excellent place to form connections while furthering academic skills. I would definitely recommend Le Moyne to anyone looking for a college that shapes the whole person and pushes them to be the best version of themself possible."
Freshman,5,"Pretty cool place. Attending in the next year. Lots of opportunities, good cafeteria services and some nice people. It’s a awesome place to go. Beautiful campus"
Freshman,5,"Le Moyne is a very safe environment and I am happy with my decision to attend college here. I feel like this college will set me up not just for the professional world, but for life itself. I could not ask for anything more in a college. Le Moyne has been great so far."
Niche User,5,"I went to a open house a few months ago and from the very first step I took onto the campus, I felt as if I was back at home! This college is a very small and connected college and it brings everyone together to form a close bond. I truly enjoy everything about it!"
Senior,5,"Le Moyne College is a small campus and offers small classes that I found very helpful and useful. Larger university classes weren’t for me, so Le Moyne was a perfect fit. The professors here actually get to know you and help you whenever needed, offering office hours and meetings by appointments. Le Moyne’s core curriculum requires all students of all majors to take different liberal arts classes, which I think is helpful for students who were unsure of their major starting out. The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control. My experience at Le Moyne has been pleasant since day one, and I’m proud to be a soon-to-be graduate from this college."
Sophomore,5,"I will be entering Le Moyne College as a transfer students on Spring 2018. I have not started school yet but with the times I have been on campus, I am definitely sure it is a great place and I know I will have a wonderful experience."
Niche User,5,"It has a small diverse campus that is amazing, caring and loving. Le Moyne college is a best fit for everyone. Staff, faculty, and students are very nice and welcoming"
Senior,5,"I'm a senior at Le Moyne, I feel prepared for grad school after studying at this fine institution. Almost all of my professors have earned their doctorate and have lots of experience living all over the world, including the career field I want to be successful in: consulting. Professors are easy to access including via text. Lots of tutoring available. There is an abundance of extracurricular events, including guest speakers from many nations, internships, work studies you name it. The institution is priced competitively with attractive scholarships. One more parking lot would do a lot for the college."
Junior,5,"I've had a great time here at Le Moyne. The Theater department is one of the best I've seen, and the whole school is held to the highest of standards. The campus is beautiful, the students friendly and intelligent, and the dorms are amazing."
Junior,5,Le Moyne is an absolutely amazing school! Their diverse core curriculum educates well rounded students and exposes them to a variety of fields of study. Professors are knowledgeable and are always available during office hours for extra help. If you're the kind of student who likes small class sizes and a more personal level of teaching Le Moyne is the place for you.
Sophomore,5,Professors are amazing and most always willing to help you out.  If you put the work in and stay active in the community your experience and return on investment will be optimum.  10/10 would recommend.
College Sophomore,5,"Not a lot of crime or violence happens on campus, but there are amazing resources for students should something occur."
College Sophomore,5,The community on campus extends to the sports as well! There is high attendance at sporting events. The athletic facilities for non-athletes are great too!
College Sophomore,5,I have loved my time at Le Moyne. It tuly is a family.
College Freshman,5,Ive had a great experience at le Moyne so far as a first year student. everyone is beyond friendly here
College Freshman,5,the security is always there for you
College Freshman,5,love the small class size. it makes the teacher more personable but it's makes attendance more mandatory.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone's welcoming, helpful and want you to do your best."
College Freshman,5,I took summer classes at Le Moyne College and I even stayed on campus. It was one of the best experiences in my life and i feel more prepared for the fall semester.
College Freshman,5,Le Moyne is very willing to help out
College Freshman,5,There are so many off-campus restaurants and stores to choose from. Wegmans is a go to at any time of the day or night.
College Freshman,5,"The freshman dorms are dry, so they will give you a warning and if you get caught a second time you have to pay a fine. They tell you that you aren't allowed to have boys past 2 am, but its a lie. Since you dont check anyone in, you can have whoever over whenever you want."
College Freshman,5,Many people come here for the large amount of financial aid given and the large scholarships they give out
College Junior,5,I feel safe on campus at all times. It's a small campus which contributes to this feeling.
College Junior,5,I really love how tightly knit the community is. Everyone is included and there's a lot of fun and safe Activities to partake in.
College Junior,5,"I've loved almost all of my professors and my classes have been interesting and fun, but challenging."
College Junior,5,Le Moyne is wonderful at accepting each and every student for who they are and encouraging individuality.
College Junior,5,"Just fill out all the forms on time and attend recommended meetings and all should go smoothly. If you're struggling to come up with enough money, call financial aid and ask for tips. They're very helpful and they may even hand over some more dough - just because you asked!"
College Junior,5,"The professors are just about all wonderful, willing to help at all times, and flexible. I major in Biology and Psychology."
College Junior,5,"The college truly just cares about its students and their well-being. Largely all of the policies in place are helpful, useful, and do not in any way hinder fun or learning."
College Sophomore,5,Courses are tough but need to work with professors for help. Class sizes good
College Sophomore,5,A lot to do in Syracuse
College Sophomore,5,Love the school and what is has to offer
College Senior,5,"Being an employee of the Campus Security office I can say first hand that the security officers are extremely dedicated to the safety, well-being, and overall interests of the students. All officers are very nice and are working hard to keep campus safe. There are always new software and technology updates being done on campus to improve this as well. Students who do not agree are misinformed and refuse to try to call security for matters they are unsure of as being security issues. All officers feel they are there to serve the students to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable and they display exactly that."
College Senior,5,"Syracuse is a great place for things to do on the weekends. There are a plethora of clubs and bars both downtown and on Syracuse University's campus. I think it is great that they are off campus because it puts a wall between academics and social life. If students do not want to leave campus to experience a social life, there is an on campus bar called ""The Pub"" where students can participate in trivia nights, bar night specials, karaoke, and other fun events. Also, once or twice a month there are shuttles offered to the local casino about 40 minutes off campus and a discount often accompanies this deal. The shuttle reduces any chance of drunk driving and the discounts allows more students to partake in the opportunity to get out of the city for a night. For students who are not of drinking age, there are always things going on at Syracuse University where students can take a cheap taxi ride with friends to and make friends at the other school. Also, there are several music venues where local bands play at decent prices and shows happen often. There is always something to do."
College Senior,5,"As far as school is concerned, school is school at Le Moyne. Many people come to college for the ""experience"" and only think about making friends, the night-life, and studying abroad, then they are upset when it comes to actual academia. At Le Moyne, professors know your name, you know your classmates, and you all work together. With that being said, there is a decently heavy workload. Whether or not you choose to see it that way reflects how dedicated you are to your education. Between the five classes each full-time student should be enrolled in on average, there is a reading workload of about 150 pages a night. That does not include the amount of pages which should be written on the subject or any worksheets or research which must be done nightly to keep up with the study. The material is as interesting as a student makes it. If the student makes it seem like a heavy work load, it is exactly that. However, if the student does the work for the love of learning, it is a hobby and does not seem so bad. I feel many Le Moyne students feel the same way and those who slack off for ""the experience"" would agree and still say the workload is too much. There are many places available to students where they can go to be more focused and where students who need assistance with that focus can go."
College Senior,5,"I have had a great experience at Le Moyne. There has been just short a handful of professors I have not enjoyed. If I did not enjoy them, it was because of teaching strategies I did not agree with. The other professors I have had are personable, reliable, and memorable. I have learned more from the professors at this school than I ever thought I would have. The courses offered are interesting and became progressively more so throughout my college career. I have grown more as a person than I thought I would. The Jesuit tradition at Le Moyne definitely lives up to it's claim of ""educating the whole person."" Class sizes are beneficially small. The student to teacher ratio is about 1 to 12 at Le Moyne. Some classes have more, some have less, but the professor always knows the name of every student within a few weeks. It really tells you something when you are paying big bucks for a degree and you are recognized as your name rather than a number. Overall educational experience has been much more than I ever could have expected to receive when I was first searching for colleges as an incoming freshman."
College Senior,5,"Le Moyne is constantly offering mock interviews, resume building workshops, and internship/ job fairs for the students. The career services office is open during normal office hours and there are staff members available for personal meetings with students to help work out any problems or worries students may have. The value of the face of Le Moyne on a resume, I believe, is very high. I have already had two internships, one of which has been paid, and I feel I had been highly valued by the team I was working for and learning from. They respected me in the work place even as an intern and noticed my desire to learn and do quality work. My one complaint is how much the school leaves up to the decision of the student in regards to career choices. I will be a senior this academic year and still have yet to figure out a path for myself post graduation but a college can only do so much for its students. It definitely opens a seemingly unlimited amounts of doors for its students to peer into and I think that is more than many schools can offer."
College Sophomore,5,I am not concerned about finding a job in nursing. I am happy with the career I have chosen. I am unsure if Le Moyne was the correct college to go to however.
College Junior,5,"Our Lacrosse team is one of the best for division II and our baseball team, soccer team, and club sports are well known for their success."
College Junior,5,"I love Le Moyne.  The professors, the students, my advisor, and all of the faculty on campus are very friendly.  I love the small school community atmosphere.  It is easy to get one-on-one personal connections with the professors that you have as well as with your advisor.  The priests eat in the cafeteria as do some of the professors.  I love the program that I am in, as well."
College Junior,5,I had no idea that Le Moyne existed.  I have vey happy that someone recommended that I go to school here.
College Junior,5,"Most people at school are simply average.  While there are a lot of dedicated students, there are also many who seem to do just enough to get by."
College Junior,5,"The campus is small, but it clean and modern.  I enjoy going to school here."
College Junior,5,The campus is always on top of taking care of any snow.
College Junior,5,I haven't had any issues with health or safety.
College Junior,5,Any student who is part of the Madden School of Business is assigned a mentor who is an established business professional.  This mentor is there to support the student throughout their time while enrolled.
College Junior,5,"I received a 3 different scholarships that I didn't even have to apply for.  One for being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa, one for being a transfer student, and another simply for maintaining good grades."
Freshman,4,"Le moyne took COVID in stride and has transitioned to an effective learning style that works well. Staff here are eager to help students and provide plenty of opportunities. I am only a freshman currently but I am enjoying my time here greatly. 
The community here on campus is super friendly, and despite having a larger than normal commuter population, everybody feels very included. Le Moyne does its best to provide it's students with a community and a good education. Highly recommend."
Freshman,4,Almost all of the professors I have met done a great job through zoom and provide an interactive experience despite not being in the classroom.
Junior,4,"online has been difficult, but many professors adjusted fine. There is a lot of work still, and the online factor makes everything seem harder."
Junior,4,I enjoy the community here at Le Moyne. I am very happy with my decision to come here as I have had great experiences and lots of fun! I wish the job opportunities branched further (maybe west coast). I also wish scholarships were more frequently available.
Freshman,4,"I took all my classes online, with some of them being hybrid classes (split between online and in-person). The professors utilized this platform well and made the material very accessible to students. All of the classes were organized into one webpage, Canvas, so they were very easy to keep track of."
Freshman,4,"This is a great school for those who like the feel of a small community. The teachers there are very personable and will often know you by name in their classrooms. That being said, there is very little diversity here because of the area and the very small size of the school. But overall, the classes are fulfilling and worthwhile."
Freshman,4,It is a very nice place to go to college. They make you feel welcome and like you’re at home. They make sure you feel comfortable and help with whatever you need. They have great classes and everyone is very determined to help.
Freshman,4,"Its a one in a lifetime opportunity.  The students, curriculum, faculty and campus are all exceptional. Its great studying at Le Moyne."
Freshman,4,"Le Moyne feels like home for me, being close to everything is great.  You can go to SU games for cheap through campus life and the staff is so nice.  Le Moyne also has a load of clubs and activities for students and they put on events throughout the year that really bring people close together, you meet a lot of new friends."
Sophomore,4,"Le Moyne College has been a great experience so far. There are many opportunities from academics to student life that enhance the experiences here. I really enjoy the friendliness of the campus between students. On the weekends, the school holds some activities. When times get busy, the campus has several resources available to students that are extremely helpful. Overall, I really enjoy being here at Le Moyne College with all it has to offer."
Sophomore,4,"I love it there. I live locally, but I spend more time on campus than I do off. It’s easy to find people in common and friends to hang out with."
Junior,4,"Wonderful liberal arts school with a wide range of personalities to fill it. The one defining trait that all students have is their dedication to doing good. Sure there may be people you disagree with, but from the health professions, to the business school, to the education department, it's hard to find a genuinely bad person. My only complaint is that the administration seems to not be able to decide if they want it to be a small suburban campus welcome to commuters or if they'd rather grow and become a campus more reliant on residents."
Junior,4,"Le Moyne College has taught me a lot academically, and about life after school in general. The professors and students have impacted my life for the better."
Niche User,4,The dual degree nursing program is very under rated.  It allows students to get their nursing degree earlier that the traditional four year programs.  The advantage in starting to be a nurse 3 years out of high school is fantastic.  Having that nursing experience my daughters senior year helped her get a higher paying job much sooner.  Makes over $75000 2 years removed from school with no overtime.  Thanks again to Le Moyne and St Joseph college of Nursing.
Niche User,4,"awesome small environment with a great educational experiment, going in as a freshman i am ecstatic about what i have already seen, i cannot wait for the journey ahead of me with students who want the best not for themselves but everyone around them"
Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes where there are less than 30 students in most courses. There are also flexible and tons of Professor office hours that students and go to. It's a small and cozy campus with events everynight from 30+ clubs.
Sophomore,4,"Being a commuter, I have met a lot of new friends that live on campus as well as commuting, too. I felt very welcomed during my first week of classes. So far my professors have all been helpful when I ask them for assistance with papers and homework."
Sophomore,4,"I overall really enjoy this college. I feel like it's an extension of my home. The people are nice, academics are good, and overall highly positive area. Everyone that asks where I go to school tells me that this school is a really good school!"
Senior,4,"Le Moyne is an amazing school with amazing people. Professors who do not even know you will greet you as you walk by. Professors are very friendly and understanding, they want to see you succeed. We have Linda Lemura as president, She is the FIRST female jesuit president. She is very friendly and actually connects with students on campus."
Junior,4,Great experience at Le moyne. Would not have chose any other school. Awesome considering it is a smaller campus! Loved everyone I meet there. Greatness meets goodness!
Graduate Student,4,"The professors are incredible. Not only are they incredibly smart, talented, and experienced, they really care about their students and will do anything to help them to succeed. I am proud to be an alumni and everywhere I go when I a representing Le Moyne I always receive praise about how good of a school it is. Campus housing and life is improving and sports teams are great."
Junior,4,Le Moyne is an awesome college. The environment is positive. Professors are always willing to help. Any one in any department is always available. Class ratio is a perfect size so that you can get to know your professor better as well as any classmates.
Junior,4,"Le Moyne is a great school. Really truly, an amazing school with a plethora of opportunities. College is all about what you make it, and I believe that I was set up to succeed at Le Moyne. They give you all of the tools to do things, but they don't spoon feed anything to you. You do have to work hard to be successful, and I feel like that helps contribute to life long learners. They lost a whole star with me for two reasons. Sodexo, their cafeteria, sucks. They don't make good food, and sometimes it's even inedible. Also, the parking. Seriously common sense, don't sell parking passes for spots you don't have. Year after year, they constantly have issues with parking. I don't understand why they haven't paved another lot yet."
Junior,4,"I love it at Le Moyne. It isn't a big school, and classes are usually very small so it is easy to get to know your professor and classmates. It's also near Syracuse University and there are a lot of opportunities to take classes there as well. I also enjoy the ease of being able to get to places without a car since there is a bus stop right near campus. The staff is great and they really try to get to know you and help you out in any way possible. There is also an awesome medical staff and they offer so many resources. I have made many great friends on campus and have gotten so many opportunities."
Sophomore,4,Your getting what you pay for here. The school is the same cost as a state school but offers a better education.
Freshman,4,"Le Moyne has very small structured class sizes which makes things easier when it comes to learning. Also this is a diverse community, we all come from different backgrounds. We come together and create my wonderful events together"
Alum,4,"Le Moyne College is in Syracuse, NY and is located close the conveniences of the city, while still offering the community feel of the suburbs. The professors are welcoming and often go out of their way to lend support to their students. The liberal arts education offers a unique experience which puts students in a position to explore different disciplines creating more well-rounded students. The opportunities to join clubs and travel through the school are both plentiful and cost effective. Overall, a Le Moyne education is well-worth the cost."
Freshman,4,"The college has a very ""home-y"" feel to it. Everyone is very friendly and creates a great environment to be in. I am happy with my choice to attend here. Every professor I have had has been very willing to help me if needed. I would recommend Le Moyne College."
Freshman,4,"Love the welcoming, community feel. There is always something to do, always someone to do stuff with. Love the campus ministry staff! Campus could feel a bit safer-anyone can just walk through at any time. "
Freshman,4,"Le Moyne college, even though the school is Jesuit, is a very open and accepting school. It has many active groups and clubs for minority students, and plenty of clubs just for fun too. The campus is quite small, but that can be a positive or negative thing depending on how you look at it. The only thing that is bad about Le Moyne is that this year there were so many freshman that the dorms are extremely crowded with people having to squeeze in extra roomates."
College Junior,4,"The professors care about students as individuals if you show interest and engagment in the class and material. The classes offered are interesting and there is flexibilty with the different type of material covered. The student generally have control of where they stand in a class, which entails responsibility."
College Junior,4,"I am personally not part of a sports team here at Le Moyne College, but I do go to the gym regularly. The gym is maintained very well and is alwas full of people. Also, sports teams are glorified, as are the athletes."
College Junior,4,Le Moyne College is a unique insitution because it is intimate and comfortable. Everyone is generally friendly and networking is easy if you become familiar with people. It is an engaging school.
College Junior,4,The school has taken great action against sexual assault.
College Junior,4,This school is very open and inviting to everyone.
College Junior,4,the dorms are all within a 6 minute walk to class.
College Junior,4,There is a good amount of school spirit on campus shared by both the students and the teachers.
College Junior,4,It has it's ups and downs but it's okay.
College Junior,4,I enjoy Le Moyne college.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are understanding and willing to work with you, course work is challenging but not impossible."
College Freshman,4,"Living in a quad with 3 people is great, plenty of room for all of our stuff and for friends to come visit."
College Freshman,4,Le Moyne is such a tight knit community and everyone is so helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are stimulating and diverse. The professors are a little bit excessively liberal sometimes, but most of them are very kind and will be helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a great career center with helpful faculty, there are often career fairs where recruiters are. Students are well prepared for job interviews."
College Freshman,4,"There haven't been any incidents of this sort in my time being at school, yes there could be ones between students but one bad fish shouldn't bring down the school."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is actually a nice thing at Le Moyne, there is however one hall that is not very nice, which is St. Mary's the rooms are small and hallways are small."
College Freshman,4,The security on this campus is great and I feel very safe
College Freshman,4,There is a good variety of different courses here. The professors for the most part are all very friendly and helpful when you need them
College Freshman,4,There is a great deal of athletics here.  The fan support isn't great that I have noticed compared to other schools I have seen
College Freshman,4,they have built up good teams and events are fun.
College Senior,4,Le  Moyne is great
College Senior,4,It is climbing since the school is getting more and more recognition.
College Senior,4,"Could be better, but it did the job"
College Senior,4,SAAC is very involved on campus and promotes athletics very well.
College Freshman,4,"Our security on campus is great. If we ever feel unsafe walking on campus, security will gladly pick us up and bring us to our dorms."
College Freshman,4,There are many internship opportunities here to choose from. There are also many graduate schools that come here to recruit students for the future.
College Freshman,4,The courses I am taking are preparing me for graduate school and I enjoy them. The professors are great! They go the extra mile for you if you ask and seem interested.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are pretty kept up for the most part. I think they need to build more housing due to the incoming students are growing. I was personally in a triple my freshman year and it was terrible. There was 1 desk for 3 students and no space for anything.
College Freshman,4,Many students are on a sports team. The facilities are great and there is a lot of support for the sports teams.
College Freshman,4,the Le Moyne community is great! The professors and staff are all very helpful and welcoming.
Freshman,2,"Because of Covid a lot of the classes I'm taking are online or hybrid. This experience has been fine for me, though some professors make it more difficult to learn online due to lack of communication."
Freshman,2,"I'm an out of state, first-year student here. Because of Covid I was unable to visit before I came, but decided to come anyway for several reasons, the main one being the sense of community I'd read in many reviews. However, now I'm almost finished with the first semester and finding that this is not very true, especially on the weekends. Campus is very empty most of the time with not a lot to do, and it's because so many of the students at Le Moyne are from around here so they either commute or go home a lot. As an out of state student without this option I often get bored or discouraged when there's nobody on campus."
Freshman,2,"When COVID-19 hit in the Spring of 2020, the transition to online was rough. As a Biology major, the online lab simulations were horrid and my Biology lab professor was far from helpful. The professors kept changing the Zoom classroom codes and the passwords. Office hours and class times were changed, making it an even tougher adjustment. Considering this was their first experience with online, I hope that they were able to learn and adjust for the Fall 2020 semester."
Freshman,2,"As a first-year who was from out-of-state, I did not enjoy my experience. I had a good number of professors who were kind and cared about your success; however, I had a few that did not. Before solidifying your schedule, DO make sure to look up your professors on ratemyprofessors.com. Campus life was dry and there was nothing to do on the weekend but have your family come get you because it is very expensive to bring a car onto campus. The dining hall food was not good either. I picked up a grilled cheese only to find there were apple fritters in the  middle! Thought it was someone trying to be funny, but nope. It is a legit menu item. Half of the only dining hall that Le Moyne offers is shut down on the weekends. I resided in Dablon hall and the dorms were not pleasant. Hair was waxed into the floor, the heater broke in the middle of winter, and the ceilings had holes and vulgar words carved into it. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned."
Freshman,2,"I am a freshman here at Le Moyne and although it has only been five weeks. many others and I are already considering transferring to another school. Le Moyne on the outside seems amazing when you visit. Your tour guides will tell you it's such a small and quaint campus that feels like a big family, there's always something to do and it's safe. It is in fact on the contrary. There is absolutely nothing to do on the weekends on campus. The food is awful the same ten meals are served every week. You can hear gunshots from neighboring blocks at night while we are trying to study. They may give you great financial aid, but you'll have to pay $500 to have a car on campus half a mile away from you, your meal plan is typically $2500, and room and board for a double room is $100+ more expensive than some other schools of the same size I know. This school may be worth it if you commute, but I can tell you first hand staying on this campus is a nightmare."
Freshman,2,"Le Moyne has so many required classes that are such a waste of time. They call them ""philosophy"" or ""theology"" but they're all basically ""how to write."" I came in with 37 credits from high school college level courses and it's still going to take me two years to finish my required courses. It's honestly ridiculous. Everyone here is super cliquey, too. If you don't make friends the first week you're basically screwed. The food is always the same and 90% of the time it's chicken. They say Le Moyne is diverse but it's mostly white. The lack of diversity is genuinely disappointing. Only good thing about the school is the small class size."
College Freshman,2,Next to no restaurants withing walking distance and those that are are sub par. Grubhub is bae.
College Freshman,2,The Bar scene is inferior to that of similar cities.
College Freshman,2,I did not enjoy my time at Le Moyne college. I am not saying it wouldn't be good for everyone however coming from an international backround I did not assimilate well. Upstate New York is very inward focused and most people I came into contact with were unwilling to accept other ideologies.
College Senior,2,"The campus just revamped the look of its dining hall, however, many students still feel they are being lied to. The food, though it appears to have a variety because of the ""food court"" appeal, makes its monthly and even weekly, cycles so you find yourself eating the same thing many days in a row. Health wise, much of the food tends to be very starchy and soaked in oil. There are very few vegetarian options aside from a salad every day and virtually no vegan options. The food, which students can easily become bored of, is also very expensive for what is available. A breakfast of coffee and a bagel has a flat, meal-plan price of around twelve dollars. There is a cafe, convenience store, and sort of ""sandwich/fast food"" place on campus called ""The Den"" but the food does not become very diverse because all locations are owned by the same company and therefore has the  same supplier."
College Senior,2,"I have been offered a decent amount of financial aid each semester I have been at my school. However, I never seem to get anything on a need-based level and I am always sent in circles. I am buried to the sky in debt and I still have two more loans to take out for my last year of school. I have made deans list the past 2 years and at the request of more aid for good grades, no one seems to want to help. I apply for scholarships to no such luck. At Le Moyne, for the most part, you are stuck with your Freshman year financial aid packet for all four years. The only financial advice I would ever give a perspective student is to reach high for money your first year because that is what you are stuck paying for four years and if you cannot afford it, loan companies will not pity you."
College Sophomore,2,Le moyne does not allow you to live off-campus unless it is Le Moyne housing... SO ANNOYING!
College Freshman,2,"As much as I thought I will be outgoing at college, I thought wrong. you can either finding me in my dorm studying every night or in my friend's dorm hanging out and having a good time."
College Freshman,2,"I think it's fair for students to bring their vehicles to college, however, the parking fee each semester is ridiculous and it is very far from where the dorms are."
College Sophomore,2,"I was honestly surprised at the difficulty I had in the academics at Le Moyne. For the most part I enjoyed my professors and my classes. However, there were a few teachers I had that just completely confused me and left me feeling helpless in the course. A majority of teachers can't achieve the amount they need to teach in the 3 hours a week they are provided. Every teacher seems to think their class is the top priority in their students eyes and they assign too much work to be completed when every other class you're taking is also assigning work."
College Freshman,2,"The school occasionally has events or programs on the weekends, which are fun, but other than that there's not much on campus to do. We don't have frats or sororities, so if you are looking for a good party you should head to Syracuse University which is about 10 minutes away."
College Junior,2,"If you don't want to partake, you don't have to. "
College Senior,2,parking tickets are given out like candy. There is not enough campus parking especially for nursing students who have to commute to the hospital and back.
College Junior,2,"Le Moyne doesn't let many students live off campus so you probably won't even have the opportunity to chose an apartment. There are a few apartment complexes near by, and somebody is always looking for a roommate, but I wouldn't get your hopes up."
College Junior,2,Syracuse is known for its bad winters. You get the lake effect snows which occupy a lot of the time spent on campus. This would be manageable if le moyne wasnt on top a hills but the grounds keepers do not keep up with clearing walkways and putting down salt which makes it very hard to get to class even with the small campus.
Niche User,1,"During the visits to Le Moyne my daughter felt welcomed, she was extremely excited. We were told a $500 deposit was required to attend.   So when the final tuition amount was sent, loans were denied by multiple banks.  Le Moyne kept the $500.00 deposit along with the $250.00.  They stole from our daughter not just the money but her excitement and happiness to attend!"
Senior,1,"When you arrive as a freshman, you will be forced into a triple or quadruple. You will have 3/4 students living in a space designed for two humans to live. There are no hand dryers or towels in the bathrooms. As a result of this, students don't wash there hands, and illness spreads. Wifi is spotty ~4mbps. Lighting is not provided in the residences. You must purchase your own lamps and bulbs to light your dorm. If you are lucky to have a kitchen, it won't include a dishwasher. There is no AC in the dorm buildings and upperclassmen don't get their own rooms. Despite all of these problems, LeMoyne requires students to remain on campus for all four years. There is a massive parking problem. Don't pay for a parking spot because you aren't guaranteed a spot. Gunshots are commonly heard on the periphery of campus and LeMoyne fails to alert students of crime in the area. Registering for classes is a nightmare as you won't be able to register for most of the classes you NEED."
Sophomore,1,"Horrible campus. Almost no parking available and what is available is at the bottom of an obnoxiously large hill which is horrible in the winter. Tuition costs are exorbitant and the offerings are paltry in light of the obscene cost. Core requirements are a slap in the face. Every student is expected to take a disgusting amount of fake classes at a painful cost. Don't expect any of these credits to transfer with you if you leave. Also force both a religious studies class and a theology class on all students. Professors for basic 100-level Core requirement classes will treat the class like a 300-level for some reason. Some teachers are fine, although if they aren't pointlessly harsh then they are unorganized pushovers with little structure to their class and heavily reliant on group work. The classrooms are very small and you'll NEVER have enough room to write at a desk/table since whatever room you are in will be simply too small and cramped. Extremely dangerous surrounding area."
College Junior,1,we don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"If you are put in St. Mary's you're basically screwed socially. There are no lounges so there is zero sense of community, it's very old, the rooms are extremely small, and you're across the street from the rest of campus. 

Also I went the random roommate route and ended up wanting to switch second semester and there aren't enough housing options for me to get in a desirable situation."
College Sophomore,1,Is very difficult to choose housing and the forms are very over crowded
Recent Alumnus,1,Trying to get off campus is almost impossible.  As a senior you want the independance of living in a college house with your friends.  The selection process makes this extremely difficult.  If you are lucky enough to get off campus finding affordable housing is very easy.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life in Le Moyne College. They don't believe in it.
Recent Alumnus,1,"In my class, we were told that only 20 students were allowed to live off campus. It is all a grand scheme to get more money from students."
College Junior,1,They dont want you to live off campus for the most part.
College Junior,1,Central NY weather consists of terrible winters but decent summers.
College Sophomore,1,9 times out of 10 the printers are out of ink or paper. The computer takes 5+ minutes to boot up. No one can seem to connect their personal computer with a printer at school. The internet is extremely slow. I dread having to use the computers at school for anything.
College Senior,1,Almost every computer on campus does not sync up with a printer which makes printing basically impossible
College Senior,1,"The ""drunk bus"" at school doesnt have a real schedule and is hard to catch when needed"
College Sophomore,1,"Being a Catholic school, Le Moyne is very strict with their rules. RA's are the real police force, and they can be up in the air as to how much and what they allow in dorms."
College Junior,1,"All freshman and sophomore students are forced to pay $250 a year for a permit to park across the street which makes no since considering two out of three freshman dorms are central on campus. This past year under classmen parking ran out and students were forced to park on the grass. Also, security is ticket happy. I once parked my car on the reserved parking circle in front of the building for 5 minutes while I ran to my room for something and recieved a $40 ticket that the board refused to appeal. For money we pay to park our cars the least they could do is let us park closer to out own building. Syracuse winters are rough no one wants to walk a mile in snow to get to their car when there are 15 empty parking spaces right outside their room"
College Junior,1,There is no greek life and no options even close to greek life.
College Freshman,1,there is not a variety of places to eat at. the only place you can eat at is in the cafeteria.
College Senior,1,"Parking spots are exceedingly hard to find, especially considering parking permits are so expensive. If you park in a lot that is not on your permit, you will get a ticket for sure. Campus security are sticklers about parking."
College Freshman,1,No free off campus parking.security always tickets people.annoying.

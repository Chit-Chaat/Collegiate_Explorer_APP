Alum,5,I did take online classes my senior year because I was doing my internship. I personally got so much help with trying to graduate on time. I would recommend taking online classes.
Junior,5,Excellent Business School that I am attending right now. The advisors know exactly what they need to do.
Freshman,5,"I am enrolled to start St. Peter’s in the Fall 2020.   I went on multiple college tours at other university.  My college tour at St. Peter’s university had a great impact on my decisions to attend.  There are great academics program,  a variety of clubs and sports, as well a spacious and beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,"Saint Peters University is a great school from all other schools in New Jersey. Saint Peters University classrooms are equipped AC’s with smart boards and ergonomic furniture.The School has Library, Science labs, robotics lab, mathematics lab, ICT lab, outdoor play area,sports centre and activity rooms. The School allow students to explore different environments by providing them playfields and facilities for Swimming, Baseball, Track, Golf, Basketball etc."
Freshman,5,I was very pleased with my experience with Saint Peter's University. I had an admissions officer visit my high school and when he shared all the great opportunities the school offers I automatically was interested. I attended their fall open house and the professors that spoke were very polite and experienced in their field. It's a very welcoming environment.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Saint peters so far has been great. They are so welcoming and offer an open arms assistant to what ever may trouble you concerning your academic. They have assisted me every step of the way since I started. I will definitely recommend this university to anyone. I dropped out of college and in 2019 I began to make something of my life and upon thinking so I contacted Saint Peters university. They just told me to come in with whatever transcripts I have and within a month I was settled to start an undergraduate program. However, the change that I will like to see occur at saint peters is how often they offer some classes in class. Some of the classes that I prefer to take in class are only offered online and that is a bit of challenge when I know I would do better in class. But overall I appreciate the school and will definitely stick with it till graduation. I have actually challenged myself in being an independent and responsible learner so it all worked out."
Sophomore,5,"There's a few things I like about Saint Peters University, such as; the friendships I've made, the falcuty that supported me, the fact that it's close to home, and the student diversity. Meeting new people at this school has made this experience more enjoyable, helped me adjust to a new living enviornment, and creating life long friendships along the way. My school has the best support system, and I am just greatful to have them by my side, especially around finals week. Transportation from my school to home is very convinet, the school has a shuttle that drives their students to the bus terminal. Around campus their are students of different ethnicity and culture, Some people even come from other countries. I wish that the Saint Peter's bridge, that goes over JFK Blvd, would extend to a building called Rankin Hall, that way it would be much easier for people with handicap to get to class."
Sophomore,5,"At Saint Peter's University I've learned a lot about myself in a small amount of time. Currently I'm entering the next semester as a sophomore and I heavily appreciate the college transition of my first year. I have many professors I stayed in contact with over the break to assist me in job finding, scholarship findings, and the effort each professor displays  in the classroom shows you how much they really care. The students are very easygoing and non biased. It seems that there is no conflict on campus and you will feel an extreme amount of security. Overall, my first year here was unimaginable and I cherished every moment of it."
Freshman,5,"People who work there such as counselors are very interested in helping you. The award students who deserve to receive financial help. The community is good and campus is safe. Professors are very dedicate people and very professional. 
Saint Peter’s University offers great opportunities to the ones who are willing to put all of their efforts to be better."
Sophomore,5,"Although I've only attended Saint Peters for one year I have realized that by choosing this University I have paved a clear path for my future. I came across amazing professors who have been extremely helpful in teaching me not only academics but way to improve in life and as a person. The professors go above and beyond to help their students and where it not for their support, persistence and guidance I would have not made it through my first year."
Sophomore,5,The professors here are very dedicated to their students.  They use everything available to them to further our education and they want us to succeed.  It was easy to seek help and talk to them.

Sophomore,5,"My experience at Saint Peter’s University has gained me exposure to a variety of informative business lectures and workshops which serve as an enlightenment and early insight to the corporate world standards and recruitment processes. During my time at Saint Peter’s I’ve acquired skill sets that will serve me in my career path and have learned valuable insight from my marketing, management, economics, programming and accounting courses. The information I have acquired from my courses has allowed me to view the world differently. Having the ability to be dynamic, efficient, effective and resilient has allowed me to be a well rounded individual not only in my field of study but other fields of study as well. The student body is diverse and has allowed me to better understand cultures differing from my own."
Junior,5,"Entering Saint Peter's University, I was truly amazed of how great the professors and students were. Everyone was very welcoming. Professors really push you to be a better student and also person."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Saint Peter's University is amazing. This School is very diverse different people, different cultures, different languages. Saint Peter's makes me feel very comfortable, even though it's a small school I feel like I'm at home. The professor is amazing with office hours and getting you to achieve the years you have in Saint Peter's.  Dean, administers, campus safety, students all are amazing and definitely make sure our 4 years in Saint Peter's is very comfortable and home oriented. There's always someone to talk to wheater your down, want to share good news etc list goes on and on. I recommend this school to all my friends and their friends. I picked the best school to jump-start my career. Thank you Saint Peter's."
Sophomore,5,Amazing college located a short train ride from NYC and the Jersey city waterfront. I found the atmosphere friendly. The staff helpful and for the most part the class environment engaging. The only negative is the surrounding neighborhood which can be a turn off for most people not use to an urban city school.
Sophomore,5,"My experience was good, meeting new students majoring in different studies. It’s also a great experience to be involved in different types of activities the school come up with, I’m able to learn new things and apply it to my daily life."
Junior,5,I registered at Saint Peter's University for one purpose to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice.  My mother graduated from SPU and I wanted to follow in her footsteps.  So far I enjoy attending this college.  I absolutely love the professors here and I have enjoyed meeting alot of nice people here.  We enjoy working together to accomplish school projects.  I have been invited to join the dean's list two years in a row and plan to join for my Junior year.  I can't wait to graduate in 2020 and hopefully I can become a State Trooper in the near future.
Freshman,5,"I liked the energy, students and faculty sharing their experience and making it a comfortable college to attend. Saint Peter’s Univeristy is a very unique college because they offer many different areas of study compared to other college. The campus ministry sparked my eye when I went for a visit because it shows our religious faith and I really loved that. I’m excited for my college experience."
Freshman,5,"I like how the school is very divers and that it feels like a campus that you know you can grow. The teachers care about you and want to see you succeed. You don't feel like just a number, you feel as though you are an actual student. The students are nice and welcoming and you feel welcomed."
Freshman,5,I was ranked #2 in my high school graduating class of 567 graduates and was offered admission to top universities. I chose St. Peter's for the small classes.  I am in now in the Honors Program at Saint Peter's and am truly amazed at how the professors truly care about the students and their development.
Sophomore,5,"After my first year at Saint Peter's, I was assured I chose the best college for me. This school has many programs to choose from and is affiliated with many larger universities as well, making it easier to apply for graduate programs elsewhere. This school is great athletics wise. Our men's basketball team, baseball team, and girl's volleyball team are most known for. If there's one thing I could change, it would be a bigger campus."
Sophomore,5,I like the diversity and the kindness of the staff and students. You never feel left out and always have something to do. The food here is delicious and always hot. The clubs help students gain leadership qualities and help students push out of their comfort zone. In the university students have a chance to become work-studies who are students that work in offices if they need help making money or paying off their tuition. The teachers here treat students with respect and help them gain full knowledge of the subjects they are teaching. Saint Peter’s University is a great school with a great community.
Junior,5,Friendly and knowledgeable staff and Professors.  Entering with an associates degree in pursue of a BA.  The adult undergraduate program has allowed me and many others working adults to achieve dreams of a better education.
Freshman,5,"Saint peters university is a wonderful school. There are teachers that actually care about how your learning and if your doing good or bad in your courses. The university itself has a lot of study rooms and students who are very welcoming and who are willing to help you study,find your way around the school and help you with your homework."
Graduate Student,5,Great school and great campus! Everything I excepted and more! My experiences with the courses and professors have been excellent. I am a veteran and  have completed my MBA .
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman at Saint Peter's University and this is my second semester. So far I've been having a good time and learning a lot of new things. My major is Communications and my minor is Sports Management; all of my professors have been very helpful and provide great information. Even though it's a smaller campus and doesn't offer as much as other schools, you really get a chance to not only learn to more about your professor but also develop personal relationships with your them, which can be very helpful in the future."
Freshman,5,"Great school, but expensive. If you've won scholarships previous to your acceptance, use them for tuition, and if you live out of state, try to ask for free housing."
Sophomore,5,The courses are nice and smooth all the professors try to encourage you to do better and they usually spend some of their personal time to help out the student if he or she need help.
Sophomore,5,"Love my school! Great people and great campus! Everything I excepted and more! Happy I decided to come here, trips to journal square with friends are the best! Cafe is alright could be better, but it all can't be perfect!"
College Sophomore,5,Saint peter's always has career fairs and networking events on campus to meet and link up with companies to build connections that way you can land a career or internship for the future. They also help you build a resume and get you started with the career path you want to head into for the future.
College Sophomore,5,"It is very safe on campus, the people are very nice and classy. There is little to no incidents on campus. I have not really heard about any bad incidents since I have been at Saint Peter's University."
College Freshman,5,"They're all passionate about they're subjects, and help us all 1 on 1."
College Freshman,5,There is constant security on campus.
College Freshman,5,"This university provides a broad variety of internships for students to take on, they encourage students to take on jobs around campus and what the campus provides, and the value of a degree from Saint Peter's University is high because it comes from the purest, best forms and minds."
College Freshman,5,All professors are very welcoming and among the best at what they teach.
College Freshman,5,My university has plenty of security around and the people are very protective and alert of each other
College Senior,5,"In terms of diversity, the school is a league of its own.  They are accepting and accomodating to all walks of life.  No fear hear and you will find a group to belong too."
College Sophomore,5,Saint Peter's believe that everyone will make it and get their degree. Saint Peter's provide many different tutors to help you understand a certain course in a easier way. Saint Peter's is big on helping students find jobs/
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are great, and they care about decisions you make for the future. They care about our understanding."
College Sophomore,5,The school has an specific internship website for all students. And we all receive an email regarding internships and programs attached to our career.
College Freshman,5,"Saint Peters University is an amazing place, filled with great people and a strong foundation to help you with your education."
College Sophomore,5,Always a good time. Until cops come up
College Sophomore,5,"so much diversity, the chicken shack is amazing and open late,"
College Freshman,5,"The school isn't worth their tuition sticker price, and they attract students by giving many scholarships. EVERYONE who has passed their high school courses and has at least one neuron gets a scholarship."
College Sophomore,5,Had a good beginning orientation.  the quality of emplyers is poor during career fair.
College Sophomore,5,I am in Delta SIgma Pi and its the best.  You make quality friends and do charitable work around the community.
College Sophomore,5,We really have a great financial aid system in place.  They are very prompt and reply to emails as soon as possible.
College Freshman,5,"The Saint Peter's biology program has satellite school connections, internship and volunteer opportunities, and the curriculum is quite challenging."
College Senior,5,The health care center on campus is very useful and in the beginning of the winter there are free flu shots available
College Junior,5,There are many decent places to rent around the campus that are off-campus.
College Senior,5,someone is always having a party
College Sophomore,5,Saint Peter's University is all about their connections! The university has a pretty good alumni network and if a student is seeking an internship or job Saint Peter's provides the network.
College Junior,5,I think this school is the best because it is at a very prime location in New Jersey. The faculty is a very knowledge set of people. Being a catholic there is mass every Sunday that I can attend to. It is fairly easy to get around campus and there is always someone to help you out if you need it.
College Senior,5,There are many events going on. Student activities always has something planned. The new state of the art student center is also great and extravagant.
College Senior,5,To be honest if you have the option to dorm take it. It sets you up for a large amount of responsibility and turns you into a true adult being away from your parents and all. You will make friends that will continue to be your friends for all the years you are there. There is always something social going on generated by the school and it brings everyone together.
College Sophomore,5,Campus safety does a really good job at looking out for the safety of the students by assuring how quickly they are able to show up at a place on campus and send email and text alerts.
Graduate Student,4,"Best online courses! Receive same amount of help you would in classroom and everything is on your time, so it makes it much easier!"
Alum,4,I love this school so much that I decided to come back to do my master's program with this school. It is a small school with a better engagement which I would recommend if you wouldn't want to be a number.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning experience with Saint Peter's University was overall good. I mean learning anything online comes with its set of challenges, but some how i got through it.  The professor really go out of they're way to ensure the student is comprehending the given topics and concepts."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Peter's University along with its vision of ""cura personalis"" Care for the whole person really manifests within this institution. Individualized care for each student, helping them reach their full potential and succeed in there specified career is what makes SPU Unique."
Junior,4,"I like that Saint Peter's offers a variety of classes that consists of small class sizes. This way its easy to make better connections with your professors. As someone who dorms, I would really like to see the dorm buildings be renovated or the room and board charges go down. The living spaces and its prices don't match. I feel like this school charges way too much to offer dorms that may have mold, mice, or roaches. Also, as someone majoring in the STEM field, I would like to see more on-campus research opportunities for its students."
Junior,4,"The online experience was not that bad during the pandemic. My professors became more available and responded quickly to emails. Also, I like how the school tried their best to provide almost all the resources they offer in-person, on the online platform."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Peter's was a very diverse university, however, everyone knew everyone since it was a small school. Very helpful with financial aid, but not much to do on campus unless you were really involved/committed to a club."
Sophomore,4,Online ED was good. Professors gave us enough room to balance personal life and school work. They were also considerate of things going on.
Freshman,4,I love the way things are at this school. Education is great and there are so many opportunities and activities for everyone to look forward too. I’m very glad I go to this university!
Freshman,4,"Due to the pandemic, and staying inside, classes were of course moved online. It was good for the meantime until I started to slowly loose focus, I also ended up getting sick as so my family which ended up into having to take care of my mom who was highly in danger. Thankfully we are all in better health now. I went back to my studies, and reached out to all my professors who helped me get back on track and gave me time to catch up on missed work. I very much did miss having face to face classes, it wasn’t the same as getting taught online."
Freshman,4,"Due to the Coronavirus, all students had work remotely. Online learning however is so much different from actually going to class with your peers and professors. Before Covid-19, the only time I would ever use the internet was to access my ebooks or for research purposes. Other than that, the best way to get the most out of you education is by physically going to class."
Freshman,4,"As a first year student coming to Saint Peter's University was a little nervous. I didn't really know anybody until the first half of my semester. The professors are very helpful and always available whenever necessary. As a commuter, I always enjoyed the car ride to school and back home even though I live 40 minutes to 1 hour away. It's a very diverse environment with majority being Latinx, Asian, and Black."
Freshman,4,This school is very different compared to other D1 schools because it is small and it's not a bad thing because you get to meet a lot of amazing people from different walks of life and If you decide to attend this school you should be open to this area because It may look high in crime but it is just an urban area. You have to fight for what you want at this school and it is the same thing with other schools. What I learned for this school is the amount of fun that you have here is what you make it.
Freshman,4,The professors that I had were amazing because they care about what they do and they want their students to succeed. These professors are in the criminal justice department.  So if you are interested in criminal justice this is a great school to learn from because the professor's previous careers were in law enforcement. They give their insight from the job to you on a personal level.
Senior,4,I prefer online over in person. It was pretty easy for me and I liked the flexibility of working on your own time during the pandemic. I had little to no tech difficulties.  I didn’t give 5 stars because I know others didn’t have as positive an experience as I did. My profs were nice enough and gave me mostly busy work and a bunch of papers and I barely had to meet virtually for class. Majority of my assignments were just on blackboard which I liked doing since they kept me occupied and not bored in the house. I would love to do more online learning.
Senior,4,"I am going to be a a senior in the fall. I think there isn’t much campus life for both commuters and residents. Campus is so boring. It feels like high school, since  it’s a small campus community where everyone knows each other and is all up in everyone’s business, it’s annoying. I will say that academics is better at SPU than social life, most profs actually care and pay attention to you with small class sizes. The resources are there, just gotta use em to do good at this place."
Freshman,4,It is a school that is close to my home and they have all the necessities i would need and want as a student.
Junior,4,"Saint Peter's is the perfect campus if you want to go to a school where professors get to know you, but have opportunities in a big city. Being 10 minutes away from the city really is such an advantage. There are many internships, or even jobs the school could connect you with due to the proximity between Jersey City and New York City."
Sophomore,4,It's a great school where you able to meet awesome people! My first year was good and made great friends! The teachers are very friendly and helpful.
Alum,4,It is a Jesuit college. The college was close to my house. Very close to Manhattan and public transportation. The only problem I truly had was the parking. I would invest in the parking permit in the case you can not find metered parking.
Junior,4,Personally I feel as the school can improve but I'm getting I thought I would get when I transferred here. I feel as if I belong here and I haven't been happier.
Sophomore,4,I like how diverse Saint Peter’s is. Everyone is very accepting and easy to talk to. It was easy to make friends.
Sophomore,4,Saint Peter’s Universiry is a pleasant experience. The university isn’t too big to where you’d get lost or anything. The environment is pretty clean and friendly. The dorms and apartments are a decent size. The food could be better from the cafeteria because sometimes they just serve nasty food. The experience so far has been good.
Sophomore,4,"I personally like Saint Peter's University, the Dorms could use some renovation but more importantly the education is great!"
Sophomore,4,My school is great. I'm very happy here and feel very safe and connected with all the faculties and staff as well. I wish the school can get more money so they can fix and enhance the quality of our dorms and the athletes facilities too.
Junior,4,I like the feeling of having my own apartment. But the overall cleanliness of the building is horrendous. There is a pest and rodent problem that is quite visible. The campus store doesn’t have the best selection of food and barely any juice just soda. Academics are great.
Freshman,4,As a freshman at saint peters University I was welcomed with open arms. It was quite easy to find out where everything was. Almost every student gets most of their tuition paid. For students that don't get financial help since this is a very expensive school you might still have to pay whatever's left. I think this school needs to ugrade on campus safety. The university is very open and anyone can just walk through the quad. The university should put up gates or at least post more security. The food is fairly good but deifinatley not worth the price of the meal plan. Also the wifi is horrible. If you dorm prepare yourself because you won't have any wifi. The University is a great place to learn and the students seem very nice and open.
Niche User,4,It is a very good university for local students.  It is a small campus so getting around is great.  You have opportunities for work /study programs.   You can work right in the university.  The office that helps get a job after graduation works hard for you.  The sports complex is great.  They have ROTC.   The library is great.  It has lots of good research books and also has lots of spaces to study quietly on your own or work with a partner.
Freshman,4,"The campus is really huge and beautiful. There is always someone greeting you when you walk in, there's always someone to help you with anything you need."
Senior,4,"Saint Peter's University is one of the most diverse schools I've attended. The general atmosphere is social. Coming from a strictly private school, even though SPU is a private university it's more toward the public school feel. One thing that I wish they would change is the appliances. Some of the equipment and classrooms are very old and needs renovation."
Junior,4,I like the fact that Saint Peter's University is a small campus. The residential halls are right across the street which means that you can get to class quickly without having to wake up hours earlier in order to make it on time. The campus has a diverse group of students and organizations for students to join. There is always something to do.
Sophomore,4,"Great school, wish they had more to offer in their gameroom. Also the Rec Center needs to be heavily updated, especially the tennis courts."
Junior,4,"The environment is extremely diverse and friendly! Small campus so it is easy to make good friends and connections and see the same faces often. The parking issues is a change that will be sweet for commuters like me ( My commute takes about 2 hours). Faculty members are wonderful, compassionate and helps you to succeed!"
Freshman,4,This year I am a freshman and I am knew to Jersey City. I love the environment in this university. I feel like people actually care to learn my name and about my life. Professors are friendly and might give you too much homework but they are just preparing you for your career. The university will help you choose the right major for you and even help you choose a minor.
College Sophomore,4,"My experiences with the courses and professors have been good. The professors will help you and answer any question you ask. I have been able to talk to professors and contact them outside the classroom for anything and they are willing to help their students. Also the class sizes are good they are not huge like the classes at a college like Rutgers or Penn State. I feel like if you pay attention in class, take notes, read and study and listen to the professors you will be just fine.As far as the quality of courses go that will depend on your interests and your work ethics."
College Freshman,4,"Academically, this is a great school and everyone is so driven to succeed. This is also the reason why it is somewhat difficult to meet new people because everyone is focused on only their studies."
College Junior,4,"Aside from the monthly tuition payments I have to make and the cost of books, I would say that being at SPU has been a great experience. I have meet a lot of individuals that will without a doubt make a difference in the world. Not only are the professors a pleasure to have in class, but the students I have encountered in my time have been well educated, delightful, and excited to learn. I believe that our student to teacher ratio makes the school really unique. The ratio is 18 to 1 which is the same environment you would find in a community college, but with the professionalism of a university. SPU is a great place to be in and I am definitely going to be a part of their graduate program."
College Freshman,4,Saint Peter's University provides a great center for sports and also provides training facilities for students interested in staying in shape.
College Freshman,4,Saint Peter's University has many internship and studying opportunities for students and pushes them to strive in their fields. They are very diverse and help students with their futures and help ensure careers.
College Senior,4,"It is a growing school.  More different classes that offer theortical approaches to modern day businesses need to be implemented.  As well as encourage students to learn how to use financial softwares if they want to be in the finance industry, for example, bloomberg terminals and excel spreadsheets, etc."
College Senior,4,"Havent had health issues but they do address and care for your need, especially since its a small private school that is growing."
College Senior,4,"It is pretty good, but you have to go out and get it."
College Senior,4,I love the small class room setting and interpersonal communication.
College Sophomore,4,Everything is clean for the most part
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is very close to one another, relationships are built easily."
College Sophomore,4,"I would chose Saint Peter's University over again if I had the choice. The professors and staff are very helpful and go out of their way to help every student that needs it. There is so much diversity, and you can learn from your peers as well as your professors."
College Junior,4,"I love how we have small class sizes so each student can have individual attention. I have found that I am more focused in this kind of environment than during a core class that may have up to 30 students. My professors have been available to students during certain hours or through email, which is more convenient for me. In the nursing department, professors are so determined to help their students succeed and understand the material."
College Junior,4,"Saint Peter's is a small campus so it is likely you come across the same people daily. It is in an urban area with a diverse community so I enjoy the atmosphere when I attend classes throughout the day. From experience, I can say the professors and staff are readily available for students during a time of need, whether it is academic or personal. College is what you make it and I am fortunate enough to surround myself with friends who make it such an amazing experience. Being a nursing major, I have a pile of workload so I spend a lot of my time at the library, which is an exceptional place to study in without any distraction. SPU clubs also try to get the students into the school spirit and I can say that there are some fun events that can be attended throughout the school year. Regardless, it is predominately commuter school so many of the students return home after classes end, but it is still possible to make friends on campus!"
College Junior,4,"Saint Peter's University has a diverse community of professors. Some professor are experts in their field, but are not great teachers and sometimes force the students to learn the material on their own. Other professors are both experts in their field and great at teaching and getting students to understand certain difficult concepts. The classes run 50 minutes long on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Tuesdays and Fridays, they run for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Labs can be up to 3-4 hours long. In general, classes are not dreadfully long, allowing the professors to keep the student's attention, instead of an extremely long class where students may fall asleep or lose focus. Our general curriculum has some unnecessary aspects, however every class is valuable and can vary widely. As a science major, I have seen and experienced the best and worst classes or professors, and I always suggest consulting Rate My Professor before enrolling in any course."
College Junior,4,"My school is a First Division University where basketball is the sport where students are the most involved. Baseball is next on the list of student involvement, and every other sport is important, but there are not as many students showing school spirit at tennis or swimming matches, for example. Our teams are very strong and full of talent, however. Our athletic facilities are slightly outdated, however my school is in the process of updating the recreation centers for the satisfaction of our students."
College Junior,4,"My university is very diverse and not too big in size. I appreciate my school's size because there are more opportunities for one on one time with the professors, which allows students to learn more and do better in whichever courses they are struggling in. My school is unique because we are centered in the middle of Jersey City, NJ which is a huge melting pot in the midst of its gentrification process. We have students from all over the world, as well as students who live nearby and commute. My university is always looking for ways to improve for the satisfaction of the students, and to make a better name for our school which is something I appreciate. Progress is key, and Saint Peter's has definitely progressed enormously over the years. If I could do it all over, I would definitely choose Saint Peter's University over and over again. I am aware that life throws you punches sometimes, and nobody's life will ever be perfect. However, as a self analyzing person, I look back on my decisions, and not every choice I've made in life has been the right choice. Choosing this university as well as my major, and I realize that Saint Peter's was the best choice for me. I never wanted to attend a huge state university where I became just another name or number on the roster of 300 or more students in a class. As a 5 foot tall young woman, I never liked large crowds and I would not have appreciated the  feeling of being lost in the midst of hundreds of people, just trying to make my way to class or the dining hall. At the small, yet welcoming community I have found here at Saint Peter's, I feel at home, and I have met special people who have changed my life in many ways for the better. Throughout the past 3 years, I have grown and matured more than I ever could have imagined, so if I had to start all over again, I would always choose Saint Peter's University."
College Freshman,4,if you choose to stick it out its good
College Sophomore,4,Some nights is very fun
College Sophomore,4,"The academics are somewhat challenging depending on the subject. Saint Peter's want everyone to be successful and the curriculum is that you should know a little bit about everything once you graduate. Registering for class is simple, first come first serve."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone gets along with anybody.
College Sophomore,4,There are activities where speakers come in and discuss about peer pressure and any other topics.
College Sophomore,4,I'm very safe around campus because I'm always surrounded by people and there are always campus safety guards around
College Sophomore,4,My school is very diverse and wonderful. It gives you a scary and good feeling at the same time. Even though you're on your own you feel this comfort like home. We have a variety of food from different cultures. It feels like home food because our wonderful chefs cook the food with love. We have beautiful teachers that love us and care about the decisions we make. We have the best library which is open till midnight during finals and midterms. We have interesting people that attend from all over the world. My school is home. It's where I want to graduate from. It's where I do all my activities and where I receive the education I need for my career. I love Saint Peters University and I'd hope to complete my four years.
College Sophomore,4,I chose my school because they really have a great Bio program and the tuition wasn't too much.
College Sophomore,4,Peacock Nation !!! All teams do exceptionally well and I'm proud
College Junior,2,I wouldn't recommend a car on campus because there's no parking or if you want parking it wont be close to your building as a junior or senior.
College Junior,2,No off campus housing help from school. not many places will  lease to college kids because it isnt a full years rent.
College Junior,2,"Wifi is weak in most buildings, cant connect devices without going to IT. IT isnt very helpful. If the pay for printing goes into effect there are going to be some angry students."
College Sophomore,2,very cold in the fall
College Junior,2,"I transferred from a community college and was told that I would receive a scholarship for $16,000. A day before it was time for me to move on campus I was told that the 16,000 was for a year. My tuition is 23,000 and I had to take out a loan."
College Junior,2,The girls are high maintenance and the guys are arrogant
College Freshman,2,Being a commuter is hard because all the snow just affects the learning and time spent on school education. It's bad because the syllabus is always changing and it delays a lot of projects and time for other in class lectures.
College Freshman,2,Snowed almost all of the second semester thus far.
Recent Alumnus,2,financial aid office is pretty helpful. one however made too  many mistakes. overall they help. DO NOT TAKE OUT LOANS.
College Freshman,2,The cafeteria closes at 8pm which is very inconvenient to many students. Also the food is not always fully cooked. It already tastes gross but when it is not fully cooked it tastes even worse.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many student discounts available and most of the restaurants around the area are all fast food restaurants so our choices are very limited and unhealthy.
College Freshman,2,I am usually going to NY. 
College Freshman,2,I do not like the dining set up too much
College Freshman,2,Very old freshman dorms. Wifi is really bad. 
College Junior,2,Saint Peter's makes everything 100x more complicated than it needs to be. it is so irritating and annoying.
College Junior,2,"All of the dorms are average.  Ofcourse the upperclassmen dorm are a little better but not a big deal.  The cost however is atrocious and living in Jersey City is not ""fantastic."""
College Junior,2,Saint Peters is in the heart of Jersey City and that means in the center of crime. Im always getting texts and emails of students and faculty getting hurt and honestly its very scary.  I dont know if that problem can ever be fixed.
Recent Alumnus,2,For the Graduate program Saint peters doesn't provide scholarships for its students. All scholarships are from outside of the school.
College Sophomore,2,"The basketball teams are somewhat good. All the others team are okay, but the track and field team is the best sports team in the school."
College Junior,2,"You Need to Know People – If you don't know the right people, campus partying can basically slip right under your nose. I spent my first two years, never knowing who what or where a party was. It was pretty embarrassing, knowing the right people goes a long long way. The best parties happen off campus or in the dorms, not at the clubs."
Sophomore,1,They ultimately only care about getting your money. The school’s atmosphere is dull and the classes are the same. I transferred after a year and it was the best decision I made. I notified the school of my transfer but did not manually drop my classes. I started attending a new school and Saint Peters sent a bill for $8200 to me which I said I will not pay. They sent the bill to collections and refused to release my transcripts. I had to sell my car and take a loan out just so I could pay them to continue my education. I despise this school and everyone that works there including the president. I contacted everyone in the University and they said they said they could not do anything and I would have to pay.
Freshman,1,"Ugh...Complete waste of a school. Professors here are hit or miss. Some were nice and cared about students, while some couldn't care less. Campus life here is absolutely dreadful... Zero parties, activities, sports games, or any form of fun. The cafeteria is awful as well with little edible food and is not even open until 11:00 AM on weekends, so you may find yourself starving at times. This school is close to the city, but what use is that when you'll have no friends to go there with? Most students here are commuters. My four months living on campus at Saint Peter's University were four of the most depressing of my life. SPU was a trap I seriously wish I hadn't fallen into. Thank goodness I transferred out while I still had the chance..."
Sophomore,1,"I honestly thought Saint Peter’s was a diverse college with the teachers but I never expected to receive racist teachers. I had one teacher who assumed English was not my first language, then when I addressed the comment twice she lowered my grade. I don’t pay To go to a private institution where teachers are rude to student and say stuff like “English is your first language” nor have a teacher call you a distraction because you stepped out to answer a medical emergency. Honestly trash biggest mistake ever."
Sophomore,1,If you want to be at a strict university go here. Saint Peter's gives out tons of scholarship money but when you attend they will take any amount of effort to get any more money from you. They favorite the athletes so much it is very unfair. The classes are very small and most people stick to themselves since there are so many commuters. The professors vary because each department is so different. Education department is the best professor wise and the stem program is not what you signed up for.
Freshman,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!
It is probably the worst school in the area. The dorms are depressing, the library is depressing, the wifi speed is terribly bad. The Cafeteria food is probably the worst thing. This is a commuter school so breakfast and lunch during the week is pretty decent, do not rely on it for the dinner and weekends, there is almost NO food and the quality is really bad. The meal plan is overpriced, you’d be better off eating somewhere else for the amount of money you pay. The management of this university is really bad. They will even trick you (told me I did not turn in my key, when I clearly did) to get money out of you. As I mentioned above, think twice before coming here. Maybe it’s better paying a couple thousand dollars more and attend a better school."
Sophomore,1,HONEST REVIEW OF SAINT PETERS. Waste of money and time. DO NOT go to Saint Peter’s especially if you would have to live there. There is no traditional Greek life. These one caf and it’s awful. Students are intolerant and feel as though they need to be spoon fed everything. Athletics are awful trainers don’t care about their jobs and there’s no good sports. No events on the weekends. No parties to go to. Your best shot at fun is dorm drinking with 3 other people but if you get caught watch out they’ll make you do an absurd amount of community service hours. Everything on campus is breaking or rotting. Every building leaks. The maintenance staff is lazy and incoherent. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. SPU IS A TRAP I WISH I HADNT FALLEN INTO
Freshman,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! 
Saint Peter’s boasts a lot of things but when you live there for a month you’ll see all the lies they’ve told you. Facilities are outdated and falling apart. Students are ignorant and rude almost always. it’s annoying to see almost no one show up for sporting events. The cafeteria is hit or miss usually falling into the miss category with little options and only open until 8pm (7pm Friday-Sunday). Caf also has NO food on the weekends. Campus “security” wouldn’t be able to stop anything from happing on campus  I actualy feel scared on campus as the schools not in the nicest of areas. There’s NO Greek life. There is NO party scene what so ever. No one has off campus housing so your best bet is to drink in your dorm room. The mail room is a mess."
Junior,1,"I Should've transferred out when I had the chance to do so. The only reason why students come here is because this school offers a lot of financial aid. The dorms are terrible. There are no parties at all. Almost every student living on campus leaves for the weekend. There is no Greek life. Only thing good about the school is how it's not competitive at all. If anyone is thinking about going to this college, just choose your second choice of schools."
Freshman,1,It's a really dry school. Barely anyone stays for the weekend. Wifi is terribly slow. The college itself needs improvements.
College Freshman,1,what greek life? school should by the houses by the gym and create greek life.
College Junior,1,All the issues of living in a Jersey city apartment and more...
College Sophomore,1,"They only give you the scholarship you received as a freshman, it doesn't matter if you are getting really good grades. There is no publicizing of scholarships, you can't even apply for them on their site. The financial office is the worse, they don't even want to help you most of the time. plus you have to wait forever."
College Freshman,1,"There is no party scene. If drinking in the dorms with several friends is considered a ""party"" it's still a scarce occurrence."
College Junior,1,when the weather is bad everyone stays in their rooms. there's no communication
College Freshman,1,"the shuttle sucks and they never come, you are better off walking"
College Freshman,1,"it sucks there are no parties, nothing happens"
College Freshman,1,"campus safety always gives you an attitude when you have a problem, especially with the shuttle. when you call it usually takes a half hour for them to get to you when everywhere they take you is less then 10 minutes away"
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do on campus
College Freshman,1,"it is scary if you walk anywhere off campus it is very intimidating. you always hear about people getting hurt, shot, or mugged."
College Sophomore,1,Dinning on campus is probably one of the worst experiences. The cafeteria is either full or it is completely empty with nothing to eat but grilled cheese sandwiches and also it closes way to early for those that are able to stay on campus.

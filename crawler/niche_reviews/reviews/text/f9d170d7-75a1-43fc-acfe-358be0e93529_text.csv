Senior,5,George Fox really cares about its' students and employees. They really work with you to keep you on track to graduate.
Sophomore,5,"When we had to go back home in the middle of the school year, the transition was super easy because GFU already has an online platform that all the students and professors share to post assignments and reminders. That made it easy to stay updated with the school. I also took a summer course and the same online website was used to post lecture videos and tests."
Sophomore,5,It is so easy to get to know people and make a new friend everyday because the school environment is set up for students to work together and help each other.
Junior,5,I love the close knit community and their Be Known promise. They truly take time to care for and learn to know their students. It has helped me feel valued as a student.

Freshman,5,"I had an amazing experience at George Fox University!

Sophomore,5,Everyone on campus is really nice and currently working very hard to bring students back in a safe and healthy manner this fall. The faculty does a great job at teaching classes and actually wants their students to succeed.
Sophomore,5,"The ""be known"" promise really is true.  Even as a commuting student, I feel like professors care about me and my well being.  They are more than willing to spend time with you and listen to what you have to say.  Even with their degrees and experience, they are fun and right on course to understand and have meaningful experiences with students."
Niche User,5,"George Fox University is a multi-faceted university. I am in what's called an Adult Degree Program and they made it possible for me to go back to school without being overwhelmed with a monstrous bill. There is so much support, which is essential to success for any student, it rivals top universities around the country in my opinion. The ability to connect with not only professors but the librarians and the financial aid office is what makes the journey of attaining a degree here so much more peaceful."
Freshman,5,I feel so cared for at George Fox and can tell that my professors all value my individual education. I have grown a great deal spiritually and am excited to continue my education here.
Freshman,5,"As a future student at George Fox, I am excited because when I went to visit the staff were just very welcoming and the class was as small as of 15 students which really gives you that one-on-one interaction with your professor."
Freshman,5,"George Fox has provided me with the wonderful opportunity to grow both academically and spiritually from the moment I stepped foot on campus. As soon as I arrived in the fall, I instantly noticed how sincere all the professors and fellow students are in getting to try to know me personally. The community is what stands out to me about George Fox. I'd have to say that overall I've had a fantastic experience in my freshman year at this university."
Graduate Student,5,"""Be known"". If your anything like me, you wake up, go to school, go to work, and go home. You don't think of making friends or investing in a longterm relationship because you feel the need to just put your head down and grind. If you can only get in and get out, you'll be fine until you graduate. Well, let me tell you as a recent transfer student from Oregon State University that George Fox University is a place you can call HOME. There is an overwhelming feeling of love and support in the atmosphere at George Fox. You think that you want to just get in and get out but they won't let you because you are now part of a family."
Sophomore,5,George fox is great for anyone who likes a small town feel. It has great academic prowess and it is super friendly.
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful, and everyone on campus is super friendly and welcoming. It is also surrounded by a quaint small town. The school also has football and lots of opportunities to find your purpose and career path that's right for you."
Sophomore,5,My time at Fox has been great so far. My professors always help me when I need it and give me good feedback on my work. There are many ways to get connected and everyone here is very friendly.
Sophomore,5,"George Fox University is a great school. It has small class sizes and amazing professors. My engineering classes are very hands on and real-world oriented, making it an awesome program."

Freshman,5,Everything about my experience with George Fox University has been perfect so far and I can't wait to start classes in the fall!
Alum,5,"I attended Fox as a Biology and Psychology major and I was blown away by how personal and invested the community is in our education. My professors were my mentors and friends and I never felt like a day was wasted in my core classes. Gen Ed courses weren't always the best, but that was based on the student, not the professor. 
I value the love and connections I found there and the chance to delve into my faith and become the person I feel God was leading me to be. 20/10 would recommend."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at George Fox University was fantastic and I am looking forward to spending the next three years studying there. Everyone on campus is friendly and encouraging, and the professors are very approachable and knowledgeable."
Sophomore,5,The professors are great and really care about how you are doing in their class and if you are showing up or not. The small class sizes also help with this student teacher interaction along with relationship building among our other piers.
Freshman,5,"GFU is a home away from home and I am excited to start my college experience there in the fall. Its ciriculum offers a well-rounded education while also allowing a walk with Christ. It also LGBTQ friendly, which is hard to find in a good christian university."
Sophomore,5,"George Fox University's community is one of the best I've ever been apart of. I always feel at home here. The school's ""Be Known"" promise is always kept and I always know I have someone to turn to if I need help. It's defiantly worth every penny."

Junior,5,"From apply to George Fox University until now after I've taken a few courses, all the administrators and teachers have been so wonderful and warm. They truly care for each student and are willing to help us in any way that they can so that we can be successful. Amazing school."
Senior,5,Great school with an awesome community. The professors and faculty are amazing and want to help you succeed. The programs offered are diverse.
Niche User,5,"Although I haven’t gotten the full experience from this school, I highly recommend it to anyone who shares the love of Jesus! This school is a great asset in combining classes centered around Christ."
Niche User,5,"My Bruin Preview experience was exceptional! I sensed a real connection to the University and believed my college experience academically, socially, and spiritually would be excellent."
Alum,5,Graduate of the accounting program and everyone had a job by the time they graduated I our class. The small class sizes help hold you accountable to coming to class and staying focused.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Fox and the community here! Their ""Be Known"" promise is very real here. All of the students and faculty are extremely friendly, which helped a lot when I was getting adjusted to living here. Also, the professors are outstanding and also live out the ""Be Known"" promise by wanting to get to know us better, besides just being a student."
Junior,5,"I loved the community and the teachers. The only thing I would change, is the chapel speakers and the band. The speakers could be more interesting, and the band would benefit from a better sound balance."
Niche User,5,I like how easily they were to get ahold of and work with to get a understanding of my academic plan.
Sophomore,5,"George Fox really does live out their Be Known promise. As an engineering student, I’ve gotten great hands-on experience, I have access to a huge engineering facility, and my professors are able to integrate their science/math courses with faith, which is incredible! The local area is charming, the campus is beautiful and feels private, and I’ve built lifelong friendships."
Freshman,5,I’m going to george fox in the fall as an incoming freshman. Visiting the university I instantly felt peace and the welcoming community that fox has. I really like the small class sizes and that the professors not only care about us academically but also our spiritual/personal lives. I also like how the academics is Christ centered and how there are chapels twice a week.
Sophomore,5,"At George Fox, I have met numerous genuinely kind people that have become good friends of mine. The experience, as well as academics, are first rate."
Junior,5,"George Fox University is so friendly, positive, and powerful that it makes even the most of introverted people feel welcome and encouraged to be a part of everything, and the education is very solid. I only have good things to say, except for the food, which isn't the worst, but it certainly isn't the best."
Sophomore,5,"George Fox University provides a clean, safe environment to learn from professors who value their students in a beautiful facility. The biggest flaw of the school is its dining options, as the variety of food services offered are of generally mediocre quality. That being said, it does not distract from the community that is built at the school, with its ""Be Known"" promise being lived out by thousands of students every year. It is easy to feel welcomed at George Fox University, and challenging course options provide a thorough education that is well worth the cost."
Alum,5,"George Fox is a small, Christian, conservative college. However, this did not prevent me being exposed to other points of views in the classroom. I constantly found myself being challenged to step out of my 'box' that I was comfortable in. I grew in every area of my life. Spiritually, Academically, Socially, Etc. I attribute this growth to what was offered to me during my time at George Fox."
Freshman,5,"My experience thus far at GFU has been both challenging and encouraging. I have faced many challenges in both my faith and in my academics. George Fox's academic counseling and spiritual life groups have shown me what do to improve these areas of my life. The challenges brought growth and success. I have continued to be challenged, but it is encouraging to overcome them and to be a stronger person because of so."
Junior,5,I have loved GFU so far! I have made friends I will keep for life. I play for their women’s lacrosse team and we even won conference last year. My professors all know me by name and are easy to talk to.
Freshman,5,My favorite part about George Fox University is the William Penn Honors Program. The program is based on a great books curriculum and is taught and directed by extremely specialized and well-educated faculty.
Freshman,5,"George Fox is an amazing school. The professors are always available to students for help or just to talk. The community at Fox is absolutely wonderful as well. I am involved in many different community settings and all of them are fantastic. The academics are taken seriously, and the professors want you to make it."
Freshman,5,The nursing program here is amazing! Also the campus is very beautiful and safe. Everyone is very nice and welcoming.
Freshman,5,george fox is an amazing school! the power god flows through anyone who steps on campus. When coming to the this school you dont have to be christian or any religion. you will still be shown the same respect as everyone and the welcoming of who you are as a person is great. I play football for fox and the amount of brotherhood in the program is all amazing and one that will open your own eyes to brotherhood and togetherness.
Freshman,5,"Is an amazing Christian school, all the staff there is really nice and polite. Also the facilities are great! And I have shared nothin but good memories there :)"
Sophomore,5,"George Fox's motto is ""Be Known,"" and they deliver on that motto. When I began attending last fall, I was unfamiliar with the campus, I was already going through very difficult challenges in my life unrelated to college, and I was not living on campus so it would normally be difficult to find a strong community. My professors and Peer Advisors played a crucial role in my integration into the GFU community by simply being available and genuinely caring about my wellbeing. There is no where I would rather be studying."
Senior,5,I love this school!  GFU is a very warm and inviting place.  The people are amazing and the professors really care about you learning.  A lot of professors go out of their way to make personal connections with their students.  It's pretty common for professors to set up coffee meetups once a week to get to know their students and answer questions outside of class.  Fox is a really great environment and I treasure my time there.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about George Fox University. Both the faculty and community surrounding George Fox allows students to be in a safe and high academic environment that prepares them for their future careers. The location of the campus sits between the west coast and Portland which allows students to explore a large variety of extra curricular activities.
Freshman,5,"Be a baby freshman, I was a tad nervous my first day of college. This anxiety all slipped away once I met my peers- they're so kind and caring, some even quite witty. The grand mass of professors that I've learned from are outstanding, I always manage to find something unique or intriguing about one. So far I've made numerous friends, am thoroughly enjoying my coursework, and can't wait to weekdays!"
Freshman,5,"The experience at George Fox University is something that you don't get to have at a college. The diverse, love, and community within George Fox is unbelievable. I like the fact that George Fox challenges you in the classroom but the fact is that they're doing this for the better of the individuals future. As a George Fox student going into the real world they are ""known""."
Junior,5,"Office hours for most of the professors are available for the students, also  you feel like the professors do want you to learn and get what they are teaching you. Also, the environment here is just very peaceful and so welcoming."
Niche User,5,"As a Christian, George Fox University has been such a supportive educational experience for me. I do not have to worry about sharing about my faith, because I am in a Christian environment. The George Fox faculty is always willing to help, are very friendly, and continually practice George Fox's missions statement to Be Known. When I was going through the application process for their university, the staff was supportive and helped me through the entire process. I truly felt respected, welcomed, and known. The university campus is beautiful, well-kept, and safe. From the lush green lawns to the picturesque bridges surrounded by a vibrant forest, the beauty of this university never disappoints. I particularly like the small class sizes which allow relationships to grow between the students and the teacher. The teaching faculty at George Fox University is exceptional. They create a comfortable learning environment and challenge the students to grow. George Fox is a fantastic university."
Freshman,5,George Fox University is a place where your true colors will be allowed to shine. Every professor and office worker want you to succeed in every aspect of your life. The rigorous academic schedule is definitely worth the money and time because the amount of opportunity that comes from it is priceless.
Freshman,5,"It's welcoming, friendly, small class sizes, great food, fun dorms. There is a ton of opportunity to do all kinds of activities like dodgeball intramurals and Fall retreat."
Junior,4,"My classes that had to be moved online once COVID started were not as good. We made do with Zoom and whatnot, but those classes were made to be in-person, not online. I do have one class this semester that was transitioned to be online and I think it is going fairly well. I am missing out on observation hours (it's a teaching class) that I would have otherwise received from the class if there wasn't a virus, but it's going very well!"
Graduate Student,4,"I loved my time at George Fox, but I don't think it is for everybody. 

Just like every college, there is drama with the management and how the school is run. Because this University is operated through the shareholders of local Christians and specifically the Northwest yearly Meeting, the decisions the school makes can be daunting. Namely with acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community and those of minority descent. 

Even in the 4 years at my time with Fox, I did see massive improvements in these departments, but I would like to see more advocacy in the religious departments where I received one of my majors from.  

The climate and dorm like is an absolute blast. The cafeteria was expensive but unlimited and good.

I participated in Track and Field and attribute my time with that program for much of the success I had educationally. I had such a good time, it cleared my head for the strenuous studying that was required. 

I had great relations with students and staff alike. 

Thanks Fox -C"
Graduate Student,4,"It was hard, transferring to online school. It was okay, but since the professors only had one single week to transition, I don't blame them for the hiccups. I'm curious if next year they will have it all figured out for online school. 

Here's to hoping!"
Junior,4,This is a very welcoming community.  The professors really do care about each student and want to see them succeed.  The students are friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend this school.
Alum,4,The relationships and professional networking I got during my time there made it worth it. I loved almost every single one of my classes and I met some lifelong friends during my time there. I learned a lot of life lessons during my undergrad years and was largely shaped by my time there.
Sophomore,4,"What I really enjoy about attending George Fox is the opportunity I have there. The resources are incredible, and the unlimited amounts of opportunities are there. One thing I would change is the amount of chapel credits that Freshman need, at least as an athlete, I feel that I was not able to perform my best because of the chapel time that was needed to be taken out of my day."
Freshman,4,"I haven’t taken any strictly online courses at George Fox, but in the light of the Covid-19 outbreak, my normal courses were moved to online. While this experience was different and possibly more difficult than a normal online class, I felt that my professors did a great job of converting our class online and keeping it engaging and educating."
Freshman,4,"It was difficult because my internet at home was very difficult. I’m sure it would’ve been much more enjoyable had I had better internet. Directions were sometimes difficult, but teachers were flexible and adapted well to the circumstances and I really appreciated that."
Freshman,4,"A little more than halfway through the semester, we had to switch to online learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. The transition went fairly smoothly, I think. I was able to finish the semester strong even with the classes being online."
Freshman,4,"There are a lot of things I like about George Fox University. The campus is beautiful, the professors are really nice and helpful, and there are lots of opportunities around campus for classes, chapel, and fun activities. There are some things that could be improved, however, such as the chapel opportunities."
Junior,4,"What do I like about George Fox University? Campus is BEAUTIFUL year round, many of the professors genuinely care about you and live out the Be Known promise, the community I have found there is like a family to me, and the city of Newberg has so many amazing local businesses that are adored by students. George Fox, and Newberg as a whole, has become my home. 

While I have fallen in love with my college, there are plenty of areas it could improve, largely in how it handles diversity on campus. George Fox is already not a diverse campus, and it has not always been a place where students of color and LGBT students have felt safe. Large groups of students have been working tirelessly this year to improve that, but there is still much work to be done."
Junior,4,"I currently am attending George Fox and am enjoying it for the most part. I definitely have made some great friendships, but the diversity needs improvement. I know some of it they can not control because it also depends on who applies but I would like to see more color on our campus. On billboards there is almost always a person of a different ethnicity and it makes it look like our school is a lot more diverse than it actually is. 
     I think the education program needs improvement because the dean of the department is the reason MANY of my peers changed their major. They are just going to get their masters in teaching because the dean was unbearable."
Freshman,4,If you love a fun welcoming environment but at the same time small and private school then this is the place to be. so many things to do here and Im always busy having fun
Freshman,4,"George Fox University is one of the best schools I have ever attended. You are able to create personal relationships with the professors and other school staff that are not available at other public universities. I felt challenged in my studies but also supported, creating a learning and safe atmosphere for me to grow and further myself in."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Fox and the community here! Their ""Be Known"" promise is very real here. All of the students and faculty are extremely friendly."
Sophomore,4,"I think that Fox is true to what it puts out into the world. Students truly feel known by the school and the professors. It is very genuine and supportive to students. The academics are strong. However, option can be limited if you are an interdisciplinary person."
Junior,4,"The school has very little diversity, and a lot of the students come from families with lots of money. The student life on campus however is very lively and does a great job of bringing everyone together. The teachers are about average for the university, but they do a good job of making themselves available if extra help is needed."
Sophomore,4,"They really stick to their be known promise. All professors I've had, and even ones I did not, made an effort to get to know me and help me succeed in everything I did."
Senior,4,"George Fox has been so special to me, the only thing I really wish would change is their religious opinions on treating everyone equally."
Junior,4,Very personal and relational. The adult degree program has small class sizes and experienced teachers who are very communicative and helpful.
Freshman,4,The professors here are unlike those you'd get at a normal university. I definitely feel a strong sense of community here. However I'm not going to lie it is expensive and not a lot of diversity is present. A lot of micro-racism happens here but not all students are like this.
Sophomore,4,"George Fox is an excellent school.  Class size is small, and almost all professors genuinely care about their students.  I have worked closely with a number of professors to fine-tune my degree to my needs.  One of my professors gave me spiritual and life advice when I was going through a hard time.  All of the staff are friendly and helpful, and student life is great.  Even though as a commuter I spend less time on campus than most other students, I still feel well connected and well known."
Senior,4,"The things I would like to see change:
- Open up grad parking for commuters and others.
- Raise the bar for future applicants so there aren't cramped dorm areas.
- Have local restaurants cater food and have better food in general.
- Stop making chapel a requirement.
- Stop adding on to the already to long list of general education courses.*
- Don't coerce students into living on campus if they really don't have to.
- Stop trying to expand. Instead, focus on remodeling the existing housing spaces, maybe hiring some more staff to help in the kitchen or train current kitchen staff, and work on lowering the costly amount for tuition."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience with this college has been excellent. I am mostly a student focused on my future, and how I can best prepare myself for my career. With that, the professors at the college are very open and trusting to talk to about sharing their path to their careers, and giving opportunities to students, like me, who want to take advantage while their. 

Overall, the school gives the students a very safe and excellent campus to focus on their academics, while meeting very friendly students."
Junior,4,George Fox is a really good school. The academics and professors are excellent. The only thing I would complain about is that they were not very helpful with my transfer credits as well as getting me on track to getting my degree as soon as I could have.
Junior,4,"George Fox University is a great school for those who wish to discuss their religion and religious background without judgement. A contract is required because they want to maintain their Christ centered community. This is why there is no ""Party Scene"" because drinking, drugs, and other illicit activities are fodder for expulsion. They have been working on the Commuter community feel more at home, but it isn't as good as it could be as they seem to treat those who commute with a lack of focus. It has been getting better now that they have a Commuter Life Director, but it can still be rough. The faculty are also really great and understanding of their students. Overall, a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"It's a beautiful campus in a beautiful area. If you are religious, it's a pretty decent University, but they do tend to put Jesus in everything (which isn't always bad, but can become frustrating if you're not Christian).
Their dorms are large and well kept, and their food is great.
If you aren't very outgoing, however, you may have a hard(er) time getting comfortable there.
Their professors are nice and knowledgeable in their chosen areas, and with their community classes, it's not that hard to find at least one friend.
All in all, I say it's a good campus to at least visit if you are Christian (or open to Christian ideologies)."
Sophomore,4,I love George Fox University. There's such a great community all you have to do is find what you love and pursue it. Everyone is very welcoming and accepting of whoever you are and whatever your interested in. It's by far my favorite school and I have gone to a lot of schools growing up.
Sophomore,4,"Computer Science department has good professors that have helped me learn a lot to become the best I can be. The class sizes are smaller so the professors read my code and I can go spend time with them in their offices. Besides that, it's possible to meet new people and make friends, but chapel isn't that great."
Niche User,4,"I have visited three times, and every time I am there, there is a great sense of community and the people are awesome."
Freshman,4,"George Fox has a wonderful campus environment. The teachers are friendly and want to be involved  in their students success. George Fox is slogan is ""Be known"" meaning the teachers at George Fox want to know  their students an individual in their class. I remember the first time I walked onto campus. I had registered for my classes and was walking around the different buildings trying to picture myself there. After walking into the music department I started talking with the woman at the counter and it wasn't too long after that teachers had come out of their office to talk to me. They asked my name, what my major was and told me that I would be in their class. They answered any questions that they could. I could see that they cared. It made me confident that I would be working with good people who seriously lived George Fox's ""Be Known"" promise."
Freshman,4,"The community at George Fox is wonderful. Pretty much everyone is friendly and willing to lend a hand whenever you need help, and the small campus size makes for a great sense of community. This school really cares about students and their issues, and maintains high standards of safety, diversity, academics, and integrity. GFU has a number of connections in the professional world, and strives to make students ready for life after they graduate. I am in the theater program, and it is excellent."
Freshman,4,"The beauty of the canyon to the noise of the student support at sporting events connect the students together. The Christian aspect, however, is not as intense as many people make it out to be. Yes, you are required to attend Chapel services fifteen times a semester, but they only preach on life lessons that truly resinate with us as maturing young adults. Not everyone here is a hardcore believer in God, but there are a lot of individuals who are developing their faith. If that's you, this community is the one for you. Everyone is supportive and is not judgmental. However, if you want modern dorms and top notch food, this is not your place. The school is extremely old, gorgeous, but old. The dorms have not been updated since they have been built aside from the two dorm halls that have been built within the past ten years. Our dining hall has weird hours. This can seem extremely frustrating. All-in-all, Fox is an amazing place to learn and grow in your faith."
Junior,4,The courses are well organized and enjoyable. The professors are supportive and readily available to answer questions. Very positive and supportive atmosphere with a great adult degree program.
Freshman,4,"I will be starting George Fox in two weeks but just visiting a few times I know its going to be a great year. People on campus, the teachers, students and administration are very nice and helpful. The campus is gorgeous, and the town of Newberg is small but still has everything you need and is in the middle of major places like Portland, mountains, and the ocean. They offer a lot of financial aid, and help you try to save as much money as possible."
Freshman,4,GeorgeFox is a great college. The professors are investing in teaching you how how to be successful. Their slogan of Be Known is seen throughout the campus atmosphere. The only thing I would change is their lifestyle contract.
Alum,4,"Pros: The campus is pretty, academics are good, esteemed university,  and ""most"" professors are great. 
Cons: Cliques, expensive, lacking diversity, shove religious views down your throat and if you don't agree your grade suffers yet the student portal is evidence of rampant drugs/sex/partying, no assistance with job placement if you are an Adult degree student, and the film program professors need to be fired - horrible favoritism, uncommunicative, arrogant, and just plain nasty! 
In summary, it's a good school IF you choose the right program, stay to yourself, and do NOT live on campus!"
Senior,4,Overall experience has been good. My advisor is friendly and easily accessible for questions. My program is fast paced and I feel I'm learning a lot. I would like to see more instructor involvement during the weekly forum discussions to ensure the forums are on the right track.
Freshman,4,"George Fox University offers a wide variety of majors with awesome professors. If there is one thing George Fox is known for, it is, well, to be known. The community is friendly and active. The professors want to help you succeed and build a relationship that helps build connections. The career resources are phenomenal, with its College and Career Center offering good advice on internships and job applications. On top of that, the campus is beautiful, with a creek down the middle and lush lawns. George Fox is the university for quality education and wonderful people."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman attending George Fox University and have loved every experience so far. The serene atmosphere and overall beautiful campus is surrounded by a community that cares. The opportunities available extend and is virtually unlimited. The support from the faculty and students helps make the college transition something to look foreword to. 
College Freshman,4,This is a small campus and the housing is convenient to everything.  Moving in was quick and easy thanks to all of the great help that was available.
College Freshman,4,This school has great spirit and a large fan base.
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on the degree, the job outcome is pretty successful for students who graduate from George Fox"
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are small enough that the professors are able to talk with and create personal relationships with students.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus and know I can always call security if I need them.
College Sophomore,4,"Housing on campus is expensive, but the buildings are well kept and nice to live in."
College Sophomore,4,"After adding the football team, sports have become a lot more popular."
College Junior,4,It is a safe place to be
College Junior,4,I see this school really cares about assisting students with finding work within their chosen field of study
College Junior,4,Students that live on campus like it.
College Junior,4,The school has good sports programs
College Sophomore,4,"If you are motivated and take advantage of the hundreds of different networking oppurituties they offer, you will find yourself landing a career well before you graduate. A degree from George Fox stands out and employers know that the school has great programs with very capable students coming out from it."
College Sophomore,4,"The people at George Fox are generally pretty safe and don't do things that would danger others. I feel safe on campus because the school puts a lot of work into doing so, and the students reflect that."
College Sophomore,4,"I had the best most incredible time in Brandt hall this last school year, and felt that the community atmosphere was very special. I made so many great friends and met a ton of awesome people because of the community that the on-campus housing offered."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed running track this year for George Fox, and had the best 8 months of my life with that team and can't wait to participate for another year. I enjoyed watching all of the football, basketball and volleyball games and it brings the school together more and makes everyone feel closer together."
College Sophomore,4,I have never seen a nicer gymnasium
College Sophomore,4,I love ythis school but people spit at my drag queen friend
College Sophomore,4,I am more interested in swing dancing on campus which happens every Saturday night
College Freshman,4,Campus safety and security is great at George Fox University. I feel completely safe there.
College Freshman,4,"It is great to live on campus.  Regardless of what building you live in, the atmosphere is great."
Sophomore,2,"Some classes are in person, some are online. The ones that are online feel so disorganized and chaotic, it's hard to keep up with what's actually happening. Even most of my in person classes are hybrid, and I'm not in class that often. It's frustrating to see the school charging the same tuition for a totally worse education."
Sophomore,2,"Not that great. Totally overrated. As a student I wish I had chosen a different school. What you see on tours and advertisement is nothing like what the school actually is. I'll give them that, their advertising is spot on, they know how to sell this school, but in reality, it couldn't be more different."
Junior,2,It is clear that George Fox University has worked hard to create an online education platform in benefits of the students. I do feel as though George Fox thrives with face-to-face instruction. This last April of 2020 I was able to see the vast difference between those two instructional preferences.
Freshman,2,Half of the spring semester was online due to COVID 19. The transition was not easy and the school did not do well communicating the decisions that were being made.  The classes online transitioned fairly well. Some were better than others.
Freshman,2,"I attended George Fox as a freshman.  Going in I was excited to attend a Christian University where I could grow my faith in community with others. Let's just say the marketing team is very good at this school. Beginning, there was a huge lack of communication regarding classes and housing. I was placed in housing without knowing, housing that is not worth the immense amount of money I had to pay. The dorm was old and only had one working shower. The others were never fixed even after many work orders. There is a lot of activities at the beginning of the year, but they taper off as school continues so there is a definite lack of student activities. They do not stand by their faith. The spiritual life on campus is lacking. I found no places to grow my faith on campus and the chapel and theology class only left me with more questions. Overall, this school does not fit the model of a private school nor the school they market it as. Not worth paying more."
Freshman,2,"My experience as a freshman at George Fox was less than enjoyable. I was unfortunate to be placed with a very toxic and filthy roommate who constantly made me uncomfortable. I brought the situations up to residence life twice to which is swept under the rug and never addressed again. The food was poor quality, some of the faculty just seem like they either don’t know or don’t care about what they’re teaching, and all that comes with a very hefty tuition cost. The school to no surprise has very little diversity, and it doesn’t seem too inclined to change that."
Alum,2,"Review of Business Department 2013-2015. I studied Marketing at this school, graduated, thankfully got a job in marketing. Fired soon after, was not prepared for the job at all. A couple of factors could have been addressed by me, but for a cost of about $60000 for two years at this school, I can say in definite terms that I did not get what I paid for on any level. If you are ALREADY a top performer in your class and your peers and mentors like you, you don’t need to come to this school, save your money. If you are not a “Type A” and see yourself needing some mentorship, guidance, feedback for growth, don’t count on it here. A lot more could be said but in simple terms, there is not much value-added that the school of business delivers for its customers/students."
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do involving drinking or clubbing around this community.
College Freshman,2,"I really don't like having to be required to have a 21 meal plan as a freshman.  It kind of ends up being too much food.  Also, it is horrible that the meals that you miss end up disappearing at the end of the week because it is pretty much wasted money for the student.  A lot of the food has fillers in it, such as taco meat with potatoes in it.  But there is occasionally a really good meal."
College Sophomore,2,"The George Fox Slogan is ""Be Known"" and as much as I wish I could have been known I quickly learned it was just the slogan. George Fox is growing to fast and cannot provide housing, parking, or the small class sizes it promises. It is a sad excuse for the close knit environment it promises."
College Freshman,2,We do not have greek life at George Fox as far as I know.
College Freshman,2,It is very difficult for a commuter to find parking and we pay to not have a parking spot.
College Senior,2,George Fox costs quite a bit and the scholarships provided are minimal.
College Senior,2,"I'm a graduate student so I can go to bars and such but undergrads are prohibited from alcohol regardless of age. Although, I've heard there are places people have places in the woods they hid and ""party"" at."
College Junior,2,There are not that many parties that go on. Most of the parties that do go on are off campus at athlete's houses.
College Junior,2,"Commuter parking needs improving, the most convenient lot has recently been overtaken with construction and we were without half our lot for the first semester of the year, and even now that construction is over we have lost a quarter of it. Another lot has been opened for commuters but is always taken by on campus students and seems pointless to even say commuters can park there."
College Sophomore,2,I have received little financial aid from Fox.
College Freshman,2,Some decent teams bu mostly subpar
College Freshman,2,"My school has many wonderful majors, however the one I am in is extraordinarily small. There are possibly 6-10 people in this major and as such cannot offer diverse classes, or many major specific classes."
College Freshman,2,The majority of the students are white. There is a large international student program though
College Sophomore,1,There are none and when there are off campus parties they get busted
College Freshman,1,I didn't realize there was a present Greek Life here!
College Freshman,1,Its a tiny town about 40 minutes from a big city with no way to get into it!
College Freshman,1,They have horrible food that no one likes. They discourage you from eating to much. They have very little meat which is a problem for athletes.  They have way to much vegan and vegetarian food that is no good for you.
College Junior,1,"Because George Fox is a private Christian school, they constantly try to live by these standards. With that said, being a student here means that you will have to sign a life contract that states you will not engage in drinking, sex, drugs, or anything related while attending. To enforce this rule, George Fox has a time scheduled for when guys can enter/ evacuate a female dormitory or vice versa. In addition, we have RAs, students in authority of a living area, who come to check on their assigned housing locations to make sure that students are abiding by these rules. Their pretty strict on these times and I wish they weren't."
College Sophomore,1,"The university likes to tote itself as being diverse, but that is far from the truth. Not only is the school predominately white, but in terms of sexuality and religious diversity, there is little to none, although that is to be expected. The administration has explicitly stated ""that is not the kind of diversity that we are looking for"" in response to a call for the need for safe environments for LGBTQ students."
College Freshman,1,"I'm not sure that we do in fact have a computer lab, but our wifi here is horrible. Our connection is slow, and at random times, wifi will go down, and it takes forever to get it back."
College Sophomore,1,"Repression Is the Name of the Game. This place stresses me out. I have been having major issues trying to find where my fiance and I will live, as there is no on-campus housing for married couple, and she is NOT allowed to live with me if I'm married. It is also very discriminatory to LGBT students, so much so that if Professors advocate for them, they could be fired."
College Sophomore,1,"Sports Take Precedent Over Academics. Sports take precedent over academics. Athletes are given special treatment just to make the school look good. Large amounts of MY tuition are being used to build a football stadium that I don't want in the first place. And I wondered why it costs $30,000 to go to this school."
College Junior,1,"Pretty Narrow – As a whole our school is not very diverse, however that is somewhat expected at a Private Christian school in the northwest."
College Freshman,1,"Bring a Car – There isn't really a lot to do in walking distance of the school, so bring a car or find something with a car if you want to get anywhere."
College Freshman,1,Wifi- Not the Greatest – The school's WiFi isn't very good; many school officials say that if you have Macs then its better. But even many of my friends struggle with their internet connection. My advice is to get an Ethernet chord and use it when you can.
College Freshman,1,Again it is a Christian school. We are not so big on greek sororities. I think there might be one christian one.
College Senior,1,"Christian Living...Take It or Leave It – I would like to start by saying that I approve of how strict GFU is because it is a Christian Campus.  If you are a non practicing Christian or non-Christian, you must understand that upon being accepted to the School you must sign a Life Style Agreement.  Which entails you proclaiming to the school that you will not be involved in Sexual behavior, drinking, or other acts deemed imoral by Church Standards.  The rules are heavily enforced with 3 strikes your out penalty system."
College Junior,1,"Transporation Doesn't Exist – Newberg is a small town, and GFU is a small school. Because of this, there is no help in transportation, and unless you have a car, you are at the mercy of your friends' generosity."
College Freshman,1,"Held to a High Standard – Upon application to Fox, each student is required to sign a ""lifestyle agreement"", which prohibits students from drinking, using drugs, and sexual activity. All these things still occur on campus, and it's not hard to get away with. However, if you get caught, they are not lenient on punishments, but you can't blame them; they have your signature ;)

In general, I think the school is far more strict than it should be, especially on floor hours for guys and girls floors. However, its livable."
College Freshman,1,"Some Real Food? The food at this school, although it is said to be made from local and all natural sources, is absolutely terrible.  I will say that they have a very consistent selection for those of us who choose to steer away from their ""exotic"" selections.  Everything tastes like it was soaked in salt for to long.  The salad bar is a popular alternative to the hot meals."
College Freshman,1,"There are no Nightlife places at all in Newberg. Its a small town and there really isn't alot of 'Nightlife' going on in this town, any time soon."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus is cheap compared to other universities, but they only allow parking in certain areas.  Each student who has a car is given a sticker related to their on-campus living arrangements.  If someone from another living area on campus parks on the opposite side of campus they will be fined by the university.  They also give out tickets to students who park in neighborhoods across the street from campus."

Senior,5,My time here at The University of the Incarnate Word has been filled with so many beautiful memories. I've meet friends here from all sorts of diverse backgrounds. This school always have an event going on every week and celebrates all holidays from many cultures. I love the environment and the amount of nature that fulfills it. It's home to me.
Senior,5,I've taken Summer and Fall classes all online. All of my professors were able to transition the learning experience very smoothly. Communication via email has been great along with the leniency towards adjusting to this virtual learning.
Senior,5,The classes are incredibly easy to follow on Blackboard. Through Blackboard you can reach professors and classmates as well as all of the resources UIW has to offer.
Senior,5,Everyone I have encountered at UIW are incredibly helpful and kind. The available student resources give you more than you need to succeed. Professors are knowledgeable about the courses they teach.
Sophomore,5,Incarnate Word has made it easy to transition to remote and online learning. They offer great resources for tutoring.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is gorgeous. The professors care about their students, and push them to be their best. Incarnate Word is a place for quality education."
Freshman,5,All my classes are online and the professors are really helpful since classes are small. They send emails when they change assignments or when we are having a zoom meeting.
Freshman,5,Provide great service and it is a really great school. Love the colors and the mascot. Classes are small so teachers are very communicable and helpful.
Freshman,5,it's a very welcoming school. the nursing program is among the top 100 in the country. it's a very diverse school with a large amount of latino students.
Freshman,5,"due to COVID 19 we are taking classes online, but it is a very organized and understanding environment to develop as a student"
Sophomore,5,The past year I attended in person and I honestly loved it. Being face to face with my peers and professors was great too.
Sophomore,5,"Attending this university has opened many doors for me, the education is awesome and I enjoy every minute I’m on campus. When I go to class I am able to go at my own pace but also ask questions when I need to. The only thing I would probably change is the parking, it’s probably the worst thing there."
Graduate Student,5,I like the overall small campus feeling and that all are part of the UIW family and will always be even after graduation.
Graduate Student,5,The professors and school make online learning not only easy but fun and still interactive with your fellow students.
Senior,5,Professors were very good at communicating when things were assigned and how they were to be done. The school was also very good at making sure that students had as much resources available to them as possible.
Alum,5,"I did not end up taking any classes online. On the upside, I did end up having an injury where I was unable to attend clinicals in person.  My instructors were incredible and allowed me to complete learning modules for the clinicals I ended up missing."
Senior,5,"I have only taken classes online during the covid outbreak, however, it was a good experience. The professors were adaptable and made sure we were able to get the best out of the class even remote."
Senior,5,The professors all really care about your success which I appreciate. I do think the school is overpriced and I wish I had taken more basics at a community college.
Freshman,5,I choose this school because I cannot wait to pursue a criminal justice program. The school overall is very qualified and offers students a pathway to faith and success.
Freshman,5,Online learning is something I haven't experienced yet but if it comes down to it UIW would be a great school to have distance learning.
Niche User,5,"From what I've seen and talk to with, they care for their students and their students safety and they are friendly."
Junior,5,This will be my second semester at the University of the Incarnate Word and so far it has been wonderful! Everybody I have met so far have been wonderful and all the teachers have been very helpful.
Senior,5,"Trust me, i am enjoying the set-up. Professors are going above and beyond making sure student learn."
Senior,5,"The culture of the university is unique. Instructors are will to make student understand what is been thought, and encourage student to do their research and get back to them for follow-up if needed. The university is bent on making student succeed in class and in their professional career. the cost worth the knowledge."
Junior,5,There is truly no other place I would rather be. These professors worked there tails off to make this last semester happen due to covid-19. I love this school.
Junior,5,These professors worked so hard to make this semester happen. I just started nursing school this last semester and they truly did everything they could to give us a somewhat normal experience. They had us do many needed virtual experiences and gave us plenty of opportunities to learn the information.
Graduate Student,5,"This university has a beautiful campus and many academic programs to choose from. During  COVID-19, the school remained in communication with students regarding classes and any status in changes or how classes would be affected. 

Throughout the years, this UIW has kept on top of their students in support of continuing educational goals no matter what challenge."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about UIW is that it’s a private school so it’s small and spacious. The professors are very nice and enthusiastic about their work. The university is very diversed despite it being a Catholic based University. They accept all religions or even those that don’t have one. Their university is very pretty and plenty of places to take a walk, jog, or hang out. Their faculty is very nice and helpful and everything is very easy to find. If you’re looking for a small, quiet, and really good school in SATX, check out UIW."
Sophomore,5,I really like University of the Incarnate Word because the professors are very helpful and care about the student's success.
Freshman,5,"Amazing, Everyone there was super welcoming and nice. Beautiful school. Their staff was super helpful and welcoming. I love UIW."

They are so kind and willing to do whatever it takes to make you comfortable when visiting or staying at your school. for someone like me that is very close with my family i was afraid to go to an university but after visiting im so excited for the 2020-2021 year to come.
Freshman,5,"What I like about the University of Incarnate Word is the open as well as friendly environment it has. The staff ensures that all students are warm welcomed and enjoy their experience at the Nest. The security on campus have an extremely quick response time and are easily accessible. Students are guaranteed safety on campus. Along with campus life, Professors on campus show the eagerness to see their students succeed. All of the Professors are professional and enjoy their job. Not only does UIW excel in student life, but is also located in an extremely marvelous area; sitting between Alamo Heights and downtown San Antonio. UIW’s location allows students access to San Antonio’s hot spots; easily letting those who live on campus to enjoy San Antonio."
Freshman,5,"I am currently enrolled and start class in March. I visited the campus and it was very easy to get around. The students and staff were quite helpful and I was able to complete what I needed to on that visit.
I will be going back to the campus this week and I’m looking forward to my visit there."
Freshman,5,Uiw is an nice campus to come to if you don’t want to be over whelmed with stuff like classes of 300 people. This is why I choose this campus . This campus also has a lot of diversity because we have an amazing study abroad program where study’s from other country come here to San Antonio to study so you will meet a lot of new people.
Freshman,5,"I am an imcoming freshman at the University of Incarnate Word for the fall semester of 2020. I have recently went on a visit there and it was absolutely beautiful, the campus is full of welcoming people and the nature around the campus just adds to the beauty of the scenery. I am going on academics and athletes accomplishments and can't wait for my next chapter as an Cardinal !"
Sophomore,5,"UIW is a great a school if you want to be. If you are involved with different organizations you will meet some of the greatest people. I was reluctant to go to UIW at first because it was small and Catholic so it was thought to be a strict school. However, when you disregard these misconceptions you start loving the school. All my professors are amazing and because the school is small I was able to meet some awesome people from all over the world."
Niche User,5,"I wouldn't change a thing from UIW, It's a great college that provides so much opportunity for everyone."
Sophomore,5,"I appreciate the smaller class sizes at UIW. During each semester, most professors will take the time to learn your name and interests in order to help you pass your classes.  A majority of students are christians and everyone I have met on campus has been kind and welcoming."
Senior,5,"The University is an excellent campus that many feel real comfortable with, and notice that there are Senior Citizens attending there as well, such as I.  This 64 year old Retired?Disabled Veteran has been attending school there for approximately close to 3 years or so, and am contemplating into furthering my Educational Endeavor by obtaining my Master's degree as well."
Sophomore,5,"When people ask me what incarnate word is like all I respond to them is that I am so glad I chose to go here. The professors are like friends, I’m where I’m at today because of how amazing the professors are. They push you and help you to be the best you can possibly be. The size of the classes and student size is incredibly important to me, you are never left out due to the size of the classes. Overall I’m so blessed to be at UIW!"
Freshman,5,"I mainly love the theatre program, it has everything I was searching for. It includes voice acting lessons and classes that help find characters for cartoons, and there are amazing programs that are good for film that help others understand how to express emotions on the camera."
Niche User,5,University of Incarnate Word is such an amazing school. So many students come together and become a family. The campus is such a beautiful place especially during winter time when light the way happens.
Sophomore,5,"This is my first semester at UIW, and i couldn't be any more glad of the school I choose, everyone here is great, all my professors are really encouraging to help me succeed  in my career"
Alum,5,"I loved my time at the University of the Incarnate Word! The peers and professors are very friendly and want to help you learn. The campus is beautiful, and definitely walkable from dorms to class. The staff truly treat you like family. Overall, UIW is a wonderful, community-driven school that is worth highly considering."
Freshman,5,My friend gave me a tour of the area. I really liked the school. I'm very excited to attend here in the fall of 2020.
Freshman,5,"The University of Incarnate Word has a big campus, which I really liked it, because when you walk in their campus, you feel very spacious. The classrooms are really big and professional and the professors be taking their jobs very seriously. These college students are very independent and you can see that each of them have their own college life"
Alum,5,I love the family environment the school offers. It is a close nit community. The student to teacher ratio is wonderful and creates a great learning environment
Senior,5,"The University of the Incarnate Word is a wonderful accredited school with students from all different backgrounds and experiences that blend together to become a family. Not only can students walk around the gorgeous campus grounds but the academics and athletics are incredible. At this school, the courses are detailed and thorough. Not only do students really enjoy and learn from their studies, but we are a small community in itself where everyone on campus feels welcome and wants to be a Cardinal. GO CARDS!"
Sophomore,5,This University has always been my dream school so just having the opportunity to go here is amazing. It is an amazing and beautiful campus. The professors are great and everyone is super helpful when it comes to figuring out what you want to focus on either short term or long term. I highly recommend this university to everyone.
Freshman,5,"I very much loved and appreciated how all of the stuff (in any department) takes their time to provide you the best service and give all the information needed. Also, it's a beautiful campus!"
Junior,5,"Overall an amazing school with attentive staff, friendly students, and a beautiful campus. I have already learned so much in my first semester that every moment spent here has been so rewarding!"
Junior,5,I don’t think I’ve ever had this much school spirit in my life! I was accepted into uiw then accepted into their award winning graphic design program! It’s literally the best design program and I’m so happy to be apart of it!
Senior,5,"The University of the Incarnate Word has a welcoming campus and an open environment. The other students are very accepting with everyone, especially of international students. The faculty and staff are very supportive of the students and are willing to help in anyway they can. I love how there are many services provided for the students such as help with finding scholarships and having a writing lab where students can get help with essays. The only thing I could think that could be improved with the University of the Incarnate Word is there should be a diversity of food served there, such as Mediterranean or Thai food."
Sophomore,5,"The University of the Incarnate Word has provided me a great experience to further my education in my nursing career. The campus provides and safe and quiet place to study. The professors are caring,kind, and helpful when helping to understand material."
Sophomore,5,I loved the Campus engagement and activities that are always going on. The only thing that I would change would be the high price of tuition and the limited parking on campus.
Junior,5,"As  a Latina studying Spanish, I appreciate UIW for the respect they have to everyone from different backgrounds. My first taste of inclusion at UIW was the first week of my freshman year at a Diversi-Tea stand. The professors at this campus are simply amazing. I’ve met some of the best people and a majority of them being professors. Beautiful campus, positive feel, and overall everyone values the education UIW has to offer us."
Sophomore,5,I love the University of the Incarnate Word because every faculty member is extremely cordial and respectful. Help from teachers is always available inside and outside of class hours and every teacher I have had so far has been very patient and clear about the material they are teaching. The atmosphere is very welcoming and so are the classrooms and areas to sit down and relax. I feel this is important because it makes the student feel at home and this school has done an excellent job at making their campus inviting and delightful.
Junior,5,Ive been at incarnate word for one year now and I love the campus. Most of the professors are kind and will help you if needed. The small classes allows you to have a connection to your professors.
Niche User,5,I am excited to be a part of this college. I was proud to be accepted. I have gone to numerous gatherings at this college and believe it is the right fit for my career path and the environment I will be in.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience is different depending on the course and professor. I have half asynchronous and half synchronous and personally, I do get my work done and it has been very easy to balance everything out. It also feels more relaxing to know that I can go at my own pace in some courses."
Sophomore,4,My experience at UIW so far has been very eventful. They have these beautiful traditional events hosted by the Sisters of Charity and the communities surrounded. The faculty and staff are all very friendly and help smooth the process of changing pace and structure compared to HS. The student body is very diverse which makes the student life more cultured and have various events dedicated by every minority. It made it feel like home.
Senior,4,"I like the fact that the classes are small, the professors are more personal and understandable when it comes to asking questions and getting in contact with them. I would like to see better communication from the administrative side of the school with students."
Junior,4,"i personally don't like online classes, it's harder for me to comprehend the material. my professors went out of their way to make sure the material was easy to grasp whenever we got moved to online due to covid-19."
Junior,4,"the thing i liked most was how small the campus was, it was easy to get around and also having smaller class sizes helped me in academics."
Alum,4,"It was a great university. I loved how small the campus was. It was awesome to see familiar faces in the basic/core courses. As you advanced, you would still see friends in different majors because of the small campus size. Downside... parking. Parking was a pain. Even with the added parking garage, it was a real struggle to find parking, especially during the day."
Senior,4,"My experience at the University of the Incarnate word has been a fun and memorable. UIW allows its students to be interactive with each other, as well as giving each student the opportunity to demonstrate their individuality."
Junior,4,"Despite the pandemic and the quarantine, the teachers were fast in accommodating themselves to online classes. They made sure everyone had access to their lectures and assignments and successfully answered every question we had."
Sophomore,4,UIW is a community-knit university! I have been enjoying studying here. It is very peaceful and small.
Freshman,4,My experience at the University off the Incarnate Word has been amazing! Everyone is super nice and all university staff and all professors are willing to assist with with any questions. University of the Incarnate Word is an amazing University!
Freshman,4,"What I love about this university is its diverse program. There are many people from different cultures that come to this place to succeed in the future and that amazes me. However, what I would like to improve is its tuition cost. Many of us, unfortunately, don't have a high income to provide for our education and I think that could change."
Junior,4,"The community on campus is very welcoming of all types of people. Despite being a Catholic school, the ideals of the religion are not as pushed as you may expect. Most professors seem to love what they do and are eager to help you understand the material."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the smaller friendly campus that i experienced. Other students were helpful and active in the school. The campus is beautiful and in a great location. The learning experience was enjoyable while the work load was easy to manage. Smaller class sizes made for the best environment possible.
Freshman,4,"The academics of the university are excellent and the faculty id very dedicated to teaching. So far, I have enjoyed my time at this university, though the campus may be a bit too small for me."
Senior,4,"UIW has a lot of resources that are useful, along with a staff that tries to help you as much as they can. The classes are small and sometimes it can be easy to communicate with your professor. The only complaint is that sometimes when you call the office it takes awhile for them to pick up. Other than that, the university is good especially when in person."
Graduate Student,4,It is a good institution and the faculty members have been amazing thus far. They speak of diversity and I can tell that they are really attempting to try and incorporate it. I look to continue at the university and enjoy my time their. They private school aspect is what attracts a specific group of students which can affect your experience.
Graduate Student,4,"Great campus, student services offices are quick to answer and always ready to help. Great opportunity to work with diverse groups of people."
Sophomore,4,The school itself is very beautiful. It is a small school that looks big but has so much history to it. The professors do help you individually but sometimes it is hard to get them to pay attention.
Freshman,4,I can't wait to start as an upcoming freshman. Everyone seems nice and all of the staff and faculty are very friendly. I love that the classes are small and how it is easy to communicate with my professors already.
Sophomore,4,the school itself is fantastic. I think there could be some major changes done to the administration. The professors are very hands on and accomadating with all students due to the small class sizes.
Junior,4,"I transferred to this University from a community college, and I have loved my time here so far. However, it has not been an easy or smooth transition. In fact, it has been difficult as a transfer student to become accommodated to the requirements of the University. If there was a way to bypass some of the requirements for students who are already juniors/have 2 years completed from another college would be extremely helpful."
Freshman,4,My experience here at the school has been great. Classes are small and it has allowed me to be more hands on with my teachers! The cost is a little high but it has been worth it so far.
Freshman,4,"I would recommend attending the University of the Incarnate Word. But be completely sure on your major. For example, I wanted to be a biology major due to not knowing what else to choose. But since then, I've decided that biology is not for me. But they have nothing related to animal science. The college life is what you'd see on tv minus the obsessive partying."
Junior,4,"Incarnate word has been very welcoming school full of diversity. I have had a great overall experience. The facilities are magnificent, the resources available to the students are reliable and readily available. We have great onsite tutoring offered in a number of subjects."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy attending the University of the incarnate word, the campus is beyond beautiful. Located downtown San Antonio, there are many things to see on and off campus. 
Campus life is very active, everyone is kind and welcoming. As well as the professors are understanding and very intelligent."
Freshman,4,"The University of the Incarnate Word is a very fun and compelling campus that has plenty of majors and minors for any degree that your looking for. However the college can get a little expensive, especially if you choose to live on campus and some of the dorms do not come with kitchens or kitchen appliances so those may come out of your own pocket."
Junior,4,"I like the size of the campus, it is not too big and it is not too small. I like that its easy to get to places and the area outside of the university is just as beautiful as the inside."
Junior,4,I am going on my 3rd year at UIW and this experience has been great. The campus is beautiful. I usually go on runs throughout the campus towards the little trials in the back which is wonderful. I realize the cost unfortunately is a fortune but you’re getting what you paid for I believe. There is some specific areas where they can nickle and dime you but also nothing is free. There is access to a gym which can be crowded but it has everything you need. There is a diverse amount of students which can help you connect and see different experiences and point of views. One thing I would change is the parking space it’s a hassile if you don’t have an early class or really late class but you just show up 30-45 mins early before class and you should be fine. The buildings are really  old so their can be problems in the dorms. Other than that I’ve had such a great experience and can’t wait until graduation!
Junior,4,"I love the professors at UIW. They are always willing to assist students, and are always available for whatever needs a student may have. The atmosphere is very vibrant, as well as it's location in Downtown San Antonio."
Sophomore,4,"The University of the Incarnate Word is a very family friendly school. If you are looking for a small school this one is for you. It is located downtown of San Antonio which is the heart of the city. Not only does it have an amazing location but its staff is also amazing, the administration at UIW is always willing to help the students. It is however a very expensive school but, the one on one that you get from teachers and staff is always worth it. In this school you are not just a number you are a priority. I am currently studying Fashion Design and I can truly say the arts program is on top of it. The amount of information that you get is mind blowing. The program truly shows everything from the roots of fashion to culture appropriation in dress. The school also provides a lot of on campus community hours. I truly recommend this school specially if you are interested in the arts program."
Sophomore,4,"The incarnate word has opened many doors for me and I have not even graduated yet. The friends I have made are amazing. The professors really do care about your future and want nothing but the best. Incarnate is more than some college to me, it’s my second home. This school offers so much for their students and are still
Improving the campus."
Senior,4,The professors for athletic training are amazing. It’s very hands on and they’re there for you whenever you need them. The school has fun events every week! And lots of give aways. Everyone is so nice and it’s easy to make friends. The campus is small enough to be able to hang out with friends right before class and still get there on time. I LOVE IT!
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this school is very open and community like. There is always easy access to teachers and faculty if you need to meet with them, and there are multiple resources available through the school off campus that emphasizes the versatility of this university."
Niche User,4,I have two relatives who attend this school. The small environment enables students to have a better learning experience and enhances teacher student relationships compared to larger schools.
Senior,4,The campus is lovely and has a friendly atmosphere. Some changes would be nice such as a a smoke free campus or areas that smoking can be contained.
Senior,4,The university of the incarnate word offers many opportunities for you adults to find out what they want to do in their lives. The professors there treat you like a person and not just a number so they will always be there for you when you need them. There is no doubt that new students to the campus can come in not knowing what they want to do and later down the road find exactly what makes them shine.
Junior,4,The school is small so there is a lot of one on one interactions with professor which really makes you feel like you improve.
Graduate Student,4,The University is well diverse and the teachers are very willing to put themselves out there for your betterment. The campus is small enough that you do not feel overwhelmed but still big enough that not everyone knows your name. The area of town around it has many different restaurants with varying price ranges but all delicious.
Sophomore,4,"I love that since my field is small, it allows us more time or critiques and feedback from professors and classmates. The only thing I have an issue with is the pricing of tuition and resources such as printing, but overall, my expereince has been great."
Junior,4,"They are very direct and open to people but can be very dead set in their beliefs. This has led to judging because this is considered a Catholic University. Diversity needs to be celebrated more. 
If you are active on the campus and with organizations, this university can easily provide some of the most fulfilling experiences of your life."
Sophomore,4,"As a former student athlete at UIW I was very disappointed with the athletic facilities and coaching for a division 1 school. However this is where the negatives end, the campus is beautiful and the classes are great. The location in the heart of San Antonio is also great for the full college experience. For a athlete I would consider other options, but for the average college student UIW is a great school."
Freshman,4,"This private university is very neat! It's expensive;but, all the activities are cool and nice to interact with. Everyone invites all to connect together in many cultural and social groups. The professors are nice and since the classrooms are small, they actually know your name and love to communicate with the class."
Junior,4,The thing I love most about my university is that it is a decent size to where I can socialize but it is small enough to where classes are small. I love getting the little bit of extra attention that you probably could not get at a large university. UIW also has a major called Rehabilitative Science that is very specific for what I want to study.
Freshman,4,I like the small classroom they make good learning experiences. The professors are willing to help and answer any questions. It's a friendly safe campus.
Freshman,4,Its a beautiful campus! A perfect size for incoming freshman. The dorms are very pretty and they feel just like home once you've settled in. Students are very nive especially to new freshman.
Senior,4,"The University of the Incarnate Word is a small, close-knit community. To have fun, get involved in campus life. Academically, most of the professors are wonderful! There are plenty of student resource. The campus is so diverse and accepting. I love it! The food is improving, but there is a lot to do outside and around campus as well, so enjoy the experience by exploring."
Freshman,4,"The university is great, along with the perfect class size. The only downfall is the expense, but for being a private school and having the best professors it's worth it."
Senior,4,"I love the welcoming atmosphere, the small class size, being part of the community, and the Catholic foundation of the University. Another thing that I love is seeing the sisters being involved with the students and groups on campus."
Senior,4,I'm currently going into my senior year here at UIW and I have thoroughly enjoyed being here. Most teachers are very considerate and are available to talk to you. If I would like to see anything change it is adding more types of undergraduate and graduate degrees.
Freshman,4,It's a great school.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Freshman,4,"As a college freshman, I really didn't know what to expect of the college life. But now that I am almost two semesters in, I am really enjoying my studies at The University of the Incarnate Word. The area is nice and the campus is clean, friendly, and safe. The professors here truly care about our education, and the small class sizes help give us a better relationship with them. I am definitely looking forward to the rest of my college career here at UIW."
Senior,4,"Overall, our university is a nice place to study and get your education. I truly believe in the values of the Sister's of Charity--Education, Service, Truth, Innovation, and Faith. Our University is growing and changing rapidly but it still preserving has a small campus feel environment.  The people in the community are helpful, caring and engaged in the development of the student outside of the classroom. I love that the university is really close proximity to the airport, downtown and easily accessible to fun venues. I love the university and hope you do well if you choose to attend a Catholic Institution. You will not regret your experience at UIW! Home of the Cardinals!"
Junior,4,"I love the small class sizes and personalized experiences. The professors there are really there to help and want you to succeed. Outside of one or two experiences, I have had a great time with my classes. My only con for this is that it is a religious school, so expect that viewpoint to come up from time to time. However, it is 100% bearable, speaking as someone who is no where near religious. It is a small school, so be aware that social opportunities are based on sports events, Greek life, school sponsored events, etc. Making friends can be a little challenging, but that is to be expected from college in general."
Alum,4,"UIW is overall a good school. I started out as a transfer student out here halfway my sophomore year and I loved being a student there. I loved the beautiful campus, the amazing professors here and the city of San Antonio overall. I really enjoyed running in the headwaters trails on campus and I loved making friends here on campus. There are some things that the University could work on and that is improving food service at cafeteria, improving police services and also making aid a little bit more easier on the financial side. But I am satisfied about earning my education there at UIW and I will never forget the memories that I made in that University that I love to call home! Go Cardinals!!!"
Senior,4,Incarnate word is absolutely homey to me. I come from a very small town so the student to teacher ratio was perfect for me and I didn't feel homesick to often since it gave me that feel. The professors are great and work with you! The caf is personally not the greatest. But they have fresh fruit on the daily and breakfast is great!
Junior,4,Since I came from a class of 25 in high school I really liked how small the class sizes are. The campus gives off a peaceful vibe that doesn't make the stress from classes so stressful.
Freshman,4,If you're a student who still wants to feel like you're in high school... Not the place for you. Very quiet and grown up atmosphere.
Sophomore,4,I love most things about the school. I can go online or in person or a combination of the two. The information I am learning is very relevant. The professors are engaging and friendly. The only thing I seem to have trouble with is advisors. They have a high turnover rate. 
Sophomore,4,"UIW is great if you want to dedicate yourself to academics. Very welcoming to everybody. However, sometimes athletes get a sense of priority. Small classes make the learning environment great as well as the friendliness of professors and students."
College Freshman,4,"At first, things were a lot different, a bunch of new people with all these backgrounds, coming to UIW and it's great! UIW would be definitely top 3 choice if I could do it all over again, I wasn't even a considering UIW at the time, but my experience has been great!"
Freshman,2,"if you're looking for rigorous academics this is the college for you. They definitely take them seriously and will provide you with a stellar education. That being said every other aspect is subpar. The dorms are super over priced, there are a very few food options on campus, and all of the offices are rude and unhelpful. Every time I have had to submit a piece of paper work they without fail lose it and blame it on me. Overall not a school I would recommend."
Niche User,2,I have heard a lot about this school. Although I am only a High school senior I would like to attend this school.
Niche User,2,This school was a beautiful campus but the surrounding area was not the best. It would probable be of your best interest to not walk alone at night. The professors were unclear of the material and the financial department was not informative.
Junior,2,"This University is very costly. I'm currently enrolled in the nursing program and it seems as though we are teaching ourselves. You would think that we are seen as a big ""$"" rather than a working college student."
College Freshman,2,They might do things for the community but they're not big on campus
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is okay, their on-campus parties have gotten shut-down, but were fun before that. There's not a lot of Greek life, only a couple fraternity's/sorority's. They mainly keep to themselves, but are fairly welcoming to those considering pledging."
College Freshman,2,Very bad living for freshman boys and the housing process is twisted.
College Junior,2,"For what we pay (Almost $10,000 for a single) it's not so great."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics is a big part of the college experience, but at my campus I feel as it is not a great deal important to be into the sports we have around campus. Those who are heavily into sports attend the games and cheer on our team, but unless you are very interested the athletics aren't a big deal."
College Junior,2,University staff don't help me just because i'm an international student. So I might have to leave the school because of finance problem
College Junior,2,"I don't know anything about the off-campus housing options except the hotel that overflow housing students get when the campus runs out of space that forces them into the most expensive option. While you can be grateful to have a place to stay during the semester, it would still be nice for more options to open so students could avoid the situation."
College Freshman,2,no one goes; only decent sports are ones with water; little/no school spirit
College Freshman,2,"NONE on campus, have to drive to club/other campus"
College Freshman,2,"I received the merit based scholarships but I needed the extra aid from Federal/State loans but UIW refused to do aything with my TASFA application. One representative said he's ""Never seen anyone who filled out the TASFA receive any aid"" whhile another representative said, ""Well it looks like your application was received and processed on March 4th, but the aid must have run out"". I just want a student aid report that shows what I would have received if the aid didn't ""run out"". By the way, the priority deadline for FAFSA and TASFA is March 15, which should ensure you get the maximum aid possible, yet I received none, not even a student aid report. I also spoke to Amy Carcanagues about this but she offered no assistance or empathy to my situation."
College Freshman,2,"Chick Fil A should have more options and should be made fresh to order not just sitting under the heat lamp. Sammy's is okay but one time I got a SIX DOLLAR wrap and it smelled really foul so I am never going there again. Finnegans just doesn't know how to make coffee well. UIW needs a legitimate Starbucks on campus, I know it will be successful and everyone will really appreciate it."
College Sophomore,2,"As a female athlete I believe more could be done to accommodate us. Most female sports do not have their own locker room and as nice of facilities as men sports. Also some Male sports do not have locker rooms either but I can compare a male sport equal to mine and they have by far nicer things. The baseball team has two fields a practice and the field they play on. Proper press box and stands for their fans. They have a covered batting cage. They also have a net they covers the whole backside of their field. Our net only covers half of the left side and when we hit batting practice on the field. We sometimes hit it over and we hit cars. So imagine walking to you car with a big ol' dent on the hood of your car, in which you have to pay for because you parked there at your own risk. I could go on for days about that.... Our school spirit is awful, just head over to a football game. On the other hand the Mens basketball team is really good and school spirit for them is completely different. Our student involvement is not up to par. I would not know how to fix school spirit. There just is not the same excitement for sports as there is and was in high school."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no Greek housing places available. Honestly, I have nothing against the Greeks but I feel like they are non-exsistant."
College Junior,2,UIW is now division 1 and we don't have the amenities for that kind of division.
College Sophomore,2,"We need better chapters on campus, and special frat housing."
College Sophomore,2,I need a better variety!
College Student,2,After the incident by the campus police I feel as though none of the student feel safe with the campus police.
College Senior,2,"There are limited scholarships available from the school for part-time graduate students.  For those trying to avoid student loans, please be aware that you will probably have to work full time and use the tuition payment plan."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much you can do, it's really boring and so constrained"
College Sophomore,2,"It's really old, needs a lot of renovating"
College Sophomore,2,"It's really old, needs a lot of renovating and the students are taking too much money out of their pockets to pay for their things"
College Sophomore,2,"The only good places are McDonald's, Sonic, and Starbucks"
College Student,2,Its extremely hard to find any kind of parking in the middle of the day.
College Student,2,"The people here are pretentious, and the few guys that are attractive are usually full of themselves and rude."
College Student,2,No one really pays any attention to it.
College Student,2,"The dining hall closes by 8 each night, and the food itself is extremely bland.  Your best bet is to go eat at the ICC."
College Student,2,"Overall, you get a very small taste considering the tuition."
College Student,2,all restaurants are closed after 10.
College Freshman,2,There's not really a drinking scene
College Freshman,2,There's not really any off-campus housing.
College Sophomore,2,not a big part of campus life
College Sophomore,2,its unfortunate they cant have houses
College Freshman,2,They're helpful if you nag them.
College Freshman,2,I don't park on campus but from what I hear it can get pretty crazy. It is difficult to find a spot so you should get to school early just to find a parking spot.
College Freshman,2,not always available where you may need it 
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you arrive very early to class, you will find it very difficult to find a parking spot on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Parking lots on campus fill up extremely fast, and most times stay until around 6p. There is no off campus parking options, unless you are willing to risk getting towed or a ticket for parking on private property. Residents get to park almost anywhere on campus, but commuters are limited and often park on the hill which is approximately a five minute walk from main campus."
College Freshman,2,"There is Chic-fil-A on campus, but their food is so greasy and they only serve five items from the Chic-fil-A menu. There is another place called Jva on the Hill, they have a nice array of fried food and they stay open until 10p Mon-Thurs. I have avoided eating at Marian Hall, the campus cafeteria, some of thei food is tasteless and they do not have a wide variety of food."
College Senior,2,No good nightlife unless you have a car!
College Senior,2,I hate parking on campus... its the worst
College Senior,2,"I didn't receive financial aide because I reached my limit... However, they were not to helpful in explaining what other options I had, if any..."
College Freshman,2,In order to find parking you have to be present at school before 7 am if not be prepared to make your rounds around the campus. It seems we have twice the amount of students compared to the parking spaces event the professors complain. The parking permit cost $200  and maybe its just me but I believe that is ridiculous especially it is a gamble to find a parking space...have i mentioned there is tons of construction going on?
College Sophomore,2,The stubborn part is trying to find financial aid in order to actually pay for the campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of the permit is not worth it, because there is never parking on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Don't really feel uncomfortable on campus. Police are located close to center and walk around every know and then. Don't really feel it is necessary to be on guard at all
College Sophomore,2,Very nice. Several places to hang around and talk or to study. Student center is a little small but is able to hold enough and location of workout facilities is nice.
College Sophomore,2,I like that the school is smaller and can get more attention from the teachers so I can get plenty of help on studying. The school has a really nice homey feel to it and has nice scenery as well. Only thing I would like to adjust would be the tuition but that's just me.
College Sophomore,2,Seems about average where rules are applied and addressed but where some students still ignore.
College Sophomore,2,No housing provided for Greeks but they still try to run many activities in the main circlet on campus. Most other students don't mind Greeks but there are some that are known to have a reputation or two
College Sophomore,2,Can get really hot during the summer and can get flooded during the rainy seasons but overall very nice weather
College Sophomore,2,Big city with the school just about located near the heart of it. Very close to downtown and shopping centers with plenty of things to do.
College Sophomore,2,The shuttles run frequently and there are several that run at the same time so you can always expect to get on one.
College Sophomore,2,The curriculum is fair and the workload can get a little out of hand if you don't manage your time well enough. Most of the facilities specialize in a field or two. 
College Sophomore,2,The school is small and the professors get to know you very well. I have yet to have a teacher or professor who did not have a high degree in their area of expertise. You do still get your teacher who does not care but overall they try their best. The academics is pretty great which is what drew me in the first place.
College Sophomore,2,The school is located near downtown and has many off campus dining options if your willing to go and discover the city.
College Sophomore,2,I don't go out to often but have found a few affordable places to go to every once in a while. It is a big city so there are plenty of places to go if you have the time and money.
Niche User,1,Behavioral Health Counselor Laurel Clement is abusive and HR covers for the school so they won’t get in trouble. Terrible counseling services
Sophomore,1,"The school is expensive . I would like the school to invest into newer buildings , student life , and cheaper dorms . Students can’t live on campus because the price is too expensive . The only decent place to eat is chick fila which will get old after your first semester ."
Freshman,1,"EVERYTHING IS OVERPRICED! UIW seeks every opportunity to overcharge students. Besides the huge amount of money spent, the school isn’t even that great. Staff is terrible, most of them are stuck up staff that hate doing their job and take it out on students. A UIW degree values the same as any small college, but UIW wants to make an appearance to the wold that they are beyond in academics when in fact the professors suck at their job! I only found ONE professor who actually loved the job and loved helping students, the rest of the professor focus on their class being seem as the “hardest” rather than actually helping students. I attended here and I am currently applying to transfer. I hardly recommend you not to attend!"
Junior,1,I would not recommend this school to anyone. Horrible staff and a waste of money. It is very overpriced for the education you receive. The dorms always have ants and the food always has hair in it 
College Senior,1,It is honestly almost non existent on campus. Nobody really does it.
College Junior,1,"I can't wait until I graduate, and when I do I'm not looking back."
College Junior,1,I honestly don't belive having a degree from UIW will mean much to others.
College Junior,1,I honestly hate that I choose to go here. My college career has been the worst experience of my life.
Recent Alumnus,1,It's obvious money is the most important thing for them not the education or financial status of the student. You are just another dollar sign to them. If they could charge you for breathing in their campus they would. Some teachers also have a power trip and will make graduating impossible for their own entertainment. Money money money and power that's what their mission statement should be. Oh and the education is ok definitely not worth what they charge and all the trouble they put you through. Administration is a mess they make you walk all over campus because no one knows who's in charge. The only people who are helpful are the deans.
College Junior,1,"This is a Catholic University, so the ""party scene"" is understandably nonexistent.

However, Marian Student Center would be more enjoyable the way it was two years ago with more couches and spaces for students to sit down and come together. The renovation estranged students and didn't feel welcoming anymore."
College Freshman,1,absolutely NO parties around here
College Freshman,1,"A policy that has completely ruined my experience at UIW is the one forcing international students to have insurance. I paid $1,070 for that stupid card thats collecting dust in my room despite paying $500+ for insurance EVERY MONTH!!!!!! I spoke with the director of ISSS but he offered no assistance. Twice. Also appealed to other staff of UIW and was told to speak to the director of ISSS which didn't help me."
College Sophomore,1,It is just ehh. Like the food makes your body go through a change and it is not a good one.
College Sophomore,1,Living in Alamo Heights hikes up the prices.
College Sophomore,1,It's so strict it's like you can't do anything
College Freshman,1,Lights are out early on campus unsafe to walk alone
College Freshman,1,The parking on campus is always difficult to find. I think the parking should be expanded.
College Junior,1,"I don't drive, but the parking is terrible on campus! I feel bad for everyone who has to drive. "
College Sophomore,1,The permit costs are a little ridiculous considering that parking gets filled up relatively quickly during certain hours. It is helpful that there are large parking garages near the dorms with shuttle buses providing travel down to campus. However during the early hours of the day the shuttles get filled up quickly.
College Sophomore,1,"The food in the cafeteria is horrible and I try my best to stay away from there. The school has a few other ""cafes"" that are somewhat better food wise but there is still much room for improvement. There are few meal plans and dollar deductions but would be better if the student were allowed to choose how they want their money divided rather than what plans are offered."

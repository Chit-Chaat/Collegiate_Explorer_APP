Freshman,5,"I'm currently a first-year student at Dunwoody and my experience has been exceptional. Due to COVID-19 school is currently online but Dunwoody provides laptops which makes learning easier and accessible for students that may not have personal laptops. Again, although the school is online the environment is welcoming and professors do their best to make sure students are following, work at their pace, and especially no one is left behind."
Freshman,5,"I have only taken classes online due to the virus. Although it's not the same as being in person Dunwoody is doing their best! Professors are understanding and do their best to explain no matter how many times you ask. They provide virtual Thursday yoga because they know many of us just stare at our screens all day. In a nutshell, even though school is online Dunwoody is still taking care of its students."
Alum,5,"This school really changed my life for the better by showing me the amazing careers that are available in manufacturing. Instructors will spend the time with you to help you understand what you are doing and help you succeed.  If you put more work and effort into your own learning and success, they will help to enable you to excel. Attending here was one of the best choices I've ever made."
Alum,5,"I didn't really take any online classes, but using the online portal for the classes was very easy and the instructors were willing to work with you to figure it out as long as you don't wait until the last minute to ask!"
Senior,5,"Dunwoody is a great hands on learning experience. I feel as though the instructors truly care about the students success in school and in life. I feel like I am being well prepared for the industry I am going in to and I was able to get a job in my career field in my first year of school. They have flexible evening programs which helps someone like me, who works full time during the day. Overall I have had a great experience."
Sophomore,5,The instructors are amazing and really care about your learning experience even though all this virus the instructors have adapted very well
Sophomore,5,Originally I was only taking one online class and that was fine but then all the covid hit and all of my classes were online the instructors were very well at turning to online
Junior,5,"ACADEMICS:
Dunwoody's approach is different. A hands-on learning environment in combination with a sense of community in my major's department keeps me consistently engaged and motivated. 

PROFESSORS:
Honestly, the professors make all the difference. These are experienced, industry professionals that care about you as a future professional. To them, you're not a statistic of how many students pass their course so that the school funds their research, like other institutions. 
*Cough* University of MN *Cough*
The Bachelor of Architecture program (which recently was nationally accredited in March 2020 by NAAB) has around 10-15 students per instructor. This invites a more personal relationship with professors while promoting networking, which is a huge bonus.

CAMPUS:
The school is old. However, recent renovations replaced the old gymnasium with a wonderful library and plenty of private rooms for those working in group projects to work with TVs and their school-provided laptops."
Niche User,5,"have not attended yet. but what i heard from is its a good school. the reason i wish to go here is because its a technical college, which is what i want."
Sophomore,5,"I love the hands on learning you receieve. The classes are small. The teachers are amazing, they are always willing to help you. I only ever had one bad teacher and after the class complained about how he never taught, the school fired the individual. The school listens to concerns of the students and wants to make your experience here the best."
Freshman,5,"Small Class, you are to engage with both classmates and Professors.
Hands on learning
Multiple scholarship offers for new students"
Junior,5,"Dunwoody is an amazing technical college with a solid reputation. Dunwoody’s reputation opened a lot of doors for me after graduating. Now that I’m returning to school to persue my Bachelors degree, I’ve decided to return to Dunwoody."

Freshman,5,"The faculty is incredibly helpful and accommodating, and the instructors have created fantastic curriculums, that directly relate to your area of study."

College Junior,5,"All of the student resource centers, study areas, and campus are well maintained and provide everything a striving student may need.  The student study lounges are large enough to accommodate a sizable group of students.  There are also multiple facilities on campus that students can go to study or receive help which helps with how efficiently students can work and use their time effectively"
College Junior,5,love that I  started studying in field I am going into with lots of hands on experience
College Sophomore,5,"Again, 95% graduation rate, it is an amazing thing- and a lot of other students have come back and retold their experiences."
College Sophomore,5,"The students seem to be quite happy with where they're at class wise and how they treat one another; always being gentlemen when they can, being polite to one another, and they have friendly conversations between one another that always seems to be enjoyable."
College Sophomore,5,"I was actually able to choose how I wanted my schedule to work and how I saw it coming together in the end. It turns out that with some assistance of my advisers, I was able to get my schedule out and ready to be fixed if there was a problem (which there never was)."
College Junior,5,"The classes and curriculum are scheduled according to the program, not by students. The architecture program runs 9:00/9:30 to 13:30/14:30 (depending on the day). I had a few classes transfer effortlessly, so this semester I don't have a class at 7:30. This schedule works great for myself and my 14 classmates; we rarely have anyone absent. After school jobs, internships and social lives are all very easy to manage with this schedule. Lastly, as an extra bonus this year, the dean of our program added a half hour lunch break."
College Junior,5,The Computer network Is great I don't have problems logging in or wireless problems.
College Junior,5,My school schedule is very flexible and time consuming. I just started school last week and it is my first year of college so far I am really enjoying everything about Dunwoody Technical College.

College Junior,5,I have found that the resources are very well prepared and they have many options for jobs. I found a job thru my school so they do a great job with that.
College Senior,5,"I am enrolled in the networking program.  I personally struggle with learning from a book.  Book work still a large part of learning at Dunwoody, but I feel they have balanced it very well with actual hands on experience."
College Junior,5,It is an older school but I love the history that comes with it
College Senior,5,"I think that the work load is very reasonable for the program that I chose to attend, the instructors are very willing to help the students with just about any problem they have. If there is ever a problem with tuition, schooling, food at the cafeteria, just about anything, there is someone there to help. Dunwoody is a very small school and there isnt any reason a student cannot get the help they deserve, Dunwoody does a great job of accomplishing this."
Senior,4,Switching to online learning during COVID has been difficult but I feel like the instructors have truly put in a lot of effort and are doing the best they can to make the learning experience good for the students.
Freshman,4,"Specialists are popular. Each industry from development and assembling to transportation and data innovation needs architects to take care of issues and drive advancement. 

In Dunwoody's School of Engineering, your instruction begins on the very beginning. Coursework is venture based, which implies hypothetical designing standards are fortified and experienced through hands-on creation and critical thinking. You class sizes will be little both for your major and your general ed and electives. Industry pioneers and experts routinely give input on the abilities, activities, hardware, and programming expected to guarantee you are prepared to take part in complex building ventures from the very first moment."
Freshman,4,"I like the classes and all the different machines they have available to work with.  School is challenging and forces me to be independent.  Some teachers are extremely good, others not so much.  The dean is excellent."
Freshman,4,"An excellent school with quality education and a welcoming atmosphere, as well as small class-size. Makes an active effort to have a diverse student population."
Freshman,4,I am a first year student and have adapted well and have had resources in doing so.  Teachers have been helpful.
Junior,4,it is a very hands on school for me and it really does prepare in your field. they really find teachers with a wide variety of skills and personalities  it really shows that they care about the education they are giving us they are helping us make connections and allowing us to work together as if we had jobs in real . The students attending this college really care about the experiences of new students. Dunwoody has a very high hiring rate and is also going through  accreditation and are in the final stages of being approved.
Sophomore,4,"Dunwoody is a great school for those who did not thrive at a traditional college as like myself. All the staff is really friendly and supportive. They actually take issues like mental health seriously. There are no real dorms, however, they do offer help with housing at a local apartment complex in Minneapolis."
Sophomore,4,"My experiences in Dunwoody was good and people there are nice. I like the way they have classes that focus on the field of work you are studying for and the amount of people in the class maybe small but, it lets you have a great connections with all your classmates."
Senior,4,I like that the classes are hands on. The instructors are there to help you succeed as long as you ask for it. I just wish it wasn't so expensive.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see change in the facilities, it is a very old building and has very poor circulation with heat and air conditioning. Also I would like to see them add housing or dorms for students."
Freshman,4,"Great hands on learning, experience and knowledgeable professors, nice and engaging learning environment!"

College Senior,4,Every course required have proved very applicable in the field. Every professor I had was very knowledgeable about their field and really invested in teaching well and helping each student learn
College Senior,4,Every course required have proved very applicable in the field. Every professor I had was very knowledgeable about their field and really invested in teaching well and helping each student learn

College Junior,4,"The instructors at Dunwoody are great. The atmosphere of having a smaller scale of students really helps with the amount of personal time offered to each individual. As for the class registration, the college registers each student automatically to fit their requirements needed for their specific major."
College Junior,4,Really hands-on and career oriented
College Junior,4,Great experience with financial aid
College Junior,4,It has been very convenient for me

College Junior,4,very helpful in placing grads in jobs
College Sophomore,4,Great teachers. Great students. Great everything.
College Sophomore,4,There are so many different types of students. There are students from all over Minnesota. Its great to see the diversity
College Sophomore,4,"As a first year student, this is a very unique school. I like the way the classes were set up and allowed me to choose how I wanted to take on the class load. It's nice and I would highly recommend it to any student going into an engineering and technological field of work."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a PSEO student attending, but from what I'm hearing, the Financial Aid and Tuition costs can be expensive, but they're rightly deserved for everything."
College Sophomore,4,"Resources are always at hand for students, whether they're at the book store or they're online, it's still as easy and accessible as ever."
College Sophomore,4,"As much fun as it is in the class, there's basically the same interaction online. Most of the class load is downloadable and useable from either my school provided laptop, my personal laptop, or my game console."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that the academics are some of the finest that people can afford and yet still get a great education. It's very nice to have a college have a 95% job placement after college, due to the job market being as bad as it is now."
College Sophomore,4,"I applaud the school for having a high success rate of students both attending to re-educate themselves and new comers. With a 95% job placement after graduation, it's no wonder why a lot of future engineers, designers, etc. decide to come here to learn. The work is quite fairly easy enough for simple tasks, but if you're not careful, the work can add up."
College Sophomore,4,"While the school may not be the biggest in the nation, it's still has some of the finest instructors students could ask for. The instructors are more of a fun and inspirational type of instructor that lecture students, but make it more interesting than you'd expect from a large study session. Along with that, the instructors can relate to student problems and can help fix and build on what they know, and maintain a good relationship with the instructor at the same time."
College Sophomore,4,I had some last minute paper work to submit to admissions and they were very helping in making sure it was all completed in time. 
College Sophomore,4,I feel very productive when I am at the school. It is a great place to learn and have the resources to help me learn. 
College Sophomore,4,I am still waiting on my computer to start taking advantage of their networking. 
College Sophomore,4,I have nothing to complain about. So far things are going well yet I just started
College Sophomore,4,I love that they are working with renewable energy such as the windmills and solar panels
College Sophomore,4,I choose this school because online and reviews said it is one of the best for electrical engineering. I am very excited to be attending. 
College Sophomore,4,I am just starting so I don't have too much to say but so far it has been going good. 
College Junior,4,"The computer network has been performing well for us. Signal is great in my classroom. It's a little spotting in the student lounge. I am so happy with the printing system: never a paper jam, great quality prints, always stocked with paper, and never weird connection issues."
College Senior,4,you just need to put in a little effort and you will make it happened.
College Senior,4,"If put in a little effort, you will get a good grade."
College Junior,4,The school is very thorough and professional with financial aid.
College Senior,4,"With tuition, you are supplied a computer, so the need for computer labs isn't an issue.  The only complaint I have with the network is the speed.  At some locations in the school, the wireless is just about worthless.  They just upgrade to fiber though, which im looking forward to!"
College Junior,2,"I believe that there is such a run around with financial aid no matter what college you attend. However, the cost of attending my college is expensive; the benefit to the cost is the hands on education received and the size of classes it is very private and well maintained."
College Senior,2,I didn't have an online class but when I went on Christmas Break my instructor made us complete the remiander of the class online and it was pretty good. I would rather be in the classroom then online because I like interacting with the instructor.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Academic Flexibility – There is little flexibility here. The curriculum is already laid out for your chosen program. There are no ""electives"" as you know them. They are also very rigid about attendance. Tardiness and absences are a quick way out the door. I can't speak from experience, but i've heard that their credits do not transfer well."
College Junior,1,"The gym recently became open 11:30 to 13:30, precisely when we are in class. The cafe is open until 13:00. The interior, especially the classrooms, are ugly."
College Junior,1,"Academics at Dunwoody are phenomenal. They are engaging, relevant and well-paced and that is why Dunwoody excels as a college. However the campus life and social scene are what brings this grade to a D. The college was built 100 years ago and as it evolved the space was divided in not so well planned ways. In other words there is no common area to find people hanging out. Student activities and groups are sparse. Most everyone comes to class and leaves after 14:30. Though with that said improvement are on their way and major renovations are scheduled to take place in the next 5 years."

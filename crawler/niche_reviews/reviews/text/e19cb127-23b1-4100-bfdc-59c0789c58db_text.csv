Freshman,5,"It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."
Freshman,5,"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
Sophomore,5,I love the architecture at Harvard and students are very resourceful and intelligent. You get the feel for an old fashion atmosphere while also experiencing the modernness.
Graduate Student,5,They established an online program to allow maximum flexibility during the pandemic! It was amazing to have the chance to attend without having to move to Boston.
Graduate Student,5,I just got in and love it! It is absolutely amazing to be able to attend this world class institution!
Alum,5,"Although I did not take online courses as an undergrad, there are a considerable number of courses now available for study."
Alum,5,Reputation and learning experience well earned and deserved.  You will not get a better college education anywhere else.
Niche User,5,Harvard has the most unique students on its campus. Students from all the world from various cultures economic backgrounds reflect their ideas experiences and perceptions that allows the whole student body to have the most engaging experience throughout their college life. It provides the students a platform to brainstorm and put their ideas onto while nurturing them into leaders and innovators and giving a structure to their ideas. It brings life to the abstract imagination of students and gives them the confidence and skill to pursue their passion and be the best among the rest. Students get an opportunity to share the hurdles and hardships of their communities and leave with a solution to their problems here at Harvard. The most illuminating alumni and a replica of passion pursuit are here at Harvard.
Graduate Student,5,Thus far it has been exceptional. Very intellectual engaging and you're surround by some of the brightest minds in the world.
Graduate Student,5,"The university has done a very good job of adapting to an online-only version of teaching, which was required during these difficult COVID-19 times."
Junior,5,Harvard really understands how online classes work. I attend real lectures where I can ask the professor questions in real time. No more waiting days for a professor to get to my email.
Junior,5,The amazing professors are really what make the university so great! They hold each student to high expectations and help them achieve them.
Niche User,5,"I completed a Summer program last year and I loved it!! The architecture was amazing and I had the pleasure of working with Harvard professors. I enjoyed the food, and the architecture of the building. I took a course in the psychology of attribution and I fell in love. The work and living dynamic at Harvard is fantastic. I was able to expand my learning and attend college seminars and workshops with college professors."
Niche User,5,However I have not personally attended an online course I hear they are wonderful. My friends and family members have attended them and have described them to be rewarding
Freshman,5,Great new programs and excellent professors. Much of a mixed student roster with people from all over the country enrolled in my online C.O.R.E Harvard Business School Classes. Online navigation is perfect and customer service are amazing.
Freshman,5,We did online conference cold call meetings with professors and industry business professionals. Doing full time this summer gof C.O.R.E Harvard Business School online and the program and experience is amazing.
Alum,5,"An amazing experience, I would 100% recommend! I studied at the Harvard Divinity School and the faculty were incredible."
Graduate Student,5,"Accepting and intellectual community of innovators, most of whom value knowledge sharing and global progress over prestige and profit."
Freshman,5,"An incredible university with some of the most brilliant, interesting, kind, passionate petiole in the world. I came in scared that this would be a cut-throat competitive nightmare but everyone lifts each other up rather than tears each other down. I absolutely love Harvard and am so grateful for all of the opportunities it affords."
Niche User,5,"very empowering experience, the summer program was very fun. We were provided with lunch and diner. The campus is very hisotrical and fantastic."
Graduate Student,5,Great University! Worldwide renowned in research and academic excellence. Great place to get inspired and learn.
Freshman,5,"Harvard is a great school, I would definitely recommend Harvard to anyone who would like to attend a secondary school."
Niche User,5,"I had the opportunity to go on a campus visit (and stayed in the dorms for a few days.) I sat in on the business class, which was a good experience because I got a sense of what it’s like to be a Harvard Student. Everyone came to class prepared and ready to learn. I got a tour of Harvard’s medical school as well. The dorms were nice but a little small, at least the ones I stayed at. The food was great and I even got to eat at the Freshman Dining Hall. The campus in general is nice and clean. It’s a good environment to be in."
Sophomore,5,"There are great professors who are clearly expert in their fields. The work is rigorous, but everything is structured so that you are continually improving."
Freshman,5,"Harvard is incredible! The campus is vibrant and there are always tourists. It is especially busy during fall because the foliage is beautiful. The professors are very knowledgeable. Most write their own textbooks, so they truly know what they are teaching. The students are also great; they are intellectual, fun, and laidback. It is a great experience studying here!"
Junior,5,"It's Harvard: it's been amazing. There are so many opportunities and so many amazing and kind people there. It truly is an experience, one I am so grateful for."
Niche User,5,I'm just girl waiting to get in my dream college but I can see it gonna be tough but I can do it.i really love this college and I think so will you
Niche User,5,Have heard and experienced amazing things. Ten out of ten recommend. All around amazing if you are looking for a very well managed all around great college consider going here.

Niche User,5,There is absolutely nothing I would change about this college. The curriculum is excellent and it has everything I would want from a college. I love the campus experience and the school itself is absolutely stunning.
Freshman,5,My time at Harvard has been life changing to say the least! I have discovered a new side of myself and have grown tremendously in all aspects of life.
Niche User,5,"In this school it was amazing, the teachers I had for a summer program where very upbeat about many things and were able to communicate with the students. It was not only them but also a lot of other people that went to school there were very nice and helpful."
Niche User,5,"Harvard University is the most amazing school in the world. If you get in, you should go. Beautiful campus, top-notch academics, Cambridge is amazing."
Niche User,5,Harvard is a really cool University and I would love to enroll there..I mean Harvard Medical School of course because I wanna be a cardiologist in future.. Harvard is the best.
Alum,5,"I loved the campus and the teachers, especially my professors. I really got a chance to connect with them while on campus! I loved their teaching methods; they really let us explore the topics we covered, by ourselves, and with our own interest. They gave us constructive criticism and we gladly grew and flourished in that environment. I would like to change one though, and that is the parking on campus. Harvard has a major parking problem, and that should really be taken a look at."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful there, everything was conveniently nearby: restaurants, beaches, malls, and of course, Boston. Student centers like the Smith Center or the Cabot Library in the Science Center are very helpful for study groups, or tutoring sessions with the reservable rooms available. Widener Library is also a very relaxing place to be in general. There was a wide range of diversity in people, personalities, experiences and expertise. Everyone is willing to help others and it is very easy to meet people. While the majority of the time the campus and the centers feel very safe, I constantly hear about incidents occurring mainly during night at certain areas close by. The professors there are very helpful, and the lessons tend to be interactive and actually enjoyable. Although the courses were extremely difficult, unlike anything I've ever experienced before, learning the information was fun although tedious."
Niche User,5,"I went to Harvard University for two weeks in the summer at a debate camp, in which we learned national-level techniques for speech and debate. They taught us how to cross-examine, how to organize and format arguments, speech exercises, and research methods. It was profoundly informative. Furthermore, the professors were highly helpful and educated and the dorms were of decent quality, despite lacking air conditioning. The campus was quite beautiful, with vast fields of greenery and trees. We went to one party on the Fourth of July with amazing food and a wonderful friend atmosphere. The local area had high-quality restaurants with interesting, modern attractions. The campus food itself was suitable, but not excellent compared to the food sold at restaurants nearby."
Niche User,5,"I had an absolutely amazing experience with Harvard University, as I spent the summer after my high school sophomore year taking an undergraduate course called Principles of Economics with three extremely notable professors - Dr. Daron Acemoglu (MIT), Dr. David Laibson (Harvard), and Dr. John A. List (UChicago). The campus is amazing, and there are are hundreds of tourists everywhere. Libraries and other campus resources are easily accessible, but it is difficult to get good vegetarian options during lunch and dinner at Annenberg Hall. Professors are very open and we had lots of excellent discussions over research they've done and books they've written, and it was the best summer of my entire life."
Junior,5,"For me, the best part of my experience at Harvard is the individuals I have met. These people whether it be professors, students or faculty are so immersed in learning and teaching others."
Alum,5,"Harvard was an incredible experience unlike any other. I instantly felt connected as a global citizen like never before, meeting some of the most intelligent and unique people I am likely to come across in my life. The institution prides itself on maintaining high standards, and one leaves its gates understanding not ""what"" to think but ""how"" to think - the most valuable skillset of all."
Graduate Student,5,I love it! I have experienced once in a life time opportunities overall it is an enjoyable experience.
Freshman,5,"The opportunities are truly endless, and the campus culture is very positive and collaborative. Professors are at the top of their fields, and student dorms/dining is great (Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, could be better though). There's a very diverse and incredibly talented student population to inspire you and most of the courses are very well-taught. I'm so grateful to be able to attend Harvard!"
Freshman,5,There are tremendous opportunities to discover your passions. Career services is a great resource to learn about job and internship opportunities
Niche User,5,I will be first generation going to college and I want to give my best and I want to go into political science and Harvard is an awesome school. The only mini problem is that there could be sometimes many diversity. I am a Latina girl looking forward to representing my community and I want to do a really good job. I want to show other immigrants that everything can be possible. Anything is possible if I keep on trying and working hard. I know that I want to make my parents proud and I would keep on working hard and giving all my ef
Freshman,5,"Harvard is a great University for the students , both international and national. It provides the best environment to study and the tools there are also so available get to research in different fields .It opens a door for the students to create something . That's why it's the best university in the world. All the new ideas come from this university which makes this world developed."
Niche User,5,"Incredible student culture as well as history.  The great thing about Ivy Leagues is that everyone had to work hard in one way or another to get in, so there are very few people slacking or truly disinterested in being there, including the teachers.  Tuition has been very hard but the more prepared your family was for college and the more scholarships you apply for, the better the experience, and that goes for any college."
Freshman,5,I love how everyone there is so friendly! It's amazing to see such a group of talented and passionate individuals.
Niche User,5,"I am an adult returning to finish my bachelor's degree. I love the school, the campus and the environment"
Freshman,5,"I just finished my first year at Harvard.  I had a rocky transition at first, but I am really loving it!  The professors and TFs I have had are all really friendly and accessible, and there is an endless list of classes that I want to take.  Conversations with peers are really thought-provoking and deep.  You can find so many great communities through different activities, and there are so many great people on campus.  Even as a freshman, I have been offered so many unique opportunities that I know come from Harvard's resources.  I never thought it could, but Harvard has really become my home this year."
Alum,5,Party scene is the best in the country! Nerds sure do know how to party! I went to a yAle part and it got notin on dis Harvard 1. So you're probably thinking about Stanford parties? They suck too. I went there for 8 years for my undergrad.
Junior,5,"Currently, I am a registered student with the Harvard Extension School through Harvard University. I appreciate how this program caters to non-traditional students who are going back to school and want a top-notch education from a premiere university."
Niche User,5,"taking a virtual tour in to the word in Harvard is just like you are there in person and i assure you that you want to be there in person ,to witness the crimson way ,experiencing diversity and cultural heritage in this A+ institution.outside this is the beautiful structures the school has from the beautiful dorms to the epic library and lovely sight of nature from the top dome .Also the part life in Harvard is dope ,the step out when it comes to partying ,sport and food.
Omg!! their football team is cold,after taking a virtual tour i went ahead watching their football game and it was legendary."
Freshman,5,I like Harvard very much because it is a great university and challenges me to learn more and stretch myself. Its academics are number one.
Junior,5,What i liked was the environment. They have great professors that can really help you learn about your major. This is a great place to be . You wont regret coming here.
Graduate Student,4,I will begin Fall 2021. However I'm very excited and looking forward to beginning my graduate studies and earning a liberal arts degree in creatives writing.  I am seeking scholarships and grants to help cover costs to attend.  Hopefully I will win this scholarship.

Sophomore,4,"Professors are very helpful and resourceful during online classes.It was a good experience, although not looking forward to paying full tuition for online class this year."
Niche User,4,It was amazing. Everyone took initiative to help one another. The professors are amazing and go above and beyond to help.
Niche User,4,With the most experienced professors in the world teaching their students ... Harvard gives its students the best possible college experience to kick-start an adventurous life. Professors always have students back and keep giving them the best a student can possibly recieve to start something new . They nurture new students to fearless pioneers. The online learning experience helps students to continue their learning no matter what and helps them to have a continuous learning voyage.
Freshman,4,"I am a pre-frosh so it's disappointing that we don't know how and where we are starting yet. I'd be even more disappointed if I were a senior.  However, I am not giving this as a grievance because they are working extremely hard trying to do the best for everyone."
Alum,4,Great experience in learning. All facilities and campus offered all that was needed to have a complete learning experience at the highest level
Sophomore,4,Great atmosphere with respectable diversity and a standard of learning and engagement that matches its name.
Junior,4,"I enjoy Harvard, there are very few places where the greatest minds in a generation can gather and truly create an open community. Harvard has a tendency to advocate for diversity, but they despise diversity of thought. The only thing the university cares about is diversity of background and ethnicity in order to appear more welcoming. I wouldn't trade my athletic and academic experience for anything, but the social aspect leaves more to be desired."
Graduate Student,4,Prestigious. Knowledgeable staff. Smart students. Beautiful campus.  Dorm is old. Buildings are old.
Graduate Student,4,I am attending Harvard for my premedical studies. The resources are great and extremely beneficial to my learning. The overall teaching is also amazing and the professors truly care about the students.
Niche User,4,I loved the general campus feel. The academics were wide and diverse providing me an outlet for creative growth.
Sophomore,4,"I had a hard time adjusting my first semester, but now I am looking forward to my next three years here. The weather is a bit terrible, but there are so many exciting things going on all the time!"
Freshman,4,"Harvard University is an elite school that will catapult most students to the top 5% of income earners (statistically speaking). However, getting a degree from Harvard is incredibly difficult with a high workload and not a great party scene. By coming to Harvard you will give up the traditional college experience when it comes to parties and sports, but you will meet some incredibly talented people and will be taught by world-renowned faculty. Trade offs."
Freshman,4,"They really give you every resource you could possibly need, from advisors to tutors. The academic environment is competitive, but not as bad as I had thought it would be. Some aspects of the school aren't fabulous, like the food in the dining hall anf the cost of living in Cambridge. Overall though, the school is amazing."
Niche User,4,"It's one of the greatest universities out there, however, it's competitive and costs a wealthy amount of money for tuition."
Senior,4,"Great professors / elite social scene. Everything else is subpar, however -- food/housing are poor, and there isn't much sense of community or school spirit."
Alum,4,"The best people in the world come together in 1 school! Great professors, great alumni, intelligent friends, tons of opportunities."
College Senior,4,Lots of bars and options. No happy hour and drinks are expensive.
College Senior,4,Very diverse by race and location. It does seem to skew towards higher income levels but that has many reasons for being so.
College Senior,4,"I haven't experienced any issues with drug or alcohol, people are really here to get to work and make the most of the time here."
College Senior,4,The opportunities and internships are top shelf. There are so many amazing people you have access to and experiences you can find.
College Senior,4,"I don't live on campus but from friends I here it is very overpriced for what you get. Overall it is livable and no big gripes other than price, great locations."
College Senior,4,The gyms and everything are pretty nice but nothing to write home about. Not as nice as I thought they'd be.
College Senior,4,"The main thing is all the relationships you create and access to opportunities you have. The extracurriculars, people, and internships I have access to are much more important than the actual classes."
College Freshman,4,A surprising number of people are varsity athletes and are world class.
College Sophomore,4,The alumni from this school gives us a framework of people we can reach out to and internships and programs we can apply to.
College Sophomore,4,I liked the lectures and sections. I especially liked the freshman seminars and expository writing class for their small class sizes.
College Sophomore,4,"I always felt safe walking around on campus, day or night. However, it is very easy for tourists to get into the dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"I felt as if the process by which freshman roommates are chosen was not effective in my case because my roommate and I had nothing in common and had many problems halfway through the year (leading us to separate rooms). The upperclassmen lottery to Leverett was stressful because there weren't enough options for blocking/rooming groups to stay together. Other than that, I liked Thayer and am excited to live in Leverett."
College Senior,4,The athletic opportunities are amazing. Just probe around and you'll find anything that suits you.
College Freshman,4,"I think that Harvard is very subtle in its adoration for sports. It has the most division I NCAA teams of any school in the country, but you'd hardly know it from the outside looking in."
College Sophomore,4,"The teams are great, fans not so much."
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is strong here at Harvard except for the social life, which is obviously a big part of the college experience. It does get better as you get older though."
College Sophomore,4,It's Harvard. Once in a lifetime experience being here.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are all different across campus, but made easy by the fact that almost everyone lives on campus and there is a very strong housing community."
College Sophomore,4,It's Harvard. An incredible experience that you can't pass up.
College Sophomore,4,the health and safety has a  significant role on the school life
College Sophomore,4,it will be very interesting experience for me to try it out
College Freshman,4,I never feel unsafe on campus. There are always police officers around and Cambridge is a pretty safe area.
College Freshman,4,"I have had a few classes that I don't love as much as I thought I would, but professors are always kind and highly available."
College Freshman,4,"I live in the Yard right now, and I really like it. It's convenient, beautiful, and pretty spacious."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of great career services but I have not used them.
College Freshman,4,"My dorm is okay, but we have a great community."
College Student,4,I play soccer for my school and I have fun with my friends through practicing soccer together.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Everyone can go to the parties, if they're interested"
College Junior,4,University officers are very upfront about issues on campus and keep everyone informed. Campus crime is relatively low but when there is an issue there are many services available to students.
College Junior,4,Housing is neat and effective. Students generally take care of their living spaces and the university keeps up with them as well.
College Senior,4,"Athletics are popular, especially the Harvard-Yale Game"
College Sophomore,4,I'm learning about relevant topics.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone has heard of this school. Everyone knows it's an Ivy League. I'm set.
College Freshman,4,Harvard Square is a safe area. HUPD are present in the yard and are just a call away. I feel very safe and frequently walk alone at night without any problems.
College Freshman,4,"Great people, awesome opportunities and resources, interesting classes, fun times. However, can be really overwhelming at times."
College Freshman,4,My Intro to Life Sciences teaching fellow changed my whole perspective on biology. I love it now.
College Freshman,4,"Wonderful place to meet intellectually driven, kind students."
College Freshman,4,"We have really good football and basketball teams. I don't know much about the other sports but most people support our sports teams. As you can imagine, not everybody at Harvard is into sports.."
College Freshman,4,"The social scene leaves something to be desired, but the academics are challenging and mostly rewarding as you would expect. The real value of Harvard lies in the professor connections and the alumni network, and if you don't take advantage of those then you might as well just go to a public university. Also, Harvard is very realistic and a non-magical place, and we all know the classes are hard so there is no need to stress about not getting a 4.0 every semester like we all did in high school- almost nobody does here. One of the greatest things that I've found is that since nobody is coming in with a group of friends, everybody is actually open to making new friends, so take advantage of the window of opportunity, incoming freshmen. The freshmen dining hall, though the food is not usually good, is one of the best things about my freshmen year so far, because I get to be in continual community with my fellow classmates and actually see my friends without having to always make plans, and I meet new freshmen almost every day and get to know them and their unique stories and dreams."
College Freshman,4,It is well-maintained and has a great atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,felipes and the taco truck are the best
College Freshman,4,We have residential houses and those are the best
Sophomore,2,Pretentious!! In one word...So glad I transferred from that school..So overrated... Phoniest people in the world...Happy to be back in Michigan..
Junior,2,"Harvard should be the best when it comes to mental health and mental health issues among students yet it is clear there is a lack of training, understanding, and community that helps students who begin to struggle while they are at the university. Without catching students early it could impact a class grade. A student can not fail a class at Harvard without major consequences. There needs to be some or more training for advisers, deans, teaching fellows and professors to watch for students who start to withdraw and are having mental health issues."
Alum,2,"The academics aren't really more difficult than your average college, but I think the high ability level of the students makes the grading harsher than your average college. I think a B at Harvard would be an A at the average college in America. 

Some of the professors are very rude and arrogant toward undergrads. I experienced that firsthand on at least four occasions (four different professors). 

The place can feel overwhelming and lonely at times, and there's no hand-holding. Also, when it comes to finding a job at graduation, you're on your own. Nobody's going to knock on your door with a job offer. Career Services exists, of course, but they aren't going to knock on your door either, and they're primarily only useful if you want to work on Wall Street. If you want any help at Harvard (job-seeking help, mental health help...any help), you have to seek it out."
College Sophomore,2,"We have some surprisingly good teams, but the majority of the student population could care less about any sports."
College Freshman,2,no one lives off campus
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid at Harvard is need-based and a complete blessing to those who get it. However, Harvard's definition of ""need"" leaves a lot to be desired because there is a lot of us who fall into the middle of the lot and are not qualified for aid but could really use it. Harvard should definitely review and revamp its financial aid program."
College Senior,2,"A single, tiny room with shared bath could cost $800-$900+. One woman was offering a tiny section of attic which could only be accessed through a bathroom- no fan or air conditioner, for $750!!! Many of the landlords my friends and I have dealt with are charlatans. They see students as cash cows and take advantage of them. I've heard many horror stories. There should be a law against what those so-called landlords do, especially considering they don't report the additional income to the IRS."
College Senior,2,"Depending on which building one lives in, it can be extremely loud from dorm neighbors and traffic and other noise from the streets. My dorm, Adams House, was not conducive to studying or sleeping most of the time. During the summer, the fans were inadequate, but we weren't allowed to have air conditioners. People would have barbeques in the courtyard and smoke blew in through our windows, which we had to close. It was stifling. I was very disappointed."
College Junior,2,There are about three small frats and three sororities on campus. Not much else to say about that...
Recent Alumnus,2,It's nice for about 2 months out of the whole school year. The rest of the time is cold.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather is not that good, and so there is less "
College Junior,2,"There's something for everyone, just don't miss hanging out with all the different cool people."
College Junior,2,"Beginning of the School Year: Too Hot
Fall: Long fall season and it's gorgeous
Winter: Annoying because it's slushy, but the wet snow makes for better snowballs.
Spring: Gorgeous

In general it rains too much. It should never rain in December!"
College Junior,2,"Sports here don't matter except for one game a year - The Game. It's the weekend we play against Yale, and literally the entire school goes. When it's at Yale the school provides buses and then entire student body (not to mention several generations of alumni) goes to New Haven for the weekend to tailgate and trash talk. When The Game is at Harvard same thing, but all the Yale students come to our campus. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather is pretty awful.  Cold, wet, rainy, cloudy.  It's only warm in the very beginning of the school year and at the very end.  If you're from the Northeast, which a lot of students are, it will be pretty normal for you.  If you're from California, I think you will be ok too, because a lot of students are also from California and seem to adjust pretty well.  Harvard has these lights that you can put in your dorm room that mimic the sunlight, for those days when the sun sets at 4 PM."
College Freshman,2,"One of the worst things about the school. Especially as a freshman, options are very limited and seldom of even decent quality. You can go to the upperclassman houses but that takes time and isn't always a viable option. Otherwise you're stuck eating in the square which is expensive and eventually boring."
College Freshman,2,"It is a small, beautiful, safe place to be. Keep your doors locked to avoid petty theft or late-night pranks. And be warned that Campus Security isn't too happy `bout drinking games, so keep your Beirut games under control."
College Senior,2,"Barely Exists – There are 3 sororities and 3 fraternities on campus. None of them have residential houses and one fraternity is the only Greek organization with property in the square. Many of the frats and sororities rent spaces in the square for meetings that barely hold all of the members. They are a good outlet for making new friends and for parties and mixers, however final clubs dominate the social scene more than frats/sororities."
College Freshman,2,"Off-Campus Is a Hassle in Which Few Students Participate – Because of the strength of on-campus housing and because of the huge expense of apartments in Cambridge, few Harvard students live off campus.  It is far more cost effective to live in the dorms, however, if a student were really intent on living in an apartment, there would likely be a large availability.  With the large amount of graduate schools in the area, a lot of people look to rent out their apartments or even just rooms to students."
College Freshman,2,"Finals Clubs – Technically, Greek life is limited to a few off-campus sororities that don't really have a presence in the social scene. However, the Finals Clubs essentially take the place of Greek life. They're pretentious, exclusive (often likened to ""good old boys' clubs""), and much-criticized by the feminist groups (they only admit men.) Of course, freshman girls are encouraged to come to parties. I know people who do go to their parties every weekend, but I'd say the majority of the Harvard community doesn't."
Junior,1,Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate online school so I don’t blame Harvard for the poor service I just don’t like it it’s a waste of money
Junior,1,"Go elsewhere if you can. The ""Harvard mystique"" -- the worry that you will always wonder ""what Harvard was like"" if you don't choose to go here -- is utter nonsense. It is nothing special, at least not in the positive sense of the word, and you will be better off at a peer institution."
College Freshman,1,Everybody drinks alcohol and gets crazy drunk on the weekends to 'unwind'.
College Sophomore,1,"Almost all Harvard undergrads live on-campus because Harvard's House system is so appealing and fosters such a great sense of community. In addition, housing in Cambridge is extremely limited and expensive."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is purely for a dedicated social organization here. They all have their own houses that maybe 6-8 people will live in every semester, but the houses are mainly for hanging out in and partying in. People don't care if you are in the Greek system or not. A lot of people kind of see it as a social system they would never want to be a part of either due to ""bro-ness,"" the idea of essentially paying to hang out with people, or because the Greek system often supports societal systems that they find personally perturbing. Some people also really like the idea of sororities and fraternities. But even with all of that no one cares what you do after you've joined. Everyone I know that's in one is happy with it, and in the end that's all anyone else cares about."
College Sophomore,1,No one knows how to drink. People think dorm parties are fun when they're actually just sweaty and awkward.
College Sophomore,1,"No Need for a Car – There is no place to park, and there are tourists and thieves everywhere.  No one lives off campus, so it's very nice to walk and not too far, plus there is a shuttle to take you where you need to go"
Recent Alumnus,1,"While almost 95% of undergraduate students chose to live in on-campus housing, the few who do venture outside the Yard are often those who wouldn't ever need to consider the cost of living in an apartment. Apartments around campus are expensive, usually pretty old, and worn out from its previous college residents. For those who find cheaper or at least reasonable housing, it's usually pretty far away from the center of campus, inconvenient, and still more costly than other colleges in the area."
College Freshman,1,It Makes No Sense to Own a Car Here – there is very limited street permit parking. dont even dream of acquiring a spot in the wintertime with all that snow. the garage is 3000/car/semester...nuts!
College Freshman,1,"As far as I know, parking is non-existent here. But why would you want a car? The T is convenient and relatively cheap. For $1.75, I can be in downtown Boston in 10 minutes."
College Junior,1,"Hard to find parking spaces.  I don't drive while at school but when my parents came to visit me, they parked in a space (that didn't seem like it required a special permit) and received a ticket after being gone for less than 20 minutes"

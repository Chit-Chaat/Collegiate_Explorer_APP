Sophomore,5,This school was the perfect fit for me. I like the small size of the school which really encourages a sense of community. The professors are excellent and really care about their students learning. The school overall really cares about the students success while attending school and preparing them for after graduation.
Sophomore,5,"This college is perfect for me, personally. It is definitely a good choice if you're looking for a smaller school and a very tight-knit community. Everybody on campus is genuinely nice, the classes are perfect sizes, the teachers really care about your success, and they have great opportunities for everyone on campus - there truly is something for everybody. Specifically for my major, social work, the university offers so many unique opportunities, like 4 internships over my 4 years, to make my education the best it could be. The only downfall is as a commuter, I do find it kind of hard to participate in clubs and organizations because the times just don't fit my schedule, but there is always the commuter council to be a part of! I definitely don't regret my decision to enroll here as I go into my sophomore year."
Sophomore,5,"WNE is such a great school. The school puts our needs first and values our opinions as students. They provide a community atmosphere, which I love, and they treat you like family. The school isn’t too big but is the just right size (in the medium). The campus is beautiful and has many resources for all its students. I highly recommend it."
Alum,5,I would 100% recommend this University to all incoming students. WNE offers many opportunities for students.
Niche User,5,Western New England is a home to a lot of students who are friendly and very active within their small community. The faculty is so nice and considerate. I feel like all colleges should follow in their example.
Sophomore,5,Love it here.  Ever since I stepped foot on campus it has felt like home.  Made my best friends here and the professors care about you and honestly try and connect with you.
Freshman,5,I love the close-knit environment that allows everyone to be so close and connected. When walking around the beautiful campus I see so many people I know and I love all the connections I have made with not only my friends but also my professors. The people and the environment are what make this school so special although the location may be poor.
Senior,5,Love it! Class sizes are perfect and great atmosphere. I am currently in my fourth year at the school and it has been exceptional. I am a psychology major and the staff have been nothing but wonderful to me. My experience is definitely enhanced by the opportunities given to me. The one thing I would note is that I have taken courses outside of the psychology department and I feel that some professors are not the kindest. It is also expensive.
Alum,5,"I loved going to school here. If I was able to pick a college for Undergrad, I would pick Western New England. The professors cared about you and how you were doing. There are so many services for new students. These resources turn into jobs for upperclassmen. The environment is a very positive place."
Freshman,5,"Western New England University has provided me the opportunity I have been waiting for my whole life. My only goal has been to study, to learn. Coming from a poor family, that was always a daunting subject. But WNE worked with me and my family to make sure I am able to attend without too much financial burden. And even so, one cannot put a price on a good education, so I am supremely grateful to be able to attend a school of this caliber."
Senior,5,"I have loved my time at Western New England University, from the professors to the campus, everything is just so welcoming. The campus itself is very beautiful, and during spring time especially so, as there are these gorgeous trees in the center of campus that bloom a lovely shade of pink, making the morning walk to class very lovely. The professors are all very helpful, with many staying late hours after class to offer their time to help students out with their work. All in all, its a great school and I love it!"
Sophomore,5,"As I walked the campus on tour as an incoming freshman I fell in love with the student life. Everyone was active and loud and enjoyed the live music from the band. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. What I loved most was that none of that changed throughout the school year. There was constant events going on that would be packed with enthusiastic people and it was always a beautiful experience. Aside from that the campus itself is beautiful, it’s not too big nor too small. I loved every detail from dining hall, library, bookstore, residence halls, and learning buildings. Western New England has so much to offer every student that walks through campus."
Sophomore,5,Love love love it here. If I could stay here for years I would. I have enjoyed every interaction that I have had give or take a few. The campus is so beautiful and I feel very safe on this campus.
Freshman,5,I visited the campus in April and fell in love and wanted to start the very next day. Admissions has been kind to me and answering all my questions through email and phone calls. They make sure their students feel safe and welcome and I can't wait to start in the fall.
Niche User,5,"I was very impressed with the tour of the campus, the credentials of the professors and the reputation of the University for Engineering.   The dinning system looked great - was very excited about the athletic complex and the integration of student athletes.   I am excited to attend this fall!"
Freshman,5,"I love this school so much. I have met so many people, I have so many resources, and all the teachers are great. Love it here!"
Senior,5,"As a graduating senior, I have nothing but positive things to say about WNE. I came from a small high school and feared being lost in the crowd when I entered college, but WNE continued to make me feel right at home. The largest class I was ever in was around 22 students, with most of my major classes having between 8 and 12. The campus is very student-run in the sense that students plan, organize, advertise, and put on the majority of events that happen throughout the week and each weekend. The Career Development Center here is also fantastic- not only have I met with them dozens of times to revise my resume, but they've helped me develop interviewing skills and helped me acquire three different internship experiences, one of which turned into a full-time job after graduation."
Freshman,5,Picking this university was one of the best decision I made because of the family I have created here and the amazing experience that I have been able to have.
Niche User,5,My mom went to this college and loved it ! She always wanted me to come here so she was super excited when I got in. I hear so many good things about their academics and sports. Also the student life on the campus is supposed to be great. From the visit I have been on I can say I adore the area and the campus.
Senior,5,Western new england University has the most professional staff and the campus is very modern. Our new Huge Dining Commons is awesome.
Sophomore,5,After my first year at Western New England University I don't feel like I'd rather be at any other school to pursue a degree in Sport Management. The staff and community provide a great environment for learning and the opportunities available to students give great practice in our fields of study.
Junior,5,Campus is beautiful and the professors are great. WNEU provides a great education for anyone of any major.
Freshman,5,Western New England is a very welcoming school. They have many different clubs that keep both resident and commuter students involved and they are making changes that will make it better.
Junior,5,"I am currently still attending school at western my experiences had being great, classroom are small, the people on campus are extremely nice willing to help out.  first time living room for school was very hard but attending school not so far from home is great."
Sophomore,5,My school try’s its best to make everyone feel wanted and apart of something bigger than just themselves. Western New England teaches their students the importance of responsibility and doesn’t cut corners when it comes to moral issues.
Sophomore,5,The academics and learning facilities are wonderful. Professors take the time and effort to care about individual students in order to ensure their success. Their science facilities are excellent and provide a safe and educational learning environment.
Graduate Student,5,I completed a 2-year online graduate program through WNEC (university).  The classes were fabulous and informative and they fit into my very busy work schedule.  I would do another online program through this university.
Freshman,5,"Overall I have had a positive experience at WNEU. They have an excellent engineering program, the classes are interesting and the professors really care.

I would like to change the tutoring sessions to make them more one-on-one and not group driven sessions."
Junior,5,"Western New England is an excellent choice if you are looking for large university opportunity with a small college atmosphere.  Classes are small and  only taught by professors with PHDs who are entirely invested in their students and will  know you by name within a few weeks. The curriculum is in depth and aimed at preparing you for real world employment, or to continue your education.  WNEU is well managed, with many opportunities to grow through clubs, activities, community involvement, and options to study abroad.    The campus is a must see, offering state of the art facilities and technology with impeccably manicured grounds and an amazingly clean campus.   The college offers many scholarships  to students who excel academically.  As a second year Junior, I am having a tremendous college experience and highly recommend you put WNEU high on your list, and please come and take a tour, as I cannot possibly tell you all this University has to offer.  Good luck in your search!"
College Sophomore,5,Professors are great and are active in your individual learning. Classrooms are clean and provide adequate materials for learning. I have not had a bad experience yet.
College Sophomore,5,Majority of students get jobs after graduating either from their internships or through contacts. Job fairs are fun and allow you to get yourself out there.
College Sophomore,5,Always see campus security everywhere and the blue light system is very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"I love it here, I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. Teachers and learning environment are excellent."
College Sophomore,5,Our Public safety is trained Massachusetts state troopers
College Student,5,I love western new England and would not want to attend any other school
College Student,5,Feel very safe on campus the public safety department does a good job
College Freshman,5,Everyone feels safe on campus just for the fact that we have public safety working hard to ensure our safety as well as staff that are at our convenience to ensure that our safety is their number one priority.
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are very understanding and they help to ensure that you understand the material and are prepared for the next quiz or exam. What I love most is how quick my professors are with responding, if I am having trouble on an assignment I can email them at the very moment and receive a response no late than an hour which is incredible! The professors really dedicate their time into the students to ensure that we are not just doing the work for the grade but understanding our work and knowing that how we did is what we are being graded on."
College Freshman,5,"Our University normally has guest speakers in relation to our careers, we normally call them ""Career Panel"" in which several guest speakers, sometimes alumnus, come to educate us about where they are in life and how they got there so that we have an idea of what steps we can take in order to get ourselves to where we want to be. We also have Career Panels where businesses come to our schools and are ready to hire qualifying students to either work as interns or work somewhere that beneficial towards their major. These are excellent events because they allow students to have a head start in life and to be job ready, while putting their major to use."
College Freshman,5,"The campus housing is great! The dorms are the same size as your bedroom back home and we have staff that come in and tidy up the bathrooms and hallways so it is always kept clean. We also have safety room checks every couple months to ensure that we do not have anything of hazard in our rooms. The social atmosphere is incredible! The RA and other staff host events to get everyone together which provides great communication for those who are either shy or afraid to make friends. Everyone in the hall respects each other, we have hall meetings that allow us to give feedback, get to know each other and pretty much hang out. Most of my friendships started from the hall meetings, the girls on my floor are very friendly and we all get along very well, and have become close friends and pretty much do everything together now. Everything in our campus housing is at a convenience, the laundry room is not too far from your floor, and if you are lucky it is right on your floor. Our classes are not far from our housing, sometimes two to five minutes but not much of a walk. The housing process was at ease, the staff made it very quick and easy to get into our dorms and to get ourselves established to our surroundings, and I am more than happy that I did not have to wait in a long line to obtain the keys for my dorm."
College Freshman,5,"As an independent student it can be quite difficult to get by in college especially when you do not really have anyone helping you but coming to this school was the best choice I have ever made. The staff, professor's and students here are so welcoming and so caring that it almost feels as if I am apart of a family. Because the campus has a small amount of students, it is easier to capture the professor's attention when in need of assistance and it is a great feeling to sit in a classroom where I know that I am not just a number, but a student with a name and purpose and the professors here help you find that purpose. This school has changed my life in ways I cannot even explain, the professors, staff and even the Dean of first year students will sit down with you and help you find ways to overcome whatever problem you are facing. My first semester was quite hectic but with the help of my professors, financial adviser and the Dean of First Year students, I stopped myself from becoming another statistic and stayed in college, worked hard and paid for the wonderful education that I continue to receive. I will be the first one in my family to graduate and it would mean the world to me if I can continue to receive this education to someday make my mother and father proud to have had such an amazing daughter."
College Sophomore,5,"Heath services are great and efficient, and I've never felt like I was in harms way here."
College Freshman,5,The school security is the best thing out here. The campus police take care of us as their own sons and daughters.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love the campus housings.. well taken care of and the people around are super friendly.
College Freshman,5,The Health Center includes very helpful employees for any health problems you have.
College Freshman,5,I am very happy with the decision I made with coming here! The courses and class sizes are what i had hoped for.
College Freshman,5,Everything about it is great. Most of the professors are kind and willing to help along with other students.
College Sophomore,5,"Great! They're excellent. They always have someone on call (I once broke my foot at like 2 am and someone was there to answer my call). They give free STD and birth control tests, condoms, checkups--they have everything you need. Seriously."
College Sophomore,5,"Great options, especially in the honors program, amazing professors who truly care about your success and are always willing to talk to you and offer help if you need it. Class sizes are always small; the biggest I've had was around 30 and that course was a requirement for both NSci and Psych"
College Sophomore,5,"I'm participating in the Sophomore Career Connections program, where you can shadow an alumni in your field. It's great experience. They're also always showing potential jobs and offering outlets to find work, and the career center is very helpful."
College Freshman,5,"The one thing that makes my school unique is how everyone is very close-knit and involved. People seem to always want to help others succeed and the professors are also very nice. Friendships are easy to form, there is a lot of free speech, and people are always learning something new everyday. There is also a wide range of clubs and activities to get involved with, and they all promote something different and inspire people to be better people and to really think outside of their comfort zones if they want to."
College Sophomore,5,I got lucky. Freshman year i found a great group of friends in my dorm that has similar interests in what they did for fun. Namely they weren't regular partiers. CAB host events every weekend that are either fun or so lame that they are easy to make fun of. there are also a few chances every semester to get off campus for events or helping the sourounding community.
Recent Alumnus,5,Loved all the housing options especially senior housing
College Sophomore,5,Love this campus it is a true gem in the heart of the city of Springfield the birthplace of basketball it's such a beautiful campus with great scenery and beautiful in the fall I could have picked a better campus to go to the good Denick teaching is great and really hands-on small classes teachers know you want to first name basis very high tech equipment in all classrooms  all buildings are relatively new the college of business is outstanding along with the engineering in pharmaceutical science in psychology and law
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the atmosphere and the amount of time that professors here put into helping the students understand what is being taught.  I also love the friendliness and family like environment that the campus provides for students.
College Sophomore,5,"I love WNEU! They really takes care of their students (especially if you get good grades). The classes are the best. I'm in the honors program, which, besides the first class you take in the program, usually caps out around 10-12 students. Other classes have a max of 25, usually less. The faculty really care about you, and will do anything they can to help you get where you need to be. I was actually able to do research as a freshman psychology major; where else could that happen? It's a great school and everyone there really does care about the school and students. They are there for you no matter what, and it's a really friendly environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Immediately when I walked on campus I felt a sense of comfort, a feeling that stuck with me throughout my freshman year. Something that I always hear people say is that everyone at my school is so polite and friendly, and I agree completely. During my first semester, I was given multiple peer mentors who's jobs were to make there to make sure that I was on the right track in my classes, and were always a text or phone call away if I had any questions. I also felt that bond and security with my professors, who as a whole made it a point to show that they truly cared about my education. One of the best decisions that I made going into the year was to join the field hockey team. I was welcomed right in, and those girls are now some of my closest friends. Playing a sport is incredibly time consuming in and out of our regular season, but it helped me to manage my time and made me feel so much more comfortable with my school. My freshman year was an incredible one, made possible by the community at WNE."
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus is a great atmosphere to make friends and be independent and housing is rather spacious and clean as well as friendly all around to be in.
College Freshman,5,"Off-Campus dining is awesome! There are so many options and they vary a lot. The prices also vary often too; some are more expensive than others, but there are always good options to choose from. The food is great and it is plentiful around campus."
College Freshman,5,"There are so many options just down the road, including both chain restaurants (Ruby Tuesdays, Olive Garden) that cost a bit more as well as local places like pizza places, frozen yogurt, etc. Domino's (I think) gives student discounts, and you can use your points on them."
Freshman,4,"I am very satisfied with my overall experience so far at WNE. I love the small campus and New England vibes, from the changing trees, to the brick buildings and pathways."
Freshman,4,I prefer to learn in person. I have 2 hybrid classes and the professors use their recourses very well to communicate and teach the students.
Senior,4,Professors were flexible when classes had to go online during the pandemic and were committed to helping students succeed. The online applications that were used worked well and were efficient.
Senior,4,The professors are very caring and are willing to listen to students insights and adjust to what the class needs. The campus is beautiful and the people are friendly. There are many events and activities put on for the students and the food is pretty good but needs some more variety. Small class sizes and not many lectures are a plus. Professors are willing to email frequently and laundry as well as printing is free. Parking is allowed for first year students as well.
Freshman,4,"I find the courses and labs to be challenging.  I enjoy most of my teachers, specifically those related to my engineering degree.  The dorms are fine, lots of opportunity to network and meet people.  Dining hall has variety but food offerings need to be rotated.  Campus is great - there's a gym, pool, fields for ultimate frisbee.  If you have a car, you can get to Boston, NY, CT and NH within an hour or two."
Alum,4,I liked how small classroom sizes so that professors had me time with their students for help. One thing I would like to see changed would be the courses with more up to date coding languages.
Alum,4,"I liked it because everything was straightforward. The professors were experienced in managing an online course. Also, it felt as if I was still inside a classroom"
Sophomore,4,"Given the circumstances, most of my professors took initiative and reshaped the course around student's ability, convenience and fairness. I actually loved going online. Of coarse there are somethings that are better taught in person, but given the circumstances, it was very good quality."
Sophomore,4,"Overall it's a really good school. The value of your time and money depends on your major, though. The science and medical curriculum is top notch, but business, the teachers don't seem to care and just throw assignments together. My experience as a science major has been overall very interesting, challenging, and rewarding. There are just some general university requirements that I think need some improvement."
Junior,4,"Western New England University is a place that truly has my heart. I have grown so much in my time at this institution and I am beyond grateful for it. Not only are the academics unparalleled, but the experiences you are able to get from WNE are far greater than simply in the classroom. With strong emphasis put on involvement, students are able to enhance the skills they practice in class like communication, inclusivity and pursue what they are passionate about outside of a textbook education."
Junior,4,"This campus looks beautiful, the dorms are very old and need some life to them. While living in Gateway I felt it was dull and depressing. But for the education it was great. The professors are great and very helpful when you need them to be."
Junior,4,"Western New England University has an incredibly serene atmosphere, which provides a suitable environment if you wish to study outside or inside. There will always be a place for students to focus on their work while also enjoying the college experience."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Western New England University is the atmosphere that is in the school and how it has a very personable feel. Since the campus is so small, you truly get to know many different kinds of people that you wouldn't get to know at a bigger school."
Freshman,4,The thing I enjoy the most about Western New England University is the way people react towards other people. The way the make you feel welcomed and how friendly the students and staff are. Although everyone has flaws they make you feel like it's you against the world and that you have a chance in the world. I do wish western new england supplied more help though and let you know when you need help or are struggling with something and offer help
Sophomore,4,"I love the school and the campus is amazing including the staff and professors. I go there for neurology and ever since I went their, my interest for neurology has being growing by the days. And with that being said, it could only mean one thing to me, this college is perfect for me."
Senior,4,It is a home away from home. The dorms are nice and so is the campus. The sports teams are good and it makes the campus a lot more fun and lively.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Western New England for my first year of college was all I could ask for. The environment was welcoming after the tough stages of moving away from my family. What I would like to see change is one of the halls to be renovated.
Freshman,4,WNEU is a great school and campus. It has a very small campus with small class sizes. the food is great with very many  options. There is police on campus at all times. The down side to the school is that there is specific options for majors. Also the schools dont have very big stages or auditoriums.
Freshman,4,"Western New England is a smaller campus, however it still provides you with the opportunity to meet and interact with many new people. If you’re ready for college life, but aren’t too sure about attending a huge university with 20,0000 students this is the university for you."
Freshman,4,The professors are awesome and its a pretty small campus so all the buildings are close to each other. The dining hall is brand and gorgeous. I only wish the food was a little higher quality.
Niche User,4,Western New England seems to be an amazing college. The student body is pretty diverse and there are people for everyone and anyone to hang out with. The school feels like a community that would be safe and fun to learn with some interesting places nearby.
Senior,4,"It's a great college for sciences with many professors who care about your learning, life and general pursuits. There's not too much for student recreation around the college, though."
Graduate Student,4,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous, especially in the fall. The people are very friendly and professors are kind and always willing to assist with any issues. Campus is very well-kept and groomed."
Junior,4,"My experience here at western new england university has been great these past three years. they are all so willing to help and be proactive and help you get out there and be apart of something and let your voices be heard. as well as receiving a great education, the professors here are truly incredible and form great bonds with each and everyone one of their students it definitely makes you feel better from being away from home, and that you can too also call this home."
Sophomore,4,I like how all classes are taught by professors and not student teachers.  They fully understand the field and are always willing to help if extra explanations are needed.  I would change housing pricing and/or the ability to not have meal plans in certain dorms.
Graduate Student,4,"Generally, I love Western New England. I think it is a fantastic school where I have met great people and have so far received a great education. I've noticed over the past two years that with more students there is less parking which is becoming a bit of an issue with public safety and tickets. The new dining hall is an awesome place to go and even hang out, although the food is still the same not great dining hall food."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great university, with great opportunities. They have great professors who provide one on one help if needed."
Junior,4,"The school is pretty small compared to other schools such as UMASS. The professors are nice and very helpful. the class sizes are small, thirty students or less. Not the biggest party school, people would rather hang out and do an activity than drink and do drugs."
Graduate Student,4,"The faculty was very supportive, coursework was challenging and useful, as opposed to just being busy  work to keep the student's grades up. The campus is beautiful, despite being in Springfield."
Freshman,4,I have had a great first semester at Western New England University. I have developed close relationships with my professors and boss. They have all been extremely helpful. You never have to be afraid to ask for help at Western New England. I live in Commonwealth hall which is the best freshman dorm. You get your own private bathrooms. The people I live with have become like family to me.
Niche User,4,I liked hoe every professor was willing to explain why they teach and how much impact they want to give. Also i liked how every building was set up in a unique way.
Alum,4,"Western New England University is a small school with a lot of support programs and a lot of opportunities to be active on campus.  There is a great gym, great dorms, and most the educational buildings are relatively new and nice inside. (Beware Emerson!)
I have found almost all the professors I have had were great at their jobs and because they don't do a lot of research they are available to help you constantly.  This school is where I learned to become a great student and then turn around and help others.  If you put in the effort, WNEU gives you the opportunities to reach for the stars and I am extremely grateful for what it has meant for me."
Freshman,4,Very inviting and family-like atmosphere. Great choice for those who prefer to have a more personal experience with their advisors. Excellent engineering programs and tools available.
Freshman,4,I love it here! I transferred in this semester and I am having a blast. Everyone here is very welcoming and friendly. It is a very home-like environment that makes you not want to leave. I have already made lifelong friends and I can't wait for the years to come.
Niche User,4,"Western New England is set on a beautiful campus that offers something for everyone. The facility is very clean and safe. Also, the staff is very friendly and you will be known by them."
Freshman,4,"The environment is comfortable, it's a small school so everyone knows each other. The professors are really helpful and they are always willing to help. One thing that could be improved is the food because it gets repetitive after a while. "
Niche User,4,I've visited this school. I loved it! It was a beautiful campus and it had all of my majors that I was looking for. 
College Sophomore,4,The large network of alumni will be helpful in my future.
College Sophomore,4,All the teachers I have had were very nice and cared about how you did.
College Sophomore,4,The campus police do a great of keeping us feeling safe.
College Sophomore,4,The close-knit aspect of the university makes your time there like your second family.
College Sophomore,4,Alumni come into our building almost every day with spirit
College Sophomore,4,I play for the varsity football team and the coaches are great.
College Sophomore,4,I love my school. I can get help anytime I want.
College Sophomore,4,The athletic facilities are high quality - the gym equipment is great.
College Sophomore,4,"Academically - awesome. The neuroscience program is great.

Socially - not so awesome. But it's only my freshman year, so  maybe I just met some of the wrong people."
College Student,4,I have a great potential of getting job upon graduation.
College Student,4,Western New England has a decent variety of housing options that improve as you move through your years.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Western New England is a big part of campus life. Everyone supports each other and it's a wonderful feeling to know that our athletes are out there doing the best they can and we are here to cheer them on. Whether it is a win or loss, we are always there and that just shows how supportive not only the students are but the staff as well."
College Freshman,4,"Academics are really what you make of them. Certain courses are worth more and can be more challenging than others. Professors also range in how good they are and how well they teach. The registration process is pretty easy, as your advisor usually makes your schedule/confirms it for you when you're a freshman."
College Freshman,4,I feel that I will receive a lot of help when I am ready to find a job.
College Freshman,4,The housing is mostly clean and great to live in!
College Freshman,4,The school deals with it appropriately
College Freshman,4,The professors really work one on one with the students but really push for team work and when other team members don't pull their weight professors don't intervene
College Freshman,4,"the suites are awesome, rest of the housing is typical."
College Freshman,4,"engineering program is rigorous, campus is beautiful but can be restricting with certain library lab hours and cafeteria hours"
College Sophomore,4,"Registration is easy, the workload is manageable, there are so many options to do research, internships, etc. and the professors are amazing!"
College Sophomore,4,"It's a very athletic-oriented school. There's tons of school spirit/support for sports teams, but it's not only a ""sports school."" There's a lot more to offer."
College Freshman,4,Everything is cleaned each morning and tidied up from classes the previous day. I feel like everything is maintained and kept well.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of opportunities for students to become apart of things such as internships, one must jump on the opportunity fairly quickly though."
Niche User,2,"I really appreciated the professors here who offered to help at every opportunity they had if they saw you were struggling. However, the worst thing about this school is the students. Those who go here are clicky and 'outsiders', to put it nicely."
Junior,2,"The atmosphere on campus feels more like high school than college. Unless you're in engineering, business, or pharmacy, you're not going to get any internships. You're better off saving your money and going to a state school."
Sophomore,2,"Western New England ruined my college experience I transferred here last year and had high expectations because of the tour guides and the staff talking highly about this school. But they are liars they talk about how much help you get here and how they're like one of the best schools for all students which are not even close. 1st. The school is no where near diverse and the clubs they have for minority students you have to pay to be in the club like I'm not paying enough for tuition for school. 2nd. the staff doesn't care as they may seem when you get there, you ask for help and they rarely give it. and when you go get help from the tutors they look the answers up online like I couldn't have done that on my own. the students are rude here unless you're an athlete or somehow in the crowd or know people from high school other than that your much of a loner in this school."
College Sophomore,2,It's there if you look for it.
College Freshman,2,"The students at this school are not very welcoming. If you don't make friends your first week here it's almost impossible to meet anyone. Plus, there is virtually no party life here. So if you're looking to go to a party at all at WNE, you'd better be in some sort of sport otherwise you will have nowhere to go. There are some dorm parties,  but they're pretty rare and RA's are pretty on edge about that stuff. This school was my top choice but I continue to be disappointed as the year drags on. It is what you make it, but my advice to you, if you're not the best at being social and you are not involved in sports, would be to really try to make friends your first week. Otherwise you will feel trapped on this campus where nothing ever happens."
College Junior,2,The school is very fake. They try and make it seem like everyone is the best of friends with everyone else and that's false
College Sophomore,2,Not many places and their all run down
College Sophomore,2,No food for people who dont eat meat
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of fast food restaurants. Nothing is special or has a lot of healthy choices.
College Freshman,2,"Springfield is a city, therefore it can be dangerous like any other city. Just watch out where you go and go with a group of friends."
College Freshman,2,"There are not a lot of dorm parties, and when there are they usually get shut down. The off campus parties always havethe same scene and get old very quick."
College Junior,2,"I don't feel safe walking off campus, I will drive to go to the store but I would not walk off campus by myself in the middle of the day never mind at night."
College Sophomore,2,"Outside our university is literally considered as ""the hood"" and we rarely go off campus. There are seven or eight other colleges and universities along our same road and each of them is nice within the boundaries of that school.... But we don't interact much because to go back and forth between campuses is actually dangerous."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you do not have a car the only options available are taxis, friends, or the bus. It can be very taxing.  Long-distance wise, there is the Peter Pan Bus Terminal as well as an Amtrak station so for the long commute there are options although they are a bit costly."
College Junior,2,"Limited parking especially for commuters, i would reccommend getting here early as possible for a decent park"
College Freshman,2,"I see people drinking frequently. I do not, but it's obvious when others are."
College Freshman,2,"I haven't had any interaction with campus authorities, but from what I have heard many people dislike them."
College Freshman,2,Not much to do unless you have a car.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of diversity. Mainly Caucasians.
College Senior,2,When it rains there's puddles all over campus but when it's sunny campus is great. 
College Senior,2,"Hours are terrible, meal plans are expensive and the food isn't that great and not a lot of variety. "
College Freshman,2,Parking for freshman is a far walk from the dorms and parking permits are expensive.
College Junior,2,People are really snobby and not very attractive.
College Junior,2,The parties suck and they all get busted by 2 AM.
College Freshman,2,this school isn't to different from other schools. it is really small and information travels around fast. the school isn't in the best neighborhood so its not good to go out and walk around to far. there's also a low guy to girl ratio at the school.
College Senior,2,"Springfield is a relatively big city. It is not the nicest or safest city, but it has it's perks. Most students enjoy Patty's and Peppa's pizza right across the street. There is also a park called Forest Park about 7 minutes from school which has a zoo and nice place to run or relax. There are a few bars downtown that are popular for the surrounding colleges. My friends and I also took part in visiting all the animal shelters that are around the school. Six Flags and the Big E are also short distances."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know very much about off-campus housing what I do know is that its kind of hard to get apartments around campus, they are expensive too because the rentals are usually houses and you have to count on paying utilities and driving to school everyday."
College Junior,2,"The drug scene at WNE is not that big. You always have your occasional students everywhere who do drugs regardless, so that's a given. Drinking on the other hand happens more often, but the kids tend to hide it well."
College Sophomore,2,"There's really not a whole lot to do in the part of Springfield campus is in. Your best bet is to travel to Holyoke or downtown Springfield. It is not a college town in any way, shape, or form. Which is odd considering Springfield college and American International College aren't too far away."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have been a high honor student my entire educational life as a student.  I received PSI CHI in Psychology, Mortar Board, and Scholar Athlete yet only in my major ( Educaation) only a few advance and are able to complete this program.
I had to change majors even though I graduated with High Honors?

We have a lot of scheduled weekend campus activities for the students."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus living is not very elegant for the first couple of years, unless you spring for the expensive freshman/sophomore living. After that the quality of housing goes up significantly living in town houses and leaving that normal dorm feel."
College Freshman,2,"It's a small campus so no on-campus bus/shuttle is available. You need to take a taxi, local bus or car to get to the bus station for any long-distance travel outside Springfield, MA."
College Senior,2,The campus police are on the look out for ppl being stupid. if you want to do bad things do them privately and have fun.
College Junior,2,"Transportation right on campus is not great. There is a public bus stop at the welcome center on Wilbraham rd but the schedule is a little infrequent. That said i have taken the bus downtown, about 15 minutes away, were we have a Perter pan bus terminal and an Amtrak Train Station. In Hartford Ct about 45 minutes away, we have an airport. There are a few taxi companies around."
College Freshman,2,You always hear about things happening in Springfield and how dangerous it is but I haven't had any major incidents while off campus.
College Freshman,2,"There is some diversity, but not anything substantial"
College Sophomore,2,"Dorm Life – The parking situation is horrid for freshman students, but it gets better from year to year."
College Sophomore,2,Have a Car. The best way to get around the area is to have your own car. But parking is guaranteed and included for all 4 years.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Every student is allowed to bring a car for free, but you are only able to park in the designated area for your housing. If you park anywhere else you will get a ticket. There usually are not very many spots available to park."
College Senior,2,They Are Moderately Strict – youre going to get in trouble if you get caught but usually first couple offences arent to serious but after that you can get kicked out of housing. also depends on situation
Junior,1,"The campus itself is okay. The students and professors aren’t bad either. However, the faculty, most notably those who work in the student administrators’ office aren’t the most friendly to diverse individuals."
Freshman,1,Western New England is an awful school filled with awful people. I am so glad to have transferred out of this school where Peer Advisors are allowed to bully students they advise. WNE lies about having events on weekends but there is absolutely nothing to do on weekends except party. The academics are average and so are the professors. So glad to have left this pitiful university.
Sophomore,1,Worst decision I’ve ever made going here. If you want a true college experience I wouldn’t recommend going here. It’s feels like high school still and isn’t diverse at all. I was an athlete here and it was a terrible experience & I wanted to transfer after the first semester. The academic facilities look decades behind other colleges & the city of Springfield itself is less than to be desired. The dorms have mold and had students evacuated in the fall. It’s just depressing here and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Party scene is pretty poor because it’s a super small school so you’ll see the same boring kids every weekend. The professors are very good however. The Only bright side about this school honestly.
Senior,1,"Im a single african american 34 year old woman with 2 children. I have attended WNEU for 4 year. I have been treated unfair by staff. I have recieved very little support.

College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,"There are spring days and winter nights, its horrible."
College Freshman,1,There is no differentiation amongst different ethnic groups at this school.
College Sophomore,1,If you don't have a car your stuck on the small campus
College Senior,1,spots fill up really quick past 8am and the permits are expensive 
College Junior,1,The wind in the winter is killer and it rains a lot
College Junior,1,I'm a vegetarian and they put bacon in EVERYTHING!
College Junior,1,The school leaves you to figure it out yourself
College Freshman,1,the parking is whack and doesn't make any sense. People park far from where they live like La Rive and commonwealth park behind freshmen dorms and freshmen park behind the gym? hows that make sense when there is parking by commonwealth for students? 
College Freshman,1,we don't have greek life on campus. they should consider it though lots of potential students are upset that we don't
College Freshman,1,"there aren't really any places to eat off campus that are close enough walking distance, and the only places really to eat out to are chain restaurants like Olive Garden or Apple Bees and you need to take a cab to reach them. other than that you have average Chinese places which are pretty decent."
College Sophomore,1,"I wish public transportation here was good but it does suck. There aren't any buses after a certain time, they do not pass at a good schedule. Cabs are highly unreliable and very expensive. The closest airport is about an hour away. I would say having a car is your best bet to getting to know the area."

Senior,5,I really enjoyed the way my professors put me first and made themselves available. They truly wanted me to succeed and were very encouraging every step of the way.
Senior,5,"All of our work was submitted through Canvas. At first it’s a bit confusing, but it just takes some getting used to. Our professors provided us with useful videos to navigate our online dashboard. If we ever had any questions or concerns they made themselves available through calls, emails, and zoom calls."
Sophomore,5,"Point Loma is paradise on earth. The campus is beautiful, the professors genuinely care about you, and the people are welcoming. I thought I wouldn't like attending a school with a small campus, but it turned out that it was just what I needed. Classes are extremely personal. You also get to meet a lot of people though! Precisely because it's small, you build deep and intimate connections with those around you. You also get to form tight knit relationships with your professors and their associates. This helps for any form of networking. Additionally, we have a variety of amazing local stores and events. San Diego is a beautiful area to live in, providing you with everything from famous taco stands to mainstream concerts. The education in itself is amazing. Statistically, PLNU has one of the best nursing programs in the country. The standard income rate after graduating is very high also. Overall, I recommend this school to anyone who wants to end with a good career/college experience."
Junior,5,"Point Loma has provided me with some of the most incredible peers and professors I could have ever asked for. The campus itself creates an incredibly welcoming sense of community, which made it easy for me to adjust to college freshman year. Coming into college, I wasn't sure what it would look like for me to take the next educational step and I was nervous to see how I would adjust. Freshman year was nothing short of amazing. Sure, I stumbled upon some challenges here and there, but who doesn't. Loma opened my eyes and forced me out of the bubble I had been hiding in all of high school. Through new friendships and amazing church communities, I was able to find my place at PLNU and finally found a home away from home."
Junior,5,"I haven't had a whole lot of experience with online schooling through Point Loma. This past semester, in the midst of COVID, I was studying abroad in Italy. Upon returning home early to the states, we continued our Italian courses online through our program in Italy, so I was never enrolled in Loma's online courses. I have friends who finished off the school year online, though, and they all seemed to enjoy it. Although online schooling is definitely not the same as in-person lectures, the professors all seemed to be extremely diligent about reaching out and checking up on their students."
Junior,5,"Second semester of this past year, I took part in online learning due to COVID-19. The school did an excellent job at providing resources and opportunities for online success for all students. They provided a lot of grace and individual help if it was needed. The school was more worries about student health, mentally and physically during such an unforeseen time, over turning every assignment in on time. Professors did an excellent job at helping their students and taking into account every individuals personal struggles, all while helping them achieve academically. I am grateful for the school's efforts during such a hard time."
Senior,5,"Good:
1. Location-I’d say this is the best located school in the country. You can literally take a 5 minute walk and be on the beach or drive 10 minutes and be in a major city.
2. Faculty/Student Bonds-You will get the most helpful and caring professors and will have super engaging classrooms.
3. Campus Life-Very good programs to keep students having fun. You can go on camping adventures, ministry missions to Mexico, and volunteer in the community all apart of a fun group. 

Bad:
1. The Loma Bubble-It often feels like a high school here. Not too many students so things like dating and friend groups often get very clique-y. 
2. Outdated- although they are improving, many of the dorms and buildings are pretty old and borderline gross. They still are functional but very lacking compared to other schools. 
3. Health- The cafeteria is pretty bad on weekends and dinner time, the gym is a closet, and mental health is often disregarded because of lack of resources."
Niche User,5,My experience in visiting Point Loma University was great because the lunch room is like a buffet and the campuses are not too far from each other.
Niche User,5,"I visited Point Loma last Spring and I was super impressed with the campus. Situated right next to the ocean, PLNU would be a great place to get your education."
Senior,5,One of the best schools I have ever been to. The learning environment has helped me grow into a better individual. The money spent at this college is well worth it for the type of education you get. The classes are based around conceptual thinking which helps each student obtain amazing skills to take with them along the way into the world.
Freshman,5,"Love this school!! Great programs. Very organized, looks at whole person rather than just grades. Really strong psychology, nursing, and education programs. Love the people. Most are authentic and truly invested in connecting with you. There is definitely partying but social relationships are not centered around alcohol as is the case for some other schools."
Sophomore,5,"Point Loma Nazarene University gives students the type of college experience that everyone dreams about. It is the perfect small University. The professors give each student their absolute best and constantly  work to help student succeed. It is truly the kind of college one attends to better themselves in each area of their life. The community at PLNU is unmatched; everyone who goes to this school is friendly, caring, and has a unique drive to succeed in their studies. Once you are apart of this community, you will always have access to a strong network in whatever you do. Point Loma Nazarene University is the one of the top universities in the nation and  has been an excellent fit for me."
Sophomore,5,"Point Loma Nazarene University is an amazing school!  Highlights are the location (amazing ocean view), and excellent academics.  The people though, are the very best part, and it's a wonderfully social place.  One downside is that the cafeteria food is not particularly good."
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed the community I have found at PLNU. The students, faculty, and staff are all incredible and create an amazing atmosphere. The academics are challenging, but enriching and eye-opening. The PLNU campus provides an incredible opportunity for students to really get to know others while also getting to discover who they are as an individual."
Senior,5,"Good
+The small class sizes (all my teacher know me by name and are always there to help)

+The student body resources (campus ministries, study abroad, intramurals, dorm events)

+Location (you are in arguably the most beautiful campus ever where you are never more than a 5-15 minute walk from the beach, also San Diego)

+Religion (3 bible classes in the curriculum, chapel offered 4 days a week, prayer chapel, church right next to campus, professors that pray for classes)

Bad
-Gym/Sports Teams (Our homecoming soccer and basketball games are fun but apart from that it is a ghost town even though the team are typically decent, also the rec center is SMALL, like in A CLOSET which makes it hard to stay healthy without having an outside gym membership)

-Cafeteria (it can be pretty gross at dinner time and weekends when professors and paid staff aren’t there to complain about the quality)

-Dorms (The dorms are literal military barracks, they are livable, but very small and outdated."
Junior,5,"I love Point Loma Nazarene because of the small student to faculty ratio in my classes. I am able to really get to know my professors and feel truly invested by them. There are a lot of social justice clubs and organizations on campus that a lot of students are involved in as well. The campus sits on sunset cliffs in San Diego, so my walks to class are always breath taking. Overall, my experience at PLNU has been incredible and I feel very thankful to attend this University."
Alum,5,"Overall, I thought my experience at Point Loma Nazarene positive. Although I was a transfer, I assimilated into the community well and made the most out of my time there. The professors take the time to get to know the students, and it makes it more personable than just being another student on campus. The connections I made at this school helped me get work immediately upon graduation, which is the whole point of going to college."
Junior,5,Point Loma is amazing. You can see the beach from basically wherever you are on campus! It's beautiful and the people are the most authentic and genuine people I have ever met.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful Campus, Good culture. Lively, Ocean views to clear your mind and refresh your moral compass."
Niche User,5,I still haven't join into that school but I went to preview day and everyone is so nice to you and very helpful its also a really safe environment.
Freshman,5,"I knew from the moment that I stepped onto the campus that Point Loma Nazarene University would be the perfect school for me. From the first day of my first semester to now I have felt nothing but love from my professors, faculty, and new friends. I am a strong Christian so being at a school whose main focus is to foster a relationship with God while providing the best education possible could not be more perfect. Before almost every class my professor will pray for the whole class; these prayers are not just broad and generic, but deep and intentional prayers for the wellbeing of all of us. Along with come the everlasting relationships that you will make with friends. Here at Point Loma Nazarene University it is hard to find someone who doesn't truly care about you and want the best for you both literally and spiritually. It is because of these factors, that I would rate my experience so far at Point Loma Nazarene University as excellent."
Sophomore,5,"Although a man of faith, Point Loma was never my first pick when it came to colleges. I came here on a whim because my mom suggested it. Ironically, I never could have imagined the impact this school and community would eventually have on me. The professors are superb; giving me more attention and care than most of my high school teachers did. The community is like nothing I have ever seen. It is as if someone decided to sprinkle classes in at a christian summer camp. The spirit flows tangibly through the students and staff of this school. May God bless this place for years to come."
Senior,5,"PLNU has been one of the best experiences that I've ever had, I have found some incredible friends and some great mentors here. The people here will encourage you, and help you along with any path you are taking. The education here is pretty good and quite broad. Also the views we get around sunset here are something else."
Junior,5,"Amazing campus, but more importantly amazing professors and classes. Having small enough classrooms to interact with professors and develop relationships is so valuable."
Sophomore,5,The people there are so incredible! I made great friends so quickly! The professors are extremely competent and truly care about you. I still get coffee with one of my first professors every once and a while.
Sophomore,5,"This school is fantastic! The Christian community is something special that creates a welcoming, loving atosmophere unlike any other college. The faculty and staff pour everything they can into their students and go above and beyond in brilliant and heartwarming ways! Also, I have a disability, and the disability resource center is wonderful. The support and love I have felt at this school has truly changed my life and I am beyond grateful for PLNU!"
Alum,5,"Choosing Point Loma Nazarene University for my undergraduate studies was the best decision Ive made! Wonderful professors, great student-teacher ratios, and the location is PERFECT"
Junior,5,PLNU  is a great school. The teachers are great and they care for the students. We are literally next to the beach. The campus is beautiful!
Niche User,5,"I went to visit Point Loma as a sophomore in high school. The campus was very beautiful, and it had a great beach view. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Each building had a unique feel to it. The had lots of great programs, and many majors."
Junior,5,"I have never been to a school that so clearly cares for its students. Success counselors, administrators, directors and staff are all very easy to get a hold of. Each truly does care foe each students well being, success and program navigation to graduation."
Freshman,5,I LOVE Point Loma. Every time I have visited everyone is so welcoming. I feel at home already. The campus can not be beat. It is GORGEOUS! I can not wait to begin school there.
Graduate Student,5,"The program was great and the professors were very kind and caring. I wish they were a little more organized, but they are very invested in their students"
Freshman,5,"The teachers are extremely invested in their students and always willing to help. The campus is beautiful.  The classes are challenging but doable and are preparing me for my future.  The people generally nice, which is always good."
Junior,5,"The best decision I have ever made about my education. The professors are wonderful, the students are God loving and full of life, the administration staff are the best you can ever think of. I like Point Loma because it has a Christian environment and it gives me a sense of security. All of the people I know who went to Point Loma have nothing but all the best things to say about Point Loma, this played a major role in making my decision to joining the collage."
Senior,5,Point Loma is great because of the people that surround the university. The attention to the students as individuals put forth by the professors allows them to intentionally develop as intellectuals and independents. It was not long for me at Point Loma to notice that the staff and faculty were very invested in helping their students become sustaining and good people.
Junior,5,"The staff is wonderful! They are knowledgeable and have practical experience in their respective fields. They are a real pleasure to learn from! While there is a religious studies requirement, nobody judges those who have different beliefs."
Sophomore,5,"Point Loma is a really great school for anyone that wants to advance in their education and personal growth. It's beautiful, and offers a sense of community that I've never felt anywhere else.
I would definitely change the cafeteria food and add more dining options, but otherwise the school is wonderful."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming Freshman, the only thing that worries me is the fact that I'm not worried at all. As soon as I stepped on Campus I knew that I was meant to be there... without a doubt. I've never visited a college that felt so welcoming and warm as I looked around at everyone's smiling faces. It is incredible,"
Niche User,5,"Point Loma Nazarene has such an amazing community bond. The students are great, professors are helpful."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at PLNU has been a blessing in disguise. A choice in life that I will never regret. At the moment of self awarness when I needed it most, PLNU has given me discernment in learning and sustaining a wholistic approach to life, which coincides with my purpose in this life. I recommend every individual to experience this beautiful notion of spiritual, mental, and physical growth."
College Senior,5,This is one of the safest places to be in San Diego. I have never experienced any fear or worries.
College Senior,5,"This school has a vast array of opportunities for potential career opportunities and networking. PLNU is held in very high esteem not only in San Diego, CA but all across the nation. Many former students have been able to locate employment immediately or internships. The alumni network and ability to network with faculty is fantastic. Often times, professors will actually have the career center/services folks come in to class and go over networking, resumes, cover letters, and learning about our gifts and strong abilities. Receiving a degree from PLNU is one of the best degrees a student can attain."
College Senior,5,"I have been very pleased with my current time at Point Loma Nazarene University. The first thing I noticed is how friendly, welcoming, and encouraging the professors and faculty are. I have never encountered a teaching staff that cared so deeply about the success of their students. The professors are also incredibly educated and are complete experts in their fields; I feel very safe putting my education in their hands. I didn't attend PLNU for my undergraduate studies, however I have encountered students who did attend PLNU for their undergraduate. I can honestly say that I've never met more educated and professional young men and women. I am incredibly impressed at their knowledge base and their ability to apply it. Also, Point Loma is beautiful. The campus is right on the beach, you can see the ocean, and it is one of the most well-maintained campuses I have ever seen."
College Senior,5,"The campus is overall safe, however they need to ampt up there security in the campus entrance. They let anybody come in, really."
College Sophomore,5,"Every professor that I have experienced has made an amazing amount of effort to help their students succeed. All of them have given worth-while lectures, I have learned a lot, and they have given us multiple study tools."
College Sophomore,5,My resident life experience has been great so far. My first year living in a dorm felt like a constant sleepover with my best friends. Point Loma does a great job of fostering a community within halls and dorms.
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at Point Loma has been nothing short of excellent. Of course, my first year was a hard adjustment to make, but I cannot imagine having to adjust to living away from home without family, childhood friends, and my church, without the love, help, support, and energy from my friends and classmates at Point Loma. From professors who have done everything they can to help me succeed to friends who have adventured all over San Diego with me to Upper Class-men who have met with me to talk about my spiritual growth, I have experienced an abundant amount of social, spiritual growth. I am so excited to go back and be involved in ASB and Student Ministries while studying and finding a job in San Diego!"
College Sophomore,5,I love this school. The only thing I would change would be the quality of food and housing.
College Sophomore,5,No instances of violence or drug/rape culture.
College Junior,5,Finding a job after college through PLNU is just awesome because of the pure fact that they provide so many reasources and oppurtunites for people to find what they are looking for after college.
College Junior,5,"Being at PLNU has been a dream, when the time comes for graduation i'll be so upset when it's all over. its been an amazing experience that i have learned so much from."
College Junior,5,health and safety on campus are outstanding.
College Junior,5,Greek life is a great way to make new friends and engage with other students that you wouldn't normally be able to meet.
College Junior,5,They are  very postiive and entertaining for both the athletes themselves but also students that aren't athletes as well.
College Junior,5,"So far PLNU has created an atmosphere that inspires me and shows me that I will succeed without fail. They provide the tools and resources for success to tbe in the future of the student, they provide guidance and help in order for each student to achieve the goals they are trying to reach ."
College Sophomore,5,"The academic advisors and offices of student vocation really care about their students success. Internships and careers are what they help out with the most. I am not into that part of my educational journey yet, but I am not worried about that because I know that they will take great care of me."
College Sophomore,5,This is all around the best school for me. The professors and the students are what make this campus so great. Everyone genuinely cares about each other and it is such a welcoming environment. The campus activities are great and so is the spiritual life. It is so awesome to be at a school where I can focus on my studies and have a great time on campus too. A lot of people love Loma so much that they stay on campus over the summer because going home is too boring.
College Sophomore,5,"There is never a problem with safety on campus, I feel completely safe. A lot of the students and I leave our laptops on the table and do not have to worry about theft."
College Sophomore,5,"Social atmosphere, convenience, and ease all are different depending on what dorm you pick. Getting an ocean room view tops it all though!"
College Sophomore,5,"This school is the perfect fit for me. I am able to be in an environment where I am not only able to learn and grow in my faith, but also in my studies. The professors truly care about my performance, and will push me in my academics, while making sure I succeed. I love being at my school, it is truly an amazing place and an amazing atmosphere."
Freshman,4,Staff is very helpful and it is easy to reach out to anyone. Their online structure is convenient and easy to use.
Freshman,4,Overall great school with very helpful staff. The campus is beautiful. Their online  resources are some of the best I have seen.
Sophomore,4,"I did not take any classes online, so I am very limited to what I have to say about it. I've heard from other classmates though, that PLNU's online education experience is very good."
Junior,4,The academic rigor at PLNU is no joke and they provide high quality and challenging material to ensure that their students are equipped to reach their full potential.  The campus is unbelievably gorgeous and the PLNU community is so welcoming.  The only downside is the VERY strict rules and guidelines of behavior that are meticulously ordered and watched.
Junior,4,Online learning at this school has been challenging due to the quick transition into full time online school due to COVID-19.  The classes that were already online were amazing and still challenging even though most people see online classes as the easy way out of a required unit.
Junior,4,"I think Point Loma offers fantastic academics, with amazing professors and access to endless resources that prepare all students for success. It is a great community of people, but I would definitely like to see a change in accessibility to all prospective students. There is minimal diversity in the student body, and I think there definitely needs to be a change in how the University advertises their school, and how accessible they are making it for people of all backgrounds (financially, racially, religiously, ethnically, etc.) to be able to attend. I also think their approach to inclusivity needs to change as well. Although it is a religious school, leaving stigma around same-sex marriage, and other ""political"" topics, I think the school needs to be making more of an outward effort to include and support the LGBTQI+ community on campus and the community, as well as more outward support to the Black community and POC community, especially since it is a Christian environment."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed attending PLNU for the atmosphere and revered biology program. I had amazing opportunities in research, and got to see the beautiful ocean on my way to lab or classes every day."
Junior,4,"PLNU is a great place to be and I am very lucky to attend school here. The professors are incredible, my classes have never been more than 40 people, and I am currently in a class with 2 people so the individualized attention you get is awesome. The academics are challenging and professors will do a lot to help you succeed, even if that means cooking you a meal at their home and just helping you with homework. The food, however, is awful for what we pay and the dorms are full of mold. Even as a Christian, I disagree with chapel attendance being forced, alcohol being illegal as a student no matter how old you are or if you are drinking off campus or not, and professors do sometimes unfairly pick favorites. I also don't feel super safe on campus because our public safety is a joke. It is also a super small school so everyone knows everyone which gets annoying quickly."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at Point Loma has been good. It was really hard making friends first semester, but by the time second semester came around, I began to branch out a little more. I am more on the introverted side, but as soon as I realized that I don't want to be lonely, I forced myself to come out of my shell and experience what Point Loma had to offer. The campus is beautiful and the people are so nice and kind. School is challenging, especially some of the GE's, but you eventually get through it. I am super excited for what this next year/years hold for me. I hope to find my passion and continue to grow as a person and in my faith."
Alum,4,"The administration, teachers, and students at PLNU are a very supportive community. You could not ask for a more encouraging and beautiful setting to succeed during such a stressful experience as being an undergrad. The school is literally a retreat from real life what with the sunset views out your classrooms and dorms, the palm trees and waves crashing a few feet away, and the serene attitude most people embody. The school is extremely centered around religion, so be ready for church three times a week. (And don’t think you can get away with studying your chemistry flash-cards for the upcoming test in the back pew… tried that and was immediately called out.)"
Junior,4,"Point Loma to start is located in a BEAUTIFUL location, right on Sunset Cliffs. It has great students, who like to be well rounded, but can be stereotypical to have the perfect life. The dorms can be updated but are acceptable, lacking resources of a bigger university including waitlisting and parking. Great staff and I love that I can get close to my professors and go to office hours often because its good to always get the help. Good school, good environment, just needs some upgrades, including dining and transportation."
Freshman,4,"Point Loma Nazarene University is extremely beautiful; it is enjoyable to be on campus. The students and staff are friendly and kind. The food is delicious and fresh. The vibe on campus is very relaxed. The beach is close, so the ocean is visible and calming. The dorms are very nice, however small."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed the classes and being able to see the ocean from some of the classrooms. The teachers really care about the students and are willing to offer help when it is asked for.
Sophomore,4,Point Loma is a great place to get a higher education. I appreciate the knowledgeable professors who truly care for my well being.
Graduate Student,4,Great location for main campus with several satellite branches to choose from!  The staff is great when it came to the application process and getting you ready for your first day of class.
Alum,4,"I loved the location, small class rooms, caring professors and Christian environment. An amazing university."
Junior,4,"I feel very safe and it has been a great experience. The staff really values you, and the cafeteria food is great."
Alum,4,"PLNU had kind, caring professors and small class sizes which made it easier to connect with professors and get the most out of your academic experience.  They are still connected to the Nazarene church, which means that they aren't progressive on issues like acceptance of LGBTQ students, which is an issue, thankfully, many students are pressing the administration on.  It's a beautiful campus, and San Diego is a perfect location."
Sophomore,4,"PLNU is a great school with a beautiful view. The classes are small and personal, and the teachers have great connections to help you get a job after you graduate. Unfortunately, the food isn’t great and the cost is a lot."
Junior,4,"The learning environment is great. Teachers push to get the best out of you! There is not much diversity, but the people are very nice. Classroom sizes are small so learning is more personalized."
Junior,4,"Great community and lots to do. Everyone knows everyone, so it can seem a bit like high school, but it offers a great community for Christian students."
Sophomore,4,"Point Loma Nazarene University is a beautiful school, not only for its beach side location but also for the faculty and staff we have here. I have an amazing time learning from our professors because of there high energies and passion for their fields. PLNU is a place to grow; become the best version of yourself that you can possibly be; and live a life closer to God. I enjoy the academic curriculum, the students here, and how helpful the faculty and staff members are. It's not only a University, it's my home."
Freshman,4,"The professors are amazing (especially if you're a science major/apart of the pre-health community). I have no doubt this school will be the reason I get into Med School. The science professors are overqualified (my freshman bio prof went to Harvard, Chem is a MIT grad, etc.). The religion is overdone and annoying. Mandatory chapel sucks but there's ways around it. The views are amazing, an ocean view freshman dorm is the best. Its almost all white kids (2 girls: 1 guy). The caf sucks (grill is good), but they're redoing the caf this year so we'll see. If you're a girl the student life is at SDSU. If you're a guy its tough but can be done. If you have friends at state you'll be good. If you look hard enough here you'll be surprised. The beach is really fun. You can find things to do, but freshman year isn't super fun/wasn't this year for multiple reasons unique to 2016/2017. 2017/2018 and the future is shaping up better."
Junior,4,Point Loma is a very nice school with Greta people. Not only does it have amazing people who care extremely about you it also has awesome professors who only want the best for you and push you mind to reach your full potential. School has a very nice campus that is very safe.
Sophomore,4,I really liked Point Loma Nazarene University because the professors actually do want to help you succeed and many of the departments have a graduation plan for undergrad students. Some professors event take the time to guide students to take the classes that are right for them. The students are also very helpful and friendly as well. Most of the students already living on campus try to help freshmen students feel at home and provide a welcoming environment for incoming students who feel nervous about starting their college experience.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my time here at Point Loma Nazarene University. One thing that I liked, in particular, was the fact that it is such a small school. My high school graduating class was thirteen students! The transition to Point Loma was as smooth as can be, considering my previous experiences. One thing I would like to see, here at Point Loma, is a more diverse campus. The university ann student body are both taking strides to bring that to fruition. Hopefully within the next few years, this campus will flourish into a thriving and diversified university."
Sophomore,4,"Point Loma Nazarene offers a wonderful environment and balance. The environment thrives through worthy academics and quality, caring professors to the personal environment fostered through Bible Studies and chapel to the literal constant view of the ocean. They encourage extracurriculars, service, and challenge you in school."
Senior,4,"Point Loma Nazarene University is an incredibly friendly place where everyone treats you like family. The Christian environment definitely helps attract friendly people who want to get to know you, and the small school environment provides much more hands on time with your professors, giving you the necessary skills to succeed. "
College Senior,4,THey are very helpful when it comes to finding job/volunteer opportunities. They offer resume help as well.
College Senior,4,Most of the professors are outstanding and demanding.
College Senior,4,The housing experience is great. There are amazing people and RA's that are sweet and helpful. My roommate situation has been great the last year. no serious problems.
College Senior,4,The school has an amazing nursing program. Most of the professors are very knowledgeable toward their specific field and are always willing to help students. Point Loma consists of very energetic people who are smart and eager to learn. THe only downside is their lack of diversity. The school has a fantastic beach view and makes you proud to attend a school with beautiful features.
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt like I was at risk of sexual assault or other violent acts.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is welcoming and friendly if you are a white Christian student. There has been some incidences of discrimination and hate on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"We have a lot of on-campus opportunities, but you'll have to put yourself out there if you're looking for more."
College Sophomore,4,"No school is perfect, but you cannot beat the environment, people, and some professors here. 

It's also in wonderful San Diego.

""Point Loma Bubble"" is a little true."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Point Loma. It has amazing people, a beautiful campus, and great support. The professors really care about both their subject and students."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletes at school are incredible. There is not a lot of activity in the stands, but homecoming is the biggest event. That is when the whole school shows up for the homecoming basketball game."
College Senior,4,"Most of the students are pretty calm. There is security driving around constantly. If there are any threats at, or surrounding the school, they do a good job of communicating this to the students through text and email. They also make it a point to let us know when there is no longer a threat."
College Freshman,4,Some of the dorms could use an upgrade but the experience was so worth it and I made a lot of close friends thanks to living on campus.
College Freshman,4,"The courses and professors are top-notch, they are difficult but you now you're getting a great education for the money you're spending. The professors are understandable and focus on teaching the students how to learn effectively instead of just memorizing what they're teaching. The professors also make themselves very available to help students outside of class time and want to get to know the students. The small class sizes make it easy to learn and interact with the professors. Since it is a small school there aren't a ton of classes offered but they have what students need for each degree program."
College Freshman,4,The school makes accessing professionals in your degree field fairly easy as well as making sure students know about internship opportunities. There are many events hosted for each degree program where alumni come and talk about their experiences and we are able to network. Point Loma graduates are well equipped to enter their field of work and employers in the community seem to like hiring point loma students
College Freshman,4,"Hendricks is an awesome dorm to stay in as a freshman because it is close to the cliffs and the ocean and it is also in walking distance of the classrooms. The rooms are an average size for a dorm room and can be pretty spacious depending on how you organize it. The social atmosphere is great, the RA's really make a point of having hall events or just nights were everyone can hangout and get to know each other so by the end of the year the people you live by are some of your best friends."
College Sophomore,4,OSV always has internship and job career opportunities. I get emails all of the time.
College Senior,4,It is really safe compared to other schools. We are in a nice neighborhood and have public safety constantly patrolling and there are various cameras hidden throughout campus. One of the biggest problems is theft of small objects which most can be prevented by actually keeping an eye on your stuff. The other was bikes being stolen but as far as i am aware they have significantly decreased.
College Senior,4,"Network 9 events are great to meet professionals who are there to help alumni find jobs and internships. OSV works hard to help those who come into the office for help. They are an amazing source and will help you find an internship. Many camps facilities, churches, and such come onto campus quite often to talk about various positions that are available."
College Senior,4,Quality comes down to if you actually pay attention to what the professors say. They have a lot of insight and are willing to work with you. Classes are pretty small which is great cause the teacher tends to know your name and how you are doing in the class. Each professor has a different style of teaching and once you find which one works best you can easily find that professor in other courses.
College Senior,4,It is a very small campus which allows you to get to know your professors on a more personal level and many will go out of their way to help you succeed and even find work.
College Freshman,4,The career service wants you to succeed
College Freshman,4,"There aren't many sports teams, however, the fans always go and support the athletes."
College Freshman,4,Point Loma is an overall great school because the professors are decent and the view is amazing.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are good, but they are overlooked and not many attend the games."
College Freshman,4,Professors really care about you and the small class sizes are a great way to get your thoughts out there.
Recent Alumnus,4,Almost all the courses are taught at a high caliber where you always feel like you are learning something useful!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus crime is fairly low, mostly just car break ins. Security is good, you can call campus security to walk you to your car if you feel unsafe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The housing is always clean and well kept. There is enough space, and all housing is close to class."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My favorite experience is by far the professors dedication to the students and their learning. The school is unique in how accessible professors are both in and out of the classroom. I would choose this school all over again because of these reasons, and because of how beautiful the campus is. Not to mention the location to the beach and the city."
College Sophomore,4,"Now this is where Point Loma shines. We have a good alumni network, and most people with a degree in the job areas (Nursing,Education) will have a job in less than 6 months. Business majors will do well if they have internships. The rest, I can't say. Career center is good for prep on how to get a job/ proper ettiequte. Not so much on giving actual jobs."
College Sophomore,4,"For the actual school; it's fantastic! I love my teachers and I definitely feel academically challenged and ready for my field. However, the parking, food, transportation, and stuff to do (other than the beach) can definitely use some work. Don't come here if you are looking for school spirit; there really isn't any."
College Freshman,4,I love the housing here very open and close to the beach!
Alum,2,We took classes online during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was obvious the professors were struggling to switch their material to an online platform.
Junior,2,"This is a good school when it comes to academics and experiencing ethical standards with teachers and campus life. Definitely doesn't have a college feel. There is no recreational gym, it is a couple weights here and there; the cafeteria food absolutely sucks and the living places are old and grimey and need to be updated. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"There isn't a huge amount of school spirit, and the sports programs leave a lot to be envied. Their club rugby program is outstanding, however and I wish I had more of an opportunity to participate. If you are interested in playing sports at PLNU, I'd suggest looking at club sports as they have more variety."
College Senior,2,"The athletics are not that great. Only some people actually pay attention to PLNU sports. THe facilities are nice, however there are not alot of sports on campus."
College Senior,2,"I was so excited to attend PLNU, and at the beginning the experience was wonderful. I am an older student and this is not my first time attending a university, but the school does a great job of making you feel welcome on campus, whether you are a transfer, like me, or  a brand new college student. They make sure someone is there every step of your check in process and have the clubs and societies out to help you feel welcome. That's about where all of the goodness ends, except for the beautiful ocean view of course. 

Beyond that, the administration is terrible. My academic advisor had no idea how to read my transcript or help me choose the classes I need. The problem with that is some of major classes are only offered every other year and the schedule of classes that they have posted is from three years ago. The schedule has just changed so I basically have to guess when the classes are going to happen. When my academic advisor told me he did not know how to read my transcript, he phoned do to the records office to have someone help me. I went down there and she basically told me I needed to talk to my academic advisor. I was in shock because he had literally just called her on the phone and I walked do there to see her because he did not know what to do. She did not help me solve and issues and was very condescending. 

The co-chair of the music department told me I should drop out of school because I was overwhelmed. I was taking ten classes, playing two instruments, and lived far from school. They want you to take 18 units per semester and that is a lot because the classes in my major are usually only one or two units. The other co-chair is extremely rude as well. He will constantly interrupt you and not listen to what you have to say. I admit that these teachers are very well versed in the areas that they are teaching, but they have no idea how to deal with people. They seem very inexperienced about life and people of other cultures."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many people go watch, but I have some friends that participate. I wish we had a larger gym and had more open hours for the athletes."
College Freshman,2,I've gotten bed bugs twice in one year. Enough said.
College Sophomore,2,"Guys, just because they write ""No drugs"" does not mean that people don't do drugs. They just go underground, and are less willing to seek help because they will get into a lot of trouble. Lots of kids drink and smoke weed, and Adderall is in demand during finals. This school can be extremely hypocritical."
College Sophomore,2,"There are only a few sports, and almost no one attends games, with the exception to homecoming (mainly cause there are few goodies). There are okay facilities for the athletes; the rest of us get 7 treadmills and a mat on the side of the gym. Invest in a gym membership if you like working out."
College Freshman,2,There are few people that attend the games regularily. Not very popular all around.
College Junior,2,Being  a private school and Nazarene the school is very strict. It is a dry campus. There is required chapel attendences and many chances to obtain silly fines at the school.
College Freshman,2,its really strict. Part of me wonders if they are hired to babysit us...
College Freshman,2,"It sucks knowing that you owe money to someone. But Loma has been really understanding of certain financial needs. It could have gone smoother, but that might just be because I don't understand a lot of things."
College Freshman,2,"The party scene, so far at least, has been very hidden. You know that kids do it, but they all leave campus and go to SDSU or another school. They don't happen on campus unless it's at a bonfire or something."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of a party scene at PLNU, honestly. To get to the party scene, most people just go to SDSU (which is only about 10 minutes away) and go to some frat/house parties there. All on-campus parties at PLNU are immediately shut down by Public Safety officials and are not allowed. Period."
College Freshman,2,I currently am actually unaware of any Greeks here at PLNU
College Freshman,2,Point Loma is a private christian college so the party scene is nonexistent. However SDSU is right around the corner.
College Sophomore,2,"Just started so I'm not sure how good it is. Still have to find the right crowd, and find the groups that go out. 

Most kids just go back to the dorms. 

Like I said before the party scene here is hush hush so you have to dig, or know the right people. 

There should be more beach/cliff parties!! 

Parties should go later-most have only been a couple hours long-kinda a bummer!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"PLNU is not very diverse ethnically. There are some black, Hispanic and Asian students at PLNU, but most of the students are white. Almost everyone on campus is a Christian."
College Junior,2,It's hard to figure out the scholarship process and you should go to a counselor to help because this school is so expensive.
College Junior,2,They have more rules than my parents do. The rooms are small and the buildings are old. They need to update the dorms and be more relaxed.
College Sophomore,2,"Public safety gives out tickets super quickly, and parking is not easy to find."
College Freshman,2,"I do not really believe that there is a Greek Life on campus. If there is, it is very secret."
College Freshman,2,"The parking is very scarce because the campus is on an eroding cliff. When there are special events on campus, then parking is a nightmare for the typical student, but Public Safety does a good job with event parking and closing off spaces. Parking is distinguished by colored spaces. Many people get ticketed and get mad about it, but the rules are pretty clear. Temporary permits are free, but all residents are required to have permits."
College Freshman,2,"People don't do nightlife at Point Loma. For any sort of nightlife that involves more than Netflix and food, get off campus. ASB does some fun night events like dances and game nights, but anything related to alcohol, clubbing, and partying is found at SDSU or Downtown."
College Freshman,2,"Forget going anywhere off-campus without a car unless you're willing to take triple the amount of time to get there. Off-campus shuttles are free but only run on weekends and on the hour; plus, they don't wait for people and you can't reach them on either number provided to call them."
College Sophomore,2,Don't have a nightlife -- too consumed with nursing.
College Freshman,2,"80% population are white, economic backgrounds are all over the board. Most people are Nazarene background or Christian. Some differences in Sexual orientation, and political beliefs."
College Junior,2,The shuttle drivers are unreliable and irresponsible.
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone is a white, Christian student."
College Student,2,Point Loma is a very strict campus. Students must sign a living agreement upon admission that states they will not drink or do any drugs during their time enrolled at school. Even if they are 21 or off-campus the rules still apply. It is a dry-campus and the rule is strongly enforced. Suspicious students may have their rooms searched. 
College Sophomore,2,"This school is very expensive.  I had to take out a lot of money in loans to be able to afford it.  I got some aid from submitting my FAFSFA, but not enough.  Also, going in as a Freshman my grade point average was over the required GPA to receive an academic scholarship. However my ACT score was one point below the required score and the school would not work with me at all."
College Sophomore,2,"As a student living on campus, you are given the choice of a few different meal plan options.  There are about four different options of combinations of meals and flex dollars you can choose from. Flex dollars are used at the ""PBC,"" the school's better option of food.  They can also be used at ""bobby B's,"" our school's coffee shop that is pretty good quality. Finally, flex dollars can also be used at the Re store which is where quick, on the go snacks and drinks are sold, almost like the inside of a gas station.  Now, meals are used in the cafeteria this is where it is bad. The food is not high quality at all for the amount of money we pay."
College Sophomore,2,"Don't go here if you want to have a social life. Everything is so strict.  Can't visit other sex in your dorm.  When you can, you must keep the doors open, lights on, and not supposed to be on each other beds...most RAs don't care but still.  You are not allowed to drink even if you are 21."
College Freshman,2,"On campus there is no nightlife that includes parties or clubs, but not far from campus there are various bars and clubs that are popular.  "
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of the campus population is white, female and local. There are diversity clubs though."
College Senior,2,Loma is 85% white rich people. It's the cost and the locals attending that drive that.  There is very little diversity on campus. It would be greatly appreciated and great for the community if there was more diversity.
College Senior,2,PARKING SUCKS if you are a commuter. It's a struggle every morning. But a huge up-side is that it's completely free.
College Freshman,2,Facilities suck and nobody goes to sporting events
College Junior,2,This school does not allow drinking.
Niche User,1,"The location is the best asset of this school. This institution is oppressive and corrupt. Some of the teachers are really kind, good people, but others are very closed-minded and judgmental. I felt like I had to hide my true identity at this school because of their strict rules. I have also seen this institution ruin my friends' whole future plans. My best friend my freshman year was accepted into the nursing school, but the school accidentally over-accepted nursing majors. Because of their mistake, they made the nursing students re-apply, and if they didn't make the first cut, then they would have to pay for an extra year of school. My friend, among many others, did not make the cut for the first group of students, which forces her to pay for an extra year of school (over $40k). They never mentioned this possibility when she was first accepted into the nursing program.

I am so upset that this institution has received any money from my family and I. I would not recommend PLNU."
Niche User,1,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I hate learning online, and the Point Loma system is disorganized. Also, some majors barely have any work while others are sitting on their laptops from morning until night."
Alum,1,"Only thing you find here is white basic air head people that live in a ""Christian"" bubble. Honestly these people, students and administration alike, are so carried away with that stupid view and their basic image, that gets old real fast, instead of striving to become a legitimate university. This school does not even have a multicultural center for crying out loud! The place that this miserable institution has allotted for MOSIAC clubs is the  transfer center! This serves to show that the administration has zero interest in making the the few diverse students they have feel more at home. It's not like they're busy it's a minuscule campus. They are just choosing to ignore their non-white and non-white-washed students because its easier. If there existed a grade lower than an F then it would first go to PLNU for diversity. They need more culture to get into their air heads that asians do not just eat panda express and make paper cranes."
Sophomore,1,"Academically, this school is excellent. The classes are small and professors are incredible.  The location is unreal, especially for ocean/nature lovers.  Unfortunately, I can’t speak highly of any other aspects. The cafeteria food is disgusting. Students have found pieces of metal and plastic in their food. I have food allergies and got sick from cross contamination due to improper following of health standards. The heaters in my dorm room do not work and there are ants. The school is extremely strict and it often feels like we are being babysat.  Students are extremely cliquey and can be pretentious. Many kids are extremely sheltered, and it shows. For a school that prides itself in adhering to Christ-like values, the administration cares far too much about money. This school is not worth the hefty price tag, and I cannot wait to transfer when this semester is over."
Sophomore,1,"The school controls students like they are in elementary school. No freedom, doesn't feel like a college campus at all. They need to loosen up on the STRICT rules and allow some more fun"
Recent Alumnus,1,"PLNU's ""Public Safety"" consists of several unarmed security guards, and a number of student workers who either do foot patrols, man the kiosk at the front gate, or drive a vehicle patrol around campus. Students and adults have next to no training, no weapons, and no real legal authority. This isn't to bash on the adult staff officers; many of them have LE/corrections backgrounds and support getting armed and PC830.7 limited peace officer status as do the quasi-Police Departments at other private schools, such as USD and USC. Point Loma is a fairly safe environment, but that doesn't mean it is a good idea to rely on untrained students with no legal authority to ""police"" a large campus in an area rife with transients. I work for a local agency and we have responded to calls for batteries, 5150s, public drunkenness, etc on the local public transportation network and I could only imagine how unprepared a student Public Safety worker would be for anything other than a fellow student without a proper parking pass."
College Senior,1,We don't really have a greek life.
College Junior,1,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek life and I wish that we did. We kind of miss out on that because we are in a Christian school. I think it would be good and the housing would help the housing availability on campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no Greek life on campus. No mention of it aside from the fact that they don't have it. Something about it breeding a party environment.
College Sophomore,1,"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT TO PARTY. Pretty much everything party related is banned here (hell, dancing was banned until 6 years ago!) Also, I don't think that not having a safety plan if you get drunk is a good thing. It just means trouble is going to happen if you do."
College Sophomore,1,"White, religious, sheltered, FEMALE, republican. I think this is the school helicopter parents would send their daughters to so they don't drop out of school pregnant. Jokes on them, a lot of students get married, and then pregnant. Before they graduate."
College Sophomore,1,"I can't call 911 due to poor cell service. In case you didn't know, that is a VERY BAD THING! Response rate of public safety can be better.

A Homeless guy nearly broke into my dorm, and managed to hop the fence. When I talked to someone about it, apparently this is a common occurrence. BRING PEPPER SPRAY."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life for some reason. The last sorority we had was disbanded over ten years ago.
College Freshman,1,Don't choose PLNU if you're looking for parties...
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life. Takes away from expected college experience
College Freshman,1,No party scene on campus. Any off-campus party scene must also be hidden from school.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are not any fraternities or sororities at PLNU.
College Junior,1,No Greek life at my school.
Recent Alumnus,1,There isn't really greek life on campus.  If you want to be immersed in greek life I would consider another school.
College Freshman,1,"There are not many student who partake in this lifestyle, but when they do it is out of sight from everyone else. You kind of have to do some digging if you want to get in on it."
College Freshman,1,There is no night life on campus. You have to go off campus; transportation is not provided.
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife on campus. You have to go off campus.
College Freshman,1,"We do not have a Greek life. It is nonexistent, which is fine with me."
College Sophomore,1,Super expensive and such a hassle to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,Our school doesn't allow parties.
College Sophomore,1,"I only rated this low because it is a very strict school.  However, I do not see anything shocking about this because we signed a document when we were accepted basically acknowledging that PLNU would be strict.  I do not see it as a bad thing because it makes our campus safe.  We don't have to worry about getting harrassed by people under the influence.  We attend a Christian private University and therefore are held to a higher standard.  They are strict on such things like noise violations and alcohol and drugs because we are nestled right in the middle of a residential area where there are families with children."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a Greek life.  PLNU is a faith based University that has zero tolerance for parties and drinking.
College Junior,1,There are only rich white kids here.
College Junior,1,Our school is dead at night and on the weekends. Ghost town.
College Freshman,1,Our school is a dry campus.
College Freshman,1,"I know people say you knew what you were getting into, but hey. I'm here because I was recruited and the scholarships were good. The campus is super strict with drug/alcohol use and not lenient at all. It depends on your RD though, one of them is great and will actually talk with you before running to PubSafety. Suspicious students will randomly have their rooms searched though, and some have even been kicked off campus for violations of the Alcohol policy."
College Freshman,1,If you like to drink and have a good time.. dont come
College Senior,1,We have no greek life.
College Freshman,1,Point Loma is a very expensive neighborhood to live in. You're better off moving farther away from Point Loma or living on campus all four years. Not many pros except for freedom and no rules. Cons are parking and being on time to class. Parking is extremely limited. Commuters fight for spots against on campus residents. Its inexpensive to live near San Diego State. Not bery convenient unless you live with your parents and they live in Point Loma.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is practically non-existent. There is a lot for commuters but even they have to fight each other every morning for spaces, and for people who live on campus just hope commuters dont take you space."
College Freshman,1,There is hardly any public transportation up here. It is kind of a bubble. Either you take the off campus shuttle which can take hours or you go with a friend.
College Freshman,1,The campus is very small so there are not very many parking spots
College Junior,1,Parking at my school is adequate. There is enough parking for all students but you must get here early otherwise most of the parking lots are full by noon.
College Junior,1,My school is considered to be very strict. We have very few open dorm hours except for upper class dorms. Our rules on drug and alcohol use on campus are very strict. Anyone caught with alcohol must take alcohol classes if it is their first time and their parents are called.

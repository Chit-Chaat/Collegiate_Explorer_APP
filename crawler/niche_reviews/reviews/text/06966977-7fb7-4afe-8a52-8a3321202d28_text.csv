Junior,5,"I believe the University has been successful with both online and on-campus studies. They take the health of the student seriously by quarantining entire campus housing when there's a spike, random testing for students, and also separating students apart and having disinfectants around. It makes me feel they are doing the best they can and I feel safe."
Sophomore,5,"The college is very big and good for students who want to achieve well academically. I also liked the standard and quality of education. The classes and subjects have a very high standard and prepares you for real world jobs. I am a Finance major and this semester, I am taking business capstone classes which are really great and have taught me very well. The teachers also do their very best to help the students learn well and get good grades. The teaching assistants are also very knowledgeable in the subject area and tend to help everyone in a skillful manner."
Freshman,5,So far my experience at the University of Connecticut has been pretty good. I don't know much about what is happening on campus because I am taking all my classes online this semester but the classes that I am taking so far are good and the professors are nice and helpful.
Freshman,5,I have been taking classes online and so far it has been pretty good. The classes that I am taking are interesting and the professors are understanding and willing to help if you have any questions.
Freshman,5,The online experience is great. I have the ability to pick my classes on Zoom with my advisor with great internet access . I have my books online and they have sent my student I.D in a preferred amount of time.
Freshman,5,"My experience with University of Connecticut is being altered by the coronavirus pandemic . However , from what I have seen online and costing the school, the campus is very beautiful. As well as the professors being well educated in their profession it causes me great honor to know I have a school with great academics."
Junior,5,"I love Uconn! They have helped me in so many different ways and has helped shaped me into the person I am today. The education is phenomenal, students have a voice and the campus is beautiful!"
Sophomore,5,"I love UConn. There's always things to do even though it's in the middle of nowhere, so many dining hall and Union food options and so many great classes and clubs to sign up for."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at UConn! I really loved the beautiful campus- especially during the fall and spring. Walking to class was never boring. The education is very top notch- classes are very challenging and rewarding if you do well. There's a lot of activities and things to do on campus, whether it be joining a club or walking on horsebarn hill. The only thing I wish was better is the housing and dorms. They are very old and have have low standards compared to some other schools."
Alum,5,"I had to take some classes online due to the pandemic, and the professors in my school were very nice and understanding. I didn't mind the transition from in person to online at all. Most professors at UConn (especially in upper level, smaller classes) do care about their students."
Freshman,5,"My experience as an SSS freshman has been great! I would have loved to been on campus, just like everyone else I assume, but my online experience was worthwhile. Attending classes and meetings was much more manageable than I thought. I feel prepared for my classes this fall, and I’m looking forward to a great freshman experience. Only a small percentage of students are a part of the SSS program, so I hope students who are enrolled in the program find this review well!"
Freshman,5,So far i have taken all of my classes  online which is personally not a problem for me because i am able to still have a connection with the teachers and the learning has not changed.
Freshman,5,Personally uconn goes out of their way to help others. UConn Paid tuition to the students with house holds with the income of 50k and less which includes me and which gave me the oppertunity to attend this school. Since i am a first genration american i was given the oppertunity to attend the SSS program which allows first generation and low-incomed students to get a head start in college. UConn has made my future.
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes online, but I will be planning on doing so in the fall of 2020. I am looking forward to how it will be."
Junior,5,COVID-19 made everyone take classes online and I had a really good experience with online classes at UConn. My professors were very understanding of our circumstances. Many of my professors gave us extra credit opportunities to compensate for what we were missing in the online setting. Overall 10/10!
Junior,5,I LOVE UCONN! The culture there is so great and everyone is so happy. Finals week is very overwhelming and the library will be PACKED! There are so many interesting people on campus. We have had a few racist incidences on campus but other than that campus life is great.
Sophomore,5,"Excellent resources and staff, beautiful campus, and wonderful people! Greek life is well established but the university doesn't revolve around it."
Sophomore,5,My time spend at UConn has been amazing! Their academics are so good here and I can really be anything I want to be.  They help to inspire you to push yourself more and more each day. Im so thankful that I chose this school!
Alum,5,"UConn is a diverse school. There are many clubs and activities on campus to be involved in and be acquainted with new people and make friends. UConn has research and internship opportunities around Connecticut. If you are interested in basketball, this is the university to attend! There is a basketball arena and ice skating rink on campus. The library has computers, a writing and math help center, and the fourth floor of the library is always quiet. Professors are accessible. If you want to know more about what’s happening on campus, you should join the UConn buy and sell page on Facebook. Dorms are reasonable and you can get a better dorm at rate 1 at Hilltop. The Student Union has late night on Fridays and Saturdays that has Karaoke and trivia and other fun themed activities. Horse-barn Hill, Jorgensen, and the recreation center are hotspots on campus. UConn Dairy Bar has a selection of ice cream flavors to try. Storrs Center has Price Chopper, takeout, Blaze, crepes, and cafes."
Alum,5,"Uconn was great. Because it was such a big school, there was always a place for everyone. There were an enormous amount of activities so no matter who you are, you were able to find a club or organization where you could feel as though you belong. The education was tough, but teachers were extremely helpful. If teacher's weren't available, there was plenty of ways to get extra help. Great school and great people. The only downside is the dorms and lack of infrastructure around town."
Niche User,5,It’s beautiful and very rustic. It has barns and also it’s mini city. You can see the green house and how they make everyone feel included
Freshman,5,"I transferred to UConn for my second semester of freshman year, and I could not be happier. As a CT resident, I was determined to go to school out of state, and never gave UConn a real chance during my application process. However, I am a total convert. I love the community, and my classes are amazing. There is always so much to do! Even throughout this online schooling because of COVID19, my professors have been amazing, and UConn has done a great job communicating with students."
Sophomore,5,"From the second I arrived at UConn, I felt at home and connected to everything around me. From the academics, professors, and people to the campus, athletics, and school spirit, coming here was one of the best decisions I'll ever take."
Alum,5,The education that I received at UCONN prepared me for a career in nursing through classroom and clinical experience.
Freshman,5,"UCONN is a great school. It's a safe environment where I can be myself because everyone accepts you. Aside from the great environment and support group, the various research opportunities available is really exciting and allows me to learn different things."
Freshman,5,"The dorms are old, but they're not too small. The campus big so either you can get a lot of exercise walking to class, or they have a great bus system. The professors always are super interested in teaching, and they all seem willing to help you out when you don't understand. The online portal is super helpful, because teachers often post lecture notes or other resources. The town center right near campus is adorable and has a grocery store (bonus!). The food is usually decent, they serve scrod way too much, but oh well."
Freshman,5,"Uconn is the best. As an engineering major in the Engr House LC, I have access to many resources to help me academically.  Professors and TAs are nice and reasonable.  The campus is too large to explore in two semesters so there's always lots to do. Party scene is good as long as you have a ride off campus."
Freshman,5,"I love it here, the environment is amazing. Their exercise program is great to and the professors are great. I feel like I am at home when I'm on campus."
Freshman,5,"The University of Connecticut is a very modern and resourceful campus. There are unlimited opportunities  in academics, sports, clubs, and more. The campus really works to make students successful by providing numerous study areas anywhere on campus, office hours for professors and teaching assistants, and tutors for just about every subject. The campus life is also very inclusive as well. There are so many places on campus for students to go such as the sports complexes, student union, recreation center/gym, and club locations."
Junior,5,I appreciate the hard-working staff and faculty that always provide their best efforts in helping their students.
Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my experience at UConn.  Not only are students granted access to most any club or academic endeavor they may wish to pursue, but most have a great time doing so!  Although UConn is located in the small town of Mansfield, CT, I have never had a problem finding something to do in my free time or on the weekends.  Sports games, greek life, bars, and on-campus clubs ensure that anyone who is looking for something to do will find it!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Connecticut has proven to be a home-away-from-home for me. Students and faculty alike are all incredibly kind and always willing to help a fellow Husky in need. Being in my second year at the University, I can firmly say that it has gone above and beyond what college life expectations were two years ago. The University of Connecticut is a tremendous place to live and learn, with something exciting always on the horizon."
Freshman,5,My first year at UCONN is great so far! The professors are good most of the time and the transition here was pretty smooth.
Senior,5,"I love UConn!! I transferred here after needing to be closer to home due to family circumstances. I had never imagined myself going to a big school, I'd never even looked at UConn when I first applied to school. The transition was scary and hard at times but best decision I EVER made. Truly the best school on earth. Can't recommend enough."
Junior,5,"Amazing experience at Uconn. Great academics and athletics. The campus is very pretty, although it is quite rural. The cows and horses are very cool and you can see them at any time and another benefit is the homemade ice cream!"
Sophomore,5,The overall atmosphere at the school is amazing. There's something for everyone and that's what makes it so great.
Freshman,5,I go to the Hartford branch of Uconn and so far my experience as a new freshmen has been a good one My professors have been readily available to contact and they have been easy to talk to. The hartford campus is has a range of diverse students. All of my professors seem to really enjoy the subject they are teaching so it has been which really helps us the students understand the material better. Overall I have enjoyed my experience so far and look forward for the next 4 years
Niche User,5,"When I toured the University of Connecticut I immediately knew I wanted to attend there, the campus was amazing, many majors to choose from, there are always people willing to help if you go as undecided. Most importantly the food is amazing . A lot of clubs to join as well as sports."
Freshman,5,The teachers are very encouraging and approachable. The campus is beautiful with a vibrant student life. There's a lot of fun events to get excited about and still have time to study :)
Sophomore,5,"I love how there is nothing around in the immediate area, it limits distractions and enhances the experience of just us being there. It is also nice because New York City, Boston, and Hartford are all really close to campus. The academics are tough for engineering, though, so be prepared for that."
Sophomore,5,Great campus with some amazing classes and professors. I have met great friends and have had an outstanding experience here.
Alum,5,I like how the professors are willing to spend their time on teaching you stuff you didn’t understand after class. I would like to change the pricing of rooms.
Freshman,5,"UConn has very strong programs and a diverse community. The classes are rigorous, but beneficial in the long run."
Sophomore,5,"I like how a lot of people that were on my floor were also in a lot of my classes, which pushed me to make friends with them so we could study together. I also like the wide variety of living options. There are even learning communities where you can live with people who are in the same major as you or have similar interests."
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely loved my time at UConn. Lots of fun, great academics, and the athletics are tons of fun. The campus is safe and beautiful and there are tons of options for dining. Local area is quiet but you can always find stuff to do."
Niche User,5,They have great engineering programs and a wonderful campus! They have an amazing dairy bar as well.
Senior,5,"The campus is welcoming, many different things to do on weekends or even during the week. Two bars on campus, a decent grocery store and a lot of different places to get food from. Most buildings are in walking distance, anything that's too far or if the weather is bad (can be extremely windy and cold) there are bus routes that run all over campus everyday."
Junior,5,I am a transfer student at the university of Connecticut. So far at UCONN my experience in the classes has been great. The professors are very engaging and the work load is good. The campus community is very accepting and welcoming which  I love. I'm very happy that I chose to come to Uconn.
Niche User,5,Excellent community on campus when I went on a college tour. Very diverse campus with plenty to do. Enjoy the wonderful views and amazing ice cream!
Freshman,5,What I like about UCONN is how helpful they are. They offer so many programs that students can use improve their academics.
Junior,5,"As a transfer student I can tell that University of Connecticut really cares about its students and their progress and understanding of the information in the classes. It is a productive learning environment set up to help students succeed.
Teachers and staff take time to help and campus is updated and beautiful."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the Business School and all the opportunities and resources they provided for their students.  Upon graduation, I received a full time job thanks to the career fairs and corporate partnerships they invite for participation."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus life and possibilities that UCONN has to offer me! I have toured and visited the main campus many times and have loved it more and more; they have a broad display of athletic and academic advantages for me, and I believe I will feel both at home and right where I should be if I got accepted into the University of Connecticut."
Junior,5,"I transferred to the University of Connecticut from the University of New Hampshire and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Some of the things that I was looking for when transferring included a large campus, school spirit, excellent academics and professors, and student life. I can honestly say UConn has exceeded my expectations in all of these areas and plus some. I wouldn't want to be a student at any other school and I wouldn't want to make any other changes to UConn!"
Freshman,5,"My time at Uconn has been very enjoyable. I appreciate the high spirits of all the people here and the impeccable and helpful staff.  There is not much I can say that I don't like about Uconn. I love the scenery, the city, and there are countless amounts of things to do around here. Hiking, enjoying downtown Storrs and checking out the museum and other ongoing events. My experience overall has been great. I have made many friends and connections and have been really striving academically."
Niche User,5,"It is a lovely country campus with lush grass and lots of room to spread out and grow. There are many choices of cafeterias offering a variety of foods from non gluten, religious restrictions, ethnic foods, allergy diets and so on. It is an open meal ticket plan meaning that you can go in to the cafeteria to grab an apple on your way to class. Then come back into the cafeteria again after class to grab a yogurt and so on. If your classes run into the evening hours, you can go for dinner #1, then go to class and come back after class for dinner #2. You will not go hungry or be hungry on this meal plan. The dorms looked relatively new, however, we were shown a model on our tour as going into an actual students room infringes upon their rights. The model was much smaller than the actual room itself would be and if you didn't listen to the tour guide accurately, then you would have been disappointed in the size of the room. They make and sell their very own ice cream at their barn."
Sophomore,5,i found everything to be very easy when applying to this school.  they send emails about all the stuff that needs to be done. i havent lived on campus yet.  i am starting this semester but when i visited the school it seemed very nice.
Junior,5,"I like the fact that UConn is kind of like its own city. Storrs center has everything a college student needs, all in walking distance."
Senior,5,I love being on the campus and seeing all of the people who go here. Working closely with professors as you move up the ranks of class standing feels extremely rewarding.
Sophomore,5,I love UCONN. They have a range of majors and minors for everyone. The professors and advisors are always there for their students.
Junior,4,"I take 90% of my classes online. My professors are able to navigate through all mediums sucks as slack, discord, and integral breakrooms to engage us in discussions. They have also been understanding about current limits students face and are more flexible towards assignments."
Sophomore,4,"Some teachers are very well organized with the class and use good online technology to teach classes. However, some classes are tougher in the online format and the module the teacher uses is also confusing. One such personal experience was in my law class, where I learned nothing but was tested every week. I had to watch youtube videos to learn concepts and learn about the subjects. The questions about the material from the module are tough and do not give the student any knowledge about the subject."
Junior,4,Professors are doing fairly well with teaching online. There are plenty of chances to request office hours and meet with them online.
Alum,4,"I had a great experience during my 4 years of undergrad. The school is definitely a place full of pride and community. I made many friends and met some great people. There are so many things to get involved in, it is almost impossible not to find your niche. The campus is extensive and large but the surrounding area is rural and homey. The staff and facilities are excellent and I couldn't have asked for a better college experience."
Niche User,4,It was very easy to enroll in duel enrollment classes and the staff are very helpful and friendly. All the professors are very intelligent in their field of studies and have a desire to teach others.
Junior,4,I like the wide range of courses available and the different programs available Igor students of color
Junior,4,"My online learning experience has overall been quite alright. I personally like having in person classes. However, my professors have been very understanding and helpful during this time!"
Junior,4,"There is a wide range of opportunities available to all students. Overall, a great experience! There are many opportunities for getting involved and receiving help in school"
Freshman,4,"UConn has an abundance of opportunities and resources for students to utilize to help them reach their ambitions for their futures. Unfortunately, UConn is also an extremely big party school and the school doesn’t do nearly enough to crack down on issues like underage drinking, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is oftentimes difficult to find others which don’t drink, as nearly 70% of students drink at UConn. UConn has a solid academic reputation, but the quality of your education truly depends on your professors (which can range from fantastic to downright awful) as well as your major (STEM has a much better program than, for example, the arts)"
Freshman,4,"Classes during the COVID-19 pandemic are either “hybrid” (part online, part in person), “distance learning” (synchronous learning), “online” (asynchronous), or “in person” (purely in person)"
Freshman,4,"My overall experience with UConn has been good so far! I am only a freshman starting this year, but I have been taking summer classes with UConn as part of the SSS program. I’m actually enjoying my time in the program, and I feel prepared to come back in the fall. My orientation experience, communication with my advisors, professors, staff, and acceptance experience have been great, and I am so excited to further my education at UConn!"
Graduate Student,4,"The campus is drop-dead gorgeous, you couldn't ask for a better environment to study. The athletic programs are mostly top-notch which can be a welcome distraction from classwork. The professors mostly care about the success of their students; but as always, there are duds. The in-state price after financial aid and scholarships is very reasonable for a nationally recognized university."
Alum,4,"Great and unique environment. UConn can seem daunting and large when you arrive but within a short period of time it becomes a very close-knit community where students, faculty, friends and family can grow and thrive! Wonderful educators and courses, great facilities, and an amazing community. Students today, Huskies forever! #Huskypride #woof"
Alum,4,"Courses are thought out by departments and implemented very nicely. Students have access to wonderful resources and faculty. Great learning community where students can get help if they are struggling, connect to one another to hold each other accountable in their academics and so on!"
Senior,4,"Overall, very average but professors seem to be very interested in their courses and what they teach. There isn't much to do around campus so clubs or athletics is thee only thing to do to keep busy besides classes during the week."
Freshman,4,Very great school with good community and academics along with sports. I would highly recommend to anyone in the New England area.
Sophomore,4,"For the most part my professors did a great jobs working with us when we switched to online classes this spring but there were a few courses that struggled to even care. Students were failing and they were just like its normal. That was really upsetting, so I would say when it comes to your science gen-eds be prepared to receive some disappointment but keep working hard and the minute you see a drop in your understanding or grade use EVERY resource and reach out to those who can help you study better. Other than that my learning experience was pretty good."
Freshman,4,"My experience with UConn has been honestly not bad. Although it could be a little better if everything wasn't online and I could actually visit the school, but so far the process has been decent and everybody makes sure that you are okay."
Freshman,4,I know that for the fall semester I have to take one class online and for the summer I do as well. They are working everything out and I know that it will be okay. Everybody makes sure that you are going to the right place and making sure things get done.
Alum,4,"Students today, Huskies forever. The incredible people I have met and the top notch education makes me want to go back and do it all over again."
Alum,4,"Students today, Huskies forever. The incredible people I have met and the top notch education makes me want to go back and do it all over again."
Sophomore,4,"There are many different opportunities for students who attend the University of Connecticut. As a student, I was able to join many clubs and I had access to various different resources. A majority of my professors were excellent, while here and there I had encountered a few that were pretty average. Student life is fairly well, there are many sporting events to attend, activities, parties. Overall, I had great experiences there, however the location is not the best."
Sophomore,4,"Taking classes online was difficult at first, but once adjusted it was fine. I definitely missed the social life at UConn, and being able to attend classes in person. However, online classes offered so much more flexibility, and most professors were very understanding. My grades did not suffer in the slightest, and while there were occasional challenges, overall I felt fairly comfortable with the change."
Alum,4,"I have absolutely loved my time at UConn. While there is absolutely nothing to do in the area, and finding parties can be kind of tough, the students and faculty at UConn are great. There is a huge variety of classes, so whether it's in or out of class, you will LOVE it."
Junior,4,"Lots of the teachers are foreign and don't speak English well, but I guess that's pretty standard nowerdays. Also they recently moved parking for off campus students to a lot which is almost a mile away from my first class, which I don't like. But otherwise the campus is nice and the academics/teachers are interesting."
Sophomore,4,"Due to corona, the second half of the semester was online. Some professors offered virtual help hours, but everything was pretty much ran as if the class was in person."
Sophomore,4,"I like the vast amount of academic resources, and student clubs/orgs on campus. One thing I didn’t like was how the school handled the racist incident that took place last fall."
Sophomore,4,It is a great school I just wish it was warm and the parties are super fun.  I love the school a lot!!
Sophomore,4,The change to online courses because of COVID19 was a little bumpy at first but for most courses it was an OK transition and we got into the groove of things pretty quickly.
Junior,4,"if you are looking for a school where you will find your group of friends, but still feel apart of big community then UConn is for you."
Freshman,4,Do not be fooled. Just because UCONN is a state school does not mean all classes will be a breeze. Academics here are very challenging. Most of the professors I have encountered are very understanding and willing to help if you reach out! Take advantage of office hours! My favorite part of campus: the brand new recreation center!
Junior,4,It is a very good university but it could be more diverse. It is a bit too expensive considering it is a public school.
Senior,4,"I think that Uconn is a great school and community. Though it can feel like a very large university at the start, it quickly becomes small and feels like home when you find your friends, clubs, and a major that suits you. The campus is very pretty and well kept, and there is a brand new gym. The only downside is that there is not too much to do around the campus if you do not have a car."
Freshman,4,I love my time at the university! There is so much to do on campus and so many resources to pursue your dream college experience and make it what you will. They're tons of opportunities to get involved in your career or interests.
Freshman,4,"The University of Connecticut has the true campus feel. Being that UConn is in Storrs, CT, the campus is the main source of life. It's beautiful scenery is peaceful and quiet. Though there is much to do and get involved in, Storrs itself is a quiet town and a good match if you're looking to be isolated in your academia."
Freshman,4,"I like that Uconn seems like such a big school, but when you get involved in things around campus, you realize that it is a very connected community that isn't hard to become a part of."
Freshman,4,"Although it is a large school, I have found that it has a very big sense of community that does not make it feel large at all. No matter where I go, I see someone I know but at the same time, I am constantly meeting new people. One of the downsides to this university is the fact that the football stadium and the XL center (where hockey and sometimes basketball games are) are both in Hartford which is 30 min away. Transportation is provided free by the school and the tickets to the games are free for students, but it is a big hassle to account for travel time rather than it being on campus. The other downside is that UConn is in the middle of nowhere. There aren't any stores nearby that can be reached without a 15 min car/bus ride. On the other hand, the social scene is great. Whether it is just hanging out in your dorm on the weekend or going to a party, there's always something going on."
Alum,4,"Overall, I can say that I had a great experience at the University of Connecticut, UCONN. At first, I felt overwhelmed by how large the school seemed in comparison to the high school that I came from and I felt as if I could not connect with my professors in my 300 students freshman classes. As I persisted and continued to take specialized coursework  within my major as well as became more involved with extracurricular activities, I began to make UCONN more and more my second home. I absolutely loves the diversity that I saw on campus, the plentiful amount of resources available, the multitude of safe and exciting student activities, and the unity that I felt through the UCONN pride that was shared among the students."
Freshman,4,"I wish that it wasn't so expensive and that we didn't have to take so many gen-eds. I can barely afford to go here, the reason that I still go here is because of the academics and the good enviorment, but money is becoming an issue for my family."
Junior,4,"I am currently a transfer student in the Mechanical Engineering program and came in during my junior year of college and my roommates are also transfers. Housing is not everyone's favorite thing but getting put with two random people, it went really well based on the interest survey we had to take. I like my classes, and my teachers seem to care much more than when I was in community college, and definitely harder classes. There are a lot of opportunities at UConn but if you don't exactly know what you want to do for a major I would take the community college route just for the money factor. It was a great choice for me, but if you do know what you want to do I would hit the ground running here and get as much experience as possible to look good for the recruiters or job fairs, which there are plenty of."
Junior,4,"I love UConn! The atmosphere is great and the campus is very safe. There is never a lack of activities to do or clubs to join and many of the professors are super helpful. However, the parking is really hard to deal with, as well as the lack of financial aid and scholarships awarded - especially when going abroad, which is hard."
Junior,4,"The UConn Storrs campus is gorgeous, with a great mix of modern and old architecture surrounded by beautiful trees and landscaping. The shuttle system is free, with multiple shuttles running various 15 min. loops throughout campus all day. This makes mobility easy, even when coming from commuter lots, etc. Academically, UConn offers programs many other universities don't, like Horticulture, Ornithology, and Archaeobotany. The facilities are state-of-the-art and the sports programs are top-notch."
Freshman,4,"The campus is nice, the tutors are effective, and while most of the teachers are great, there are those that are completely unhelpful and you end up teaching yourself"
Freshman,4,"I transferred to UConn from Clark University after one semester. I picked Clark because it was a small school, but immediately realized I did not like a small school environment. When I choose UConn, however, I was still scared about going to a large school and getting lost in the crowd. This was far from the case. At UConn, both staff and students have welcomed me and helped me settle into this new environment, and made it feel like home."
Freshman,4,"Being a Freshman at UConn is a changing experience for someone who is an introvert as myself. You are surrounded by a big campus that forces you (in a good way) to branch out and network. There are times when diversity is an issue; since I am an African American student. But overall, when you find the right people the experience isn’t as frustrating. Professors and advisors are there to help and there is so many resources for students mentally and academically. This college has a strong focus on student health and it makes me feel happy to have just that."
Sophomore,4,"One thing that I really enjoy about the University of Connecticut is the surplus of extra curricular activities that are offered through the school. There are hundreds of clubs, volunteer groups, and athletic teams to choose from. It is extremely easy to sign up for different groups, and there is an organization for anything that you would like to get involved it. There is a great amount of advertisement done for all the different organizations, making it easy to get involved."
Freshman,4,"I have only been at UConn for one semester so far, but I think it is a wonderful school, with great resources for students throughout their journey in college."
Freshman,4,There are many opportunities to make friends and gain experience in a lot of career paths. The staff is great and friendly. Mentors really care about your future and opening your to new possibilities.
Sophomore,4,"UConn is an awesome school but it is very big, which can get overwhelming, and there is not much to do on the weekends. However, the classes are great, food is pretty good most of the time, and most of the people are awesome."
Sophomore,4,It's an amazing school but overall I feel like they just spending money on unnecessary stuff that costs us to spend more. For example every week there's someone out there cutting the grass but when winter comes around they don't have people cleaning the snow/putting salt out.
Sophomore,4,The University of Connecticut has many great activities and ways to get involved in different organizations on campus. However one way it can be improved is by professors being more involved with their students.
Freshman,4,"The University of Connecticut is a great school. I know one of my fears was that it would feel like it was in the middle of no where and that it would be hard to build a community in such a large school. However there are so many opportunities for students to get together, and be part of a community that makes it feel small. Its a beautiful campus with lots of things to do. What I would like to see change maybe more variety in the food at the dinning hauls. The menu is very similar and it would be great if there were different kinds of foods offered. But other than that, the University of Connecticut has been great."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Connecticut is a perfect place to go for someone who wants the ability to explore their own major and explore outside of their major. I have been able to take classes within my major while also being able to take classes out of my major which piqued my interest outside my field of study. Not only that, there are a lot of academic and social clubs that one can join, making it the perfect opportunity to be able to make connections with other students, alumni, and professors. There is so much room to grow and the school gives you opportunities to grow as well. Not only that, with any issue that does come up on campus that inhibits campus life, the school gives opportunities to students to show their opinion and create new programs or initiatives in order to fix those issues."
Freshman,4,"The school seems to have a good overall academic program, although it certainly has its downsides given the high number of people and other things"
Freshman,4,The academics are outstanding at the University of Connecticut and the faculty on campus are always friendly and willing to help. There are a few things that could use some improvement such as dorms and the variety of dining hall choices but overall its a great school.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at the University of Connecticut. I transferred from another institution and immediately felt at home. UCONN did a great job of welcoming all students, whether it was first years or transfers. I had a great support system at the school including advisors. I was made aware of all the different opportunities at UCONN that I could get involved in. I was placed in housing with other transfers and other sophomores. UCONN offers many helpful resources for academics and really made the transition into harder classes a lot easier. I was able to take advantage of the resources available to me to do well. I did not feel out of place on move in day at all when coming to UCONN, everyone was very accepting. One thing I would like to see UCONN improve on is supporting the different majors that they provide. They do not have many resources that can set you up to have a job or internship once you graduate."
Freshman,4,"I liked that people there are friendly and helpful. The professors are also useful in that the ones I have had get back to me in a reasonable amount of time, and are approachable."
Niche User,4,"The University of Connecticut provided me with a unique, memorable, and educational summer camp experience. From their summer engineering program, I was able to learn about many different types of engineering disciplines. The summer camp provided students with outstanding professors and academics. Although the experience as a whole was enjoyable the dorms were very small. In return, the food was better than expected."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Connecticut is a great school, very good teachers and amazing programs. The only thing I would change is the professors in the tri-campuses and more security in the garages."
Freshman,4,"UConn is a very respectable university. It has a very inclusive and diverse environment that allows everyone to find their own place. Because of its size and diversity, every individual has the capability to mold UConn into their own self-defined UConn.

The size of this university is, in a way, bittersweet. It's because of its size that UConn has the ability to offer the vast amount of opportunities that it does. In turn, it is easy to feel lost and overwhelmed at UConn. Even though every student has a place at this university, it is sometimes difficult to truly locate that place. It is a responsibility of UConn to help these students, without overwhelming them. This process is certainly a challenge, for both UConn and the student, that needs to be given more attention."
Alum,2,"Personally, I am not a fan of online learning, as I find that I do much better while being in a classroom where I can talk to a professor and ask questions along the way rather than awaiting an email response that often took days-weeks. When COVID 19 hit, it made it very difficult to coordinate with other students and professors."
Alum,2,"Counselors were incorrect in what they shared. Counselors were discriminatory and negative.  Campus is large and spread out. It is a school that could be good for exploring liberal arts possibilities.  Horseback riding and music are fun classes to add on, but the overall experience I would not recommend to anyone."
Sophomore,2,"Uconn is a very lively campus with lots of activities, clubs, sports, etc to be involved in and food is average. Yet a major downside is that the school does not care at all about their students financially. They do not give appropriate aid, and do not accept any sort of negotiation which is pretty ridiculous as the cost of attendance get more expensive each year. If you plan to come to Uconn out-of-state, keep this in mind and make sure you have a backup plan. College debt is no joke ."
Sophomore,2,"Teachers rarely help you with academics and they charge extra fee’s every chance they get, and u can not do anything unless u pay the fee first, I had a 300$ balance that I didn’t know I had, and they gave me a 150$ late fee the day after it was due and I called and asked if I pay the 300 now could they take off the late fee and they wouldn’t"
Senior,2,"Fine place to get a degree, but not much else. A lot of big egos and unhappy people. UConn police do an incredible job of making sure nothing fun ever happens. When you’re 21 you can go to the bars."
Junior,2,"UConn has very little consideration for their commuting students. I once had to drive to school in a blizzard to take a test which couldn't be made up if I didn't show. But when I got there, the professor hadn't even shown up because of the snow! Yet i still had to drive all the way there in less than perfect conditions. Speaking of, the professors are horrible. They hire teachers who either have no idea what they're doing or teachers that have such thick accents that you can't understand them. Academic success isn't just in the hands of the student. It's also in the hands of the professor teaching the class. If the professor can't communicate clearly with the students, or they have unreasonable standards, etc, then their students will fail, and they will fail as a professor. I would like to see UConn administration take more interest in accomodating commuters and hire professors who can actually be understood."
Junior,2,"The closest thing you have to entertainment up here is the overhyped Storrs Center, which is just two small streets of restaurants. No wonder why so many students gain weight, the only thing to do when you're not doing work is eat. One of my hobbies is living a healthy lifestyle, and I can't even do that because the gym is always packed & the food is greasy. I can give a whole other rant on just the gym, but ill leave it at this- the football team has more racks for the 80 players on the team than the rec center does for 19,000+ undergrads. And for the Sodexo-brand food (aka high school cafeteria food), I can't even accurately count my macros because the administration fails to provide accurate nutrition info. As for the dorms, the view from outside of my window is Storrs Cemetery. The overall campus is gloomy and reminds me of the Industrial Revolution. Good luck escaping campus if you're a Fresh or Soph, you need 54 credits to bring a car to campus & HOPEFULLY get a parking spot."
Sophomore,2,"Overall, academics are good. In terms of campus life, the location makes it so that there is not much to do on and outside campus."
Junior,2,"While UCONN may be one of top 60 schools in the U.S., it has many downsides, including taking money for nearly every single activity students wish to pursue. Nothing is free here and it uses students' tuition money for its own purposes, including giving away hard-earned cash to coaches and athletes to keep its sports record. As a university, it shouldn't be focusing on athletics, but rather on academics, which everyone came there for. If out-of-state tuition was more affordable, I certainly would not recommend UCONN for anyone, especially considering that it's a party-school, even though it tries to deny it. Also, UCONN always takes the professors' side on everything, so be prepared to not get any aid from higher-ups."
College Freshman,2,"The academics are what you would expect from the reviews and rankings you read online. The faculty is helpful and understanding, and the work load is generally heavy but mainly dependent on your major like any other school. I was very disappointed by the lack of activities/events/parties outside of Greek Life, which I have no interest in, and clubs. I would say it's because I'm a freshman guy, buy I've had the same problem weekend after weekend travelling with groups of girls as well. Cops shut down everything on campus outside of the bars before 11, and it takes upwards of 30 minutes walking to even get off campus for parties. The food is good at some dining halls, the people are cliquey, the academics are worth the effort, but it's very upsetting to have so few outlets and watch people at other schools out until 3 AM on weekends while you sit in your dorm because everyone has gone home."
College Junior,2,"There are many improvements that can be made to the health and safety of the UCONN campus, Health Services is always a pain to deal with"
College Sophomore,2,"I feel safe on campus, my walk back to my dorm was well lit. Other paths to dorms aren't lit too well and UConn doesn't take sexual assualts very seriously."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Small, overpriced, old housing options."
College Junior,2,"I think the school is making efforts towards a safer campus, but I don't even know where I would go for help in the event of a sexual assault."
College Sophomore,2,I had to move from my old building because so many people were making rape jokes.  Rape culture is a legitimate problem at UConn.
College Senior,2,Room's smell like people smoked marijuana. Bathrooms smell horrible and aren't clean.
College Senior,2,You don't hear much about it. However I am not very interested in it anyways.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at UCONN for freshman are not what I was expecting. They were quite small for two people, damaged and the bathrooms were very very dirty all the time. There were also only two bathroom stalls, one of which was half the size of a normal stall. The social atmosphere was also very uncomfortable- rules were not enforced and boys would go in the girl's bathroom, a boy hid a camera in the girl's bathroom, and someone was sexually assaulted. This case was not taken care of by campus and was ignored. Students were not informed of who the student was which made people feel very uncomfortable in our building. Overall, the supervision and enforcement of rules lacks quite a bit. Students do what they want with little to no consequences."
College Sophomore,2,"The relationship between Greek and non-Greek students is quite bad. They often don't respect one another and some of the fraternities and sororities are snobby to those who are not in one. Additionally, fraternities and sororities are disrespectful to each other- there have been incidents of racist acts and the school administration did nothing about it. Greek life rules the school much like athletics do."
College Sophomore,2,"UCONN does not focus on the success of their students. As an undergraduate, you feel that you are on your own to pick classes and decide on a major. Once I had an idea of a major I wanted to study, I was told I needed to have picked it at the beginning of freshman year because I would be very behind, even though I was still a first semester freshman. My advisors had not mentioned this to me when I started out despite the fact I mentioned my interest in the major. I am very disappointed in the school and its willingness to help students succeed. The class sizes are also very large and do not allow for students to interact with professors. The relationship between student and professor is essentially nonexistent except for when an exam is graded, but even then, the professor does not know the student they are grading."
College Sophomore,2,All of greek life is slowly getting kicked off campus and is generally viewed badly by students at the university besides the 10% of students who are in greek life
College Freshman,2,I'm at a state school so people already have groups of friends coming into school. I feel bored at times and wish I had a city so I can do something beyond my campus.
College Sophomore,2,"At my first year at college I felt that it was the wrong fit for me. I felt that I did not want to graduate from this college. I worked extra hard to maintain good grades so I was able to transfer. This fall semester I am transferring to one of my dream schools and I cannot be more excited! The school I am attending in the fall is a public research university, something which is very different from where I first started, a private liberal arts school. I would suggest to students researching schools to look at small and large schools, this will truly help you decide what you want. And that feeling you get when you first step on campus is a lasting one, first impressions are lasting impressions! College is what you make of it so enjoy the ride!"
College Freshman,2,"People get fed up a lot with the administration. It seems sometimes that they make decisions that purposefully go against what the student body wants. It can get frustrating, but it doesn't really affect the college experience too badly unless you start really thinking about it and getting bummed out."
College Sophomore,2,"I think Greek Life is crappy. They do participate in community service because they HAVE to, but if it were up to them, they wouldn't give a damn. Not to mention, the past year has been HORRENDOUS with racism."
College Sophomore,2,"UConn's financial aid is a joke. On the FAFSA I have an expected family contribution of 0, yet I still have to take out a number of loans each semester. I get grants from the university, but not nearly enough aid for my family's level of income. I am a first generation college student, and am the child of a single mother, I should be receiving far more aid."
College Freshman,2,Storrs is in the middle of nowhere. They're trying to develop more of a downtown but it's still pretty limited. They finally added a grocery store and a gas station. Most restaurants are fast food but a few cafes have popped up.
College Freshman,2,"Frat houses have some cool parties but they're usually exclusive. Some will let guys in for $10. Girls can get in free as long as it's not an exclusive party. The police shut down big parties very quickly. A lot of people start walking home from parties around 10:30pm. It's pretty dismal. Bars keep things going later as long as you are ""old enough"" to get in. UConn is in the middle of the woods so there's not much to do near campus. If you want a big nightlife you're better off going to school in the city."
College Sophomore,2,The administration has little involvement in student affairs. The higher administration does not look to understand or care about the student's here. There was recently an issue and there was nothing really done to fix this issue and students had to protest in order to get a response from the higher administration.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not involved or really know anyone involved in Greek Life, but from what I've heard the students seem to cause many issues."
College Freshman,2,"There's not much around Storrs within walking distance. A little downtown area has been growing over the past couple of years. It's all brand new, but still very small. There are a couple cafes, a 711, a frozen yogurt place, a Moe's, Mooyah, Insomnia Cookie, a sushi bar, and a few other fast-food places. The costs are pretty average, but not many offer student discounts. I would check out Dog Lane Cafe, they have really good sandwiches!"
College Sophomore,2,Cops have gotten stricter and stricter each year
College Sophomore,2,"Residence Halls are too small, Suite Style dorms are in horrible locations, On-Campus Apartments are too expensive."
College Freshman,2,Party life here sucks. Unless you know the correct people or unless your in a sorority/frat you'll never figure out where to go. People here either tend to go really hard or not at all and it's horrible if your in the middle.
Recent Alumnus,2,The administration is too strict on general violations of parking as well as not understanding individuals when certain circumstances arise
College Junior,2,"The housing here is alright. The truth is that no university is going to offer housing that is good value for the money, or an appropriate amount of space in a dorm room. That being said it is still insulting how little space is given for so much money being paid."
College Freshman,2,Not much going on-except for Storrs Center which is great.
College Freshman,2,wish there was more scholarships
College Junior,2,"I have received no financial aid from this school.  My FAFSA grants me state loans, but I do not consider loans financial aid.  It's still money that I will have to pay back.  You could say that the reason they do not have good scholarships is because they are a public school, however I see them pouring money into new unnecessary buildings and athletics facilities.  If UConn truly cared about it's students, it would be giving that money to them."
College Junior,2,"I do not live on campus, but I'm not sure that I would feel safe doing so.  Campus police racially profile and can be very cruel to sexual assault survivors.  The University of Connecticut is very large and has many parties.  When we win sports championships there are riots.  Sexual assault rates are very high.  During holidays such as Halloween I do not feel comfortable being on certain areas of campus."
College Sophomore,2,Don't really care for them
College Sophomore,2,I am denied many opportunities for scholarships and aid
College Sophomore,2,The Gym is always full
College Sophomore,2,It's a lot of drunk people and no dancing
College Junior,2,"Still not enough around Storrs, same places allthe time"
College Junior,2,All the Greeks think they are better than everyone else
College Freshman,2,"Although I live in Buckley, ""a perk"" as part of being in the Honors Program, it is considered one of the worst buildings on campus. Its dining hall is the worst, location is terrible, heating/no air condition make all seasons a torture. The only good thing is the two extra inches we get in our rooms."
College Freshman,2,"Although it is a public school and relatively cheaper than other schools, UConn scholarships are all or nothing. Some students can receive $5,000 a year while others receive an all inclusive scholarship. However, $5,000 does not even cover one semester at UConn."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do around here.
College Freshman,2,"UConn is Storrs, literally. We're surrounded by farmland but we're close to three major cities (Hartford, New York City, Boston) and there's pretty easy access to get there. The new downtown Storrs is super nice but that's all there is to do and all you can really do is eat. But you don't really need to go off campus because there's always stuff to do on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Storrs is UConn. There is nothing else. However, you're not far from Hartford (barely a city), a little over an hour from Boston, and about 2 from new york if you wanna go into a city"
College Junior,2,most frats have become tacky and coincide with coke heads and alcoholics..
Recent Alumnus,2,I have never seen any acts of violence in regards to diversity however student sub groups tend to mingle amongst themselves.
College Junior,2,All I ever truthfullly see off campus is Dunkin Donuts.
College Junior,2,There is not much social life around the dorms
College Sophomore,2,The off-campus housing that's actually close to campus are used for partying. There are more options that are further away but they are not convenient due to the distance. There's another expensive option close to campus and the complex is called The Oaks. This isn't reasonably priced but it is close to campus.
College Sophomore,2,I personally think greek life is one of the worst parts about uconn.
College Sophomore,2,Very little goes on if you're not at an off-campus party.
College Freshman,2,"A half-hour, 45 minute bus ride to Hartford.  Nothing to do locally off campus."
College Freshman,2,Cold and windy most of the school year.
Sophomore,1,"I come from a poor family after making the dean's list and receiving straight A's, I expressed my financial situation to the school and was recommended to cancel my housing so that I could afford the next semester instead of being offered any aid or a scholarship. Uconn also practically robbed me of $6000 because not a single person told me that I could get my $3000 health insurance fee waived which I paid for for TWO semesters costing me $6000 AND my housing. DO NOT attend this school if you're in a difficult financial situation like me. They will not aid their STRAIGHT A DEAN LIST students, they will not even tell their students about the waivers they can fill out to save tons of money, and they will ignore ANY APPEALS you make toward cancellation fees. But something they WILL DO is build a new recreation center that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars when we already had one."
Junior,1,"not helpful and all they care about is the money the classes are stupid hard and the kids are trash. I liked this at first but then they took away my scholarship because my professors messed up my final grade and they wont change it, that is not fair at all and now i just don't understand what is going on"
Sophomore,1,"UConn fails in most facets one should expect of a large state school. If you have any interest in living somewhere without 60 miles per hour winds hitting you constantly, UConn may not be the place for you. The massive deficit within the Connecticut state budget mean UConn will not stay the educational powerhouse it is today. The dorming situation is abysmal. Stuck in the 1970's, the rooms are not fit for any sane person."
College Freshman,1,"Parties only occur at off campus frat houses, apartment complexes, or in the dorms. Wherever they are, the cops will shut them down very quickly and leave people walking home before 12. My friends and I have spent much more time than we would have liked walking around campus at night for hours only to find nothing. In the recent years the cops have become increasingly strict and the parties decreasingly frequent. Most are BYOB. This has been a frustrating problem since I got here, and as it gets colder there will be even less parties than the few that occur on the weekends."
College Freshman,1,"This is my biggest problem with the school. Whether you're a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior, it is very difficult to find and enjoy parties. The bars are decent but always crowded, and always ID. There are currently only two bars on campus, and zero other clubs or bars within a reasonable distance. Walking is virtually the only way to get to parties if you don't own a car because they all occur off campus. If you aren't into nightlife or partying I can see why this wouldn't be a problem, but it was disappointing to come here and find these things out and spend the first few weekends wandering campus while your friends from other schools are partying from 9-3AM."
College Junior,1,I personally have no interest in engaging in Greek life.
College Junior,1,"Greek life at UConn changes people, and from an outside perspective, it's not for the better. I have had more than one friend join a sorority and begin to forget me and the people they used to hang out with. I knew a girl really well from high school, and when she joined Greek Life at UConn, she changed her hair and wardrobe completely just to fit in. Both fraternities and sororities are very cliquey and if you aren't part of them, don't expect to be invited to any parties or events."
College Sophomore,1,"Absolutely terrible; Greek life tries to create a popularity hierarchy which is stupid and juvenile and it's basically a weird cult, and the members are the only ones who thinks anyone likes them."
College Sophomore,1,"UCONN does not take safety seriously on campus. Someone in my building was sexually assaulted and nothing was done about it. The word on campus is that if you need help, contact the Storrs police, not UCONN police. I had a bad experience with campus safety when I called for a Husky Safe ride at 11:30pm. They denied me a ride when I felt unsafe walking 25 minutes back to my room on a main road. The point of these rides are for this exact circumstance yet they denied me a ride."
College Freshman,1,"Not my type of people. There is no diversity of thought at all - arts and culture are extremely under appreciated and almost everyone is just very basic and shallow. There are only a few common interests: drinking, partying and Tinder. Vineyard Vines seems pretty popular amongst Connecticut natives. Social life seems very superficial and I just really feel like I am in the wrong place. I'm sure there are some awesome people somewhere at UConn but I have yet to meet any of them."
College Freshman,1,They are overrated and turn people into snobs.
College Junior,1,My tip? Go to a school that you don't need financial aid for...that is how horrible the process is
College Junior,1,Nothing around here except about half an hour to 45 minutes away.
College Junior,1,Outside of campus there is literaly nothing to do and nowhere to go. You'd have to drive about 30 to 45 minutes to get to a more lively town and find places to go.
College Junior,1,Aid and scholarships are extremely difficult to get
College Freshman,1,I received very little financial aid and had to pay a lot more than I could afford.
College Sophomore,1,The weather is by far the worst part of living here. There are days between january and march when it is almost too cold to walk to classes
College Freshman,1,"UCONN IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST, BASICALLY. I HATE IT. I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE TO LIVE THERE OR EVEN NEAR IT."
College Sophomore,1,Buses are never on time and the GPS app that shows their exact plans are unreliable.
College Freshman,1,I did not receive aid even though I need it. 
College Freshman,1,it is awful getting anywhere.
College Student,1,UCONN either gets extremely cold or extremely hot making going to classes a hassle almost the whole time you're there.
College Sophomore,1,you can't go anywhere unless you have a car or a friend with a car
College Freshman,1,"NOTHING AROUND. Unless you like cows and fields, you'll be painfully bored here."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is close to campus but the cost is outrageous 
College Junior,1,UConn might be the coldest most windiest campus I have ever attended. 75% of the time you are running to class in order not to get wet or freeze.
College Freshman,1,UConn is really bad at giving out scholarships. Some of my friends who were accepted to better schools than UConn got more scholarships from those schools than UConn!
College Senior,1,"I have received a degree in other subjects. For instance, I am a certified nuclear medicine technologist and I also have a business degree prior to entering nursing school. On multiple occasions, my financial aid was incorrect and/or I would not be charged and within 24 hours charged the fees and a late fee for non-payment. The culture of the school is to rate professors via survey before the end of the class, however for a particular professor that many students had issues with, we were not given an opportunity to rate the professor until several weeks after the course. Also, the registration process always changes. Sometimes we are told to register ourselves for class, and then when administration realizes a problem with the system, the students are told to register ourselves. In regards once again to professors I am 5 weeks away from graduating and I took an exam in Med-Surg that most of the class failed. This particular class has two teachers in which we were instructed to only contact one for official rules. We expressed concerns as a class and unprofessionally we were told that we did not study and were stupid. The morale dropped significantly and many students do not want to pursue further education based on this horrible program."
College Senior,1,It is ALWAYS windy. And it rains almost every tuesday. The weather is the worst. 
College Sophomore,1,It's completely bad if you have a vehicle and can't get a permit to park campus.
College Junior,1,"They need more parking lots for commuters. It's a nightmare. Last semester I didn't have classes until 11 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but I had to get to campus by 9 if I wanted a spot that wasn't on the other side of campus. There are buses to take if you do end up parking on the opposite side of where you'll be spending your day, but they aren't always that reliable."
College Sophomore,1,"There is plenty of parking at Uconn, but it is expensive.  The parking garages are about $12 per day.  A resident parking permit for the year is ~$160."
College Junior,1,"There is barely any on campus parking, other than in the two garages which can get very expensive.  The cops are handing out parking tickets all day long so it is very important to find a legal spot, otherwise you will most likely get a ticket.  Overall, parking is a nightmare and it is easier to take the buses."
College Junior,1,The hartford campus has no nightlife. So if that is what you are looking for apply to the storrs campus.
College Junior,1,Getting a good parking spot is difficult. Make sure to get to the campus early.
College Freshman,1,Lol I've only been here one semester and I haven't gotten caught ...
College Junior,1,Every party gets broken up by 11. There are cops guarding all of the off campus apartments. Dorms are strict. Bars get raided all the time so its hard to get in underage.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at UConn is a NIGHTMARE. There is very little visitor parking and for the most part you have to pay to park in a garage. Parking in the garage is not cheap and parking tickets are quite expensive. On the weekends you can park in some faculty parking which makes things easier, otherwise the UConn police start making their rounds as early as 7:00 AM to start ticketing cars that do not have parking passes. As a freshman getting parking is pretty hopeless and the other non-campus parking that is offered is very expensive. If you don't have to bring a car then don't!"
College Senior,1,"Plan on paying out-of-pocket, or on lots of loans."
College Senior,1,"If You Don't Have a Car or Know Someone Who Drives, It's Going to Be Hard to Get Around – Simply put, UConn is surrounded by trees, cows, farms, and small towns. There are two charter buses out of UConn: Megabus and Peter Pan. Both of these buses can take you to places like Providence, RI and Hartford. I think Peter Pan has a connection to NYC. There's a little state bus from Storrs to Willimantic. And there's a bus to take you to the Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester on the weekends. But that's about it. The big buses run on limited schedules, at least for Hartford. If you have a really nice family that will drive you to and from campus, or friends, that will help you out. Even better if you have your own car. I don't know much about parking and car-related stuff, but the parking usually is on your fee bill and you can't have a car on campus until you're a junior or you have the required credits."
College Sophomore,1,Middle of Nowhere – The UConn campus is in the middle of nowhere and approximately 30 minutes from the nearest metropolitan area. There is not much off-campus dining to choose from. Wings Over Storrs is awesome but that is about it.
College Sophomore,1,"If you are not a commuter student and do not have a parking pass, you have to park in north or south garages which are not free. Even if you do have a pass, you may not be able to find a space so make sure to arrive early. For parents, if you can find a space, only make sure to leave the car there for a short time."
College Junior,1,"As a student without a car, when my family brings me to campus to move in or comes to visit me, there is always a problem with parking. Whether it is finding it or being able to park here or there, we are met with difficulty."
College Senior,1,"It's All About the Beach – There are some beach and house parties to be had, but most of the activities focus on the ocean and the outdoors, not on nightlife and parties."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The University administration decided that they could save money by getting rid of graduate housing.  Rent near campus is extraordinarily high.  Most graduate students live 3 to 20 miles away.  Public transportation is dismal, so a car is a must."
College Student,1,The campus is based off a design of a wind tunnel so during the cold winters where is snows a lot it is also extremely windy which makes it even more cold. But inside is warm!
College Freshman,1,"Parties Central – Uconn is a great place for you if you want to party. There is always a party going on during the weekends, and you can get alcohol pretty easily if you want it. However, if you want to do anything outside of partying or getting wasted, there isnt really a whole ton to do. Most of the social life here seems to revolve around parties and drinking and such, and since I'm a person who is not into that stuff it makes it hard to do anything else. Transportation isnt that big of an issue to get back to campus, most places are within walking distance or there is a service that will pick you and bring you back to your dorm. You have to check to see if this service is running that weekend because it doesn't always run every weekend. If thats not something you want to do, there are lots of sober drivers that will charge a few bucks to take you to and from parties."
College Freshman,1,"UConn has its own climate. One day it may be sunny and warm out, and the very next day it may be snowing or freezing cold and very windy. Very strange. Tends to be fairly cold, and the wind routinely makes the temperature extremely cold during the winter."
College Freshman,1,"Awful, Really a Hassle – I don't have a car on campus and, if you live on campus or know someone with a car, I don't really think there is a need for a car.  It can actually be more of a hassle.  People who I know that have cars are always complaining about finding parking spots."
College Freshman,1,"To be honest, the Greeks feel like they are better than everyone. They chastise those that are not part of the Greek life and that is sad. Truth be told, they cause the most problems on campus."
College Freshman,1,Night Life-No Value – There is not much to do. The campus does not offer a sufficient amount of opportunities for us students to enjoy.
College Freshman,1,"HATE ITTTTT – I want to transfer, nobody likes it here either. It is commonplace to joke about how crappy the school is. I think I pretty much ruined my college experience by coming here, there's no fun to be had at all. I just hope I can transfer out junior year and maybe then I can go to a college party not 2 hours away...Oh and the advisers are awful, they do not know what they are talking about and could barely help me pick classes to transfer. Its like a trap, you get lured in with the promise you can go to real UConn. Then then leave you for dead, all alone and infact it is very hard to get form stamford to storrs."
College Freshman,1,"they actually do have greek clubs you can sign up for, but few and sects of the larger group. Its not taken as seriously at all"
College Freshman,1,"there are robotic business workers who take the train, people lower socioeconomic class all over the rest of the town. Pretty much no college atmosphere whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,there are what 7 majors you can pursue here. the classes are scarce and almost impossible to get into. As a freshman I could not get ONE science class and I am an environmental major. I really regret coming here and unless you want to be nurse
College Freshman,1,"there isnt much staff interference. Sometimes there are homeless people wondering around the school... However, the students are pretty much free"
College Freshman,1,"Do Not Expect to Get Smarter – they claim they get amazing teachers from all over, like NYU to come teach. That is bs the teachers are very commonly part time teaching or from the surrounding community colleges. There are no classes available towards most majors, apart from gen eds."
College Freshman,1,"No Campus Life – Theres no campus police, so if you get caught, you are screwed by the state"
College Freshman,1,"Inconvenience of an Out-Of-State First-Year – As an out-of-state first year with my car, I came to my school just in time to miss the last of first-year parking options.  Make sure you get your permits as soon as they're available, and don't try to park anywhere without a permit in many places--tickets are free-flowing."
College Sophomore,1,"I come from a city where guys prefer to surf and skate rather than sit in a chair with a bong on their lap.  If you are looking for a grizzly then UConn's your place to troll for guys.  But if you're looking for anything more, you're probably not going to find it here.  To be fair I've seen about 15 decent looking men; all the rest are boys."

Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere on the campus was like nothing I had ever experienced. Whether I was walking to and from classes, I felt safe and comfortable in my own skin. The small school vibes definitely helped me find my place at the school. I never once felt as if I couldn't ask my teachers for help or just stop by during after hours. The school also has a vast variety of clubs and extra curricular activities, along with a great Greek Life which improved campus spirit. When I'm at Spring Hill, I feel like I'm at my home."
Sophomore,5,"We moved to online classes due to the global pandemic, which was a real stress for both us and many teachers. Despite the stress, the online classes were very well organized and most of my teachers extended their office hours from what they would normally be. Some teachers didn't even create office hours and told us to contact them as we needed them. Overall, the experience was amazing. As someone who doesn't do well learning online, I never felt as if I wasn't learning enough or as if it was a waste of my time."
Junior,5,I love Spring Hill College and all the opportunities they have presented for me. They have programs for all majors that allows full success post graduation for all of the students who come here.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Spring Hill College! I was honestly super nervous to go to college because I live 14 hours away and I knew I wasn’t gonna know anybody there, but EVERYONE was unbelievably nice and the campus is the perfect size so it just felt like my second home. I’ve already made great friendships during my first year that I know will last a lifetime. And most of the professors truly care about their students and the education they receive. Overall, it’s just a great atmosphere and I really can’t wait to go back!"
Sophomore,5,Awesome nice atmosphere and great environment. Love the smaller classrooms . Wish they had more majors for grad school
Junior,5,I have had a very pleasant and great experience here. The campus is so beautiful. The student to professor ratio is small.
Sophomore,5,I love the togetherness of Spring Hill College. It makes feel as though I could easily be friends with any one of my classmates and peers. The very close- knit type of relationship makes feel like the teachers care about me and my success.
Freshman,5,The close knit student community. The professors all know their students by name. And everyone is accepted.
Sophomore,5,"Spring Hill College is my true home! I love it here, the staff is amazing, and since it's such a small school there is ample opportunity to meet new people and feel completely safe doing it! The only thing I would improve on is the price, it's extremely expensive."
Junior,5,I love Spring Hill college. I have learned so much and have gained confidence in school and other activities. I have gained life long friends.  The professors are fantastic.
Sophomore,5,I love my college. I feel safe and protected by the campus and staff. It really is a community willing to help others succeed.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Spring Hill has been wonderful. I love the atmosphere and the people around me are extremely nice. Coming into college was nerve-racking for me, but Spring Hill made me feel welcome from the start and has allowed me to transition smoothly into the process. I'm very pleased with my school."
Sophomore,5,"Spring Hill is not a real school, it's like summer camp. Everyone is so nice and welcoming and talks to you like you've known them your entire life even if you met them two seconds ago. Everyone is so creative and you can find liberals, conservatives, christians, jews, muslims, gay people, straight people, trans people, anything you can look for. The connections are amazing also, its such a great community and I've met so many people that I have some connection to even though I had never met them before. great people, great teachers. But pub safe needs to chill with the weed busts."
Niche User,5,The faculty and students alike are very friendly and helpful to new people. The security guards made the campus feel very safe and homey. The campus itself is very clean and well-managed and my experience as a whole there just made me feel completely comfortable.
Niche User,5,Every time I have been to Spring Hill the environment has been great. All of the people are super welcoming and kind. The campus is so pretty and small. The food there is pretty good. The unlimited swipes is pretty dope.
Freshman,5,This Fall I will be starting my second semester here and I absolutely love it. The faculty and staff here are wonderful and friendly. I'm very excited to be starting back here and I'm glad I get to call this college my home for the upcoming future.
Alum,5,Spring Hill has great academics with professors who are involved. The campus is beautiful and really peaceful. If you like a small school this one is for you!
Niche User,5,My visit there was nice and they offered me a small grant because I went for a visit. I was very impressed with the campus and the overall mood of the campus. I am excited to start there. Learning more about Catholicism will be very interesting for me!
Freshman,5,"Before coming to Spring Hill I was just the shy girl that sat in the back of the class. But after just a week at this school, I have became more open and have made many friends that I expect to have throughout my life."
Freshman,5,I have had the best college experience at Spring Hill College. I would recommend this college to anyone. The diversity is so wide with people coming from all over the country and world. There's so many clubs and organizations to become apart of.
Freshman,5,I love SHC! The thing I love the most is how small and connected the students and the staff is. I never walk across campus without running into someone I know.
Freshman,5,It is an excellent small school with a great campus.  The small class sizes promote a good learning experience.  The professors are very helpful and the classes are very challenging.  It is a great college to continue in the Jesuit traditions of learning and giving back to others.
Freshman,5,Spring Hill College is a very well rounded institution. The academics are very good but the athletics are on the growing side. The professors are all very well educated. The food on campus is not always the best and there are not many options when it comes to your meal plan. The city of Mobile is very big and has many different attractions outside of the campus but the campus of Spring Hill itself is very scenic.
Sophomore,5,"I think Spring Hill is an amazing school! It has given me the opportunity to explore all aspects of education through its Liberal Arts curriculum, as well as my faith in the Catholic Church. Although their science equipment and building need a serious update, I have been able to learn some useful techniques for laboratory experience. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small school."
Freshman,5,"Spring Hill College is definitely one of the best choices of my life. It is definitely worth the money you spend to go here. The campus is beautiful, the classes are small, professors work with you and the curriculum is challenging. Spring Hill College works with you financially and educationally. I would highly recommend this beautiful private, Jesuit College to anyone who is looking for a college."
Freshman,5,"It's a very close campus. The connections you make are meaningful, and the people are genuine. The classwork is challenging, but people in the south know that Spring Hill is a good education. The professor truly care about everyone. It's a great school like most Jesuit universities and is a wonderful place to attend."
Freshman,5,I love this place. Lovely and energetic professors who care a lot about your academic growth. You will never feel left behind on your class work because of the touring program and the available time you can spend with the professors outside of the class. The college has a quiet and open library to study alone or in groups. Numerous events are planned throughout of the semester for students to engage in and enjoy.
Alum,5,Spring Hill College was the best decision I made out of high school. It was the perfect mix of fun and academics and I wouldn't trade my experience for any big school or football game. I still stay in tough daily with my best friends from SHC and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. 
Junior,5,Spring Hill College is a great school for anyone to attend. The campus is beautiful and the academics are excellent. 
Sophomore,5,"Choosing Spring Hill College was the best financial and academic decision I could have made. I received a generous academic scholarship and some other smaller ones, all through the school. The campus is lovely and well-kept and  buildings and facilities are clean. I am a commuter students so I don't spend any time in dorms. The only thing I would like to see Spring Hill do differently is manage their commuter-friendliness. I live a pretty good distance from the school and often miss out on activities because I am usually unable to drive back and forth. As far as academics, I have yet to encounter a difficult or unprepared professor and am getting a quality education."
College Freshman,5,"Our public safety comes very quickly as they want to ensure the safety tof every student, and are very reliable in their aid."
College Junior,5,The professors are all very knowledgable and highly educated.  They're willing to help every student but you have to be willing to help yourself.  Classes are fun and engaging because most professors tend to try to promote discussion amongst the class.
College Junior,5,"I love living on campus, I wasn't able to my Freshman year and finally being able to is a lifesaver.  I'm so close to my classes and all of the social events on campus.  A lot of people complain that some of the Residence Halls are older, but honestly there's nothing wrong with them.  Some of the older buildings have thicker walls and bigger rooms than the newer ones, so it's really all about what you make of it."
College Junior,5,"I really love going to Spring Hill, there are a lot of opportunities to truly feel at home here, no matter how far away from home you really are.  The community on the Hill is really fun and tends to be quite engaging, no matter your interests.  I also think it's pretty great that even given the recent terrible events both across the United States and abroad, the school is always communicating with its students and encouraging them to be the change we want to see in the world, and to lend our help to those who need it."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The party scene definitely  impacts the student experience. We love to party with each other and it brings us closer to one another. You don't have to drink to party, everyone always has fun regardless."
Recent Alumnus,5,Weekends at the Fairway Apartments are great! Want to go out for thirsty Thursday? We have a free shuttle to and from downtown!
Recent Alumnus,5,Each department ensures that you reach your maximum potential.
Recent Alumnus,5,Programs in place to make sure students are safe are very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,5,Our professors have great connections to advance you to the level where you want to be.
Recent Alumnus,5,Class size is great! The most I've had in a class has been 32 other classmates. This allows the 13:1 faculty/student ratio.
Recent Alumnus,5,Sexual assault awareness programs have significantly increased to raise awareness on the issue.
Recent Alumnus,5,Greek life is a great balance of your social and academic life.
Recent Alumnus,5,Best college in the state of Alabama!
College Sophomore,5,I believe the Spring Hill College degree pulls so much weight because it is so diverse. The school really forms students who are well rounded in all subjects and have received the best education possible to excel in any area.
College Sophomore,5,"My experience in the classroom has gone far better than I could have ever imagined. The professors are kind-hearted, down to earth individuals who are passionate about the subject they teach and are fully concerned with the student's awareness of it as well. I feel as every professor is not just a teacher, but a friend who I can go to for any advice, academic or not."
College Sophomore,5,I feel completely safe while I am on campus and I am fully confident that public safety is doing their part in order to establish such a safe community.
College Sophomore,5,"I believe Greek life is a great part of campus, often hosting events for not just entertainment, but also for service, just as our Jesuit educations calls us to do."
College Sophomore,5,"This school is amazing not only due to its vibrant atmosphere, but also because the passion for learning and growth can be seen on a daily basis. This school really embodies the Ignatian values, where one can fully be formed into a whole person."
College Sophomore,5,I love my professors. They actually don't treat you like a number they treat you like a person they want to get to know and they want you to learn the material.
College Sophomore,5,We have a very strong Alumni Network that is always hiring student right after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek Life at Spring Hill College makes up 40% of the population of students and we as a greek community raises thousands of dollars each year towards philanthropy. Some fraternities and sororities are know for the social scene, but we like to focus on what will last past our 4 years here in college."
College Sophomore,5,"Spring Hill has not only furthered my education, but has made me a better person. Through our Jesuit identity we believe in the care for the whole person or ""Cura personalis"" meaning we care for the mind, body, and soul. Spring Hill College has developed me into a truly professional young adult that will ""go forth and set the world on fire"" like St. Ignatius said."
College Sophomore,5,I love being able to learn about topics more in-depth than I could in high school. My professors are very knowledgeable about their fields and courses are very educational.
College Sophomore,5,"Spring Hill College is very much like home; I feel welcomed not only by fellow students, but also by teachers and the campus itself. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting."
College Freshman,5,"The school has a wonderful diverse population of students from all over the United States as well as several other countries and continents.  It has a family atmosphere and there are many opportunities to get involved.  There's greek life, sports, numerous clubs including gamin clubs and great opportunities to get involved in community through various service organizations.  Campus ministries is very active and for all faiths and Mobile is a very dynamic city...home to the original and first Mardi Gras!   Spring Hill College is a beautiful campus on a hill overlooking Mobile! I love being a part of this historical Jesuit College and family!"
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved being a part of Spring Hill so far. There are people from all over the world making the campus very diverse. The students, professors, and campus staff are very friendly, it makes the campus a nice place to be. The friendships and memories I have made are unbelievable and if I had to, I would definitely choose Spring Hill all over again!"
College Freshman,5,This school is so unique because it possess a lot of good characteristics and provides a great environment to learn and further my education as an individual. Lastly it provides a great learning experience as I move forward as I grow into the person I want to be.
College Sophomore,5,There are many options for those who want to partake in Greek Life at Spring Hill College. Everyone gets along and they do not exclude others from their activities.
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is amazing. I'm currently in TKE, but all of the fraternities and sororities are great. We hold a lot of community service events and fundraisers throughout the year for our philanthropies. There are no specific greek houses, but they will usually get a few rooms in the apartments that will be labeled as that specific fraternity/sorority's apartment."
College Freshman,5,Party scene is awesome. You always know someone who knows someone that's doing something if you want to go have fun and everyone is pretty friendly.
Freshman,4,"Most of my professors did a great job with the transition to online learning. They provided additional instruction and reduced our course load to fit the new situation. However, I did have one course that I felt dropped the ball. We basically had to learn the rest of the material ourselves, as the professor did not want to use zoom. We had homework checks every week, but other than that, nothing. Every other class, though, I felt did a good job."
Senior,4,A true Jesuit institution that strives to inspire its students and ignite their passion and find their purpose. The class sizes are small to allow for a more direct learning experience for the students.
Freshman,4,"I love the academics at Spring Hill. The classroom environment is definitely small, which is better for me personally. I have had a good experience at Spring Hill so far."
Sophomore,4,Spring Hill is very welcoming to all kinds. The only thing I'd like to see changed is the price of attendance.
Senior,4,"If I could go back in time to when I was deciding which college to attend, I would choose Spring Hill every time!"
Freshman,4,"In my experience, it is difficult to get money for clubs and sports scholarships, but there have been a lot of structural changes recently. One of the changes was the outside of the chapel, while the front of the campus, near the baseball field, has something going on with plants. The food is sometimes good, but usually average or a bit less than. The people here tend to be nice, or at least decent, but there are some questionable people (like there are everywhere). I enjoy how the faculty teaches, especially in sociology and honors English classes. I wish that the roads would be repaved in certain areas, but that isn't likely to happen anytime soon. I am a commuter student, which isn't great, but I have heard from some of my friends that some of the dorms can be pretty terrible."
Freshman,4,This college is great for a small one. Everyone is so nice and friendly. It's very diverse with people of every nationality. The classes are small which is great for actually learning. The sports are some of the best of the conference and the coaches are wonderful.
Senior,4,I like how small Spring Hill is because it makes everyone feel more connected to each other. This makes us watch out for each other more. My only complaint with the college is how much everything here cost.
Senior,4,I have had a positive experience so far at Spring Hill College. Friendly people around including the faculty. Class sizes are small enough for everyone to be part of the everyday activities and helps build positive relationships with everyone.
Junior,4,"Spring Hill College is a great school if you are looking for a small classroom size, one on one relationships with your professors, and a close-knit community. On campus, you know most people, or at least most faces. But, this also means everyone also knows all of your business. It is both amazing when in a positive way, but also can be stifling when everyone is talking about what you did this weekend and knows what you ate for all three meals that day."
Sophomore,4,"Spring Hill is smaller therefore, you class size just right for teacher/student ratio. The campus is accessible by walking no need to drive to any class and everyone so family oriented. It’s a wonderful home away from home."
Senior,4,I like that Sprig Hill is a Jesuit College that takes pride in providing a holistic education. One thing that I wish the college would improve on is diversifying the student body by expanding their recruiting.
Sophomore,4,"I really like Spring Hill College. It is a small campus, so everything is in walking distance. The professors like for you succeed, so go to office hours. Everyone is great on the campus. I would like to see more of a preference in food choice, but in all it's good."
Junior,4,"Academics and teaching staff are great, and I couldn't be happier with the quality of education I am receiving. However, the treatment of student athletes, specifically female athletes, is appalling. The women's rugby team is being kicked off campus due to the school no longer wanting the liability or the financial commitment of the team."
Freshman,4,Spring Hill has a great support system that ensures success. Campus life can get a little boring due to lack of events. Not a very diverse campus.
College Sophomore,4,People are really enthusiastic about being diverse
College Sophomore,4,Helpful teachers and students in all classes.
College Junior,4,The school is pretty diverse and the school itself works hard to maintain diversity and celebrate it.
College Junior,4,"As far as colleges go I think Spring Hill is relatively chill as far as drugs and alcohol go.  There are parties, clearly, but they've been getting more and more tame as the years go.  The school works hard to ensure everyone's safety."
College Junior,4,"I can only speak for my major but I already have an internship, and all it took was me discussing it with my professors.  Most of the professors at Spring Hill are very well connected and that makes things easier.  I also, personally, have heard that a degree from Spring Hill will open a lot of doors whether your interests are graduate school or careers."
College Junior,4,"I feel so safe walking around campus, and I walk around frequently at night.  The campus is so small that it feels close to the Public Safety officers regardless of where you are, and they're always available for calls.  Even if you're just suspicious of something.  The RAs on Duty are also available to help you with anything at night, all you have to do is call."
College Junior,4,"I'm not involved in Greek Life, but quite a few of my friends are and they really enjoy and promote the experience.  But, there isn't much animosity between Greeks and non-Greeks.  We all get along pretty great and all of the events still involve everyone, not just Greek Life members.  I also love that the Greek Life is so involved with charity!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"We are all a family with some disagreements, but a family nonetheless."
Recent Alumnus,4,Housing is great with the exception of the housing process.
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy all the perks of living on campus. It truly allows the student to get involved on campus more frequently, as well as experiencing living with some great people where one can foster meaningful relationships."
College Sophomore,4,"Speaking from a student athlete, I believe the athletic environment on campus is serious, but it also allows the athlete to involve themselves in other activities, so there whole college career isn't absorbed by their sport."
College Sophomore,4,I have only lived on campus for a year so far and it was very nice.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics is very important to Spring Hill although we do not have a football team so that is the only downfall to them.
College Junior,4,"it's pretty good, though i'm sure our parties do not compare to other schools."
College Junior,4,our campus is very diverse and most everyone is accepting of each other's views
College Sophomore,4,Spring Hill is a small school so crime rate  in general is very low and the security is very good.
College Sophomore,4,"I am so happy at my school. The people there are amazing, and the faculty and staff are there to always help you."
College Sophomore,4,It's quite easy to get internships. Networking is great because of the alums from the school who are willing to help current students any way they can.
College Sophomore,4,"Public safety is available 24/7, and they're only one call away. It takes them very quickly to get to a destination."
College Sophomore,4,"There's a nice fanbase for the sports teams. Volleyball, basketball, soccer, and baseball are well-attended. Rugby is a club sport, but it is very popular on campus. Could easily be mistaken as a varsity sport."
College Sophomore,4,"Because it's a small school, it's super easy to get involved and make your name known on campus. There's people from all over the country, which makes the experience even better."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is active and involved on campus.
College Freshman,4,not too big on greek life but friends seem to enjoy
College Sophomore,4,So far all my classes have been small with engaging and interpersonal professors. If there's a single reason to come here it should be academics
College Freshman,4,"If all you want from a college is an education, then this is a great place. The courses available and the classes are rich and wonderful. The teachers, for the most part, are great and engaging. The price is outrageous, though, and there's a very specific social scene, filled with preppy people. I would not go again, given the opportunity."
College Sophomore,4,"We have the teaching and people to beat help prevent campus crime. I feel very safe walking around campus alone, though I do feel slightly less safe while walking around at night."
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are great! The professors are really cool and super helpful with class work or if you are struggling in a class they are more than willing to help you or help you find more help!
College Sophomore,4,"We don't have houses for our sororities or fraternities. I have many friends who are not members of Greek life but still come to the parties and don't think of us as bad people. It isn't paying for friends as one freshman has posted already. Greek life brings more parties around campus and you can always count on a friend in Greek life, whether you are a part of it or not, to bring a large group of people to support you in any event!"
College Junior,4,"Spring Hill College has given me the tools to think critically, and how to properly read and study in order to succeed."
College Senior,4,"I love the people. There is a real community here at ""Sprill"". We all share similar experiences with classes and events. You can access your professor easily. There aren't any lines to wait in to see them just for one question. They are conveniently available."
College Junior,4,I love the Campus. It is so beautiful and helps create a welcoming atmosphere. In my first two years I have made life time friends. The professors are the best and work hard to help all students.
College Sophomore,4,"The party scene at Spring Hill College is very good for those of age to partake in drinking. If you do not drink, there are still lots of people who party in other ways as well."
College Sophomore,4,"I actually live off of campus, and I love it. I've helped many of my friends find much cheaper options near Spring Hill College."
College Sophomore,4,There are various local hot spots that are usually full of college students. The cost of the dining is pretty average and the quality of food is great!
College Sophomore,4,I love the administration at Spring Hill College. They are strict on issues that trouble most colleges such as drinking and drug abuse. They care about the students enough to enforce their rules on us with great diligence.
College Freshman,4,"The school is expensive, as any small liberal arts school, however they do a pretty good job of helping out any way they can. If you're in good standing in your academics you'll usually get a decent grant. Don't expect much from sports if you're an athlete. They are just now transitioning to division 2, so they are still trying to get things settled scholarship wise."
College Freshman,4,"Dorms are pretty nice depending in the building you choose. The freshman dorms are are ok, Toolen is a bit far from everything, but if you don't mind a walk they have the best community out of the freshman dorms. Social Atmosphere is what you'd expect from a small school, you pretty much get to know everyone from just walking around."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is being part of a community of badgers(the mascot). While it is expensive, everyone is pretty cool."
College Sophomore,4,There are not many safety officers here but the few we have do their best to make this a safe campus.
College Sophomore,4,The administration does a good job when they do something but they don't always intervene with certain things.
College Sophomore,4,The gym at this school is pretty well maintained and has quite a few options for students. The athletic department seems to be pretty strong and they care about their athletes.
College Sophomore,4,"I love attending sporting events, but it is not a huge deal around campus because we are such a small school."
College Sophomore,4,I like the Mobile area and would definitely consider living there after graduation.  I have found that there is plenty to do and explore with my friends.
College Sophomore,4,I find dorm living very enjoyable especially if you are able to live with your best friends.
College Sophomore,4,"I love being Greek!  I think it was a great idea now that I am a part of a fraternity, although I don't think that it was absolutely necessary because our school is so small.  I get to hang out with Greek life whether I am affiliated or not"
Sophomore,2,"Spring Hill College's potential to be a great college has suffocated under the weight of an administration plagued by mismanagement, miscommunication and sheer incompetence. The College's poor financial footing has resulted from such failings and has deprived students of opportunities for campus involvement and better living conditions. There is an unusual degree of negativity among the students and faculty about the College. For instance, in 2019 a professor at the College hung posters in multiple buildings around campus which openly criticized the College's striping of professor benefits while maintaining the upkeep on a golf course. He was terminated by SHC when discovered to have been the culprit. Another professor constantly berates the Administration on Facebook. Also, students wear clothes which bare the logos of other colleges, and rarely wear that with Spring Hill's name/logo. Most importantly, the lion's share of students don't share a passion for academic rigor."
College Freshman,2,"A lot people came from private schools in New Orleans or just Louisiana in general, causing it to already be cliquey. The food in the cafeteria is awful... how do you mess up pasta?? The parties are awful and theres nothing off campus to do on the weekends. It is way better if you have a car on campus. If not, you're stranded. The school is completely different than advertised. It feels extremely small, too. Overall, the school is only good for athletes and for people who are REALLY in touch with their faith."
College Freshman,2,The softball field is the most pitiful looking college softball field you will ever see. We have to miss classes because we don't have lights on our field. We would be able to attend more classes and schedule practices around our schedule if we had lights on our field. It's a joke.
College Freshman,2,The school is unhelpful and there is no diversity.
College Sophomore,2,Springhill kids can only be found in numbers at one bar and only on Thursday nights when a trolly takes them downtown.
College Sophomore,2,SHC kids don't go out much. They have parties in the on campus apartments alot but most are pretty lame
College Sophomore,2,"As being a member of the women's varsity soccer team, I can tell you that our locker rooms and athletic trainers room are well below what they should be. Our athletic department is also not that great, we have had 3 coaches within a year. Our team works together rather well but our fan support is quite poor."
College Freshman,2,"The students are obnoxious, the building is always unclean. The RA never does her job, and ignores texts. No one is supervising. There is always trash cluttered in the halls. The bathrooms are very gross. It's overall a sucky living space."
College Freshman,2,It's basically paying for friends at our school.
College Junior,2,"They have good/fun activities SOMETIMES. It's small, very expensive. The professors and other students are super friendly and helpful. Like I said it's small so you build bonds fast. The cafe is great and the campus restaurant is really good. Everything else, though, is just not worth it to me to go here. This is a very basic school, too basic to cost so much."
College Junior,2,Good at times and bad at other times. There are not many options to choose from since it is a small campus. Students mostly try to eat out when the food is not good.
College Senior,2,"No one parks ""off campus"" at spring hill. The parking on campus is also pretty limited."
College Sophomore,2,"Cali girl expereincing hurricanes, tropical muggy weather and this year ice storm closed campus for 2 days"
College Freshman,2,"Spring Hill is located in Mobile, Alabama, the rainiest city in the U.S. Point made."
College Sophomore,2,"Although we recently got new computers, how useful are they when the internet connection is so slow at least in the dorms they are. However, the computer lab and the library that houses computers are very nice facilities. Printing is good. I much rather prefer the convience of having my own computer. Overall the computers are good, but it could use some improvement."
College Junior,2,"The Girls and Guys in My School Are Seclusive. The individuals in this school seclude themselves in groups. This is psychologically not good for those who are not within a group because individuals within these groups say bad things against those who are not in their group. Many people seem cold and unfriendly. I've sometimes say hello to a few individuals and they do not respond. If you find some nice people who will talk and stick with you, then it is okay."
College Junior,2,"Mobile is tied with Seattle for being the rainiest city in the Nation, so rain boots are a solid investment. It can get extremely hot and humidity is a common occurrence."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Apartment central. Mobile has a new building site for just apartments alone almost every week. The apartments are beautiful but now they are priced between $800-$1,000 +. That is ridiculous! I thought our cost of leaving was supposed to be reasonable. I am a full time student so I do not really have the time to work a great job full time. The cheaper apartments are occupied or not in a safe neighborhood. What do I do? I have to live somewhere."
College Senior,2,All male sports are funded more than female sports.
Sophomore,1,"I was enrolled in eighteen hours when the Spring semester abruptly transitioned to so-called ""online learning."" Professors chose to assign additional term papers to count in place of attendance and participation (which would be earned through just attending class), and only one class had an online discussion (not lecture) over Zoom -- and that occurred just once. For the tuition and fees SHC charged, it was as lousy an education as one might expect from Trump University. Also, the College is not reimbursing room-and-board fees (and you can forget about a discounted tuition), but instead is giving a credit of 30% of room-and-board fees for the following semester (which many students don't qualify for, due to transitioning to off-campus housing). Be warned: SHC is hostile when it comes to giving money back and will straight up ignore your emails. #lawsuitwaitingtohappen."
Alum,1,I hated my time at Spring Hill so much that I transferred. The administration of this school does not care about students. The facilities are falling apart even though most students pay out of pocket to attend.
Niche User,1,"If you are interested in joining things just to put it on your resume, go ahead, but the workload is a ton. The required religious courses are taught by nut jobs and the lower level courses could be passed by a 6 year old.
The school is also located between two horrible roads. It is dangerous just to enter and leave campus bc of all the traffic! 
The students talk about partying more than they do their own schoolwork..
There is hardly anything to do besides sports and sorority. 
The clubs are horribly put together. No good basis or reliability.
And most importantly, the guidance counselors were absolutely horrible. One of them made me feel like I was the issue and that I was just seeing things wrongly or something, i don’t even remember because it was such terrible advice. I wish I could erase my time there from my memory. You can’t order your transcript online, you have to scan or send a letter with a form filled out stating you want your transcript."
Niche User,1,"Horrible college. It’s only beautiful, that’s it. People fake being friendly and caring, both students and staff. I had the absolute worst time of my life here and it pains me to think about it so much that I have to block out all the memories. Just a bunch of partying rich kids. Teachers suck too. God that theology professor.. damn just a crazy man. 
The food was horrible!
Don’t even get me started on the dorms.... the washing machines never worked. 
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
College Freshman,1,Residence life is the worst.
College Freshman,1,"freshman dorms suck, they refuse to upgrade or remodel"
College Sophomore,1,The food is good once every week.
College Sophomore,1,There is no campus transportation
College Sophomore,1,"We Can't Live Off Campus – you can only be a commuter if you live within 60 miles of the school. They're strict about this policy, so commuters are few and far between."
College Freshman,1,"Am I Still 16? Another very reason I don't reccomend coming here is: you are NEVER allowed to live off campus, you must live in a dorm, eat in the cafeteria and follow a dinky RA's rules all four years.  Most people in their early 20's are not interested in living in a dorm where they have to follow petty rules (no persons of the opposite sex allowed in your dorm after 11pm) at risk of being written up and fined by the RA.  I feel like I'm in high school all over again, except in high school I didn't have to pay out the ass for room and board for four years.  I basically live off campus with my boyfriend at his apartment, but I still pay $11k to have my name on a residence hall list.  Waste of money.  And to be exempt from living on campus you either have to have parents that live right by school or have a serious medical illness that would be a hazard to others if you lived in the dorm.  Oh, and you have to present your case to a committee that will decide if your medical illness is a big enough hazard that they are willing to lose your $11k a year.  And you will have to present your embarrassing illness to be regranted permission to live off campus each year and if you're suspected of lying, you will be punished by however the committee feels is appropriate.  THIS IS BULLS***... I know no other school that requires students live on campus, and you should not be punished for not wanting to live here."
College Freshman,1,"When I visited, the tour guides gave me the illusion that this school was academically rigorous, prestigious and it seemed like a nice place; it feels like a resort with the tropical Gulf Coast weather and the abundance of palm trees on campus. The school definitely has a nice ambiance, students and faculty are overall very nice and approachable people but, I'd still give the overall student life a D.  There is just no nightlife or fun things to do on campus; apparently there used to be, but ""all the fun people graduated last spring.""  Mobile is a small, boring city and the downtown area is a pathetic excuse for nightlife and is usually pretty dead.  There is one ""club"" (i.e. a super trashy bar with a dingy 9X9 dancefloor with a stripper pole) and a few bars that serve minors, but I was bored of the downtown scene after about a month of being here.  I think being in a sorority or fraternity helps assuage the endemic boredom on campus, but they're expensive to join ($700 a semester) and the perks are limited (you don't even get to live in a house)."
College Sophomore,1,"There is a vaiety of food, but the taste of the food is not very good."
College Sophomore,1,"Get Help Fast – It's an over $40,000 school and financial aid is beyond helping anyone. They can try to help but being a private school they keep as much money as they can regardless the consequences. Financial aid for this school would be a miracle."
College Sophomore,1,"Food on the Hill – Not only is the pricing for the meal plan ridiculous but they said they'd improve their food but they may have only improved the kitchen. The food is worse than before, and usually has some unsettling side affects to ones stomach. Breakfast is Always the same thing and lunch somehow gets magically turned into dinner. The only positive is that at certain points there is a good day with good food but its very rare."

College Junior,1,"Even though Spring Hill College pulls in students from all over America it is not incredibly diverse. There are mostly southern white students who aren't too open to other ethnic students. Many hispanic friends who I have from Miami and Orlando feel completely segregated by some students on campus because of their ethnicity. Even though the school is increasing in racial diversity, the way many students think regarding race is not very open."

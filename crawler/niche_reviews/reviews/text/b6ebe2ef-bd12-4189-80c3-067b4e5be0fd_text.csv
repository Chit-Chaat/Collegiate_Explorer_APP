Graduate Student,5,"This college really turned my career around. I got the BA in Electrical engineering Technology, current working for the department of defense in air to aur refueling technologies.I am an electrical technician, with prospects of becoming a mechanical engineer. I cleared 80k the first year i worked there out of college. Its a rare degree, people jump at the chance to hire you, if your into electricsl and your hard working, this school is for you. Also a buddy I went with makes 100k+ as a relay tech"
Junior,1,"Ever since the new owners the school has gone down hill. They only care about money, not your education. They are even staying open despite the corona virus pandemic. That just proves they do not care about the students. I wouldn't recommend this school because, they only care about money, the labs are shotty at best, and when it comes time to give you your money from student loans they always have an excuse why they dont have it yet. In conclusion DO NOT go here"
Alum,1,"I attended Hamilton in 2009, I believe. It was the most frustrating time of my life, honestly. My ""teacher"" should have been fired years before. She had her favorites and called us "" heffers"", talked about finding a ""chocolate boyfriend"" and had it in for several of us. I also was brought up before one of the staff when I did NOTHING WRONG. I felt like I was in prison and couldn't defend myself at all. I was NEVER so happy to get out of a ""school"" in my life. I absolutely do not recommend this school at ALL! I wish I could give it zero stars!"

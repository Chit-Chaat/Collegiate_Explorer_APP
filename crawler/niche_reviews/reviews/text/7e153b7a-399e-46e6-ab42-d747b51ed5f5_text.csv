Freshman,5,"Online learning has been a difficult experience, but with the software provided l am about to keep in touch with my professors."
Freshman,5,So far so good! Eastern shore is a hbcu in maryland. I’ve made many good memories here. I was excited to get a scholarship.
Junior,5,I am currently signed up for classes in the fall that will be online. I am hoping that my experience with online classes will be good. I previously took a course at UMES that was online and it went well.
Alum,5,Amazing. Very recommended. Great experience. School spirit is amazing. Lots of organizations to join. Administration and alumni affairs do a great job. The campus is very friendly. Students work together and support each other.

Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman in the fall 2020.  I have not have the experience for online learning.  in high school, I did online learning for my last quarter because of Coronavirus-19."
Freshman,5,"When I came to the school for a tour, it was a beautiful experience.  The tour guide was very informative and showed places of interest that I like.  The dorms, the campus ground, and the academic buildings was great.  The people I met were happy and nice.  My overall experience was GREAT!!"
Sophomore,5,Each of the teachers went through presentations well which made it easy to receive the information. Also were available for extra class calls or emails whenever something was not understood or heard.
Niche User,5,I am enrolling in the spring I think I will do great things in the fall in my field of computer science
Niche User,5,"University of Maryland Eastern Shore made my feel at home and ready to apply and move in the moment I stepped on that campus. Overall, my experience was 5 stars. The professors go above and beyond to make sure that the students receive the best understanding of the topics so they can go on to be the best version of themselves."
Freshman,5,So far I have attending UMES for four months now and I've been having the time of my life. The people I've met and the friends I made really made the experience priceless and if possible I would love to attend the UMES full time through out four years.
Freshman,5,"being away from home was a slight fear of mine I didn't know what things were going to be like but umes really made me feel at home. the café served meals that were filmier to me and were delicious. the staff were welcoming, helpful and encouraged me to stride for better."
Senior,5,i love umes. i been here all 4 years of my college career. i been involved in several student clubs. I love the family feel here at my HBCU.
Freshman,5,It’s honestly been a great first year . Anybody would be lucky to go that school an experience what a HBCU truly is.
Freshman,5,I really like my campus its an overall safe environment. There's just not a good verity of food  its almost the same thing everyday. The housing rules are outrageous .
Junior,5,"I like the University overall I love the location of the school , the campus size and class sizes. I like that professors know your name and can better help you based off your weakness vs being at a bigger university where you are just a number. I would change the college events make the campus more social."
Freshman,5,"I attended a summer program there and I loved the organization of he program.
Excellent Teachers and staff. The environment was safe, the living quarters were great. I will be attending this university in two weeks. I am glade the program found me"
Niche User,5,the staff is very helpful and friendly. they genuinely care about the education and safety of the students. the students are very relatable and you create a bond with them.
Freshman,5,UMES is a great college. The location is great to focus on studies and not so much whats going on around the campus. It offers a short drive to Salisbury MD where you can enjoy recreational activities & partying.
Freshman,5,My experience at Umes has been one to remember i have met a lot of good people and i am well connected.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy UMES and their encouragement to join the school and become a Hawk. I would change the staff/faculty's help to keep their students on track with the correct courses, basically more advisement from the advisors."
Freshman,5,"My experience here at university of Maryland Eastern shore has been a great one so far, though am still a freshman. But I have enjoyed every moment"
Senior,5,"Eastern Shore is a great school, you make your college experience what you want it to be don't just depend on the school to make college worth wild."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the University of Maryland Eastern Shore for the diverse atmosphere. At this university, I have been able to gain new experiences and connections through different opportunities that the university has had to offer."
Freshman,5,From what I saw at eastern shore during my times there was actually  good. The school was very diverse and good in student life. I heard that the professors were excellent and the school was one of the top ten in the state.
Junior,5,"I am a current student enrolled at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES).Majoring in Kinesiology, health and fitness concentration. Overall, my three years at the UMES has been a great experience. I love this HBCU because it is very small and a family university. I honestly wouldn't change anything about UMES."
Niche User,5,i used to go to umes and i enjoyed my time there i wold have went back but plans went otherwise i will go back to visit
Sophomore,5,University of Maryland Eastern Shore is a great school to attend for exercise science. any new people to meet and great education.
Freshman,5,"The university of Maryland eastern shore is a great hbcu, it's more of a a community and a family before it is a college. Here at the university we welcome everyone you automatically become our family and friend. The professors are here for you and do a great job of making every student feel welcomed and do an amazing job of making sure everyone is on great track and has an understanding of what is being taught. I hope you consider the university of Maryland eastern shore for we would love to welcome you."
College Freshman,5,Everyone works hard to insure you have a job
College Freshman,5,Here at UMES the school really cares for their students.
College Junior,5,I feel like i am going to perfect my craft at this school
College Junior,5,There are a range of different students here
College Junior,5,I have had alot fun and help being sucessful in my major i had peers help me be the best i can be
College Junior,5,Not into the party scene.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe at my school and find no threat by the student body. Everyone one is cool and to themselves the university does a good job at protecting its students, I respect that."
College Junior,5,The parties are great. There are multiple parties going on from Thursday to Saturday so the students have plenty of options.
College Junior,5,The nightlife at our school is great. Especially from Thursday to Saturday nights. That is when the partying starts.
College Junior,5,"The school diversity is the best. Majority of our professors are Muslim or African. However, as a whole the staff and students are all from different ethnic backgrounds. Also, they are events for students for their religion beliefs such as bible study, gospel concert, and a chapel on campus."
College Junior,5,"The academics is the best. The professors are understandable and supportive. The registration process is very easy to do. The workload is heavy but can be manageable depends on the student. Also, they are plenty of study areas around campus for study groups to meet or just for an individual."
College Junior,5,"The career prospect is the best They school website have an internships column so students can see the internships that are available. Also, they have them posted on the bulletin board around campus. The school also have a career fair every semester so the students can attend to."
College Junior,5,My overall experience is the best. i build a good bond with my professors and adviser. They are very supportive and we can talk about anything when i visit their office hours. Mostly taking about their experiences with college and tips on how they got through it.
College Junior,5,The security on campus is great. They are security guards in every dorm at night and the campus police are at every post on campus.
College Junior,5,Love my apartment and my dorm I was housed in clean and comfortable
College Sophomore,5,Having financial aid is the best because it saves your family money on your school and its best if you fill out applications for them early every year.
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe on campus, even during the nights."
College Freshman,5,Huge amount of school spirit is shown.
College Sophomore,5,we need greek housing available but its cool
College Sophomore,5,it has been very helpful.
College Freshman,5,"The strictness is okay I guess you could say. It is lenient in some matters. I'm unaware on policies about parties but they always get shut down, ALWAYS. Were in college, we would like to have fun sometime."
College Freshman,5,"My school always have different activities on campus to make the campus fun, they are a lot of store around for student to go buy food stuff they need"
College Freshman,5,"Its the best place to live when you are attending college because its more bigger, safe, cleaner,"
College Freshman,5,"The safety and security of this is is very important, because everywhere you go they are camera monitoring the area for any crime, and if a student is not feeling safe on campus the could go to the offices around the campus and they could help them."
College Freshman,5,The athletics at my school are one of the best in maryland. Therefor a lot of the student in my school go to support them in there home games .
College Sophomore,5,you get lots of choices to choose from
College Freshman,5,Greeks are amazing..they hosted many events this past semester..probates were long. They are fun to hang out with and one kappa in particular inspired me to keep on going through school.
College Sophomore,5,I would not choose any other college to go to
College Sophomore,5,I like my major because this is what I want to do in life. And with my major I can make my goal which is helping people and making them well again
Recent Alumnus,5,"One thing that my university is amazing upon, is its diversity. There are so many students from different ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, races, origins that it creates a huge melting pot. There are tons of organizations and events that magnifies the diversity that we see on campus."
College Freshman,5,I love my school. It does what it's supposed to do. I learn a lot and it's not difficult and it's close to home. 
Junior,4,"As a transfer student, overall the process was quite easy. A lot of the academic professionals reached out to me in regards to my application process. It was difficult getting in touch with someone during COVID because no one was in the office. I did not get assigned a financial aid advisor even after getting in touch with CAAS. I also had difficulty getting credits transferred as well."
Junior,4,Online classes are typically self guided and the instructors are very helpful when it comes to online curriculum.
Junior,4,UMES is a diverse school in a hidden location that provides a good experience if you're actively involved in campus/community activities.
Freshman,4,"fall 2019 was my first year at college and it was very fun and exciting I enjoyed it a lot. honestly, I wouldn't change anything about my experience one bit. the people I met and all the professor I got I meet really left an impact on my life. in the future year to come I plan on joining an organization on campus."
Sophomore,4,My experiences were great here. Everyone one of the staff members made it their mission to help you become as successful as you possibly could.
Freshman,4,What i would like to see change at Easter Shore is the different programs here like maybe add Civil engineering to the academics because that is something that i would really like to do in college.
Freshman,4,"It allowed me to connect with people who looked like me as an African American person and to learn from and perform new experiences with said people. There's always something that is taking place on campus whether it be a cultural event, a seminar on dealing with school, a pie-throwing contest, or a fundraiser or charity event. The professors and faculty all seem to put genuine thought and care into educating their students and ensuring their success."
Freshman,4,"UMES is a very great school. The professors are great, everyone on campus is friendly. I feel very safe on campus and there is always an event going on every week. No one is left out at UMES. I love it there."
Freshman,4,Academic/ professors are wonderful.   Campus life not the best.  I’m not much for parties and campus life is one big party.
Niche User,4,"Staff and faculty are friendly and very helpful. The environment is friendly due to the area that the campus is located in. Since the campus is said to be ""in the middle of no where"", most of the students know of each other. The food overall is good and they have a variety of choices. 15 minutes away from the campus is the 'city' where we can go shopping and to go eat. Also about 45 minutes away is Ocean City so there is always something to do on and off campus. They offer a variety of clubs and sports that students are always encouraged to participate in. Academics is pushed upon the students and help is always offered by advisors and even the professors who are willing to help students who want to seek improvement and success in doing so."
Sophomore,4,"I come from Silver Spring, MD, a seemingly more progressive area, however I have a unique appreciation for the Princess Anne, Maryland area. While many students are not fond of the serene environment, I have been able to make UMES my home away from home. UMES is a tight knit community that makes students like me feel at home and not easily overwhelmed. It is a school that openly represents their HBCU pride. The event committee does a great job to plan all inclusive events for students on campus to ensure that we all interact with eachother and feel confident in our school. The professors that I have encountered go above and beyond for their students; it is clear they genuinely want their pupils to succeed. The only concern I have for UMES are their food options for students. I would suggest that in the future, UMES incorporates a more versatile menu for people who don't eat meat. All in all, my experience with UMES has been a great one. I am blessed to be a HAWK FOR LIFE!!!"
Freshman,4,The campus was very opening and very welcoming to all of its new admitted students. It made it feel like all the students were at a new home. All the majors here are also pretty good and it has a great communication staff. They even offer one on one help to students such as 1 on 1 with professor which makes it very convenient to struggling students that probably don't understand what is going on in class.
Niche User,4,"My experience at Eastern Shore was great my first and only semester. Due to financial issues, I could not go back unfortunately. But I had met a lot of interesting people and there were people on campus who looked forward to my success."
Junior,4,"University of Maryland Eastern Shore is an interesting experience. For a Historically Black College, it is open to other ethnicities. There tutors are pretty help too."
Freshman,4,"My first semester at the illustrious University of Maryland Eastern Shore was honestly one to remember. I was very nervous about starting my new journey in college. UMES taught me so much within such little time. I would like to see a change in the organization when it comes to some of the departments, but other than that, I'm really glad that I chose a university that feels like home. Go Hawks!"
Sophomore,4,Eastern Shore is one of the best HBCU's in Maryland. Very different from other campuses as far as surroundings. One of the best schools for Criminal Justice. They have great resources but they don't always share their resources effectively.
Graduate Student,4,I felt that my undergraduate status was the best. I enjoyed learning about serving the clients I would later have. The field experience was a great opportunity for my growth in dealing with future clients.
Sophomore,4,I’m going to be a sophomore this year and so far it’s been a bumpy ride. From crazy roommates to teachers not willing to help my freshman year was a little rough but I wouldn’t change it for the world (except for the grades)😅.
Junior,4,This university has so much to offer but considering it’s demographic it isn’t at its best. I have enjoyed my current years here due to the adjustment from the fast paced civilization that I’m used to. Administration could be better as with other things. Though every college has its faults. Overall an experience I’ll never forget.
Sophomore,4,"As a current student of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, after a year of taking classes there, I've only experienced a small fraction of what is to offer on and off campus. Thankfully, I have 3 more years to fully get the #umes experience."
Graduate Student,4,I enjoy being apart of this school. Teachers are very helpful and responsive. It is a great learning atmosphere.
Junior,4,I transferred here from new york and over all the school is good I have had many opportunities at this school i think school spirit should be worked on however.
Sophomore,4,"I am thankful for the opportunities I have been given and the memories that I have made at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. During my first year, I was challenged academically, made great friends, and was even able to participate in a study abroad trip to the Dominican Republic. 

In terms of campus life and the administration, there are several changes that need to be made. One of the biggest issues on our campus is the food. It is below par and disappointing a majority of the time. School spirit also lacks severely, and the inability to do a lot both on campus and in the surrounding area also tends to drive people away from the University. 

With all that said, I am genuinely enjoying myself. My friends have made my experience so special, and I  am so happy that I decided to attend this University. I hope that necessary changes will be made during my next three years to improve the school to where it needs to be."
Freshman,4,"I liked the dorm rooms, the food was okay and the students were able to travel to their classes. Seemed like easy access."
Senior,4,"This is a beautiful campus with many amenities. Whether you are looking for a club to join or you need tutoring help after class, UMES has the resources available to help any student learn and understand the material given. Above all, it is one of the cheapest colleges to attend.

Transfer students should take precaution, the Office of the Registrar are difficult to work with. It is advised that any transfer student should frequently check the status of his or her transferred credits and keep a paperwork folder from day one."
Freshman,4,"My experience at UMES has been great. I’ve always been somewhat shy, but being in college has helped me a lot. I have now broke out of my shell, I’ve been able to meet new people and life is just great staying on campus."
Sophomore,4,I like how the professors actually care about the students and want to ensure that they are able to pass the class and eventually graduate.
Senior,4,I like the school but I feel that thee should be more resources for students to learn more hands on.
Sophomore,4,"That is a really good place to focus on, teachers are great they want you to succeed. I would like that the school have some more healthy and tasty food."
Senior,4,"Being A senior, I can reflect back to the very first time I committed to UMES not knowing the emotional rollercoaster I would go on.Being at UMES has taught me college is what you make it. From the outside looking in, UMES is an unpleasant school to be at in the middle of nowhere. Now that I am very close to graduating, I now see that UMES was a school that overall taught me very valuable lessons on myself and how to interact with individuals in a professional manner. UMES taught me how to never take no for an answer, fight for what you believe in, and anything is possible with a little help form the school."
Freshman,4,"At the University of Maryland Eastern Shore my experience was great. I enjoyed myself on campus the faculty and staff were very friendly and helpful. The diversity on campus is noticeable but there is no one person I feel that is left out. The campus safety is always on top of things, it keeps us in the loop of what's going on at the campus ."
Freshman,4,Great HBCU to attend. Professor are there for you if you need help and this school has a good fashion merchandising program
Sophomore,4,"My experience at University of Maryland Eastern Shore was fun. I like the people and the environment. Some people say the school is boring  or its nothing to do  but in my opinion you have to make your college experience fun. The food could have been a lot better, they had some of the same food every other day which wasn't good at all. Personally I love the the school and I plan on staying there all 4 years."
Freshman,4,"This university is really good. They have most of the majors you would want, they even ave some majors that other colleges don't. The teachers are good and it's fun to be here. I would like for there to more things to do that everyone would enjoy doing, not just a select few."
Freshman,4,"I like this school because the professors here are very friendly and seem to actually care about us, the students. In high school I never had that feeling it was almost like the teachers only showed up merely because of their check. I would change the fact that they make us pay for literally everything because I'm struggling financially."
Sophomore,4,"University of Maryland Eastern Shore is a very close-knit, diverse and peaceful community filled with pride and ambition . It offers a variety of programs for both undergraduates and graduates. This school is a home away from home and it is an escape from hustle and bustle of suburban and urban life."
Freshman,4,"Driving into University of Maryland Eastern Shore campus for move in day was a bittersweet moment. As I became more open minded about the campus and what it has to offer me, I became more of a member of the school. UMES is an overall well rounded school and is all of what you make it while your are there. I plan on making the best out of my experience there. HAWK PRIDE...CATCH IT!"
Freshman,4,"My overall experience so far at this University has been exciting, knowledgeable, and life enhancing. I've learned a lot about myself, the staff, and students. They are very polite and considerate toward you and your long term goals. I have and would recommend this school to many people without a doubt."
Freshman,4,I love my hbcu. There is some growing that needs to be done. But I am fine with growing with it. I feel as though school unity should be embraced more.
College Freshman,4,It has a great balance of school work and partying.
College Freshman,4,The school has a lot opportunities but dont make it easy for students to know where to find them.
College Freshman,4,The housing is good but could be very far from class depending on where u stay.
College Freshman,4,Cant wait to be a Kappa.
College Freshman,4,UMES has been a great experience for me so far. Some of my professors could be more helpful and involved with the students but other than its been great.
College Freshman,4,There hasn't been an incident to really base my opinion on but that must mean it's great. I've seen many bulletins offering people to talk to in these situations and people are interested.
College Freshman,4,The housing is good. They offer off-campus housing options too
Sophomore,4,"The university of Maryland has many opportunities for ""go-getter"" students. They provide help academically and their academic coaches advisers and staff personnel give great advice, and help with many things even outside the campus."
College Senior,4,Racism and discrimination still exist....handle it with maturely and with a sense of humor.
College Senior,4,There is always room for improvement
College Senior,4,There's always room for improvement...
College Freshman,4,From what I've seen the facilities look nice and generally new.
College Sophomore,4,The school I attend is very interesting. It is unique because it is an HBCU. They occasionally host events that attract you to new opportunities. My favorite experience was attending our 2016 Homecoming Concert because it gave the chance to interact with many students along with musical entertainment.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on my campus
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe walking around my campus
College Sophomore,4,"My school gets the students involved , makes learning in a cool way for adults . I really like it"
College Sophomore,4,Professors are helpful and quality is pretty good and class size is okay
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is very dedicated in making life on campus fun
College Sophomore,4,"I would not transfer, i will be receiving my degree from UMES"
College Sophomore,4,I liked all of my professors.
College Sophomore,4,This is only because I lived by myself during these years. I don't know about other people.
Senior,2,The University of Maryland Eastern Shore is not what it is all hyped up to be. It's a nice university to get away from home but be prepared to have no type of off-campus fun activities to enjoy throughout the week as well as on the weekends.
Freshman,2,"UMES is an ""ok"" school. The administration of the school could do a lot of things to make the school better. The administration is too strict on the students & does not allow them to have a full college experience."
College Freshman,2,We don't even have a football team and the football club was cancelled for my first semester of school.
College Freshman,2,The Greek-life is very weak hear. We rarely ever see or hear about them around campus but we know they're here.
College Sophomore,2,"The rooms are too small, dorms need renovation"
College Sophomore,2,A robberies happen on the off campus housing and sometimes if you are walking alone at night around campus.
College Sophomore,2,There is no visitation allowed in the dorms. When we do have visitation we usually have it at towards the end of the semester and its only on the weekends.
College Sophomore,2,This is mostly because they don't have a real football team
College Sophomore,2,"I see a lot of cheating. There are a lot of unmotivated students who don't bother to come to class. If they do come to class, they often get up in the middle of class to leave. However, to be fair, there are successful students there. Graduation rate is low."
College Sophomore,2,The quality of career prospects isn't so good at the campus.Most of the jobs are taken if you don't act fast and there are not enough jobs to apply for at the school.
College Freshman,2,The transportation is good but theres no clubs.
College Sophomore,2,Housing sucks I constantly have cold water in my showers and problems with the heating. The RAs are care free and irresponsible my bedding is horrible and my back hurts at night.
College Freshman,2,"I just don't like the environment, lack of opportunity, and the people here."
College Junior,2,The process is horrible and the customer service is worst
College Freshman,2,"The Party scene weren't they used to be when I first moved in. Police are always ready to shut parties down and tell everyone to go home. If police are not around, there would be fights that would cause the party to end early."
College Freshman,2,There are not enough off campus dining to choose because Princess Anne is a very small town. Most dining areas either close after 11 or they don't deliver. One would have to take the bus to go to town to get some food and the wait to catch the bus to go back to campus is terrible.
College Freshman,2,"I feel the strictness at my school wasn't really needed because everyone at college are adults and I'm pretty sure they know they would have to face consequences if one mistake happens. The dorm I stayed at, I didn't get visitation and it wasn't fair for others, making it kind of hard for college students to see their friends."
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive enough financial aid. I received very little scholarship money.
College Freshman,2,The food at the cafeteria is very horrible.
College Sophomore,2,The atmosphere is bad but not terrible considering the school is near the poorest county in maryland
College Sophomore,2,It used to be okay and you had parties maybe not a lot but they didn't get shut down. Now you cant have a party for more then 10 minutes because the cops come or people are so pressed and crowed the place. You have to go to Salisbury to party
College Sophomore,2,Your more scared of the police then find them helpful. They call the state police so fast because they think something is gonna happen but it never does. I think crime has calmed down a lot so the increase in police is just getting annoying.
College Freshman,2,"University of Maryland Eastern Shore is in the middle of nowhere and if you don't have a car you will be bored all the time. Most of the shopping, nightlife, and other things are in Salisbury, MD.  Very little stores and food places surround UMES."
College Freshman,2,I'm a freshman and there have been a ton of parties that have been shut down this semester.  Before I came here I always hear this school was a party school and the stories the upperclassmen talk about.  If there is a party it's off campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not very interesting. Parties are back & so are the Djs
Recent Alumnus,2,"Ireally don't care for them because all they're concerned with is partying & being popular or seen/noticed. Iota Psi Theta is the only Frat at UMES that seems to genuinely care about their education, community, campus, and future."
Recent Alumnus,2,The drug scene at my school is steadily increasing. Most students do partake in marijuana usage and are becoming to be more public about it. I would not be surprised if students drug usage began to affect their performance in school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is a huge deal when registration period comes around.  A lot of students do not know their classification due to missing credits. Because they don't know their classification, students can't register on the assigned days and miss out on essential classes and prerequisites that they are supposed to take. In addition, some professors either do not give enough work and give too much work. There needs to be a medium where teachers can get accurate feedback from the students to know how they are doing."
College Sophomore,2,There are only scholarships through the Honors programs.
College Freshman,2,"there's always going to be someone willing to buy underage students a drink. that can't be avoided. but a majority of the campus is high on a regular basis. there's people who grow the stuff in arden's, talons, eveywhere! and the police do nothing! it's baffling!"
College Freshman,2,i don't have to pay to live off campus but i've heard it's a pain to deal with at times. parking in Arden's is just god awful at night or any time past 6pm. they didn't think to add more parking to the back when they made three new buildings. and they didn't think the trash situation through when they gave four buildings two trash bins. it's stupid.
College Freshman,2,princess anne is a dead town for college students. theres the fast food and the over priced food lion to eat. you have to go two towns over to do anything fun and  the school has no shuttle during the week to go out on the weekend so it's a pian being stuck on campus all the time if you dont have a car
College Freshman,2,It is a rural area so it cost a decent amount of money to get public transportation anywhere.
College Freshman,2,Most of the dorms have problems that need to be fixed and the maintainence people take a long time to fix them.
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of sports that the teams are really good at so there usually isn't a very big audience.
College Freshman,2,I don't live on campus so I don't have full disclousure of housing policies but I know that if you don't live in that dorm then you are not allowed to go into that dorm.  There are only visitors allowed on the weekend during certain time intervals.
College Freshman,2,There are no public spots that would qualify as a club or a bar.  There are only a few ways to get to a nearby city and it does not run very late at night.  Parties are usually house parties.
College Freshman,2,"My college is located in a small, rural area so there are only a few available restaurants.  The restaurants that are in town are chain fast food places and a few small diners that lack quality food but make up for it with low prices.  There are only a handful of sit down places and there are few vegetarian options."
College Freshman,2,Not much of a challenge for me. Felt wrongly placed in math. NO thanks to Dr. Brown. Dont need much to be accepted into UMES just look at the students. I kind of wish I could have been able to be in the honors program. First semester classes were simple. Only difficulty was learning Microsoft Access in my Business Software Class because she cancelled class and couldn't teach it because it wouldnt work on the computer and the videos didn't help. I even tried to help myself by reading. Just too difficult. 
College Freshman,2,Security seems to surface at night to me. I dont really see them much during the day. Walking at night was the worst for me especially hearing about what goes on at the UMES campus. Anybody is allowed on that campus. 
College Sophomore,2,I don't eat on campus because a lot of people say the dining food is not that great.
College Sophomore,2,I would love to be part of greek life but i just don't see it around the school that much.
College Freshman,2,"I think my schools dining needs improvements, the cafeteria closes too early, there isn't a big enough variety and the food that is served, isn't that good in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,the weather at eastern shore is very bipolar because it could be cold one day then rainy then hot the next. so its never a week when the weather goes against what the weather people say. Sometimes when you need to get somewhere it will be snowing or very windy and cold and you might not want to go outside aymore and it ruins your whole day.
College Senior,2,Nothing much around salisbury u is 15 min away
College Senior,2, Not everyone but most don't take their education seriously which makes them stay for 8 years
College Senior,2,Got nothing but loans. In state gets all of the money there is leaving out of state to have nothing
College Freshman,2,"If you are not your own person, you can be easily pressured into the drug scene. "
College Freshman,2,"Rain, snow, sleet or shine we still have classes. I live in the dorm furthest away from campus so going to class in bad weather becomes a challenge; my 12min walk to class could easily becomes a 20 min walk to class in bad weather conditions."
Recent Alumnus,2,"We don't have Greeks at our school , so therefore i have no idea of what to say ."
College Freshman,2,im not used to quiet streets/neighborhoods its pretty quiet .
College Freshman,2,"get it done on time, make sure you tell your parents ahead of time to fill it out so that they can get their information out the way."
College Sophomore,2,I stayed in the newest dorm. 
College Sophomore,2,They really just shut down party's 
College Sophomore,2,Buffet style but same thing served every week. Unhealthy foods. 
College Sophomore,2,Weather is all over the place
College Sophomore,2,I don't like it too much math
College Sophomore,2,There aren't restaurants in princess Anne every restaurant that you know of is in Salisbury. So you would have to travel 15-20 if you have a taste other than mc Donalds
College Senior,2,"This school is quite a hassle to be apart of. Out-of-state students should really consider a much better school because of all the time, money, and effort you are going to have to put into this school. There will be very few scholarships available, and you won't receive help like you should - especially if you get excellent grades like me. I would never come back here. "
College Senior,2,"They don't have any special study options and very little workload for an English major. The professors try and help, but the registration process can be a little confusing at first. "
Freshman,1,"University of Maryland Easternshore is really an unorganized, unstructured, and unprofessional school.  The service, administrators, financial aid, programs, and communication with the school and students is very poor. Even during Covid-19, I feel they did not make enough of an effort to inform the students on new updates and necessary information. For example, the first day of classes, me and many other students walked about 20 minutes to all our classes, only to find out all of them were online.  The school did a very poor job in failing to inform students, especially freshman with this info. Also, the school never answers their emails or calls. Freshmen students and I have been emailing financial aid since the first week of school to scheduele an appointment to  discuss the financial aid packet some of us still have not received.  To this day, they have never responded. The school barely cares about the students and their well being. I feel they mainly car about the money."
Senior,1,I'm not fond of eastern shore.  I wouldn't recommend anybody to get her. The poffessors do not care about students and the campus is in the middle of nowhere.
College Senior,1,"Rated as the worst and most dangerous on multiple school sites due to robberies, theft, shootings in housing, murders, having students associated with murders, students being held at gunpoint, apartments being broken into and robbed at gunpoint, this is why I do not live on campus. It scares the living daylights out of me having a late class and getting out around 7:30-8:20 p.m., however some of the gentleman in the late night classes are nice to walk you to your car."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no school spirit at my university unfortunately. I played varsity football although T my high school career and experienced more thrill than I have ever here at this university. The bowling, tennis , and track teams are respectable athletes. Our football club at the university is sorry and tired."
College Freshman,1,"The parties alone can be amazing. There are usually many to choose from especially on weekends. But they always get shut down by campus police for some unknown reason. After a long hard week of studying and classes , I feel as if I deserve to have fun. Parties are the only fun around campus, there is literally nothing else to do. NOTHING!"
College Sophomore,1,they shut down anything that is fun
Recent Alumnus,1,"The field of biology is different from the others because we have the worst professors, the worst class times, and more than likely, majority of students don't finish in four years because certain classes are only available during either the fall or spring semester."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We have the worst professors here, at least for biology majors anyways. Most of the professors that I have encountered since my time here do not understand the information as well as they should. Many times I find myself having to resort to help from my peers because it is impossible to get assistance from my professor."
College Freshman,1,oh dear god this school is full of idiots. i can't believe they let these students into college. they shouldn't do it because it's giving students who wouldn't make it into a good college a chance to skim through and get a degree. the teachers are half god awful. they have such heavy accents its difficult to understand and then they aren't willing to help half the time. my high school was harder than this and this school is full of morons.
College Freshman,1,There are almost no attractions in town.  To find something interesting to do a student would have to travel thirty miles at least.
College Freshman,1,I dislike some of the professors I had because they didnt teach. They were mostly about getting out early and cancelling class. The students didn't make the experience any better. Im going to finish up this semester and transfer. 
College Senior,1,Only like 5 places right near campus
College Freshman,1,"when it gets cold it gets cold, you dont even want to leave your bed."
College Freshman,1,"When school first started the food was delicious, now its like they don't care and give us anything. I'm pretty disappointed, we pay tuition for what again? There isn't even a menu, "" you get what you get""!"
College Sophomore,1,Nothing is in princess Anne 
College Sophomore,1,We have the worse Greek life for an hbcu school no many fraternities no sororities 
College Senior,1,"While the housing process is simple, it is very hard to get an actual dorm of your choice. It should be first come first serve, it is actually just random and unfair. Overall, I know people who couldn't come back the next semester because there were no housing or dorms available (at least that's what they say) and it will turn out that there are places available after all. "
College Senior,1,"Unfortunately, I don't enjoy it because I do not feel prepared enough as I am about to graduate. "
College Senior,1,"I am still trying to find an internship. It's very hard to find one near campus, especially if you do not drive, since there are none available on campus (For my major)."
College Senior,1,"What nightlife? For those who look for excitement, this isn't the school for you."
College Junior,1,All black. only a handfull of white people. Have not seen any asians hispanics or anything other than black or white. 97% black. 2% white. 1% other
College Junior,1,Bad school. Do not come here. Basically like attending community college.
College Junior,1,Garbage. All the buildings are old and need renovations but the campus refuses to spend money on repairs. Classrooms are either hot or cold. No in between
College Junior,1,Girls out here are sloppy looking. There are a couple good looking ones but the majority are sloppy and dumb. Nothing more unattractive than a dumb girl
College Junior,1,What greek life? Only 1 frat i know of and that is because i have class with the Frat leader.
College Junior,1,Academics here are equivalent to community college. Very basic. And many professors teach out of the book or do not fully understand the content they are teaching.
College Sophomore,1,"The prices are too high for me, especially when i have to pay for school and books and other supplies. The room are small they not as big and the hallways are not cleaning. I just think they should build knew ones since there are more people trying to attend the school."
College Junior,1,"At umes, our athletics means everything, buy everyone doesnt support. Our teams work hard,our bowling team has been number one for the past few years but only a handful of people can say that they've been to a game. Surprising we having alot of school spirit. Since we dont have football, basketball is the one thing everyone on campus can come together for and cheer."
College Sophomore,1,Sucks. The process of going through financial aid is so unorganized and long for something that really takes 2 minutes. Some tips would be to make sure you completed everything because they wont help you unless you do and talk to your financial aid officer about working on campus.
College Junior,1,"Due to the location of the campus, the nightlife of the university is a poor D. Students are forced to stay in there dorms and find a way to keep themselves entertained.I will explain what I mean by the location is a big factor: UMES is on the Easternshore of Maryland where is more of a country locale than an urban one. The area is an 80% of farmland; the school is one of the most important landmarks of the community and the busiest area. Without the school, like on holidays and breaks, community Is what I would call ""dry."" Not to say there is no bars in the area but, compared to a city or medium sized community, princess Anne, the location of the campus is ""dry"""
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is very small and so are the building. There is not many connections between each buildings so students are made to walk in the horrible weather. When it rains in University of Maryland Eastern Shore...it floods. So GOOD LUCK!!!! Also, classes are not canceled even if you are wet all around. Also, no transportation available....all you can do is to use an umbrella."
College Sophomore,1,No volunteer opportunities nearby. No affiliated medical school. Already 2 deaths (one person was fatally stabbed). Great financial aid package. People are nice but the campus makes every a bit depressed since there is no attraction nearby. If you come here you can find parties but otherwise you can seriously focus on your studies. The professors are great and they will take their time to help you.
College Freshman,1,finding a parking spot early in the morning is easy because not too many have early morning classes. but around 10am its hectic finding a parking spot because theyre all taken and people usually leave their car parked in the same spot all day
College Junior,1,The only way to get financial aid that does not have to be paid back at UMES is to have a low EFC onFASFA.  Few get academic scholarships awarded by the school
College Senior,1,"The housing on campus pretty much sucks. Its over priced for what it is, and they are old and disgusting. The best place to stay would be clusters/student apartments in my opinion, because I dont like sharing a room. But the actual dorms are probably way better, and stay clean/renovated"
College Senior,1,"Parking is way to expensive for no reason. You have to have a parking permit to park in all of the lots, or you will get a huge fine, and they parking permits are very expensive. The security guards just sit in the booth and dont really do their job. In order to get a space you have to arrive super early to class, and some lots you cant even park in"
College Junior,1,"There aren't many good places to hang out at night around that area.  If you are looking for a good party or nightclub, one must go all the way to Ocean City, which is 30 minutes away from the school.  There is one club/bar nearby the school that have good drinks, but it quite small and gets crowded pretty quickly."
College Freshman,1,The campus sits in between to bodies of water so it was a little rough during tropical storm Sandy last month.
College Senior,1,"University of Maryland-Eastern Shore
There isn't much parking yet you must have a parking pass or get a huge parking ticket that will triple after thirty days. I would be find if the University could promise those who purchased a parking pass will 8 out of 10 times have a spot to park but they can't. So its better to save your money and park in a designated lot that you don't need a pass and yet that lot has been know to fill up at times. Most of students don't worry that much about because they car pool."
College Sophomore,1,Shuttle has set times and only goes certain places
College Junior,1,Many of the financial advisers are impatient and aren't really concerned with helping good students with their financial struggles.
College Freshman,1,I haven't seen anything to great or fun that they have done so far. It has been disappointing.
College Sophomore,1,Nothing to Do – The Princess Anne area is very deserted and has little population. There's not much to do off campus. The closet mall is about 30 mins away and its the only mall on the lower eastern shore. There are no recreation center around not even a park. The one place we can escape to is Ocean City which is an 1 away.
College Sophomore,1,If you dont have a sticker on your car you will have  to walk a distance to get to places. If you use someones car and park in the wrong plaace they will get a ticket or towed.
College Freshman,1,"Shopping, Activities Etc. There is absolutely nothing to do on campus other than the few events the school may host. Anthing else, you must go to the next city over."
College Freshman,1,the dorm room here are like a prison.  it is just a brick wall painted blue that we can't even decorate because the adminstration is afraid that the paint will come off.  also we have any visitation of the opposite sex during the week so forming study groups are impossible and everything else on campus close at 12.  the bottom line is that the dorm life sucks
College Freshman,1,Football Team – We need a Football team. we are the only HBCU without a football team
College Senior,1,"There is hardly a nightlife at school. The police shuts everything doiwn as soon as it starts to get good. There is only one spot to go to an it is on wednesday nights, and the police are waiting outside for you."
College Senior,1,I believe that this university has all the right criterias to become a better university. If there were a better sports and Greek life on campus everyone would enjoy a wonderful college experience. If the people in the main office feel like these things are a burden to the campus then they shall not be working here.
College Sophomore,1,"New Policy – I am new here, but my first semester they changed the printing policy.  Printing is no longer free, apparently it use to be 200 or so free pages a week I was told.

I am giving the campus a D because of the following.
- limited wireless access
- limited weekend access, due to closed computer labs and wireless in the building the study in turned off
- the network firewall on campus and off campus is strict, the first week of moving in I could not even access a program used to watch and record lectures; do not even try to relax by playing an online video game, they are all blocked.
- the help staff, I have put in numerous requests to have the above issues resolved and only one was every met in a timely manner (~2 days) if you can call it that

."
College Sophomore,1,"To be honest, there isn't much of a night life on this campus unless the library counts. People just have get-to-gethers with their friends and occasionally someone will throw a party that is likely to get shut down. I wouldn't know about nearby bars because I'm not legal to drink yet."
College Senior,1,Terrible Financial Assistance – It is very difficult to get financial assistance and the staff are extremely difficult to work with and dont seem to care or want to help anyone.
College Senior,1,"Strictness Is Inhumane. The Police Force are very harsh on students. Its almost as if the Police harrasses the students. University of Maryland Eastern Shore is a lovely spacious campus, due to the space students have to travel to meet others. I am a commuter student and due to my living arrangements, I am told i can not enter campus during late hours. Late hours to police around Princess Anne are considered 5pm and after. The issue with that is the way the campus is set up, you can reach any of the ammenities without going on campus. Basically limiting the access to success centers (tutors, libraries etc). Princess Anne is a different city, where our neighbooring school is salisbury state. Magically in plain eye-sight anyone will notice UMES happens to have salisbury police, campus police, somerset police and many other police on campus. Parties are non-exsisting. Social life limited. Everything is shut off or blocked off by 5:30pm, although classes are still in. No matter what race, age, during your schooling you will get treated unjust."
College Sophomore,1,"Almost EVERYONE Picks up Atleast 1 Drug Habit Here! At umes there is nothing to do but drink, smoke almost every day of the week. The classes here are SOOOO basic. Way easier than high school. So what do students do when there bored??? (spark up, pour drinks, or maybe both). For most students, this is the #1 way to meet new people.. As for police enforcement, DON'T DRIVE DIRTY!! Don't drive drunk. The police are TOO pressed to send a lil black kid to jail. Don't do dumb stuff."
College Sophomore,1,Could Be Much Beter – There are police but you never see them around campus walking around making sure everythings okay.
College Senior,1,"I have realize being here for 4 years now that the University of Maryland Eastern Shore has one of the worst financial aid departments in the country. In order for you to recieve any type of school funding or financial assistance you have to go above the financial aid department and speak with the Vice President of Academic Affiars when doing anything. It would seem that their are maybe 5 in total, administrators who will actually help you out in this institution and they are the bosses of the bosses to the various department in the school."
College Freshman,1,Party Life – We in the middle of no where there are no clubs or bars the closet places are in va or baltimore
College Sophomore,1,"The Shore – There isn' t much to the atmosphere at UMES (University of Maryland Eastern Shore). The school is located in rural Princess Anne, Maryland where there little to see and even less to do."
College Sophomore,1,"Needs Better Visitation Rules – In college you are expected to not just learn but become adults. We are treated like children in the dorms, even upperclassman dorms. I live in Murphy Annex, which is reserved for honor upperclassmen students, and we don't get visitation until a month left in the semester, and when we get it our geusts have to leave at 12AM on weekdays and 2AM on weekends, which makes absolutley no sense. You can try living in the Student Residential Complex (Clusters as we call it), but it is dangerous, which is sad for campus housing. The University needs to tighten up security especially in their housing complexes. If I lived close enough to commute I would, but sadly that's not an option"
College Sophomore,1,"My financial aid process with my school is somewhat difficult. My school is not in favor of rewarding high GPA students, however they favor students in ""desperate need"" of financial aid. I have a 3.833 GPA and I receive less than $2000 a semester. I am also cheerleading captain, member of the National Society of Leadership and Success, and the Most Improved Player of Year 2011-2012 and yet I have difficulty paying for my tuition. I was always taught that hard work is rewarded, but my school has forgotten this important lesson. I suggest searching online for scholarships everyday and crossing your fingers because the ladies at the front desk of the financial aid office have a serious attitude."

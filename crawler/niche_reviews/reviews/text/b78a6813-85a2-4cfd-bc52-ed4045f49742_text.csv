Sophomore,5,"The professors do a fantastic job educating their students. The campus is small, easy to navigate, and beautiful. The people who attend that school are really friendly."
Sophomore,5,"The professors I had did a good job of teaching their subjects despite the new format. Although I'd never done school online before, because of them, I was able to adjust and keep my good grades."
Senior,5,My experience at North Park has been good. The school is very welcoming and staff are nice. The campus is somewhat big but very nice.
Freshman,5,"I really like the campus and the location of the school. It is surrounded by lots of popular social places to eat such as Starbucks, Jimmy Johns, and McDonald's. There is this one really good place called 2 Asain Brothers, and they have AMAZING food. Walking around campus, you see so many familiar and friendly faces. It is a very wholesome campus."
Freshman,5,"North Park University is a great four year college. It is a smaller university, but it offers many different educational routes."
Freshman,5,"North Park is a small private university, this means that there is more opportunities for students to get more attention or assistance from their professor. Their facilities are phenomenal as well."
Freshman,5,The faculty and North Park are motivated to see you learn and succeed in their classes. Not only that but the smaller class sizes allow your professors to get to know you by name so it is that much easier to find support when you need it.
Niche User,5,"The experience I had with this school was phenomenal and everything worked out nicely. The day was just overall perfect.. The school is located right next to the Lake which is something I find quite cool. It has a beautiful scenery and campus. Everything also seemed very up to date. Most schools, well the ones I visited still had an old feeling to them. However, Northwestern had very nice modern rooms and buildings."
Freshman,5,Professors and Administration is very helpful and caring for students. Campus environment is very welcoming and has a strong communal feel to it. I feel safe and welcome around all campus!
Freshman,5,North Park is a great city-centered 4-year University.  My first semester here has been great.  There is plenty to do around the campus and plenty to do on campus.  I would recommend this school to anyone who is looking for a school in a big city.
Sophomore,5,"It is a small campus on the northside of the city, but it does not feel like you are surrounded by a regular neighbor. Professors are very nice and want students to succeed."
Junior,5,I love this college it is exactly what I wanted in a school. The campus feels like no stress exists. The teachers are also advisers and because of this if there is any questions it is so easy to reach out for information.
Freshman,5,I will be attending North Park university fall 2019. since I've gotten accepted to this university I have feel very welcomed. I love this university so much just based off my experiences every time I go to a campus activity.
Niche User,5,"I love the campus, it is beautiful. The faculty is highly trained and know exactly what they are teaching because most have experience in that field!"
Graduate Student,5,"Overall good, they offer online as well as campus classes and they have satellites that are far off from the actual college which give students the opportunity to reach out to them and find the closest location."
Freshman,5,"It is an excellent university. The major point which I like about this university is about its diversified culture, and equal opportunities for everyone including international students."
Niche User,5,"I  will be attending North Park University in the fall, and after my first visit I  fell fast in love. I    had applied to many other schools and after witnessing North Parks intricate and comfortable environment, I   knew it was the perfect place for me. The area surrounding NP is filled with different restaurants, and safe places to spend your time. Being able to go to school in the city is a blessing in itself but in an environment like North Park it makes things even more substantial."
Sophomore,5,Science program is above average! If you want to do anything medical this place is where you want to go.
Senior,5,"The School of Professional Studies has an incredible on-boarding program that just about ensures the success of each student joining the program.  They self-advocate as ""cheerleaders"" in support of each students completion of their chosen degree.  I highly recommend this school and program for any adult seeing to return for degree completion."
Freshman,5,"So far, I have really enjoyed my freshman year. North Park University has helped my transition be smooth and I believe I have been very successful. I am offered all the resources I need, and can not wait to dorm next year."
Freshman,5,"It is a really great school. I loved everything from the culture, the faith, the teachers, and the academics. I also liked the athletics."
Sophomore,5,"When I first started at North Park University, I wasn't too fond of it due to the fact that I originally wanted to go to an out of state university, however due to my personal life circumstances that wasn't able to happen for me. That being said North Park University was recommended to me and was the very last school I applied to and was the school I chose to go to. As I continued into my first semester of my courses, I fell in love with this school! The campus is to my liking and put together like a little town and I fit in pretty quickly. This school has a diverse community and though its something Im not really used to I enjoy creating relationships with different people from different cultures.The courses are rigorous and include a lot of hands-on learning experiences around the community. The staff and faculty serve as useful resources and provide a lot of support in whatever it is each individual needs."
Sophomore,5,"I was never certain of what University I was going to attend. After a good amount of thinking, as well as considering all of my option I decided that North Park University was the right place for completing my studies. Since I joined the school I've had a great experience as per the academic, as well as societal environment that exists in the school."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at North Park University has been amazing. The students who attend, as well as all staff members who work there are amazing, and very friendly. The amount of support given at this school is great, it really helps knowing that there's many people there who would love to watch one another succeed."
Alum,5,"I lived on campus, and the wonderful thing about on campus at North Park is that you get to know your community really quickly! Other students are familiar and for an extrovert like me, I really felt like my classmates were the people that I was safe to be myself and learn how to grow up around.  The campus was beautiful, if small-ish.  The professors were fully invested into their students, and the freedom to question and listen and respond was marvelous.  Highly recommended!"
Sophomore,5,"It has been a amazing experience so far, the students and staff are all super helpful and kind regardless of what you look like or believe."
Freshman,5,North Park is a small University located within a very big and busy city. The academics are excellent and the community is very diverse. The faculty are always informative and willing to help.
Freshman,5,North park is a great place and fit for me. I am on the football team and my teammates are great help with school and life. The teachers here are friendly and caring.
Senior,5,NPU is a multicultural and diverse university that really shows their talent in caring and giving the best they can to their students.
Sophomore,5,"Iâ€™ve had a great experience attending North Park. The professors are a big influence at the school; they spend extra time and effort to assist all students and constantly encourage us to go beyond the boundary to exceed in our curriculum.

North Park provides programs for students to learn about the community and become active in school activities. Their facilities are paramount to my education, they offer a comfortable environment to study, learn, and communicate with students and staff.

I believe diversity is still an issue and they can gain more reputation by reaching out to students of all backgrounds and nationalities. However, what they lack in diversity, North Park makes up for with student groups for Black, Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern, and LBGTQA to help integrate them in-and-out of student life."
Sophomore,5,"I love my small classes, proximity to the city, and of course Pastor Judy! This is the perfect school for me."
Niche User,5,"I took a summer class here and it was great. It was in the Summer Science Academy and the teachers and the students were all great. I learned a lot and it was a very hands on experience, we got to go in the cadaver lab which was absolutely amazing because you get a hands on learning experience in a rare way that not a lot of schools provide, there's nothing like it you will never learn from a book or technology the same way as you do as seeing the real thing."
Freshman,5,I love my school it's very diverse and professors have respect for their students!! The campus if beautiful and clean I feel safe ok n campus.
Sophomore,5,"I recently transferred to this school and so far have been treated the most respect I've ever received at a school. Everyone is helpful, the campus itself is astounding. The courses given are informative and have a wide range of diversity. Although Tuition is high, it's totally worth it."
Junior,5,I liked North Park because it was Christian and comprehensive. It had a small campus and a big spiritual life. I got to try the campus for free for six months. I liked the sports teams and the library. They have good food and student support. I like the Christian friends I meet along the way. I wish they could lower the tuition al little.
Freshman,5,"I really love North Park University, I love the fact that they are willing to help you in whatever way possible to stay in school. I love the diversity in the people and in the culture. When you walk in campus you feel like your part of the diversity and culture and there are always events going around campus. I love the teachers, they are there to help you in any way possible to succeed in their classes."
Niche User,5,North Park allow student athletes like my self to combine athletics with a major in Athletic Training. This is an unique opportunity that  few other colleges can offer.
Sophomore,5,"North Park University is a really great campus to get your college education.  It is full of the latest technology and is full of diversity.  I feel these are what makes this university so unique!  The professors are extremely caring and are always willing to help out if needed.  It is located in Chicago which is definitely a plus.  There are so many things to learn about and explore in this big city.  The people are truly amazing and this makes my college experience so rewarding.  The opportunities are endless. North Park is located near the home of the Chicago Cubs!  It was an awesome feeling to be part of the World Series 2016!  I am only a sophomore at North Park, and I hope I am given the opportunity to graduate from here.  The tuition is very expensive for me, but I'm trying my best to get really good grades and apply for available scholarships."
Junior,5,I must say the best part about North Park is the teachers and staff.  All are always friendly and happy to assist with both  financial aid and academical problems.  The staff is always welcoming and happy to meet with students during business hours for extra support and to answer any questions.
Junior,5,"I love North Park. I am a current Junior at the University and North Park has given me so many opportunities for me to grow as a future educator. The professors are so great and really attempt to reach out as a supporter of you, as well as your professor."
Sophomore,5,"It feels like home away from home! I find myself calling it ""home"" when I'm back in my hometown! Something about being able to live in a Christian environment that allows me to thrive in different leadership opportunities and grow as a person while seeking out an educational desire is beyond refreshing."
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely secure on campus, and I' sure many other students do as well. The school has many events that in which students attend, and we talk about health and safety. Heart and safety is and extremely important topic."
College Freshman,5,If you're not feeling safe on campus you can call the campus police and report a problem if there is one right away. You can text the campus security and they'll go meet you up and walk you to your dorm or give you a ride where ever your going on campus and they're someone always on duty as a security and at the front door at each housing hall.
College Freshman,5,"There's someone with different jobs. If you're looking for a job, you go to the Student Engagement Center, if you want to join a club you would also go to the Student Engagement Center; there's someone there for everything."
College Freshman,5,"There's always someone willing to help you out, someone to answer your questions, someone to give you their opinion."

College Junior,5,when on campus i feel as if nothing will hurt me
College Freshman,5,I love North Park for what it is
College Freshman,5,I have not encountered anything serious yet
College Freshman,5,I love how the school is small and i have good relationships with my professors
College Freshman,5,It is such a great tight knit environment I love it
College Sophomore,5,my experience has been really grate. I am a international from West Africa Liberia. over the  time  North Park Univerity  been a really good hely to me in developing and fitting in to this new community. the people at my school are very welcoming and loving.
Recent Alumnus,5,There are always securities checking around the school's parking lot and walking around in the buildings which makes me feel safe.
College Freshman,5,Renee is always emailing you with up to date info on current happenings in the career/internship office
College Freshman,5,They make an effort to know you as a person
College Sophomore,5,All of my professors are approachable and extremely knowledgeable .
College Sophomore,5,I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,The admission counselor helped me through the process start to finish.  Everyone was super nice and made me feel like they wanted me to attend their school.
College Sophomore,5,Everything is maintained very well and great equipment
College Junior,5,People from all over the place is there.
Junior,4,I really enjoy how the class sizes at North Park are small which gives students and myself a better opportunity to get that one on one experience with your professors. Everyone that I know at North Park are there for the same reasons everyone is very friendly and challenge each other everyday to become better scholars. In my experiences in the classroom all the students around me are very helpful with helping me out if I am not understanding the lecture or the homework assignment.
Junior,4,"The online experience is very different and something that took a while not just for me but with others as well to get the hang of online classes. The professors have been doing a great job with the technology and communication with homework and lectures. Since North Park in general has a very friendly community the students and myself all help each other during these tough times we are facing at the moment. As of today, I have not had any problems with online classes."
Junior,4,It's a very diverse school with many international studies. We have the city by us to discover for studies and have a program that lets many people discover many neighborhoods in Chicago.
Junior,4,When the pandemic hit we were required to take online classes. The classes were stressful at first because it was something new and I had to plan my days accordingly.
Junior,4,It's a small campus and the surrounding area is actually quite nice. I am a biology major and from my experience the professors are amazing. Decent overall experience so far.
Sophomore,4,"I had to take all my classes online as others did of course... It wasn't particularly challenging at all. Professors were very much on top of giving us materials and meeting with us for regular classes. What was challenging was my ability to remain in an academic mindset, as I was home all the time."
Sophomore,4,"North Park is a private school, and therefore a lot smaller than many universities. This creates a very communal environment, where professors and students have the ability to build relationships beyond the classroom and academics."
Senior,4,Online learning is decent but I prefer having classes on campus. Online classes are virtual and the professors email their students and have everything well organized for students to learn.
Sophomore,4,I think that some thing that I like about NPU is that there are many resources that students could go to. One of the resources that they have is writing center. This is really helpful because students could go and get help with their paper. This is provide to everyone and I feel that it has help me improve. I think that something I would want to change is academic. I feel that sometimes student schedules are really full that it really hard to make class work in the schedule.
Sophomore,4,Chose to attend this school very last minute and at random. Some of there professors shouldn't still be teaching but other than that I love everything about the school. The Christian influence is just what I needed. Ive made so many amazing friends and gotten the opportunity to do so many new things and explore the beautiful city of Chicago.
Sophomore,4,"North Park University has many programs that allow students to explore. The one that I enjoyed the most is Catalyst Semester. This allows students that aren't from Chicago to explore the city in a new way and learn about the history of Chicago. The staff is also very helpful; they really care about your education. You can reach out to almost anyone and they will be willing to help you or find solutions that will make things easier for you. Certain classes also have trips, related to the class, which sometimes makes learning a bit easier/understandable and fun."
Senior,4,Its a terrific school and I recommend it for anyone that wants to study business. The teachers are really helpful throughout the years. They provide you with the help you need.
Junior,4,My experience has been great at North Park University. Being on the softball team has allowed me to form a lot of connections more quickly than I would have if I wasnâ€™t on the softball team. My favorite part about North Park is the small student to faculty ratio which allows more one-on-one learning with the professor.
Sophomore,4,I like the atmosphere and how diverse the campus is. There are always different clubs and activities that people are encouraged to join.  I also like that the campus is big which allows people to get out of our comfort zones and to get to know others around you. I like the people around me and our professors as well. I like how they encourage us to attend office hours as well as offering or providing further assistance including students with disability programs.
Alum,4,"-if you like partying, you might get bored here. and given that Chicago cards pretty strictly at bars, you might have a hard time going on. some sneaky drinking on campus.

-lots of college students get lonely. I think that that's much less of a concern at NPU, as you'll see the same faces in the cafeteria three times a day, especially throughout your first couple years. 

-some students (especially the lifelong Covenant kids) seem to rarely leave campus. other students spend very little time on campus and prefer to go work at a busy restaurant in the city, etc. 

-professors can be extremely accommodating and helpful.

-for being a D3 school, people are pretty good at being sports fans. 

-if you didn't grow up attending Covenant camps, etc., you might feel like a bit of an outsider. 

-NPU definitely doesn't have the on-campus recruiting for internships and 'real jobs' that bigger schools have, so you have to be more proactive as an NPU student than you might need to be elsewhere."
Sophomore,4,"It is inviting, and the classes are beneficial to future life and are thought provoking. The campus is beautiful, and easy to get around. The neighborhood is diverse, but there's not much to do unless you use public transportation. The school says it is diverse, and it is more than other schools, but you don't really notice it. Rooted in the Christian faith, but not everyone is Christian, nor forced to be. There are plenty of things to get involved in, which is why chapel and other services are not required. Being on campus helps students become connected to such events, opportunities, communities."
Senior,4,North Park has excellent professors and I feel that I get a very good education here. There are a lot of programs put in place to help students be successful.
Niche User,4,"I've been living by the North Park area for over 10 years and I've participated in a new programs that are affiliated with my church that once let me stay at the university for a month. During the experience, I stayed at one of the residences and also ate at the campus. The only thing I would change is the quality of the food that is being served. They serve decent quality food but it is fast food, so there is nothing healthy on the menu unless they have spaghetti on some nights. Everything else about North Park is great. The professors were kind and respectful; the classroom experience made me want to go to North Park."
Freshman,4,"I love how small the school is and how close you can become with the teachers and students. I always feel like I can get help with my school work and just about anything! I love how close I can be with my classmates and I know everyone in the class. Also, the campus is so close to the city which makes it very enjoyable to be able to experience all of the culture and excitement of a big city while still being at school."
Niche User,4,"I can say that everyone within the facility, especially the admissions counselor is very communicative,  I love the overall communication. What I love most or look forward to is the education, sports, and experience there is within the university."
Junior,4,What I mostly like about North Park is that I have been in a program called COMAPASS since freshmen year and now I get to be a mentor for the incoming freshmen in my next three years. I've already been a mentor for two years and it's great. I also like that the campus is small and its easy to get to one place to another. Professors offer much help and are willing to meet with their students if they're free.
Sophomore,4,"I like the diversity of the school. I have been here for about 2 years now and the school is more diverse. The professors are very helpful when it comes to organizing schedules for the next semester to giving advice. The campus is great because its small where it is easy to get around and everyone somewhat knows everyone. The university has great opportunities for internships, volunteering, and jobs for students on campus."
Freshman,4,"North Park is a school that, although being a Christian school, respects that religious view of other. As well as those who may not even have a religious view. It's a school that will make you feel welcome and accepted. The classrooms are not that big making it perfect to have an involvement with the teacher and being able to ask about any question one might have. Also it a school that really helps you focus on your career and makes sure that you are on a path to success."
Junior,4,"I just recently began my time at North Park and I am studying Nursing. So far, my experience has been fantastic! I love the diversity in the school, the way the nursing program is set up, such as the classes and when they are taken, and my teachers have all been educated very well on the subjects they are teaching. I think the level of difficulty in the classes is also at a great spot. Something I would like to see change is adding more clubs on campus. I believe this would help all students, including commuter students, become more involved on campus."
Senior,4,One of the things I like about North Park is that the class average is about 17 students so the proffesor really gets to know one and have a better relationship.
Freshman,4,"I think North Park University is a good college. I have heard that the teachers are really engaging and get personal with each students due to the small class sizes. Also, the campus is beautiful. I would recommend this school to anyone."
Freshman,4,The diversity at North Park is amazing. There are so many experiences offered that are unique to NPU. I personally love how small it is because I know my professors and they know me. You know everyone on campus which opens up huge friendship opportunities.
Niche User,4,I loved their football team and the fact that they have everything I could possibly want. I could join their track team and excel in the class room with their law programs and their internships give me so many possibilities.
Junior,4,"I like that the instructors are involved with the students and not just focusing on lecturing. In comparison to bigger universities, instructors are available to each student as for instructors at bigger universities do not have the time to help each student. I would like to see more activities on campus besides sports activities."
Freshman,4,"North Park is a great school, as soon as you enter the campus you feel as if you were somewhere else and not Chicago. At NPU you experience how people come together as one and have different activities with commuters and people who stay in campus. The student to teacher is great because the classes are small and the professors get to know students like in high school, it shows that the professors actually care about the students."
Freshman,4,North Park is an excellent small Christian school that not only helps us as students but as adults as well.
Junior,4,"North Park is a great enviornment, most people on campus are extremely kind and helpful. My favorite place on campus? Brandel Library! As an UG student you have access to our Writing center and may loan out a laptop if you were to forget yours at home."
Junior,4,"North Park admissions did a great job at welcoming me as a transfer student. I have really enjoyed both the education and English programs. Since North Park is located in such a diverse area our campus is not only diverse, but my field experience for teaching has been incredibly diverse and extremely preparatory for my future. It is also nice that it is not right downtown Chicago but very accessible to it."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman in college I was expecting for college to be a life changing experience. While attending NPU I realized how much I loved the campus and the people in the community. I love the fact that everyone is very friendly, accepting, and open. The campus as a whole is truly amazing, although I am only a freshman I have a bright future ahead of myself. NPU is the best for me because everyone really made me feel at home and were very welcoming. I also love that the campus is small and the fact that everyone is basically a family here. Even though I am only halfway through my first semester I've noticed that I have changed into a better, stronger, and wiser person. I believe that NPU has really had a positive impact on me because already the faculty I'm surrounded with have helped me so much and they are always wiling to make their students great. "
College Freshman,4,"The quality of the courses is great, I feel like I learn a lot of material every time I attend my classes."
College Freshman,4,"When it comes to sports, a lot of people at school love them. Many people here have school spirit. And even if you aren't involved in a sport, we have a gym area for students to workout and play sports, Theres a basketball court, a swimming court, and also a swimming pool."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school more than I thought I would. I was a bit scared when I had to make a change from high school to college, but I love the experience at my school. There are so many buildings ad places in my school that I like. But although I have grown to like this school, as a commuter, I don't feel very included in all of the events. I wish they had more events for commuter students such as myself."
College Senior,4,"My experience at North Park University has been great. It has a beautiful campus, all the staff has been very helpful, and it makes me feel at home."
College Freshman,4,The Greek Life community is very welcoming I just haven't joined.
College Freshman,4,They're gym is amazing! A lot of hours are spent in there!
College Junior,4,I am hopeful that I will be able to find a career following graduation.  The student career center is equipped with talented and dedicated staff that knows how to land opportunities for their students.  They have a great track record as well!
College Junior,4,"North Park is a great school nestled in the diverse, urban, exciting neighborhood of Chicago.  Inside the walls you will find helpful staff, caring professors and a wide range of people from commuters to on campus students.  

Its a great place to be."
College Junior,4,Resident life is amazing.  There are resident women and men groups that offer social outlets for fun like open mic night at the coffee cafe.  On campus housing has resident advisers that are available to provide guidance and help when needed. It is like one big happy family and celebrating birthdays is fun!  Your mom can sign up for a birthday cake and it will be delivered to you room or apartment!
College Junior,4,Actually this is a  non issue as these do not exist at my school.
College Junior,4,"The games are a draw for social life.  Its a great place to connect with friends and cheer on more friends! North Park does a great job keeping students aware of the schedules and activities that surround sports like the tailgate parties before football games.  Soccer games are another big draw for spectators as the team has been winning some games in recent years.  It is always fun to cheer on the winners in a game, but at North Park it is just fun to cheer!"
College Junior,4,North Park is a great school for three reasons: 1.  It is easy to find a place to fit and belong whether cheering on the soccer team or enjoying pancakes in the cafeteria.  2. The professors are really relate able and easy to connect with. They go the extra mile on social media too!  3.  The urban Chicago setting is a perfect back drop for a wonderful play land of adventure.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the professors, even in a huge lecture hall they know your name. Professors are willing to always help"
College Junior,4,The career office is always sending me emails to let me know they are there if i ever need their help to get a job
College Junior,4,the class sizes are small and the teacher knows everyone
College Junior,4,It seems like everyone is on a sport here and they do fairly well against other schools
College Freshman,4,"Although we don't have Greek life here at North Park, I feel as though we have what it embodies. And that is a sense of a family someone that will always have back rather its from your sports team or anyone on campus everyone here tries to look out for one another."
College Freshman,4,Historically the school is known for either wining or always having a solid baseball team and our men's soccer team. The stands are filled on a consistent basis which in turn creates an unbelievable environment. Just this current year the men's basketball team was one win away from being in the division three tournament.
College Sophomore,4,As long as you are not worrying about your debt ceiling and live on campus it is a wholesome school to attend. Go on the CTA to get to Chicago in 20 minutes.You also have Wrigley field literally 10 minutes away from the brown-line station. Security can pick you up during the evening from the brown line as well.
College Sophomore,4,"Just like any other Private University. Nonprofit thinking can generally be associated in any class.The school of business has feelers around the North side of Chicago and downtown. I believe if a student does not slack and has good relations with their professor, they can find a job/internship."
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly the school is a wonderful school in a relatively safe community. The school is expensive and I commute to save $9,000 a year, respectively. I transferred here as a sophomore. I immediately immersed myself into the university's business programs.The faculty generally cares about their students. If a student asks for help, help will be given."
College Freshman,4,"I love North Park and I am really happy I made the choice to attend. There are plenty of things that annoy me about North Park, but that is the same anywhere. North Park is a school that really cares about its students and though I don't always agree with everything or everyone at this school I know that being a student here means something."
College Freshman,4,A lot of people get involved with sports on campus
Recent Alumnus,4,Academics is very important. Faulty encourage students.
Recent Alumnus,4,Athletic facilities is the right size for this small commuter school.
Recent Alumnus,4,"So far, as student at North Park I have encounter wonderful faulty that encourage me to reach for my professional goal."
College Freshman,2,"Hoping this rating will change, there is a rally to support students who have been mistreated by negligent policies. The students are fighting back against North Park not supporting victims enough."
College Freshman,2,"Anderson feels like a submarine, and Burgh feels like a prison cell."
College Senior,2,"There have been a few shining moments are ARA, but for the most part, it's lackluster. It often gives people indigestion. The fruit and salad bar can be good, but it isn't always fresh. The pizza is floppy on a good day. The sandwich bar is usually a pretty good standby, but man cannot live on sandwiches alone. They have a good variety of cereals, but again, not a great or very filling option. The grill is greasy and not very good. The hot food line is usually one of the following: strange, gross, over/undersalted, cold, mushy. Vegetarians, beware. There is little for you here. Center Stage can be redeeming, although the options are not consistently good."
College Senior,2,I can't even remember hearing that there was any.
College Senior,2,"My school is far too clicky. 80% of the students are covenant and they all knew each other before they came to the school, and continue to flock together throughout their whole time there. 

It's extremely annoying."
College Senior,2,"Concerning sexual assault my school will try to cover it up if someone reports an incident, but if you tell the police they will wind up blaming a victim. That is why most people end up not reporting the crime because they don't want to be blamed. Also our security escort system is a complete joke and will refuse to pick you up if it's too late, and make you walk back to your place alone."
College Senior,2,"The only semi good sporting team on campus is our men's soccer team, and our women's rowing team. The football team is a joke. They won three games this past year and that was a major accomplishment for them."
College Junior,2,"off campus dining is not that great the only choices you have is a mcdonalds, starbucks and a charcoal delights. after two weeks you grow tired of theese three options and they don't offer healthy choices."
College Sophomore,2,"If youre not 21 then there is nothing to do close by , other than eat"
College Junior,2,Its either to cold or to hot in Chicago. your dying almost year round
College Freshman,2,It's basic cafeteria food. Too many times I end up eating pizza or a burger because the other choices are bleh.
College Freshman,2,"Not the reason to come here. It's okay, but not my first preference. Check out the cafe's on campus, go with 10 meal plan, and have money to go out to eat"
College Freshman,2,The cafÃ© isn't open at reasonable hours
College Freshman,2,Im not gaining the full college experience. Very religious. I feel like I'm repeating high school all over again
College Freshman,2,"Monday through Thursday, including Sunday visitors have to be gone by midnight. Friday and Saturday guests have to be gone by two AM. This is dorm rules. No drinking or hookah "
College Freshman,2,People often take your spot. Spots do fill up quick too and can make you late to class
College Freshman,2,There is plenty gang violence around and near campus. 
College Freshman,2,"Their are hardly any party's on campus. Everyone goes to wrigleyville or any other bar downtown. Its inconvenient too, you have to have a public transportation."
College Freshman,2,The bathrooms are very dirty
College Freshman,2,I'm not enjoying my experience at North Park University. I feel like I'm not gaining the full college experience that every man or woman should experience in their lifetime. 
College Senior,2,"Our student dining hall is known as ara. The food quality isn't very good due to a lack of variety of food selections. The students mainly eat the usual burgers, fries, and chicken burgers everyday. Since, we are located in a diverse neighborhood in northern Chicago, students will explore the different foods. However, it can be costly for a low-budget college students. The best advice to give someone would be to mix it up in the ara dining hall, instead of eating burgers for two weeks straight."
College Senior,2,I have only eaten in the cafÃ© I have never had the dining hall food. the cafÃ© however is very expensive and not worth the money.
College Senior,2,North Park is a religious school so when it comes to religious diversity there is very little. There are many different races but majority of the students are white from my experience.
College Senior,2,Chicago is one of the more expensive places to live. If sharing a place with a few roommates then its not too bad but to try and live on your own would be hard on a college student. However there are always busses running so transportation should not be a problem.
College Junior,2,It's Chicago.  You kinda just have to get used to it.  The crappy winters just make the spring and fall all the better.  Looking forward to spending a summer in the glorious festival filled air of Chi Town.
College Freshman,2,this is a Christian college so students are afraid to get caught with any type of drugs. Their morals keep them in check.
College Freshman,2,Chicago's weather is very unpredictable. The first few weeks of winter are fun but it gets old after about a month.
College Sophomore,2,"For several years students have tried to get North Park University to give students U-passes, but the attempts have not been successful."
College Sophomore,2,not much going on in the area unless you go downtown chicago
College Junior,2,"North Park in the only school in Chicago not to have the U pass...
So you have good transportation in that there is the CTA but you have to pay for it out of pocket..."
College Junior,2,We have a great security department that makes rounds through out the night and provide rides to the L stations in Chicago but  the area is too dark
College Sophomore,2,"It's freezing, granted I'm from California and not accustomed to this weather but it seems like Chicago got geographically screwed."
College Sophomore,2,"Real hot in the summers, and real cold in the winters. That's something you cannot control, sorry!"
College Junior,2,No So Hoppin â€“ If you're looking for a huge party school... North Park isn't the best option. There are parties in the apartments but nothing to get crazy about. But it is in Chicago so you can always take the brown line downtown and go to a bar!
College Senior,2,"International Students â€“ Since North Park attracts many international student, I would say about 75% of students are White since these international students come from Norway or Scandinavia. Ths drew me again because I wanted to meet new people. They are all very welcoming. It is kind of weird that Hispanics (my race) are few, but I don't mind."
College Sophomore,2,"Wireless Access: Non-Existent â€“ The wireless access at North Park University is terrible. Some days you get to connect to WiFi, some days you don't. Computer Services will do their best to help out, but when you're in there almost everyday it gets tiresome."
College Junior,2,"Very Repetitive and Less Healthy â€“ The campus dining is very low grade with what you are actually paying.  You have to be very creative if you want to eat healthy.  But, the dining hall is the campus hangout for all underclassmen which is nice to see everyone there every so often.  The food may get old, but the mind gets to improve you creativity side to eat wiser."
College Freshman,2,"Make It What You Want â€“ North Park is a dry campus, so alcohol is not allowed on campus. Of course this doesn't mean it doesn't happen. So if your looking for a big party, you might have a hard time finding one. However, there are parties and plenty to do because we are in Chicago. If you really wanted to party every night you could, but it isn't a big part school by any means. Most people at North Park are always up for getting off campus and going out on Thursday nights and the weekends to have a fun time."
College Freshman,2,Very Few Labs on Campus â€“ Theres not allot to choose from when your on campus.  Just like 3 labs in the library.
College Sophomore,2,"Take Public Transit â€“ There are plenty of ways to get to school without a car. Since, the school parking lot charges unreasonable prices, and parking that is free is taken within seconds of campus opening.. it would be best to just take public transit."
Freshman,1,No online experience. No online experience. No online experience. No online experience. No online experience.
Freshman,1,The nursing programme is wonderful! but if you are looking for pre-medical and biology there programme is new and not one you want to bank on. Looking at being realistic - advisors don't know the information they need to - you won't have a good fighting chance to getting into medical school and there  only connection to a medical school is leaving. Not an option you want to consider
Junior,1,"Does not know how to handle sexual assault cases, survivors' safety, rapist punishment, or false claims."
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,"I really wish we had Greek Life, but we don't."
College Freshman,1,Too many party's for a christian institution.
College Senior,1,Dry campus so not very many parties to speak of. The majority of the partying happens at the bar scene when you are old enough.
College Senior,1,I have never been to a worse place to eat in my life. There are no vegetarian options. No gluten free options. And hardly any dairy free options. The dining hall has been shut down five times in the last ten years for health code violations. If you don't have to eat there DO NOT!
College Freshman,1,This past winter has been the absolute worst. Living in chicago it can be 40 degrees one day thene negative 2 the next.
College Sophomore,1,"Worst teams ive seen, our football team especially is a joke."
College Senior,1,"there are not of option for food, and most of the food are stale. the taste is really bad and i think that they can make better quality of what is handed to the student. the verity is low, so we cant have as much as we want. what is really upsetting is that price for dining is really expensive for low quality food. just talking about it makes me angry."
College Senior,1,uptight students who only consider friends and fellow team members of a certain sport team.
College Senior,1,"The restaurants near school are mostly fast food and not healthy. If students do not have a car they are pretty much stuck with take out pizza, Chinese food or McDonalds."
College Freshman,1,The dining service is the worse thing about the school. The food is all you can eat but it is low quality. The pricing of the food also is not justified for what you get. (10 dollars a meal regardless of what you get) Next year there is a chance that the school will get a new dining service.
College Senior,1,Parking is limited and off-campus parking doesn't exist.
College Senior,1,This is very crowded area.  Everywhere in Chicago is expensive. I have yet to find decent housing nearby where school would be easily accessible.
College Senior,1,"North Park University is rooted in a deep tradition.  It is distinctively Christian but not a conformist environment; acceptance of diversity and ecumenism is the spirit of our campus. When it comes to campus deviance or rule breaking, it is quite strict.  Penalties range depending on the offense.  The university strives to prepare its students to be responsible citizens both globally and locally.  With that said, it is always here to help its students but will not hesitate to necessary discipline."
College Junior,1,"Bad Dorms â€“ Burgh is your best option, Anderson is so small and Ohlson is the worst. An all girls dorm that makes you want to fall asleep when you are there. The food is not so great either."
College Freshman,1,"Peer Pressure â€“ The drug scene at NPU is incredibly high. Since it's location is not too far from the city, it still gets pricey taking the train and buses to go someplace. Because of that, I know a lot of students who drink and party not too far from the campus and even on campus. A lot of peer pressure happens. I know a lot of people who did not want to get into the alcohol scene but ended up in it since it is a small community."
College Junior,1,The parking is really bad. It costs $100 per year and there is never enough parking space in the first place.

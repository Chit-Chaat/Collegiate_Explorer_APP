Freshman,5,I am a second semester freshman here at THEE illustrious Clark Atlanta University. I have always wanted to go to an HBCU and I believe attending CAU was my best choice. The professors are the best and they will try their hardest to make sure you understand the material before moving on. I am proud to be a CAU Panther!
Freshman,5,"Although my first year was cut short due to Covid-19, my school put a plan in place in order to ensure we can continue our education online and even provided enrolled students with free laptops! The professors make some classes lenient for students and even record lectures in order for students to access them any time to take notes and study. Our ""I'll Find A Way or Make One!"" game is strong!"
Freshman,5,"Clark Atlanta University is an AMAZING institution. I am currently a rising junior and I can honestly say there is never a dull moment. . I will say though, definitely MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN AFFORD 4 YEARS AT CAU BEFORE  All in all, CAU is AMAZING but choose a school that is AMAZING and affordable, and if thats CAU, well....SEE YOU SOON FELLOW PANTHER!"
Freshman,5,"Clark Atlanta University is an AMAZING institution. I am currently a rising junior and I can honestly say there is never a dull moment. At Clark Atlanta we turn up together as a family, and get our work done. I have a 3.8 GPA, and have already participated in multiple internship and research opportunities. I will say though, definitely MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN AFFORD 4 YEARS AT CAU BEFORE ENROLLING AS A FRESHMAN. It is a very expensive price tag, and I will say that it can be frustrating when your trying to have fun but you do not have enough money to make it through the semester,"
Niche User,5,The website represents itself well. Due to covid-19 it looks amazing and I love the way it looks and design of the website.
Niche User,5,"Nice school. HBCU. Love the environment and love the respect, and the administration. Have heard nothing but good things about this school. It is a respectable college that is surprisingly close to other universities and institutions."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience, due to covid 19 I had to complete the end of my freshman year online. My teachers did an amazing job with communicating with me, which made the transition smooth and painless."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school it is the perfect fit for me. Clark has diversity with spelman across the gate and morehouse across the grass. The campus life is definitely one of a kind. Clark is not only my school, it is my home."

It is a very expensive price tag, and I will say that it can be frustrating when your trying to have fun but you do not have enough money to make it through the semester(s). However, if you work really hard in high school and get a solid GPA (3.25-4.0+) and make a solid SAT score (1,100+) you'll probably qualify for a merit scholarship. The main reason I was able to afford CAU was because of a Full Tuition Scholarship (My GPA was 3.7 & SAT 1200). All in all, CAU is AMAZING but choose a school that is AMAZING and affordable, and if thats CAU, well....SEE YOU SOON FELLOW PANTHER!"
Freshman,5,I loved. I had the best college experience! The school is fun and we have a lot of fun events. The staff here is helpful and nice. the dorms are so beautiful and spacious. the cafe food is alright but we are surrounded by a lot of restaurants so food wasn't a problem
Freshman,5,This school really prepares us for our futures.  Coming here seeing all the alumni flourish and give back to their community motivates the students to continue to matriculate. Staff is very friendly and helpful and the teachers value education. Prepares us for the business world by implementing well dress Wednesday’s and other dress down days where they encourage us to wear Sunday’s best.
Freshman,5,"My experience on campus was absolutely great, the staff is family-based and very friendly. It’s like a home away from home feeling. The teachers are very understanding and reasonable."
Niche User,5,Clark Atlanta is very organized and they care about their students. When first going onto their campus they welcomed me with open arms and made sure I had everything I needed.
Niche User,5,well for me it felt like home as soon as i stepped on campus. i am currently a recruited to play football for the school. Another thing i like is that i was never really used to being in the city growing up and this will be a perfect opportunity for me to further explore city of Atlanta and get to meet a lot of new people.
Junior,5,At Clark Atlanta here at this school overall I love being here everything dealing with the atmosphere the city life everything is just wonderful. Some days the food isn’t too good but I’m more than grateful for everything being here is a blessing to me and my family
Freshman,5,"Within the first few months of being at Clark Atlanta University in my first semester, I knew that I was at the right school for me. Being that I am a business major I was excited to be immediately taking 3 classes in my major, pre calculus for business majors, business seminar, and intro to business. In each of these classes I was able to make some type of connection in them with either the professors or the course work. I was able to for the first time in a long time love learning and everyday I looked forward to going to one of these classes. With the connections that I was making I was able to excel in the classroom and receive more than adequate teaching and guidance to continue to help me through my matriculation at Clark. I can not wait to go back for my second semester and continue to make connections and continue to excel in my course work."
Freshman,5,It has been a fulfilling experience. You get a sense of community and family being there surrounded by people that you can relate to.
Niche User,5,"I found out about Clark Atlanta  from touring the campus this past summer, and I really enjoyed it. The campus visit was great I really liked getting to meet some of the students. The food was a good part as well."
Freshman,5,"Love it here, i’ve discovered many things i’ve never seen before. Everyday is a new adventure for me and my friends."
Sophomore,5,Perfect for African American students who wants to live a successful life and not just work for someone.
Freshman,5,So far the college been helpful and especially Mrs. Jackson from the scholarships department has motivated me to come because I was thinking about not attending because financially I wasn't prepared but she gave me a speech I needed to hear and now I am motivated more than ever!!
Niche User,5,the people are ok but very thing eles is good and the food was pretty good and the partys are amazing but over all things are good

Freshman,5,I love the new experiences.I feel like i’ve found my new home and am ready to start my journey as a college student !

Graduate Student,5,It’s an amazing school and the staff are great. Homecoming is the best thing that could have happened to my life.
Niche User,5,Its a great school. I would love to attend to Clark Atlanta University one day. They have a awesome arts program that I would like to attend.
Sophomore,5,hat I like about Clark Atlanta University is everyone treats you like family. You get the experience of a large campus because Spellman College and Morehouse College are right next door.  Everyone is very uplifting and encouraging. I like the student engagement. There is always something to involve yourself in. We also have fried chicken Wednesday and catfish Friday. And we have well-dressed (business attire) Wednesdays. I love the orientation guides corp; they are a great assistance for incoming students. There are many chances to become a campus queen which encourages confidence in young black women. I would like to see the housing issues changed by creating more housing for incoming Freshman and upper classmen so they have the opportunity to stay on campus.
Niche User,5,"What I experienced at The Illustrious Clark Atlanta University is the Pride that they have about their University. It is an HBCU however it’s International Alumni are very diverse. Being a prospective student and my parents both have attended CAU I am very excited to apply in the Fall of 2019. The campus is very clean and decorative. Very good energy that I get from the students that go there. I’ve talked with some of my prospective professors and they have already encourages success in my academic future. I am very happy I took a personal and official tour visit. I love Clark Atlanta University it teaches about heritage and how it correlates with the lesson plan...it’s amazing to me. Finally, my parents were right for once."
Freshman,5,"I just love Clark Atlanta Unviersity.  Everyone is so friendly and willing to help.  I am orginally from Illinois so me trying to navigate GA at times were challenging, but the peolpe are so nice.  The administration is the best. I graduated early from my HS, so I started in January 2019 and not the normal freshman term of the Fall and the students made me feel right at home.  I am applying to as many scholarships as I can because I come from a single parent home and the tuition is more than my mom can handle, so without scholarships I will not be able to return.  I am trying to do everything I can to return to Clark Atlanta University.  My GPA is 3.8 on a 4.0 scale so I am hoping I can secure some scholarships."
Freshman,5,I like the diversity and the ability to meet new people whether you come from the same type of background or not.
Sophomore,5,There's no place like CAU! At Clark Atlanta University I learn so much about myself and the people around me as well as my history! CAU has given me some of my best friends and greatest lessons of my life
Sophomore,5,I love CAU because it feels like a home away from home. It is beyond valuable to be able to connect and share ideas with the faculty and fellow students there. I've made friendships and connections that will last a lifetime.
Junior,5,Clark has a lot of good opportunities and resources available to their students. There are also a plethra of opportunities between the Atlanta University Consortium.
Freshman,5,"I liked the culture of this HBCU the most. The hospitality is great, they welcome you in with open arms and bright smiles, and heartfelt complements. I would highly recommend this quote to anyone of color because it’s not only a great cultural school it is great academically as well ."
Freshman,5,"The top 3 reasons why someone should attend Clark Atlanta University is because they offer exceptional education due to the fact that they are among the best HBCU's in the nation. Clark Atlanta open many door for students who are looking to reach the next step in their future, and they also really look out for the student helping them stay on track with grades and making sure that they do no overwork themselves or underestimate each students potential.Clark Atlanta University has a great location and there is always something you can do. You are able to take classes at Spelman and Morehouse with out an extra fee. This college has many activities that you can participate in as well as the other campuses."
Sophomore,5,"I love Clark Atlanta University's staff of professors.  They are extremely interested in the education and well being of their students

I wouldn't change a thing"
Freshman,5,"Clark Atlanta University give me the ultimate HBCU experience as an African American student. Since I came from a predominantly white high school, it is a cultural shock to now go to school with predominantly black students. However, the pros to this are it helps me to be around other much like myself and be able to connect and build my brand. Networking on campus is also key and it is easy to do so on this campus because it is so small. I believe living on campus and living this new lifestyle has made me look at myself differently and when I say that I mean in a way to try to find myself and learn ""who am I?"""
Freshman,5,I took a college tour down there and I loved the vibe the admission. They are really diverse down there. Their programs aren’t like regular programs they have professors that make it fun.
Freshman,5,"Great school and environment, you feel at home and never have to worry about your safety. Being an out of state student it was difficult to adapt at first but my surrounding peers were able to make me feel at home."
Freshman,5,The Academics at Clark Atlanta is great they have great professors and the overall Atmosphere is great and nurturing
Freshman,5,I absolutely love my HBCU! Right when you step on campus you feel at home. It’s so uplifting and fun experience and I’m so happy I’m having my college experience at Clark Atlanta University!

Freshman,5,I loved the tour it was really interesting. I am hoping that i can get accepted to thus college because doing fashion design would work for me in the future.
Niche User,5,I love the energy you get when you step foot on campus. It literally felt like my home town. Everyone is so nice and caring. I definitely will be going back for an official college visit soon.
Niche User,5,"I loved the school in general, I went to tour the school over the summer and it had everything I expected from it. Theres an abundant amount of student life, there are great professors, and its just a great campus in a wonderful area. I wouldn't change a thing about the illustrious Clark Atlanta University."
Sophomore,5,I love the experience here ! It’s a beautiful scenery and there is something always going on. The staff helps you when u need help and the work is easy . There are many clubs and kegs that keeps students active throughout the year and it is excellent. Clark Atlanta is a big family. THe best experience is being at Clark Atlanta having fun with friends
Senior,5,"Clark Atlanta University is like some to me. You become very close to the professors and within your department. Professors are willing to help you at anytime, whether it is studying, test prep or helping you with Graduate programs and internships."
Freshman,5,I haven't been to actual school yet but i did attend my orientation and i can tell my school is great school. I love my hbcu.
Graduate Student,5,"Clark Atlanta University (CAU) is an extraordinary institution that prepares students to become productive citizens, the University motto speaks for itself ""I’ll Find a Way or Make One”. 

The experiences obtained at CAU are impeccable, professors are extremely knowledgeable and effective. The professors have a keen way of forcing students to meet their expectations, whenever you are not performing at your fullest potential. Once expectations are met or exceeded professors have an amiable way of informing students that expectations have been met.

I am enjoying CAU, the rigor that’s instilled within the courses, and the fostering of my critical thinking skills. I have learned a tremendous amount of information from CAU that will provide guidance while navigating through the educational sector and I am looking forward to learning more as I complete my doctoral program. 

I would like to see a scholarship increase for graduate students."
Junior,5,"My experience at Clark Atlanta University has shaped me into the successful student that I am today. The professors take time to develop and enhance the growth of students, which helps mold them into leaders of the future. From a student life aspect, I made a lot of long life friends and made countless memories. With Clark Atlanta University being located in the heart of the city of Atlanta, there are many adventures to partake on. Within a 10-15 radius, a student can gave access to the Mercedes Benz Stadium, Downtown Atlanta, various food options, and so much more! I wouldn't trade my experience at Clark Atlanta University for anything in the world."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Clark Atlanta has been one of the best experiences I have ever had. I am so happy I chose to attend such and illustrious University where I can meet people and create a bond that will last a lifetime. There are some things that Clark Atlanta can work on such as housing and scholarships are concerned but other than that Clark Atlanta University is a great choice.
Sophomore,5,"Being apart of an HBCU is an amazing experience! The staff is extremely helpful and welcoming. The professors’ doors are always open for you to ask questions, receive help and find a friend!"
Freshman,5,Clark Atlanta is a great school and I'm enjoying my college experience thus far.  It was my only choice to attend for College and I have no regrets at all.  Clark Atlanta is maturing me as a young adult and again I'm loving the experience.
Niche User,5,"I recently toured this college and absolutely loved it! The students were very prideful in their school and advocated for the hbcu experience in general as the one you won't get anywhere else. The professors new the students by name which was very encouraging. The campus, in general, was gorgeous and I am sure that this is the school for me!"
Freshman,5,"The school is in the heart of downtown. Rich culture, a lot of diversity. I highly recommend this school to anyone considering. There are also many great fraternities and sororities"
Sophomore,5,I am having a wonderful experience thus far. I only wish the campus can be closed off in certain sections to keep the outside population from wondering on campus. I know of certain things happening but I feel the campus is safe.
Freshman,5,My experience at Clark so far have been a remarkable one. What i like the most about it is the professors do not mind giving you one on one help outside of class and academics is a number 1 priority around here.  What i would like to see change is more scholarships giving out because people choose not to attend Bc of the tuition and not being offered any financial help.
Junior,4,"This transition was difficult for both students and professors, I believe my remote learning experience has  been fairly easy."
Junior,4,"Clark Atlanta was the perfect after high school environment that  promoted  the success of their Black student body, making my transition exceptionally easy."
Graduate Student,4,I love the professionalism of professors and the study abroad program. I would change the financial aid process to better accommodate the students.
Sophomore,4,Clark Atlanta University is a great place if you want the Historically Black University experience. It is often overlooked because of the other colleges withing the AUC. The culture is unbeatable. STEM program can definitely get better.
Freshman,4,"For the 2019-2020 Academic year, I was an incoming freshman. Before my matriculation at CAU began, there was a shooting at our library's and two of my classmates were shot. Our school year started off extremely eerie; however, Clark Atlanta ensured their students that they were there for support. Later on in the fall semester, a CAU student went missing and was later found dead. This was another time of fear and uncertainty at CAU, but they still ensured the students that they were there for support. CAU handled all hardships and unexpected inconveniences with care and in the best way possible. The CAU motto is ""find a way or make one,"" and they surely stuck to throughout the entire academic school year, especially when Covid-19 struck. CAU is the epitome of a true HBCU experience. They teach their students to grow, hustle, and never fold under pressure. My experience at Clark Atlanta University has been tremendous."
Sophomore,4,"Overall education wise and experience Clark Atlanta Universe is an amazing HBCU. Everyone looks out for one another it’s like there is a sense of family, very soon into the semester you’ll feel like this could be a home away from home for you. Advisement could be a bit disorganized at times but majority of the time they help and coach you through everything. It really isn’t hard to make friends or find a mentor on campus. As well as a job if necessary. Everything is right there. I am proud to call myself a panther and hopefully one day you can call yourself one too."
Niche User,4,Clark Atlanta is my #1 pick. This school lives up to 100% of my expectations and I would not change anything but the dorms.
Junior,4,"My experience at Clark Atlanta University has changed throughout the years. Clark Atlanta University does not help students financially  who are suffering emotionally, physically and emotionally. Its not benefital for students who are trying and going through the different phases of life."
Niche User,4,"Clark Atlanta University is a very diverse campus. The culture is rich and alive, which is something that I've looked for in schools that I would like to attend. Clark Atlanta University is very highly spoken of and it lives up to that reputation, with academic opportunities along with social ones as well. My experience visiting the campus was filled with excitement and a vision of my bright future. I wish to attend Clark Atlanta University as a biracial student that can succeed from this type of environment."
Freshman,4,I love being at an HBCU. I feel welcomed by everyone And feel as if the professors really try to connect with their students.
Junior,4,Everything is great but the administrative offices need a little help. I would recommend CAU.  I’m glad I chose CAU. Great education.
Sophomore,4,Clark is a great HBCU that believes in their students. Professors are willing to assist where needed. Student life is great! There is a lot of activities in campus to get involved in. You never have to leave campus to find things to do.
Sophomore,4,"Although the transfer process is a little difficult considering the fact that you will have many questions and concerns while trying to make sure you're completing all of the steps correctly but not being able to be in contact with the correct people when they're in a meeting or just not answering the phone but other than that the overall experience is great and there is always someone willing to help whether it's in the beautiful AUC library, cafe, or classroom."
Niche User,4,"From what I know about CAU, it is a great university to go to if you want to expand you knowledge on your major because they give in-depth lectures that are very understandable."
Senior,4,"Going to Clark Atlanta University was the best decision of my life!! The teachers care about you as well as the rest of the staff of the university. Now although, the school does like to play with your credits when it comes to graduating on time. After going back an forth with administration on missing credits they finally added them and everything was back n track! Campus life was great !!!"
Niche User,4,It gives you a good look at what it was like back then and how hard it was for African Americans to attend a university.
Alum,4,The faculty staff is very supportive of assisting students with reaching their academic goals. The operation hours need to be revised because there are many unforeseen instances where certain offices are temporarily closed during documented operation hours with no representative to receive messages or relay a time to call back.
Niche User,4,when touring clark atlanta i realized it was a lot to veiw it was pretty big so it was a lot to see and learn about i also noticed that they had real people who where attending the college actually giving the tour so it was good having a insight on clark through someone who was actually attending the school .
Junior,4,A very supportive school. I have learned a great deal from the staff and students. I have a better person for it
Freshman,4,"CAU is a great place for students to learn and grow within their field. The University has many long-standing partnerships with corporations around the city and the nation. Students are nurtured and pushed to their full potential in their studies. CAU being nestled in the AUC provided students with varying learning opportunities at Spelman and Morehouse as well. The ability to connect with two other schools simultaneously provided students with the ability to learn and grow their experiences. Ultimately, CAU is a fantastic place to grow and come of age."
Freshman,4,At Clark Atlanta I like the campus life because you meet so many intelligent young black minds and interesting background's. Clark Atlanta is a school I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to belong and somewhere where they can truly be themselves.
Sophomore,4,The campus and professors are outstanding. They actually care about the students not only in school but outside of school . They will give you the best hbcu experience to me . I love the school and happy with the decision I made . The school to me doesn’t get the credit it deserves. I believe the school is way more valuable than everyone thinks.
Sophomore,4,"Clark Atlanta University is a very expensive school, over priced in my opinon. Nonetheless, you get your money's worth while attending CAU. CAU is in the heart of Atlanta and is part of the AUC, which is a whole different community itself. CAU offers real life experience, trial and error, and opportunity. The institution is a HBCU and a good size. It allows it's students to be creative and successful. I do wish that CAU would invest in their students more."
Senior,4,I enjoy being a student at Clark Atlanta University. It shines the light on our Ancestors as we continue day by day on their same path.
Freshman,4,The student life is good. We have a lot of social events on campus. The school similar to most HBCUs are disorganized. They all over the place. We always have a housing crisis and we don't even have the best housing arrangements compared to local colleges. The cafe food isnt the best.  They swear all black people eat chicken and its sometimes prison food.
Freshman,4,"Clark Atlanta University is what you make it but that's with any college. The professors are great, but administration is unorganized."
Sophomore,4,"Clark Atlanta University is a very good school for three reasons: 
1. Family oriented- everyone welcomed me my first semester. In the fall, there is a week where freshman have to mingle and get to know each other.
2. The professors are very understanding. At the same time, hold you at a high level of expectation. 
3. There are so many events on campus. You will have a good time at each event. These events will be inside and outside. Very fun."
Freshman,4,"Clark Atlanta University falls under the category of a historical black college or university. Being a black American, attending this school that is apart of the AUC has brought many opportunities. One of those opportunities would be the kind of people I am surrounded by. Because this is a popular school in the Black American community, there are people who come from all over to attend creating a very diverse environment. This applies to the professors as well."
Alum,4,My experience at Clark Atlanta University was amazing! I love my HBCU! The professors were very concern about their students and still are after graduation.
Freshman,4,The things I like about Clark Atlanta is the culture and creativity. Often times you will always find somewhere to fit in and people to socialize with. The school can approve of Financial aid and get better at the organization. The learning environments are judge free zones and there are always conversations going.  Overall I have had a really good time at the school
Niche User,4,I 'm having a wonderful experience with Clark Atlanta University. They always pick up the phone when I call and have questions about anything. They are quick on their replies as well. They make sure you have everything you need in order to get accepted.
Alum,4,"Great school. Ensure that you stay focused on your educational goal because it is easy to get caught up in the social life of all the universities and the city life. There are many events happening around campus. There are many different classes, labs, and study places that will help you focus."
Sophomore,4,A very excellent and worthy HBCU. I recommend attendance to all young African American students looking to pursue a career especially in Atlanta. Offers great resources and connections to its students. In addition campus life is very fun and activity filled. Although students must be financially prepared for tuition expenses and things of that nature. Aside from that the student will be well equipped for their future career after attending the university and will most likely be actively in their field before graduation.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Clark Atlanta University was eventful but was also a learning experience. Clark does a great job at giving you the resources we need to become the successful adults we thrive to be. Clark gives us countless opportunities to get our talents and name out there and connects us with successful, well known people and companies. Clark is very hands on when it comes to our education and future."
Freshman,4,"Clark Atlanta University is a very great school, specifically for those who major in business and mass media. There are a lot of opportunities provided to those specific majors and finding a job after graduation will not be a problem at all. Clark provides students with many resources to succeed and network with many people. The school is also located in a popular city where many well established people live therefore, enhancing opportunities as well."
Freshman,4,I would like to more scholarships and ways to help student finish school without so much debt. Also working on providing housing and no taking students housing at the last minute.
Freshman,4,"It has been a very good year so far, I am a football player, and the advantages that I've had are excellent. I have met many people, and learned about many new cultures. I was afraid at first, but everyday got better, my professors are very helpful. I have learned to humble myself, and be a better person. I plan to get more organized, entering my second semester as a freshman. But I am so happy that I chose this HBCU, I am proud to be a Panther."
Niche User,4,The campus is very open and has good history behind the campus with a lot of opportunities advertised on campus
Junior,4,"Attending an HBCU was one of the best decisions I have ever made, but choosing CAU was even better. I really enjoy my time at Clark. They have many different programs to offer to students to make their time at Clark the best it can be. Clark allows students to be themselves while also making them a better student and person in the community."
Niche User,4,its a great college they have a good campus life they are very diverse even though its a hbcu overall good school.
Junior,4,Clark Atlanta University is an immensely supportive school;  they aid their students in acquiring the necessary skills needed to further matriculation and prepare its students for adulthood. The faculty cultivates each of their students by giving them the tools that will be advantageous to their futures.
Junior,4,"ake plans to attend the CAU Experience beginning Friday, August 12, 2016.  The CAU Experience is 5 days of exciting activities and workshops designed to welcome students to their new home away from home, and will offer students a historical perspective of Clark Atlanta University.  New students will also participate in a formal induction ceremony, which is a rite of passage to becoming an official Clark Atlanta University student."
Niche User,4,"I haven't personally experienced it myself but I do a lot of research and from my understanding this is one of the top schools besides Spelman and Morehouse, which is very close together."
Junior,4,"I love the school, it has great spirt and an awesome atmostphere! I wish it was more scholarships.   Also, the Music Department really needs alot of funding and renovations. More equipment and newer equipment would be really helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Coming from a predominantly white high school and attending a historical black university was a huge culture shock. Clark Atlanta University has opened my eyes about who I am, who I can be, and to appreciate my history. By giving me and my fellow peers a chance to network and learn by using similarities and differences between each other our education seems to be unlimited. Clark Atlanta University is a great school but like any school it is not perfect. Communication with the universities staff and financial advisers can be a little difficult but I will say it teaches you patience and perseverance which has benefited me in the long run with getting things done."
Junior,4,"Great culture and experience. I love attending this HBCU. The faculty could be better and more organized but the professors are pretty good. Diverse, family vibe, empowering."
Sophomore,4,"As a Rising Sophomore at the Illustrious Clark Atlanta University, I would say that I have had a truly wonderful HBCU experience. The campus is lively and exciting. Everyone on campus is willing to help make your experience at CAU the best experience of your life. When you come to CAU it really feels as though you are apart of a big family."
Sophomore,4,"As a Rising Sophomore at the Illustrious Clark Atlanta University I must say that I am gaining a true HBCU experience and a phenomenal education. The atmosphere at CAU is joyous and uplifting. Everyone on campus, including faculty and staff are willing to help make the experience at Clark Atlanta one to remember."
Junior,4,I have attended Clark Atlanta University since my freshman year. I am now a junior and I love my institution. I recently changed my major to business administration and I’m loving the classes and professors.
Junior,4,"I have had my issues with Clark Atlanta,like any university you will attend but I can honesty say coming to Clark Atlanta University was the best decision for me. Initially I was going to attend Howard University but there were some issues with my housing, When I decided I was going to CAU instead I was wondering if I was making the right choice but now I do not regret my decision at all. Professors like Dr. Bass if you are interested in psych, Dr. Boyer and Dr. Kimbro if you are going to be a business major and Dr. Thomas teaches the best humanities class that will open your eyes. All of them are the best professors you are going to have during your matriculation. We are in the process of a transformation and if you take one step on the campus now. It feels like a whole new campus and a whole new University experience. I have met some of the best people while attending CAU."
Freshman,4,"Although, I am currently a freshman and will be a sophomore when I return in the fall, there is a lot that I have witnessed. I enjoy how although I attend a HBCU and majority is of African American decent, we are all different. We are different from the ways that we talk, where we are from, and even who we are as people. Although I am enjoying my first year here, there are multiple things that I will be looking forward to in my years to come."
Junior,4,"My experience here has been an irreplaceable one. I do not think there could be any other university that could give me as much as Clark has given me so far. It's not perfect, but it definitely feels like home and there is a diverse amount of perspectives here on campus. Of course there needs to be improvements, but I believe I made the right choice in coming here."
Sophomore,4,Clark Atlanta is a really good school.  My favorite part about the school is the student life. Everybody seems like a family. The professors are all great teachers. The one thing I would like to see changed is the amount of security on campus.
Freshman,4,"I love the school's culture. We have fried chicken, market Thursdays homecoming week and so much more. There is also so much opportunity and contacts within the AUC if you put yourself out there. They conduct job fairs each semester where real companies come to Clark, looking for Clark students and offering real jobs and internships. All along the school they have flyers and posters for interested companies, club entries, and opportunities to show off personal talents.  I love my school."
Freshman,4,"Clark Atlanta University is a great school to attend if you are interested in fashion, mass media arts, and business."
Junior,4,My experience at CAU since freshman year has been rewarding.  The professors have been interested  in the students and ensuring that the student body learns and reach their potential.  The guidance counsellors have been exceptional in providing direction and ensuring you are on track.  The administration takes student problems and issues seriously and listens to the student body with respect.  I currently belong to several college organizations.  CAU offers a wide academic selection of courses for students to choose from and I believe my experiences will indeed attribute to me becoming very successful in my future.
Freshman,4,"I personally have enjoyed my Freshman experience. I currently play athletics, therefore, I have daily challenges. My day starts off with a 5am practice, class at 8am, then studying, practice and studying."
Niche User,4,I have been there to do a tour and I fell in love. This school had so much to offer and is now on the top of my list.
Sophomore,4,What I would like to see change ATL clark Atlanta university is the security and the quality of the dorms.
Sophomore,4,"Clark Atlanta University provides an experience like no other! There’s many organizations and extra curricular activities available to get involved in, community service events, and the professors really care about their students! Campus life is always lively and the students have a bond like no other. l’d definitely consider this a “second home”!"
Junior,2,Online learning was challenging because of technology issues and inconsistent learning. Clark Atlanta is not a good school for online learning. I think that they excel with in person teachings rather than online teachings.
Freshman,2,"Overall, I believe Clark Atlanta is an average private institution... if you are not i n the STEM program. I say this because in my experience, the science and math departments have been incompetent, and not very helpful towards students. Additionally, for those who have to come out of pocket, as I did, you are not getting your money's wort at all. If you're on a scholarship, by all means, take advantage of that. If not, do your research both online and with other students before paying that $38-40,000."
Sophomore,2,"The thought of attending an HBCU is one of the most amazing thoughts, in my opinion. Going into a new state I was expecting something amazing. However, that’s not what it was. The campus life is so boring and it’s not what I envisioned of this institution."
Freshman,2,I love the  students and the positive atmosphere that the school has but i wish that there was better communication overall.
Freshman,2,"Clark Atlanta University has a great environment culturally but this is overshadowed by the mediocre curriculum and overpriced tuituon, fees and room and board for the poor quality you receive in return."
Freshman,2,Its really not all that. They don't care about students safety or look to fix any of the issues brought to their attention. The food is nasty but they do keep that grass cut.
Freshman,2,"Suck for a HBCU!  No band, terrible football team, 4 of 5 teachers are hard to understand. Open campus even though its supposed to be private. no hall directors, boys lived in all girls hall without anyone knowing. Does not have enough housing for all students. Dorms are old and dirty.  Crackheads come on campus. Do not walk to Walmart alone (only a block away). A party every night in the dorms, bothering those who wish to attend class. How is the food bad in the heart of Atlanta! After the first week of classes everything goes downhill."
Sophomore,2,Financial didnt help much because tution was so high. Clark atlanta is private so it did not receive funding from the government . So you eithr have to be rich or your parents have to take out a parent plus loan.  My mom was denied the parent plus so i had to go home after the first semester. Other than that clark has alot of energy.
College Freshman,2,"Not the best it could be, needs a lot of work"
College Sophomore,2,We don't have our own gym with weights and equipment. Most of the time people travel over to Morehouse's campus and use their gym.
College Sophomore,2,The area that were in is a bad area so I would prefer our campus to be a closed campus rather then a open one:(
College Senior,2,The security should use their time better to ensure the safety of the students.
College Junior,2,"Currently the Men of Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, and Iota phi Theta are not on the yard.

Currently the Ladies of Sigma Gamma Rho are not on the yard"
College Junior,2,"The athletics at my school is bad, not enough money and effort is put into increasing team performance, fan support, and school spirit."
College Freshman,2,I know everyone smokes and drinks
College Freshman,2,The halls had a funny smell and wasn't comfortable
College Freshman,2,"The basketball gym is tiny, pretty old, and should be remodeled. The basketball Team and Football team aren't the best at winning but homecoming was fun."
College Freshman,2,The rules are really strict depending on the housing you stay at and often the visitation is taken away because some people make bad decisions.
College Freshman,2,My school's sports team needs to recruit.
College Sophomore,2,We are not d1 school and we rarely win games.
College Freshman,2,The security on campus is bad.
College Sophomore,2,So far I haven't received any aid except loans.
College Sophomore,2,They are apart of the already bad neighborhood.
College Sophomore,2,Always fighting and getting shut done.
College Sophomore,2,As much money as we pay to go we need more options
College Sophomore,2,Do not like to find money for students to stay.
College Sophomore,2,Hours of operation are terrible.
College Freshman,2,Takes hours for the food to come
College Freshman,2,A lot of times they're too strict.  I chose to come to college to not  be treated like a kid and yet I'm still being treated like one by Clark and its officers.
College Freshman,2,I continuously try to receive some kind of aid from the school or the government.  the school is always saying that they don't have any money to give out and I am in desperate need for money.
College Freshman,2,Always makes you go to the bathroom.
College Freshman,2,There is not enough options.
College Freshman,2,The faculty can be very rude.
College Sophomore,2,Oh the financial aid office is slow and packed. Only a handful of the workers actually know how to help you.
College Freshman,2,It does not look safe or good quality.
College Freshman,2,I don't like that we can not have outside visitation.
College Freshman,2,People are getting robbed but no one it around to protect anyone.
College Freshman,2,Safety and security on campus are not very good. Our campus is open and in the city so anybody can come on and off it. There have been many robberies but not many sexual assaults. Public safety is weak and I don't always feel safe on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The local area is very bad there's not much to do, see or eat around. We have to go far and pay for transportation to get there."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is an open campus; therefore, one must be careful especially at night."
College Freshman,2,The Houses are very poorly kept up with.
College Freshman,2,I feel this school can do better
College Junior,2,This is always a challenge.
College Freshman,2,The school doesn't like giving money and its ridiculous. You stay on hold to get false information.
College Freshman,2,"The admission office is terrible, the young workers don't help. Scholarships are needed but they are stingy with money."
College Freshman,2,"Fan support is terrible, because most students do not show up to any of the games."
College Freshman,2,"For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the options of cooked and uncooked fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, legumes, and sprouts needs to be much increased."
College Freshman,2,"Because students are quite often robbed by non-students, I do not feel safe on Clark Atlanta University's campus."
College Junior,2,They're worried about the wrong things.
College Junior,2,Financial Aid staff is extremely inconsistent.
College Junior,2,Better off eating off campus.
College Junior,2,Girl's varsity basketball team is the only sports team worth mentioning.
College Sophomore,2,"The registration process at CAU is very, very slow. You have to stay on top of them consistently. Any other way, things will not get done."
College Senior,2,I wish there was more variety
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is very slow
College Sophomore,2,Officers need to be more alert.
College Freshman,2,Sororities/Fraternities are suspended or are very likely to be..
College Freshman,2,"I received a scholarship this year.  I had a lot of family issues and I did not do as well as I should, so now I have to find money to remain in school. Staff appears to only help who they want to help. I am doing better now."
College Freshman,2,there needs to be more campus police to prevent robberies. Health center needs to be more convenient.
College Freshman,2,"I do not feel safe on my campus. Because of the area that the school is in and the incidents happened before, the school should have the most high quality of security but that is what it lacks the most. I have received many emails of school students being robbed at gun point and nothing is being done about it because it is happening repeatedly. Homeless peoplle have walked in our school cafeteria and  have not been caught or escorted out until minutes after walking in. People who do not attend the school walk on and around our campis on a day to day basis."
Graduate Student,1,I did not take any classes online at the school. All of my undergraduate Classes were taking on campus in a classroom setting.
Freshman,1,Due to the Covid-19 I had not been enrolled into classes yet. The school was very unorganized with sending emails for updates and etc.
Freshman,1,"Clark Atlanta University was very unprofessional. Me and another Brianna Booker applied for the same semester to start school and they ended up sending the other Brianna all of my information including my social security number. I tried reaching out to the school and sent emails and everything, no one ever got back to me. The school was unsupportive even when I called to ask questions about enrolling to the school before the incident even happened. Nobody knew anything they were all just there to be there literally."
Senior,1,The Business School is beyond awesome but as the university as a whole its awful. The financial aid office is beyond unorganized and never communicates properly. Its made my senior year the absolute worst.
Freshman,1,"Clark Atlanta University is not what people make it out to be. I dreamed of coming to this school and within my first few months of being here I quickly regretted it. I wouldn't waste my time at this institution, and this is the most unprofessional setting I have ever experienced. Besides the tragic and straight disgusting dorms this school drains your pockets for every dollar you have. Please don't come here."
Freshman,1,"Clark was a horrible experience. The living was terrible its something Clark should really work on. The second thing about the experience is the neighborhood the school is in, its a terrible choice, so many bad things happen over there."
Senior,1,"Great school Education wise, but when it comes to public safety Clark Atlanta is corrupt , one officer was fired for have forced relations with a student, MY NAME IS GREGORY TAYLOR (@RICHSINCEBIRTH1) Clark Atlanta public safety keeps pulling me over saying im speeding and honestly don't go over 20 mph, as of Professors they are wonderful, but the thought of getting shot by chief little and his clan after I pass my chemistry test is scary, this is my last semester at Clark I will find a way or take one. @Richsincebirth1 on ig follow me"
Junior,1,My overall experience with Clark Atlanta University was atrocious. It was hard for me to keep up with a lot of things from classes to tuition. There should be a mentor program for new students and transfer students.
College Sophomore,1,The football team is pretty awful. So the school doesnt really support them well.
College Sophomore,1,Financial Aid Office needs help. They are rude and do not like working with students.
College Freshman,1,"Getting money here through scholarships, internships, etc is really hard. They do not give too much money for sports or any help."
College Freshman,1,"They dont like to help, nor give money to those who really need it."
College Senior,1,I understand and agree to have rules but why not compromise .
College Sophomore,1,"The only problem Clark has is the visitation policy.. 6-11:30. That's horrible. We are adults, we should be able to have 24 hour visitation."
College Sophomore,1,"I personally do not like the food. WOW is pretty decent. But for us to be paying $37,000 a year we should have better cafeteria food, more options and more places on campus that sell food."
College Sophomore,1,They sometimes treat us like children.
College Freshman,1,CAU is terrible when it comes to visitation - not sure why we're all adults. yet still being controlled.. 6:30 - 11
College Freshman,1,No one supports the teams except basketball but its mostly a fashion show and its free to students so its something to do but no one pays sports any attention really other than boys basketball. Its not easy joining the teams.
College Freshman,1,"The curriculum was so easy and not challenging made the academics the worse. The professors don't care if you come or not and give a ton of work (easy) but the number of students that actually showed to class made the teachers have you just sign your name on the roster to receive a grade just for showing up. The basic math classes are not challenging but the educators do not educate they review what you should already know and if you don't you just fail. No help is given, no calculators aloud and it is super easy to cheat on the online test and homework. You learn nothing its like high school all over again. All in all don't come to class with your own opinion because you will be shot down, no debate, if and or buts about it. It is the teacher's way or not at all even if they are wrong based on facts. End of discussion and You better know your African American History."
College Freshman,1,It is necessary to have a car on this campus. The shuttles and bus services do not run as often as some people need it to. I personally need a car because of my appetite and due to my job I have off campus.
College Freshman,1,"I am suppose to be in the better, more expensive dorms."
College Sophomore,1,Majority of the Greek life is suspended. 
College Student,1,i would probaly live with an family member
College Freshman,1,I think the finical aid department can be more organize and helpful. 
College Freshman,1,I don't like the visitation in our dorms I feel its to strict for our age.
College Freshman,1,I go to a HBCU but we have a lot of transfer from other countries 
College Freshman,1,Most people on campus use drugs and alcohol but its not a pressuring thing.
College Freshman,1,Free parking is good but it fills up to quickly. The parking permit cost to much for college students. 
College Junior,1,"If you don't have a permit for parking, the free spots around campus fill up quick."
College Junior,1,Financial Aid takes forever because of lack of workers or they just take their time to assist students. However when I got assisted all my financial problems were handled.
College Sophomore,1,For people with good grades they're decent I suppose but for need base children it's terrible because it goes off merit first which doesn't make much sense since there is already alot of scholarships for them. Maybe if the need based students had a chance of extra help with the expensive tuition their grades wouldn't be so bad! Horrible system!
College Student,1,i don't really eat inside the school like that unless i have to
College Sophomore,1,We have a small campus parking garage and I am frustrated that they make us pay for parking when we are students there who pay $750 for 3 credit hrs of class. Our school is already expensive why continue to take out of our pocket? There needs to be another parking lot created somewhere near campus. Grad students always have a hard time parking when wen we come to campus.You also have to be careful about parking on side streets because they have a person who rides around in a white trucks who passes out tickets.
College Junior,1,"They are not really helpful with giving out scholarships, and only give them to their favorites"
College Sophomore,1,"I am writing this review under the category of ""Facilities,"" because there is not a selection for Student Accounts and Financial Aid, or the Registrar.  I will be completely honest in this review, and I want to acknowledge that I love Clark Atlanta University, and have no other problems with the university, other than the categories that I have listed above.  

  If you are used to dealing with businesses and individuals that lack proper organization and customer service skills, then by all means, apply to Clark Atlanta University.  Be prepared to spend hours of your precious time standing in long lines,and experiencing complete confusion when completing simple tasks, like: academic advisement/academic registration/asking questions about financial aid/transfer credits/student housing/receiving paychecks/receiving refunds/locating buildings on campus/getting straight and CORRECT answers to your questions.  

  Yet again, I will emphasize that I hold no grudges towards the university that I attend, but I feel that it is my duty to share my honest, first-hand experience with prospective students who are thinking about transferring (what I did; big mistake) and/or applying to Clark Atlanta University.  

  To sum it up: the administrative offices at the university a re grossly antiquated, unorganized, and 99% UNHELPFUL when it comes to properly handling your important business.  If you want a stress-free college environment, I would strongly advise you to avoid/rethink applying to CAU if you were already in the process of applying, had already applied, or were considering applying.  

  Academically, the school is excellent, especially the School of Mass Media Arts.  

  I truly hope this review helps someone."
College Student,1,"Our Males basketball team and Football team is not very good at all. The games are crowded because they are free. Not many people watch the game, Tailgating is the major event...very social. Not much team spirit, the Greeks take over the attention. The facilities are ok but could easily be updated. Because we are a division II not many scholarships are given out and it is hard to join teams..alot of paperwork, not very organized."
College Senior,1,"The football team is in transition. We support all athletics but the football team  is not on the level it once was. It will take a little time but we have some gifted players on the team and once the new coach makes his assessment we should be the great ""Panther Nation"" we used to be."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't apply for a parking permit, which are really first come first serve, you have to park in the garage but it costs $5 a day."
College Senior,1,THE AREA IS NOT THE SAFEST WITH SOME THEFTS. PUBLIC SAFETY FROM THE AUC DOES PATROL THE AREAS.
College Senior,1,The police force is very lazy. Our policies are however very strict; to the extent that you may not be able to participate in certain activities if you have poor grades and if you obtain a judicial. The policies are implemented by student afairs which is why they work. When dealing with police officers they are very lazy and run away from confrontation.
College Sophomore,1,There is a parking garage however they charge students to park in there which isn't fair. It is bad enough we pay high rates to attend so why not have ample parking? Also Clark is surrounded by Spelman and Moorehouse  so the parking gets crazy sometimes. I usually have to park about 2 block from the main campus which is aggrevating
College Freshman,1,This is a HBCU so most of the students here are African American but we do have other races that come to this school also.
College Freshman,1,"There are not very many attracitons in walking distance, but they are around (Coca Cola Factory, aquarium, zoo, etc).  However, the community has a high crime rate and there are many homeless people around.  The town of Atlanta, itself has a lot to offer and there is lots of networking that can be done."
College Freshman,1,We pay too much money to have C/C- quality food and have to starve after 6 p.m. on weekends.
College Student,1,It can be better. It generally depends on what professors you get.
College Student,1,"The weather is HORRIBLE. It doesnt want to make up it's mind. Everyone considers it ""Bipolar weather"" since one second it can be very humid and hot then an hour later it is freezing cold with a cold air. If you are not used to Southern weather, you will hate the weather here."
College Junior,1,Financial Aid office gave me the run around on everything.
College Junior,1,"Ups and Down – Parking is a hassle even in the parking deck. You might see a homeless person walking, but it's still safe, police monitor through out the day. At night it's hard for visitation. The dorm rooms are old. But what can I say things change every year."
College Sophomore,1,"Teachers Are Not Dependable – It is hard to get in contact with teachers outside of the class and during the summer, while they are supposed to be on campus they are near impossible to contact or get in touch with. Teachers will wait until the last minute to put your grades in and they will come out completely wrong and there is no way to contact them about why you earned a particular grade"
College Sophomore,1,"Rain Boots, Shorts, Overcoat, and Shades – At CAU we experience almost every weather condition everyday...You never know what to wear because if you look out your window is sunny but as soon as you step out your dorm it may start to rain. Always be prepared for dramatic changes in the weather conditions"
College Senior,1,Not Very Helpful – Clark Atlanta gets all kinds of funding but they do not openly tell students. Every semester it is very hard for students to get enrolled in school and you literally have to chase people down in order for them to tell you they have money they can give you
Recent Alumnus,1,"DEFINITELY NEED IMPROVEMENT! the financial aid process was absolutely HORRIBLE! the advisors were extra slow and lazy, the lines were super long and took forever to get enrolled. i would recommend that they hire faster, more experienced advisors that will make the financial aid process run a lot smoother!"
College Sophomore,1,they feed the students the same greasy food every day. we need more nutrition and protein
College Freshman,1,I had the worst experience with Financial aid.  They make you stand in line for so long just to offer you a little bit of money!  I advise you to go to Financial aid as soon as it opens so you will be the first in line and do not leave until everything is complete because if not you'll have to return several times.
College Freshman,1,"Mixed and Always Changing – From what I am used to, the weather in Atlanta is a little bi-polar. One day it is extremely cold and then a couple of days later it's extremely hot."
College Freshman,1,Strict on Campus – I would say my school is more strict than most just because its a private school. For example: we have visitation hours for guess. When alo colleges have it where students can go to their friends room anytime they want
College Freshman,1,Internet Connection Is HORRIBLE! The wifi in my dorm sucked I had to go to the student center or Morehouse to get a good connection.
College Senior,1,There are hardly any parking spaces around the actual buildings that  classes are held in. The parking lot is too expensive to park there everyday and is not included in your tuition if you do not stay on campus. There are often break-ins along the outskirts of campus and fines are outrageous.
College Freshman,1,Bad Internet Connections – I live off campus and i get very bad internet connection.
College Freshman,1,"Residence Visitation – The visitation hours are the worst. It's from 6pm to 11pm. If you're a minute late, you will get fined. They are very strict about visitation. In my opinion, they should extend it since we are all college students"

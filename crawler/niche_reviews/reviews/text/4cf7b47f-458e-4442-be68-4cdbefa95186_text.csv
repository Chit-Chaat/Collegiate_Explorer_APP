Freshman,5,The professor are really helpful and help me repetitively on my first day find majority of my classes on campus. The campus is extremely big and clean the stuff are very polite.
Freshman,5,I find it very interesting attend and very welcoming to attend here. The college experience is very good.
Freshman,5,Georgia southern has a good online learning experience because my friend went through and he said it's actually better than on campus so hopefully we shall see
Junior,5,I did not take any online courses yet. I did not take any online courses yet. i did not take any online courses. I did not take any online courses yet.
Freshman,5,"Online classes are pretty self explanatory, especially through ECore.  I would prefer taking some online classes if you need to work while going to school"
Freshman,5,I love GSU but the campus can be really confusing when trying to get to class. The parking is very strict as well.  I love that you can find all your help through one email!
Sophomore,5,"During this time having to do online learning was somewhat a struggle. The experience really showed me how serious I have to take my classes. For some people online classes can be difficult, it was hard in the beginning but once I got used to organizing, studying and attending class at home it became easier. If we were to have classes online again I would like it because during this hard time of a pandemic it will be safer for everyone. In person classes are my favorite because it is easier to connect with my teachers and make potential friends or classmates that I can make study groups with. Overall my online experience was decent but I would not want to do it again for my preference."
Sophomore,5,Faculty  is extremely helpful and available for students; this was especially so when we went 100% online during COVID for the balance of the academic year.  Sorority life is fantastic!
Sophomore,5,Georgia Southern is a very good school. I really enjoy the environment and diversity. They care for their students and their education.
Freshman,5,I’m an upcoming freshman and so far my experience with Georgia Southern has been great! I can’t wait to see what my first year will be like!
Freshman,5,I like the feeling of the school its a big school with a feeling of closeness. This is what I w had constantly heard about the school but its different experience when you get there yourself.
Senior,5,"The one class that I took online was about World History. The professor was not demanding whatsoever, being that it’s a CORE curriculum course. Meaning, everyone has to take it at some point before graduating."
Senior,5,"Georgia Southern University is an overall great institution to pursue a bachelor’s degree! It may not be the most diverse school; however, you will quickly become acclimated to the environment and find a supportive Eagle family :)"
Sophomore,5,"They do everything possible to assist the students with online classes and content. During the rough times of COVID - 19 especially, professors and staff did their best to accommodate students to be sure that the online learning process went smooth and successful."
Freshman,5,"Due to covid-19, I did take the second semester online. I enjoyed learning that way, versus in campus. Georgia Southern has this system called folio where you can check your emails, find new assignments, and get your grade from your old assignments. It makes your learning easy and fun."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed my time at Georgia Southern. It was easy to say, "" one of the best college educations in Georgia."" It is the campus that every high school locally grows to love. If you go to the school or not, you will still feel apart of the environment/atmosphere. I would say I am glad to see most people not use Georgia Southern as their first choice anymore, however, I feel the reason behind that is they pad the education with too much liberal arts. I would suggest the Statesboro campus if you're looking for the better experience."
Freshman,5,"So far at Georgia Southern, it appears to have great potential to be a great place to go to school, and earn your degree. I have just graduated from high school, and College classes haven't started yet, but the professors, and staff seem knowledgeable."
Freshman,5,The best thing about Georgia Southern is the fact that it is a very large campus with a small feel. The classes remain quite small for the most part which makes our learining experience easier and better. We have the chance to get up close and more personal with our professors as well as the student body.
Freshman,5,"It was truly an incredible learning experience and a unique way to help students develop a passion for their studies since they are shown that their work, thoughts, and ideas are heard and taken into consideration. The collaboration from computer engineers, mathematicians, chemists, biologist, and entrepreneurs avalible to you as resources help create and present a
fully well-rounded vision of what is avaliable for you in your future."
Graduate Student,5,"Georgia Southern is great, full of opportunities, and they truly care about their students. I love the campus!"
Freshman,5,"I am a dual enrolled student at Georgia Southern University right now. It is a joy just to be on campus with the well kept grass, trees, flowers, etc. Every building has something unique about it so it is very easy to find where I need to go and that helps with being on time to classes on the first day. All of my professors have shown real dedication to my learning experience and encourage me to use office hours so I can get the best help possible. I don’t have much to complain about except the new online classes have been a struggle to keep up with. I suppose that goes for most schools though. Trying to schedule my normal day of work now while having a load of work to do has been somewhat of a struggle. Not to mention the lack of hands on learning making it even more difficult to retain information. That is just my take on it. The campus is definitely one of the best aesthetically and I love the community there."
Freshman,5,The SOAR and the Eagle portal was user friendly which made locating the  necessary department easier.  I would have to say the Web sign and coding used was done by someone familiar with the engineering concepts.
Freshman,5,IF YOU NEED A SIGN THIS IS IT !! Join Eagle Nation. You won’t regret it I promise ! I never want to leave !
Senior,5,Great school and beautiful campus. The school is always taking the time to improve. The college has expanded to several campuses but I've only been to the main campus in Statesboro
Niche User,5,Georgia Southern is a great university with great academics and student life. It feels like home as soon as you set foot on campus.
Niche User,5,"As an upcoming freshmen, so far Georgia Southern University has shown great communication skills throughout the faculty as well as to students. Personally, I have toured the Statesboro campus and found it beautiful. The campus provides many workplaces and social spots for students around the campus."
Alum,5,Hail Southern! Great college experience with a balance of school and social life. Graduated in Mechanical Engineering 3 years ago. College offers a lot of support for internships and other resume building opportunities. Engineering professors are very passionate about research and offers students active engagement in their research if one shows interest. Southern is also the best hands on school for engineers. Almost all of the courses revolve around real world applications and a lot of time is spent in the shop building what you design. College football is also very engaging with tailgating becoming a big part of southern and an important college experience. I would recommend Georgia Southern to anyone looking for a college degree.
Niche User,5,"Georgia Southern University is a beautiful campus with a large diversity of students. Not only are their academic programs amazing, but they make you feel right at home."
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere at Georgia Southern. I love that there is so much you can get involved in. It is diverse.

Sophomore,5,I love GSU. Everyone on campus is very kind and accommodating. All of the courses that I have taken thus far have been challenging in the best ways and the staff and faculty really do care about their student’s success and they value learning!
Freshman,5,I like the diversity and the various campus activities and organizations that you can join or participate. I wish there was more financial aid opportunities.
Sophomore,5,I love it! The students are amazing and very welcoming. The campus food is great and so are the dorms.
Freshman,5,Coming into my freshman year I didn’t know what to expect. The campus is amazing and and the weather is really nice so it makes for a great environment to live in. The dorms are also really nice and it is affordable to have your own room and non communal bathrooms so it makes college feel more like home. The professors are amazing and really care about their classes and students. Only con is that it can be hard to makes friends unless you’re really good at putting yourself out there.
Freshman,5,"The environment and atmosphere is really inviting and I love living on campus. Not only the people are nice, but the environment is beautiful and kept up with regularly. Opportunities are offered periodically and there is something for almost any one here."
Freshman,5,I appreciate how all of the professors I have had are devoted to their students.  I wish there were more choices for on-campus housing.
Freshman,5,"The school offers so many things to get your future off to a great start from experiences, involvement, learning, and much more."
Sophomore,5,"I love that Georgia Southern has such a variety of programs ranging from film and production to nursing to education and even music! I love that I can come to Georgia Southern and feel safe! The tuition might be a lot, but it is worth it! I don't know where I would rather be!"
Alum,5,Great small town feel but with a lot of different kinds of people. Everyone is very nice and the professors really try to help you the best they can.
Sophomore,5,I really like Georgia Southern University for many reasons. Freedom's Landing is  amazing on campus life. The community is really tight knit and the teachers really care about how you are doing in their classes.
Graduate Student,5,Georgia Southern is a fabulous school in the heart of the low country offering incredible programs and facilities for students in all programs. I am so excited to be a second bachelor's degree student in Nursing at the new Savannah campus.
Niche User,5,"Georgia Southern has a very beautiful campus. All of the students seem so happy and friendly and the school is overall very welcoming. The library is the best part, with different levels for different needs of each student. Great school!"
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Southern has so many resources to help with your writing skills, math problems, or any subject you are struggling with. There are so many activities and volunteer opportunities that keep students involved. This is my second year at Georgia Southern and my experience so far is going well."
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful, the students get along well with others, it’s a safe and wonderful experience. Though they don’t mind handing out parking tickets to whomever over stays their welcome. It’s a highly recommended school, I can’t wait to enjoy the next 6 years there obtaining my degrees."
Sophomore,5,"caMy experience at Georgia Southern has been overall amazing. Not only is it a beautiful campus but it's filled with beautiful people. Everyone is so helpful and genuine which has made my adjustment to College much easier. I love the energy this campus brings, its definitely a breathe of fresh air.

Graduate Student,5,"My school is absolutely wonderful. From hiring us to feeding us, the institution makes it very easy to transition from home to college and then from college to the workforce. I think it is an absolutely fantastic institution for higher learning."
Sophomore,5,"I am proud to be an Eagle. This is my sophomore year and I have found Georgia Southern to be an engaging and inviting college.  Most of my professors care about their students and willingly help those who seek out assistance.  The school resources are outstanding and I am fortunate to have found the perfect college for me. The slogan, "" We are a big university with a small town feel"" is accurate.  People in the community support Georgia Southern and take pride in it!  Georgia Southern is an exceptional university!"
Senior,5,"Big school with a small, personal feeling. The professors are highly involved and caring. I would not change anything about this beautiful place."
Freshman,5,"Georgia Southern is a calm collective University, the campus and plentiful and mellow. Academic buildings and the dining hall are not to far from the housing areas and the transit buses run smooth and are easy to catch at the bus stops located around the campus perimeter. The staff such as advisors and workers in the front office building show great hospitality and professor put pride into their lectures. If you're looking for these qualities into a school, you should consider Georgia Southern University."
Freshman,5,I loved everything. The people are so nice. The school seems so new and fresh. And professional as well. They seem to really value education and the betterment of society.
Freshman,5,"I love the large scale, small feel experience. Georgia Southern is a big school, but we are a family."
Freshman,5,I like how they showed me around and cared about me as family everybody was silly help and get connected
Freshman,5,"I have only been to orientation and I will start at Georgia Southern in the fall. Overall at orientation I had a great experience and made friends with people who I will see in the fall. I had the opportunity to stay in one of the residential halls for one night, and I really like the dorms. The bedrooms are spacious enough for anything that a college student would require. The two dining halls also had a wide variety of meals and options to choose from."
Freshman,5,The Georgia Southern Statesboro campus is a campus full of diversity. The teachers and campus staff are always so kind and helpful with any situations.
Junior,5,"The plains of south Georgia in Statesboro, Georgia is the last place that I would've expected to find my new home. Georgia Southern University is a university for students. The university doesn't view its students based on class, field of study, socioeconomic background, etc. The university has looked kindly on each of its students and realized that each of them have a reason for attending, so the university doesn't waste that. It is truly a community like no other and leaves a lasting impact on everyone who comes, whether for tours or for class."
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Southern campus haves y helpful resources, including a 24 hour library. The campus is expanding each and everyday and it looks amazing! Along with these buildings, Georgia Southern are offering more and more opportunities to be successful in each class because of the tutoring sessions and studies rooms they have built over the years."
Junior,5,"I love  the Statesboro campus of GSU, where I currently attend. The campus is beautiful and the faculty/staff are so friendly. GSU does an excellent job of getting students involved and providing ample opportunities for involvement across campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending Georgia Southern. The food, environment, and teachers are great. The teachers seem like they really care and they try to get you to learn all of the information that you can. The school cares about your well being for hosting things such as Wellness Wednesdays where they bring dogs to the library to keep your stress levels down. The only bad thing about Georgia Southern is that their housing is plummeting and they are pricey, but they have other housing arrangements and they will work with you with the tuition."
Freshman,5,"Great campus, professors, and student body. Georgia Southern is where you go to truly get the full college experience. You aren't only obtaining a degree here but gaining life long friends and memories. The campus is full of activities and events. You also have so many useful resources to use if you're struggling academically."
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Southern University has an amazing engineering and computing program. Professors are dedicated to ensuring students' success in the classroom and in outside work environments. Inclusive communities related to your majors keep your social life active, as you're always meeting new faces."
Junior,4,"The school is very helpful when it comes to accommodating students in order to be successful during this semester. They have laptops that they loan at the library. They have classrooms open in order to do zoom classes, and they are very flexible with office hours."
Junior,4,Georgia Southern is a very good school. I really enjoy the environment and diversity. They care for their students and their education.
Freshman,4,"Southern has a great campus, the weather is always amazing, and for the most part, all the staff is very helpful. The one and only down side I can think about this college is are underdevelopment of the area around it."
Sophomore,4,"As a first year student at Georgia Southern University, I was nervous about the campus because I never visited. Applying to the school was very last minute but once I got used to the school I am very proud of my decision. The campus is very welcoming to students of different backgrounds such as sexuality, religion, age and race. It was hard to get used to at first since it is a really big campus but after 2 months it was definitely easy to navigate buildings, classes and teachers. I would recommend coming to Georgia Southern University because the teachers, advisors and counselors are really hands on with all of their students. There are always fun activities going on campus so you won't always be bored! The departments are always helpful for their graduating students a job in the future. Georgia southern has changed my life for the better especially the clubs."
Sophomore,4,Professors did their best with an unprecedented situation.  All of mine were available and very accessible to keep in contact with students and t address any course related issues
Junior,4,"Georgia Southern has a great campus. Open areas and nice scenery all around, and the campus itself is easy to travel around. The transit system is fairly on time and most areas are within walking distance. The dining commons are buffet style with good quality food."
Junior,4,My online classes were just as easy to learn in as my in-person classes. The online professors made it very simple to understand material and do well in the online environment.
Freshman,4,"I have one class online, and I’ve heard from other students that the online experience is just as good as any other."
Freshman,4,Online learning experience so far has been quite enjoyable and I would say it was a pleasant experience even with everything that is going on currently.
Sophomore,4,It is a good school. I like the atmosphere. People are generally friendly and like to be helpful. The learning environment is friendly and focused. The dorms are nice where I stay and the Southern Pride Marching Band is amazing.
Junior,4,"I have done really well with online classes, whether they have been with Georgia Southern professors or through Ecore."
Junior,4,Geogria Southern is a greatschool that is constantly changing in order to fit the needs of students. Most of the problems I have encountered lie with a few rouge professors. Most are willing to hep students and provide quality education to everyone enrolled.
Freshman,4,"I have not taken any classes online. If I had, I am sure the staff would formulate it in a way so that the student would have a chance at success."
Sophomore,4,"This college has just about everything you would want for a college experience. Great teachers, great team spirit, and so many awesome clubs to join. Whatever you want to make of your college time, you can here."
Sophomore,4,"There are many great professers here at GSU. They were all willing to help in our time of need, and completely understanding"
Graduate Student,4,"Online classes are not bad, professors make their self available. Advisors are extremely helpful in this process as well."
Alum,4,At first I was attending armstrong university but then they merged with southern. So I don’t think I got the full southern experience.
Sophomore,4,I liked how it was not as difficult to find my classes around campus. It is also fun to be in a new environment with new people. I also like how friendly the professors are and my classmates.
Junior,4,"I love Georgia Southern! It is a great school with a beautiful campus. The teachers I have had are committed to my learning and I have formed some great relationships. The higher level classes you take tend to have the teachers that are more involved with you, but there are some teachers who teach lower level classes that will form great relationships with you. There are many opportunities to get involved on campus if you are willing to put yourself out there. I joined a sorority on campus and also held a position within it, which allowed me to meet so many great people."
Freshman,4,"Love this school. The professors, for the most part, are very nice. I think the campus is very beautiful and its a lovely location. The only negative thing is that you can tell that the school puts more money into the football team than it does in other areas of the school."
Sophomore,4,"I really like it. It is just the right size and is very diverse. There are lots of restaurants to choose from and they are clean and offer a variety of food choices. There are many sports teams, sororities, housing options and fun places to go. It's located in a small town with the college playing a large part in attracting students from different parts of the country. You're not too far from Athens or the city. The professors are great and most of them are very easy going with a wealth of knowledge."
Sophomore,4,"I go to the Armstrong Campus, and most everything is very nice. The only gripe I have is with the lack of astronomy classes on campus and the limited scheduling of music classes."
Freshman,4,"I find Georgia Southern a very nice school, very big campus, lot of students to interact with. Dining is very good too compared to a lot of schools. Dorms are the BEST part about the school,  most dorms you don't have to share a room with others. Professors for the most part are very easy to get in contact with and understanding. Only downfall , the school is located in the country.. So if you are a city person, don't expect it to be a lot of things to do or a lot of ""scenery"" outside of the campus."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Georgia Southern, the professors are usually very helpful in giving us ways to make sure we know the material, most of mine have posted many things online for us to use to make sure we understand what is happening. On top of that there are many places to go if none of that helps you understand. The courses are challenging and I think I am actually furthering  my knowledge not just doing more memorization like I did in high school."
Junior,4,"Georgia Southern has been a great college for me. Most people are very friendly, and the university tries very hard to support students wherever it can."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience has been calming and great. The campus is clean and the people are friendly and warming."
Freshman,4,"Georgia Southern is a very diverse community, there are lots of ways to get involved on campus and the school provides a lot of opportunities for students ranging from scholarships to internships or jobs."
Niche User,4,I loved it. The campus was very nice and very student oriented. The programs are very beneficial to the students. The food is great. The staff is respectful.
Freshman,4,"The campus is a very diverse place for all students to express themselves, and have the freedom to complete their paths in their times."
Freshman,4,My overall experience so far at Georgi Southern has been great. Some of the professors (not all) are wonderful and do a great job of teaching and engaging not just lecturing.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I am having a great first year. One thing I would like to see is more activities in Statesboro."
Freshman,4,My Southern experience has been wonderful. From the classes to the overall school atmosphere it has been absolutely great. I wouldn't change a thing.
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Georgia Southern University and I love it here. It is very welcoming and the campus is the perfect size. Most of the people here are very outgoing and are open to meeting new friends, and most of my professors are very considerate and want you to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Southern's campus gives off ""southern hospitality"" vibes and it's wonderful. The campus is beautiful , sweetheart circle is perfect for lovers wanting to lay in their hammocks, and the two lakes are a great place to go sit and cry after failing a test."
Sophomore,4,"Good school for the price and location. Sometimes there are some racist incidents though, which is kind of dangerous for the “diverse” folks like me."
Sophomore,4,Georgia Southern is a very personal school. The teachers all remember you by name and the housing that is provided is very nice compared to many other college dorms.
Freshman,4,"I love Georgia Southern for many reasons. One is the atmosphere. Everyone is truly a part of a family here and everyone is invited to and included. Another reason I love Georgia Southern is because of the diversity of culture, race, gender, and sexual orientation. Everyone is accepted here."
Junior,4,I like how the campus isn't really huge but not necessaryly small either. Its very comfy and easy to get around too. I love how there is every club you can think of and if you dont see any then you can create a club any time.
Freshman,4,"There is an amazing faculty here, the campus is gorgeous and easy to navigate, and classes are all pretty close to each other. The first year experience course is redundant for many students (though it could be very valuable for students who come in with less knowledge of college life)."
Sophomore,4,"The price of the school if your in-state is very affordable. Good program for those looking to go into nursing, business, or engineering who weren't necessarily 4.0 students in high school."
Freshman,4,It is a small yet beautiful campus. Everyone here is very sweet and outgoing. Help is always offered and no one should unwelcomed here.
Sophomore,4,I have only been at the college for a couple weeks and so far it's great. A lot more opportunities than my previous community college.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Georgia Southern University, and it already feels like home.the community is very welcoming, and the people here do the best they can to make sure that every student here feel pleased to be a student at Georgia Southern . There are a good amount of student activities, and organizations,  that help you get involved .The organizations constantly have booths up making sure that everybody knows that there is stuff they can join to contribute to a good college experience. College is a lot different from high school, it is your responsibility to keep up with everything and know when everything is due, but it truly does help you transform into a responsible adult. What i would like to change at Georgia Southern is the  residential halls, they could be worked  a little more, and they should  check and clean them often.My experience at Georgia Southern has been good so far, and i can't wait to see what the rest of this year has in store."
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Southern University has a great atmosphere for academics and student life! I'm majoring in chemistry with a pre-pharmacy track, and I will definitely miss the campus after completion of my pre-requisites!"
Freshman,4,I am looking forward to being a freshman this fall. My family and I attended orientation this summer and it was very informative.
Freshman,4,I like that the Georgia Southern campus is in one compacted place. It allows me to stay at one place at all times and not having to move a lot to find my classes.
Freshman,4,"I was attracted to Georgia Southern because of the campus, student life there and the athletics. After completing my first year there I can say I was impressed in all these areas. The only thing I would say could be a problem is that the surrounding area around the school does not offer the most things to do."
Junior,4,I came from a small town and though I was ready to leave the lifestyle I didn't want to go too far out of my comfort zone. Georgia Southern is the perfect balance because its located in a small town but close enough to places like Savannah and Macon where students can go to enjoy that faster scenes of bigger areas. The campus feels very safe and inclusive to students and professors are very personable if you make the effort to seek help in times of confusion.
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Southern seems rough around the edges at first if you're not a big party person, but having the right people around you can easily make the best of your situation. Nothing to really do down there, but the dorms have AMAZING wifi."
Freshman,4,As a DE student the university has been pretty helpful with the entire class trasfer process and the curriculum was challenging yet engaging. I don't attend the statesboro campus for classes but the experiences I've had with the online and liberty courses were great. I highly recommend for anyone else looking to DE.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Georgia Southern has been good so far being a freshman. The academics are fair, the food is good on most days, athletic sports is an eh, there's no party scene here at the Armstrong campus, and that's pretty much it."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Georgia southern University is that you have unlimited resources at your disposal.  Whether its tutoring,"
Sophomore,4,"This University has many things to do. There are many activities and there is always something happening every day, whether they involve class, career opportunities, or hanging out with others. The school takes academics seriously and my classmates work hard and are serious about their classes. Many of the teachers I had were very engaging and so far, all of my classes were enjoyable at some level. The food is also well received and there are many options. People are willing to work with you if you ask for help, be it school, housing, or anything else. There is also a police force ready to handle situations on and off campus if they arise. Overall, this is a really good University and I thoroughly enjoy attending this school."
Freshman,4,"Southern has an absolutely gorgeous campus. Magnolia trees and flowers everywhere. It’s absolutely breathtaking. The scenery is only matched by the attentiveness of the staff. While this may seem like an enormous school, the class sizes and individual attention that the professors are willing to give students is more akin to a smaller school (in the best of ways, of course).

Georgia southern is the largest “small school” in the state, and it shows. The only real drag is Statesboro itself. It’s close enough to Savannah, so exciting opportunities aren’t too far away, but there aren’t many to speak of in Statesboro proper."
Sophomore,4,I love Georgia Southern and am so happy I decided to come here. I have made great friends in only the year I've been here and am now a part of multiple organizations on campus. There are so many opportunities for students to get involved in and resources on campus to help us succeed.
Sophomore,4,The campus was beautiful and the housing was the best I’ve ever seen. I would like to see more interactive things for students to get involved with around the campus. All of the “fun” things around campus are closed or taken away.
Freshman,4,I have yet to actually attend a class but I have heard good things about the school like faculty and teacher-student ratio
Sophomore,4,"Good place to be. The experience is what you make it. If you want to be social, you have to reach out. If you want time to yourself, on campus hours are flexible with your classes, and you can just chill after class. Love the individual bedrooms for dorms.

 Heard the horror stories of the past. The professors are...professors. Some are very good...outstanding. Will take time out of their day to help you learn the material. Will organize their material online to where it's coherent enough to study with ease. Some...some are shit.

It is a high value college compared to other colleges...but it's price is definitely inflated. Advisers will try to pressure you to take classes they suggest base solely on high school gpa, and will pressure you to take their suggested classes...even if it requires an extra year in school...and more money you may not have."
Junior,4,"Georgia Southern is an amazing institution considering its price of tuition. You are given great academic programs, top of the line dorm rooms, and tasty food all within a reasonable price point. The campus life is amazing and includes a large variety of different sports, clubs, and activities that is sure to meet your interest. The institution itself is not any more diverse than your typical PWI, but minorities are sure to make a bold mark on this campus! Be cautious though that Georgia Southern is located in the middle of way, so campus life is as fun as you make it!"
Junior,4,"The way Georgia Southern is you can easily find friends that will be considered friends for life. One thing that sticks out is the scenery and the lakes right near the library. Soo you can take nature walks to enjoy yourself, take pictures, or just to clear you’re head"
Freshman,2,"Online courses have been difficult to keep up with as the work load for each class increased and time at home spent working increased with it. I know professors had to find ways to replace in class sheets and activities with online supplements in order for hands on students to retain what was being taught in the video recorded lectures, but the asynchronous courses made it difficult to ask the professor questions about the content without feeling as though I was being a nuisance and interrupting the professor’s daily life. This led to me feeling less prepared for tests and made me anxious about my grades in the classes dropping. This anxiety was associated with minor physical tolls such as headaches, migraines, bad eating habits, etc., but once classes were over and grades were released I was much more relaxed at home. Online classes can be structured much better once professors are given adequate time to build the class material and incorporate more hands on learning."
Sophomore,2,My experience as a student in Georgia Southern University has been okay. I am just feel like i am being judged by the students and there is really nothing to do in school.
Junior,2,"This school has great aspects to it, but some of the departments are HORRIBLE! If you are a computer science major, go to school elsewhere"
Sophomore,2,"I loved Georgia Southern at first. From the numerous events and clubs,  the small-town feel, to the free tutoring, GSU seemed to have it all. Things got sour  for me pretty quickly. Georgia Southern could improve on its teachers, dining hall meals, counseling centers, and much more. The university could focus better on mental health, provide more options for healthy food rather than unhealthy, invest in quality teachers and staff, and take into account the students experience with the school."
Sophomore,2,My experience at Georgia Southern has been one to remember. I have had some of the best teachers that I could have ever experienced and some of the worst. Georgia Southern is known to have that big college small class feel but I have felt quite the opposite. I have felt that the school has been too big for me. Most professors do not take the time to learn your names or even look twice at your grade. That is not something that I want to be a part of. I am planning on transferring to a school that can give me more of that one on one feel so I can learn more for my career.
College Sophomore,2,Very discriminatory towards non Whites.
College Junior,2,Bad experience with Greek Life
College Sophomore,2,I do not like Greek life that much because their houses were right next to my dorm and their parties made it hard to study and sleep.
College Senior,2,There are not any minority houses on Greek Row and its unfortunate.
College Sophomore,2,"Some of them are annoying, some are cool."
College Freshman,2,"I do not like Greek Life. With a few exceptions, most sorority girls and fraternity guys are snobbish and condescending. They also dominate the atmosphere."
College Freshman,2,We have a lot of armed robberies and that worries me because I don't think they ever find out who is doing it.
College Freshman,2,Not strict. Code of conduct board sucks.
College Freshman,2,There is literally nothing in this town
College Freshman,2,I didn't get much money back because of our income which wasn't good.
College Freshman,2,A lot of parties were shut down this year before they even started.
College Freshman,2,Needs to establish a growth plan that is contingent college growth
College Freshman,2,There's really nothing to do in Statesboro other than a few restaurants
College Junior,2,Unfortunately I don't qualify but my parents cannot afford what they are expected to pay
College Junior,2,I have no interest in this
College Freshman,2,im an out of state student and received no financial aid from the school
College Freshman,2,I rate bad because i feel like the greeks are all partiers and really the life serves no other purpose but to party
College Freshman,2,"It's literally in a small town. Have fun on campus, but off campus is depressing. City folks beware!"
College Freshman,2,its about to be a lot of studying
College Freshman,2,Didnt give me that money for my tuition
College Freshman,2,A stranger could be a student if he walk in
College Junior,2,"I don not care for greek life, I do not really know anything about it."
College Senior,2,not enough shops or selection for the amount of people there
College Freshman,2,"Anything outside the conforming white frat boy is somewhat treated in a lesser light among students, diversity is here but it is definitely not a cultural sensitive or cultural relative area."
College Freshman,2,"Statesboro is an isolated city that can meet the needs of a student, but I could not live here. There is not much to do besides go to the bars , or parties that are constantly shutdown, most of the time I find myself in Savvannah"
College Sophomore,2,There are very few area attractions.  you can travel to the beach or Savannah both of which are fairly accessible by car for museums and nightlife.
College Sophomore,2,"from what I could tell, there isn't much going on in the small town.  but Savannah isn't too far"
College Sophomore,2,"There are several great parking lots available to students. However, there are also some that are very far away, and sometimes they are not worth paying for. The prices for on campus parking are outrageous and need to be lowered. Parking and Transportation does a good job to regulate the parking lot. They give tickets out to those not allowed to park in the lots, and students often get mad about it. However, students are normally at fault and deserve a tickets. The parking lots do fill up fast, and students need to buy a parking pass before the spring semester ends in order to get the parking lot they prefer."
College Student,2,"Permit costs are very expensive, and a permit is only good for one parking lot, which means you will have to walk to some classes. Ticketing is also a little overboard."
College Freshman,2,"The wifi, network speed and reliability are poor! Something needs to be done!"
College Freshman,2,I just don't know why everything is so strict
College Freshman,2,Takes too long. They don't communicate.
College Freshman,2,The Greek community only throw parties.
College Freshman,2,Nothing to do but smoke and drink.
College Senior,2,There are not enough parking lots. The permit costs is what has prevented me from being able to park on campus.
College Senior,2,"Drug and alcohol visibility is somewhat high, even in the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"COST is Ridiculous. LIVE OFF CAMPUS! Process is good though, they dont want you to change your mind. TO cancel my housing they wanted me to pay 800 dollars, that is 3 times the price of the housing contract and the school term hadn't even started."
College Sophomore,2,I have $2000 left to pay for school and the school hasn't tried to reach out to help me pay for school.
College Junior,2,The worst thing is how much it costs to park
College Junior,2,"its goood really good , really really really really good"
College Junior,2,"its goood really good , really really really really good its goood really good , really really really really good"
College Junior,2,"its goood really good , really really really really good"
College Junior,2,"its goood really good , really really really really good"
College Junior,2,"its goood really good , really really really really good"
College Sophomore,2,There arnt many emergency phones and the campus police cant be everywhere at once. Many problems can occur with people being robbed or a girl being sexually assaulted. During the day you feel safe but at night is a different story..
College Freshman,2,Many students are pressured into participating in activities with alcohol. I have not noticed any problems with drugs like cocaine or marijuana.
College Student,2,The weather is so unpredictable.
College Freshman,2,Statesboro is a very boring city. There is not a lot to do around here except for things that happen on campus.
College Freshman,2,The heat is always at extreme temperatures and there is not a lot of shade to block you from the sun.
College Junior,2,"Seems like lots of people smoke weed on campus, I usually notice when im walking by campus housing. Lots of people use it off campus too"
College Freshman,2,"Its convenient to have health services, but the amount of people on campus makes it harder to stay healthy and also the weather."
College Freshman,2,"The amount of freezing rain, and violent winds here in east Georgia is not the most comfortable environment to be in."
College Freshman,2,Summers are really hot some days can get up to 90 degrees. Then the classrooms are really cold. This winter has been on the other end of the spectrum and has been really cold.
College Freshman,2,They monitor it in the dorms but with the bars so close to campus practically everyone goes and most are underage.
College Junior,2,"Unless you go to Savannah, which is 45 minutes away, there is not much to do in Statesboro."
Graduate Student,1,"Georgia Southern University is a very racist, white-person centered place. I have heard multiple students use the n-word like it was going out of style and proud of their racism."
Graduate Student,1,"horrible school! this school has the worst type of kids there is! also, everyone who gets in either has deal with the dean and admission team. don’t send your kid here. the school is a horrible place to make friends and statesboro is a very boring place. no fun things to do unless you drink and smoke. don’t recommend this place! trust me because i graduated from here class of 2018!"
Sophomore,1,"Do not attend this school if you are looking for a social life or are unwilling to deal with generally nasty people. The staff are unwilling to help many times, every interaction with them in my 2 years here has been unpleasant, as most are unhappy to do their jobs it seems especially where it is needed the most (financial aid, bursar). The student body is incredibly pretentious, selfish and unaccepting of anyone with many stereotypes of the typical college student coming to life on this campus. This is essentially high school, but in college all over again. I would not recommend this school for your mental health which can lead to a very negative outlook on society as a whole."
Junior,1,"For all you veterans do not attend this school, There is no support for Veterans. Once they receive your benefits your veteran status is no longer. For Adult Learners seek before you leap 80% acceptance, less than 30% Graduate 2% are able to use there degree. 80% acceptance of your money.Think about it you work at a College  average yearly 40,000 unless your a university like Howard, Yale, Stanford In GA 60,000 max. You young Kids  you think if you get a degree you made it (Wrong). If you do get a Job in your degree field you will be trained how it's done in the real world. If you have to donkey kiss to get a grade then your Teacher showed you what to do but didn't teach you. Don't think College is the answer. Most business owners never went to College. Find A school that helps not hurt it's your money. In GA less than 10% of the population go to College."
Freshman,1,The store across the street from my dorm at Southern Pines kept getting robbed and people could easily just walk in and out the dorms. The food was okay but racism wasn't out there but it was there on the low.
College Freshman,1,Greek life is the only way to be apart of the social scene. They throw great parties but you can't get in unless you're in a fraternity or sorority.
College Senior,1,"Financial Aid office offers little to no help and often times will even fail to reply to emails or return phone calls. In office, they tend to act as though you are a bother and provide vague answers."
College Freshman,1,"My first week there, we would have oven weather, but it would pour down rain right in the middle of the day."
College Freshman,1,I hate the people in Greek! They have this mindset that letters make you better then someone else
College Freshman,1,Everyone on this campus is alike.
College Freshman,1,Ticketing and fines are terrible! Just a way to rip people off and make money!
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing to do outside of campus.
College Junior,1,"I'm not Greek, and I have no interest in it. I know some Greeks who are awesome people to be around, and I have met others who kind of suck. A lot of fraternity members are really racist."
College Junior,1,"Not feeling safe being home alone, walking out of the library or class at night, or even going to walmart alone ruins a lot of my experience. If there were sidewalks, shopping, or more activities/hobbies available I would have a better time. People in classes are ok. Locals are ok but scare me."
College Freshman,1,The cops are always out to get the students and treat them with no respect.
College Junior,1,At GSU it is summer time year around. The worst season to attend school at GSU would be on campus during summer time in the months of May through July. The heat could be worst but the humidity is unbearable. This humidity makes November feel like September. 
College Junior,1,Almost everybody drinks even if they are underage.
College Junior,1,They do not provide enough buses to take students that park at the stadium.
College Junior,1,GSU does not offer a lot of scholarships.
College Junior,1,I personally do not put myself in those types of situations to see the drug and alcohol usage. Every college has them but I know what I am here for and that is for school only.
College Sophomore,1,Georgia Southern has great dining areas but this year the meal plans limit that to about 2 places. 1 on weekends. The food at these 2 cafeterias is good but grows tiresome very quickly and the other options are great but you are given a small budget to eat at these expensive places. Living far from all of this is very impractical and every returning student complains about this situation.
College Junior,1,Stateboro is a town where you can do alot of community service
College Sophomore,1,"I received enough financial aid, but it has been a bit of a hassle.  For some reason, it still says I don't have Hope even though I have earned it, and I have to go through a lengthy progress to put it back before my classes get cancelled."
College Sophomore,1,The weather is fine mostly not a really a concern but its never constant. Its either too hot or too cold.
College Sophomore,1,"When it rains, it just about floods. They barely cancel class for anything. Umbrellas turn upside down. Not lenient when i comes to weather and tardiness."
College Sophomore,1,The campus itself is a pretty secure place but there are obvious flaws in security. We have had people that have been mugged be hind the RAC and people breaking into the RAC to steal out of lockers. Right off campus is even worse but crime rates have been steadily declining.
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus can be a nightmare. It's very likely that you'll get a ticket 5-10 times per semseter
College Freshman,1,Right now the dining is horrible because there are no open dining halls besides the makeshift Nest which sucks. And everyone is pretty sick of Chikfila.
College Sophomore,1,"I personally do not drive, but I hear all the stories. Parking is very crazy on campus and there are so many ""Faculty and Staff"" parking spaces that is seems impossible to find a spot if you are a student."
College Senior,1,"Many guys and girls that go here get caught up in trends. So they spend exorbitant amounts of money to look like someone who is not themselves. Everyone wears the same clothes, has the same interests, and has the same hateful attitude towards learning. I very disappointed in my peers."
Recent Alumnus,1,I am not interested in Greek life. Grades are more important.
College Freshman,1,There are at least three bars right across the street from my building and every night I can hear the drunks partying and leaving to go back home. It is not safe to walk alone at night because of all the intoxicated people.
College Senior,1,"My experience with GA Southern University Financial Aid Department has been very unfavorable.  Their focus is not the student and they don't provide all of your options nor like to answer questions.  They have provided me with incorrect information 2 semesters in a row.  
I do not like doing business with them at all."
College Freshman,1,"It is so humid down here, the gnats are always in your face because you sweat so much. It rains frequently and then your hair gets frizzy, and you sweat like crazy when the sun comes out."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A Little Too Full of Themselves. GSU's policies reflect a small town school that think they are on the same level as bigger universities.  In trying to play with the ""big boys,"" they have compromised their biggest selling point...a smaller, personal university.  They take themselves far too seriously.  I think this is the byproduct of their rapid growth."
College Senior,1,where i live is really close to campas but the apartments suck
College Freshman,1,"Parking during the day can be absolutely ridiculous. In order not to miss class, sometimes you have to park out of your zone. Naturally, you expect a ticket, but fins are absolutely ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,"Frat Boys and Sleezy Girls – The boys that attend Georgia Southern as a whole are not very respectable guys. A lot of the guys that are students at this university pledge to join fraternities and think they are better than everyone else. They don't treat girls with respect and try to take advantage of girls in the bars. The majority of the girls at Southern are loud, obnoxious and act inappropriately around guys just to get attention. If one does not fall into one of the above categories you don't feel welcome at social events."
College Freshman,1,"This Town Is Dead – Statesboro is not a fun town to live in. The shopping is very limited along with places to eat. There is an extreme abundance of fast food restaurants which causes much congestion in the small town of Statesboro. When driving to the dorms, it is mandatory that you pass the local bars where college kids go to party. The streets in front of the bars are constantly covered in broken beer bottles, cigarrette butts, and vomit. The atmosphere of this town is awful and not appealing in any way."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs, Alcohol... We Have It All! The drug and alcohol use at this school is unbelievable. I do not participate in either of these activities and it makes me sick when all I hear on campus is how people can't wait to indulge themselves in such nonsense. Georgia Southern is known to be a party school, and it certainly is. Because of the excessive use of these two substances, I lost interst in Georgia Southern and I'm transferring to the University of West Georgia in the Fall of 2012."

Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere of Western Carolina University. This university and the local area promote a close community. The student to professor ratio is 17:1, and each semester I've been here, each of the teachers have known me by name and done all they could to make sure I succeed. I am an Interior Design major, and they have a great program and really want to make sure each student is ready for a job, which I love. I chose Western because I love everything that they have to offer and I believe that everyone on this campus and in the community want me to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Western Carolina University is the best school I have ever been to. The professors, staff, and faculty are always willing to help and see success. The community at this school is very friendly and accepting, and the university encourages diversity and open-mindedness. Everyone is always working together as a team! I have never felt more at home and accepted in all my years of schooling."
Freshman,5,Both my parents and one sibling are alumni’s and I am excited to attend western Carolina this spring.
Sophomore,5,"Great professors, students, education, area, weather, all around amazing. Very proud to be a catamount."
Sophomore,5,"I liked online classes. Professors easy to contact, everything laid out in black and white. Would recommend."
Alum,5,"Didn't take online course, but I'm sure they were fine! Professors are amazing and will do anything to help their students succeed."
Alum,5,"The professors at WCU made taking online classes a breeze. They were always there when I needed help, or when I couldn't figure something out. Overall I would highly advise taking easy electives online, space permitting."
Alum,5,"Western Carolina University is a beautiful college that is nestled in the Appalachian Mountains of NC. WCU has grown both in size and diversity over the past few years, and it is a great place for college students who are looking for a school that offers amazing outdoor recreation, as well as phenomenal academic programs. As a WCU alum, I can attest that attending this school was  worth the time and effort, and the view isn't bad either."
Niche User,5,"Didn't take any online classes, but the tour was good.just reviewing it cause its great and a good experience."
Niche User,5,"It was an amazing tour on campus, the classes they had were great and the view  outside of campus is amazing. Here they have classes for people that want to learn about business which is my dream career to do."
Alum,5,The online classes were very easy to take and the best part about having online classes was the ability to work at your own pace and from virtually anywhere. The online learning experience was ideal for me as I am a shy person and it was nice not having to talk in front of other people or sit in a room full of people I didn't know. This helped me to thrive and excel in the class because I was not stressed out from being around or having to engage with other people.
Alum,5,"I loved going to WCU for my undergrad studies because it was close to home and in a beautiful location. The class sizes were small which meant that the professors were able to engage with their students both as a group and on an individual basis, making the educational experience more meaningful and intimate."
Sophomore,5,I love how supportive my advisor and teachers are. Registration has been very easy. I didn't know how to do it at first. My advisor schedules a time to call and register over the phone. He pay close attention to how my grades are going and helps find a pace that is good for me. That's one thing that I have enjoyed the most.
Sophomore,5,"All classes that I take are online. I love the pace that they have gone. My teachers have been super supportive. One class we had a student from over seas and she didn't have the book available to her, so the teacher made the book available to us all in powerpoint slides."
Sophomore,5,"One thing I love about WCU is the learning environment. The teachers are very helpful and when you are done with class and studying, you have a fantastic view of the gorgeous mountains!"
Sophomore,5,"To me, there is the perfect amount of people! There is a lot of diversity and opportunities around campus, but not so many people that there are unbearable lines everywhere, which saves a lot of time. Of course, the NC Promise (which makes tuition only $500 per semester!) is fantastic if you want to graduate with little to no debt! I have learned skills that I never thought I would learn, such as dancing and tutoring, and met people with beliefs that I never had the faintest idea existed. I strongly recommend WCU for anyone who wants to have new experiences, likes the mountains with hiking and biking trails, and likes watching the sky turn to a beautiful purple and gold in the evening, hence the school colors. One extra thing that may be good or bad: nearby towns are small and have little to do in them. I like that because I don't like driving in the first place, but if you are the type that needs to get out then it is important to keep that in mind!"
Sophomore,5,"The professors at WCU were very understanding about the difficulties of classes switching to online. Of course, taking classes online is never quite as effective as it is in the classroom, but they did a good job creating assignments that students could follow at home and either creating Zoom sessions or recording videos to put on Panopto for the students to view at their ideal time. I prefer taking the classes in person, but I don't see how they could have managed online classes better!"
Freshman,5,I love the location and the community you get to be a part of. Everyone is so welcoming and there’s so much to explore if you love nature!
Alum,5,"I took a few classes online and the experiences went well. They made me realize that they are not the devil, like I used to think they were. This was largely because the professors were helpful when they were needed."
Freshman,5,This school has completely opened my eyes to the idea of diversity. Their main focus is to be helpful throughout our four years and they have shown that to be true. I have been given many opportunities to achieve big-time and relax and be active throughout my school. The SPED class has given me an opening to the UP program which has allowed me to continue my work with children and adults with disabilities. Western defiantly got my fear of going off to college and being introduced into a new environment to go away. They are very active in the student's lives and supportive to get them the help and care they need in order to achieve big things. Overall Western Carolina has truly been an amazing experience so far and I hope to gain main more unforgettable experiences.
Junior,5,"My experience at Western Carolina University has been a great one full of new experiences and awesome opportunities as a student and as a community member. What I like most about Western is their concern for having a inclusive, diverse, and respectful community that is engaging to all persons. The campus is welcoming and if you enjoy outdoors and the mountains, it has awesome places to explore. My favorite thing to do is to go out hiking with friends."
Alum,5,"I wouldn't change a thing about WCU. It was my home for 4 years, and I loved it. The quality of education is second to none, and the memories will last a lifetime. I remember stepping on to campus for my orientation, looking at my mom and saying, ""This is it. This is home. I have to go here!"". Those 4 years were the happiest years of my life, even though they were medically trying for me. WCU was amazing in that aspect as well, and helped me immensely as I navigated a new medical condition as well as University. When you go to Western Carolina University, it's true, you are forever a Catamount!"
Sophomore,5,Western is an amazing campus with really nice people. I have enjoyed my first two years here. I am a marketing and communications major and the classes are challenging but very effective and the professors make it enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,Western Carolina is a beautiful campus with incredibly friendly people and a high quality teaching staff. It is a top notch education without paying a high cost.
Freshman,5,Western Carolina is all you want in a college it's got a great learning atmosphere  and dedicated professors reading to teach their students everyday
Niche User,5,"As an incoming freshman for the fall of 2020, I have been to the campus numerous times.  I've taken tours, spoken to financial aid, admissions, and housing.  Everyone is so helpful in making sure my experience is a positive one.  I have also had the opportunity to go to a few football games.  The band is amazing.  The atmosphere at the game gave me chills.  My view of the football stadium is surrounded by mountains and rolling hills.  I knew that my heart was here at Western Carolina.  Some days, my mom and I take a drive to visit the campus.  The scenery is breath taking.  I am excited to be able to attend Western Carolina University.  Go Catamounts!!"
Junior,5,"I am a Communication Sciences and Disorders major who transferred into Western Carolina this year. WCU is the perfect school for me. The classes are fairly small, I have had 30-70 students in each of my classes. This allows you to really connect your your professors. If I am struggling with a topic, my instructors are always ready to help. My classes have been interesting and line up perfectly with my career choice. My favorite thing about WCU is the clinic they have in the Health and Human Sciences building. In the clinic students can observe speech therapy sessions and gain knowledge on how to handle their own sessions when the time comes. The campus is beautiful and the school is always trying to become better. Overall, Western Carolina is a great school!"
Freshman,5,Wester Carolina University is located in an amazing area. There are so many things to do while here in the mountains and so many amazing people to help you along your journey. Professors work hard to help you and give many one on one chances to help you achieve. Overall Western Carolina is a great school with a great community behind it.
Junior,5,"The professors are amazing and are every passionate about what they are teaching, as well as very understanding and accommodating of student situations."
Sophomore,5,I love WCU! Great marching band. The professors really care about each student. It truly feels like home.
Sophomore,5,"I am a still a fairly new student to Western, but my time here has shown that it is a really lovely campus. The professors are adamant on being passionate in their respective fields of study, it makes you want to go and learn. There is a diversity all around. The option to take are limitless. There are very few, if not any downsides to attending this University, but if i had to make a single change it would be to make expenses a bit lower."
Alum,5,"WCU is a fantastic school with a great teaching staff, learning opportunities, and degree options. The location is incredible too!"
Senior,5,Outstanding programs. Excellent online classes and layouts. Everything from blackboard to the Western Carolina website is outstanding. I am a distance education student and it has been night and day to the college I came from. The criminal justice program has to be one of the best on the East coast. Extremely intelligent professors who know and are able to teach excellently. Major plus is the fact that it is apart of the NC tuition assistance program.
Niche User,5,I went to Western Carolina University during the spring and it was an amazing experience college that offers a lot to the students . It has many great opportunities and has an comfortable feeling.
Niche User,5,"I love everything about Western Carolina University! It is such a family atmosphere and they are all very welcoming. At my first open house, everyone was super helpful regarding where everything was and they were happy to answer any questions that my family and I had. I am super excited to spend the next few years on the beautiful campus in Cullowhee!"
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere on campus! everyone is so welcoming and so open to new ideas. Also the greek life on campus amazes me.
Freshman,5,"Western Carolina University is located in a small town named Cullowhee, although there is not much to do around town, the beauty of the campus is worth it all. As well as the classes they offer, and all the support and help that have."
Freshman,5,Great school and the mountain are beautiful. The people that work at western Carolina are very nice and I love that I choose here.
Freshman,5,I love the scenery and how beautiful the campus is! They have good dining and the dorms are so nice. The diversity is great and I love how welcoming the people are. Overall a great campus and wonderful people.
Freshman,5,"When I first went on a tour at Western Carolina, my brother made me think that Western Carolina wasn’t as good as it actually was. Throughout the years, I’ve attended drum camps and tours on campus and I grew to love this school so much. It’s such a great place to live and the education and other programs are amazing."
Sophomore,5,I love the community here at Western Carolina University. Such a great supportive community aids in the learning process of college life. I am so thankful that I am attending this University over any other. The instructors are overall amazing and full of knowledge about their study.
Sophomore,5,"Imagine you're at your favorite place in the world and you never want to leave. Western Carolina University is that place for me, I can't express how much I love being a Catamount! Here at Western I've made friends everywhere I've been (including the line at Chick-Fil-A) the students here at Western Carolina are proud to wear purple and gold and I encourage you to join our crew."
Freshman,5,"The campus is the perfect size, a fair amount of walking but other than that everything is pretty close together. The teachers actually want to get to know you and want to help you an anyway they can. Everyone is pretty supporting. Western is a very accepting community."
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere. Western is the most enjoyable place I have ever been to. The students here are involved all around, and are the most friendly bunch of people I have met! I first arrived to Western alone with no one to talk to, but within 72 hours I had already made a few friends just from walking around campus. Those connections even led me to join a fraternity.  The outdoor life is also great. I love going on hike's on the beautiful mountains we have here. I could not see myself at any other school.  Lastly, but the most important is the $500 tuition is the best thing to offer. I do not have to worry about my taking out loans or anything. I am grateful for Western Carolina."
Sophomore,5,"The professors genuinely get to know you and learn your name rather than just your face. Western is such a beautiful campus located in the mountains, and there are loads of wonderful people."
Senior,5,Western has provided me with the ability to understand and enhance my knowledge of the world and its surrounding areas of interest. I was able to help the community in larger ways than I had first imagined. I was able to graduate with an undergraduate degree in 3 years because of the helpful and knowledgeable advisors.
Sophomore,5,the college is placed in the middle of nowhere. it is a very quaint nice college. it is not too big not to small.
Sophomore,5,The professor to student ratio is great. Its a small regional university and I do not like large schools. Its close proximity to Asheville North Carolina. There's lots of outdoor recreational activities to do .
Senior,5,"I have had an amazing experience during my time at Western Carolina. I have played baseball for two years here and I have enjoyed every second of it. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and there is so much activities you can do here. All of my professors are very well qualified and very good at what they do. The area of Cullowhee has so many different things to offer such as fishing, hiking, tubing, and other recreational events. I have always felt safe in this amazing atmosphere. There is nothing negative that I can say about Western Carolina University."
Sophomore,5,"I am already attending WCU and have had an amazing experience so far. The campus is gorgeous, the professors are nice and always willing to help, and the food is really good. Besides that, I can't say much for the party scene cause I don't go to them, but the library is super nice and the librarians have helped me a lot with past assignments. The walking trails are gorgeous and we have several of them plus walking around Dillsboro (the little town outside of campus) is a great way to spend a weekend (after studying of course)."
Junior,5,Western is a beautiful campus and an amazing school. The classrooms aren't as big as most universities but I believe that allows for a better education.
Sophomore,5,"I love the ""customer service"" @ WCU!!!  They are always very cordial and never treat you like a bother, welcoming, and they've ALWAYS returned phone calls and replied to emails quickly ... ALWAYS!  You can call 10 times in a day and the same person will be just as chipper on the 10th call just like on the 1st call!"
Sophomore,5,The professors really care about the success of the students . The campus is beautiful and small enough to get to know your classmates
Freshman,5,I like the environment and the people that are there. The other students and professors are very nice and caring. It is a great environment to be in.
Sophomore,5,"I love the scenery western offers. They have a great outdoors life and makes students feel welcome at all times. The professors are great and attentive. The food is okay but what we have is super yummy. I like how many classes and opportunities western offers. We have greek life, club sports, intramural sports, and many other clubs that aren't sports. The campus itself is not terribly big which is good for walking to classes. They have many off campus living choices which I think is vital In a college town. The Professors use blackboard very well and make sure each student is understanding his or her material."
Freshman,5,"Western has been the greatest decision in my life. The tuition for me being an out of state student is phenomenal! It was cheaper than anything in SC that I got accepted to! It has the atmosphere of a small college and everyone there is very friendly. Their athletic training program is top notch and I highly recommend that program, especially the professors! The climate for me was perfect because growing up in the Charleston, SC metro area, I wanted to go somewhere cooler and Western did just that. Even though it is in the middle of nowhere there is still a lot to do within an hour- two-hour radius of campus. All in all, this is an amazing school and I absolutely love it!"
Junior,5,"I love the environment and the students as well as faculty and staff.  I do wish they would change the system for parking and other student services such as on-campus housing and food services on campus.  I recommend WCU for anyone that enjoys adventure and the outdoors, as well as a small-scale school with lots of energy and community engagement."
Sophomore,5,"Western Carolina is just a wonderful school. If you like to get out and enjoy nature this is the place for you. There are plenty of hiking trails, lakes, and river near Western Carolina. There are plenty of water falls you can out and see on your free time. The Fine Music Art center here is wonderful and we have the best band in Western, North Carolina!! The faculty and staff here at western are wonderful. The have many different backgrounds with plenty of experience that helps them teach their courses successfully. All of the professor always have a positive attitude during class which helps keep students engaged. Another advantage to Western Carolina is the student life. There are plenty of carnivals, festivals, and movie nights so you can get out and meet plenty of people. Over all, I would recommend anyone to go Western Carolina!"
Freshman,5,The environment is great! They have so many programs to get involved with in every aspect of majors or just interest.  People ate very open and welcoming as long as the staff.  If you're stressed   just walking outside can be so relaxing and seeing people outside produces good energy and positivity all throughout campus.  People are truly concerned with others well being whether it concern school work or your well being at a party.  Best choice I could've made!
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere that I witnessed it was the best college I've seen so far. I felt like I belonged and that I was meant to go there.
Junior,4,"I've enjoyed most of my experience at WCU! Though there have been several stressful moments with class work and exams, there is so much to enjoy around campus when I'm not stressing on school work. The football games, which always have an awesome halftime show by the band. There are movie showings in the UC on the weekends and many other activities throughout each week. Also the campus is not far from the Blue Ridge parkway and many hiking trails."
Freshman,4,"I really like how the campus is laid out, very easy to find your way around and everything is very close together. The only bad part about going to school here is that there is not a lot of activities going on in the surrounding cities. There is not much to do if you do not really like the outdoors, not much shopping places but many places to go hiking and the such. The staff and students are very accepting and kind, easy to make new friends if you are coming here alone. Has a wide range of programs which is very nice if you can not make up your mind."
Freshman,4,"This time during COVID-19 is much more difficult to learn and be involved with my classmates. However, during this time I have had a very good learning experience. My online assignments have been very engaging and manageable, and I feel as though my instructors are still passionate about sharing knowledge with us for success even if it has to be online. My online lectures and Zoom calls throughout online learning have been engaging, and have given me the ability to communicate both to my classmates and my professors."
Alum,4,"Smaller class sizes and many expansions project were great. They continue to grow in number, but seem to be managing that well."
Freshman,4,I love that the campus is nice and packed so it is easy to just walk everywhere. The online portals and resources are extremely easy to navigate as well.
Niche User,4,"I am very familiar to the area, so I am transferring, but if I was completely new to this area and looking for an outdoor school with a closely-knit feel, WCU would definitely be the school I would be looking at! I feel there is definitely a weird attitude around making friends, with occasional ""clique culture"", but maybe that was just personal experience. Overall, very great programs, instructors, and clubs and student organizations!"
Graduate Student,4,"WCU has a great campus, it is very safe and has beautiful scenery. It is located on old Cherokee land and pays homage to the Native Americans often. Courses can be rigorous but with the smaller class it is very likely you will receive help from your professors if needed. As far as student activities, the University tries very hard to keep students active outside of class with fun and interesting engagements."
Graduate Student,4,"While I have taken no directly online classes, I have had experience with the online portal that professors use. Blackboard can be used efficiently if the teachers know the system."
Alum,4,"Western Carolina was life-changing. Cullowhee is so different from anywhere my family has lived that it opened my eyes up to different American subcultures.

The student body is diverse in origin and in belief. I feel that regardless of your background, you will encounter good-faith people with different backgrounds and views on the world. Regardless of your religious and political orientations, you will be challenged in some form or fashion.

All of the professors in the Political Science, Business Law, and German departments took questions and gave productive feedback when asked.

The people at the food courts worked hard and were very polite. The food on the whole was tasty. Anyone will have to find for themselves which dishes are blander on certain days than on others.

As you can see, it was a great school all-around."
Freshman,4,Western Carolina University is a good all-around school the offers tons of events year-round. the courses are great and the people are even greater.
Junior,4,"The university has been a really good one so far. They helped me by giving me a payment plan my first semester; but sadly don't have one for summer semesters. The teachers I had for my first semester were really knowledgeable, and for the most part, interesting.  I am currently working and going to school so I am not that active on campus. However, given the location of the campus and my familiarity of the area, it is a pleasant place to be."
Senior,4,I liked the availability of online classes.  Instruction was professional and worth the money.  The campus is beautiful and the people are down to earth.  The registrar's office is helpful when you are in need of information.  The opportunity for my family to be able to study online changed the outlook for my career goals and I am grateful for the experience.  My advisor was very helpful and personable.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the area that it is in. It has beautiful mountains. I also love my instructors and the smaller class sizes. I feel that I am getting a quality education. However, it is known as a party school. Additionally, I prefer not to live on campus because you must buy a meal plan if you live on campus. Due to a medical condition, I must be on a specialized diet that the university does not cater to, so I must do extensive paperwork to get accomodations."
Junior,4,"I just transferred here and so far everything seems really great! The dorms are pretty nice and the faculty and staff is incredibly friendly. The hardest part has been finding a job--no luck yet, but hopefully that will be easier in the fall semester."
Freshman,4,"Im a current student at Western Carolina University, and I can confidently say that I enjoy my time here very much. The walking distance to classes is extremely bearable, and my class times are perfect. I give WCU four stars because it's a beautiful institution with wonderful professors and administrations, who include their students, and a no hate campus. However, Western is sloppy about housing, seeing as I will have to live off campus next year due to not enough beds on campus. Theyre tearing down two dorms, and not building new ones soon enough. There's not enough housing for students, and it's a big bummer...as well as terrible parking. But besides these negatives, it's a beautiful campus."
Freshman,4,"Western is an amazing campus in general. The faculty is very nice and overall very helpful. The only problem is the food is not good at all. I feel like for Western to do better in the future, they need to improve their food options."
Niche User,4,Western Carolina has an amazing climate for good spirited individuals. It has ideal scenery and a great student spirit.
Sophomore,4,"Over all it is an amazing college, it seems very safe even during nights. Though it could be more diverse."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Western Carolina as my college because although the campus is sitting in a valley-like area, we are surrounded by the beautiful mountains, especially during the month of fall and spring when the flowers form and leaves change color. The campus itself is not too costly and it is well known for it's pride of the mountains marching band which is going to be performing in the Macy's day parade this year. It holds many different majors and degrees for incoming students and allows many international students to attend the school as well. The faculty genuinely seems to care about my success and is very helpful with putting me on the right track to receiving my degree and getting a job or internship in the new future."
Freshman,4,What I do enjoy about Western is that it has a very simplicity feel to it. It is the perfect size school for someone who is looking for a moderate small to medium size school. Because we are right in between the mountains of NC the scenery is beautiful through the seasons. Because it is a little more secluded I actually do feel more safe than I would in a bigger school somewhere closer to a city. Western offers a variety of things to do for the students in order to get us involved around campus and keep us busy with other activities besides school.
Niche User,4,"The community is wonderful and all of the activities like football games and homecoming. Lots of places to sit and do work as well, not to mention a great marching band!"
Freshman,4,As a Freshman I love this campus. From someone who is an Out of State student I found it super easy to make friends with the many social events on campus!
Junior,4,Only been involved with WCU at the start of this Fall 2019 semester.  My daughter lives on campus because it is mandatory.  She also had to purchase a mandatory food plan which she has a hard time finding food to eat because she is a vegetarian and eats only fresh foods.  The admission process was smooth and all were kind.  Her professors really seem to care by taking the time to work with her since she came on campus academically a junior but socially a freshman.  She feels safe.
Freshman,4,"I really like the multitude of clubs, organizations, and activities on campus!  We have so many restaurants on campus and places to study and hang out with friends.  I just wish more happened on Friday and the weekends.  Campus is practically a ghost town after classes Friday."
Senior,4,"I love the location of this campus, nestled in the mountain of Western North Carolina. The campus is gorgeous and there is a beautiful hiking trail hiding behind the Health and Human Science building. There is plenty to do on campus and off campus. You will have an awesome experience going to this school!"
Niche User,4,I liked how there were many things to do and that Western Carolina brings all activities to the college. I wish it wasn't in such a small town with nothing in the actual town but at least there is a lot at the college.
Senior,4,"Very organized and helpful. Very supportive and responsive to questions during admission process. Instructors and administrative personnel email back answers quickly, day and night."
Sophomore,4,Western Carolina University is an excellent school with a high importance on the students. Western offers many great programs for different interest. The advisors effectively help the students to get where they need to be in four or less years. There is a varied of clubs and student activities to keep students busy and happy.
Sophomore,4,"I love Western Carolina because it feels like home to me. I have so many great friends and feel so welcomed by the staff and orientation leaders and I have only been there for a semester. My first semester there was absolutely wonderful. The food there is terrific, they have so many options in the cafeteria along with Chilis and Chickfila and so much more. There are so many things to do at Western and it is so easy to become involved at the school."
Sophomore,4,The campus is not very confusing to get around and is easily maneuvered through. The people are not that bad and the professors can be very caring.
Sophomore,4,"Western Carolina is a very great school, but during the weekends there  isn’t much to do around the local area. Plus, this school have  professors that actually cares about their students and grades."
Sophomore,4,"While I have for the most part enjoyed my experience at Western the financial aid office is terrible to work with, I sent in my information financial aid for the upcoming school year at the start of the semester and did not get anything in return until June. Many of the professors are great but I had one who was overall a bad professor and very discriminatory towards females in the math program (this includes me) in his math class."
Freshman,4,I went to Western Carolina for camp during high school and everyone was so welcoming to me and others aswell. I went for their soccer camp I got tons of exposure and experince as well. I also went to vist a friend how lived on campus and she showed me around the campus it was big enough to always meet new people but small enough to fel safe and comfortable as well this why I'm going there this fall.
Alum,4,Western Carolina is located in a beautiful area. Lots to do outside and lots of outdoor programs available to students who want to adventure!
Junior,4,I just started here so i am not sure if I can give it all 5 stars. So far I have had a great experience with the admissions offices and working with me kindly through all the struggles of getting things transferred over. The professors seem to have a great reputation and I am excited to continue my journey.
Sophomore,4,"I originally applied to Western Carolina because of NC Promise, which grants in-state students $500 tuition per semester, but ended up falling in love with the school. Most classes have fairly good student to teacher ratios, making it easier to reach your professor for any questions or concerns. Western Carolina has some of the most genuine and caring educators that I have been privileged to know. You have to enjoy the outdoors if you're thinking about attending because 90% of the activities outside campus have to do with the outdoors. Dorms and near by apartments can be a bit expensive but are relatively cheap compared to other colleges in North Carolina. Campus parking is a bit difficult as well because it's to find parking spots during the weekdays. Overall, Western Carolina is a great school with a stress relieving scenery that never gets old!"
Freshman,4,Its such a beautiful campus with really great people! I've met tons of great friends and am excited to continue my education.
Freshman,4,"Western Carolina University is a beautiful campus that is centered in the middle of a valley between mountain ranges. The sights are very pretty and the campus is very involved with nature. With that being said, I wish there was more of a push towards recycling and helping the environment because the campus is full of nature. The academics here is nice and the professors and be a range from very sweet, to cool, and sometimes can over estimate the knowledge of the students (i.e teaching a general chem class like its organic chem).  The campus is in the middle of nowhere, meaning that there are no places to go to off of campus except for the local Walmart. The football team kinda sucks but the marching band here is amazing. Would recommend this school if you are not a big sports fan, enjoys nature, and/or is a science or forensics major."
Freshman,4,"Western Carolina has been very welcoming to me.   They supply all of the resources I need for me to have a successful collegiate career and to have fun while doing it.  There is always something happening on campus, everyone truly wants the best for everyone, and also the campus is very beautiful.  As long as you work hard for the University, the University and the people at it will work hard for you."
Freshman,4,"Western has been amazing so far in the time that I've been here. The scenery is great, the people are very nice, the staff are very passionate about what they do and there are a lot of opportunities on campus. The only thing about Western that is a little iffy is that the parking absolutely sucks and the closest city is over an hour away so the internship or part-time opportunities off campus are very limited."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy this college. The campus is modern and updated and the campus community is very friendly and outgoing.  This campus is not a large campus but is it large enough to give you a sense of community and family. I wish the surrounding community had more entertainment restaurants and shopping options. With the limited number of options, the student have to depend on activities and involvement on campus."
Freshman,4,Western Carolina is a beautiful outdoorsy school. They have great housing options for students and an amazing student recreation center. The teachers and staff are easy to talk to and very helpful. There’s many opportunities to make new friends and the diversity is very obvious. It is a very inclusive school that I am proud to be a part of.
Sophomore,4,"I like how a lot of the professors do care about your grades and want to help you succeed in your education. The campus is gorgeous, especially in the fall. There are a ton of food options, and it is in the beautiful mountains and good town."
Sophomore,4,The teachers I have had so far have been very involved and excited about what they teach. They are great with their students and really care about each students' success. The only complain I would have is Western's population is growing quicker than the campus can manage. They are running out of dorm space and parking is terrible.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Western Carolina University is a very well established place to receive a higher education. With it's beautiful outdoors, student to teacher ratio, and variety of clubs and organizations; you can get very involved. The only negative part of WCU is the parking situation on campus very difficult to find parking as a student."
Graduate Student,4,"Western Carolina University is an amazing school! The people at Western and around the community are great. There is always fun events going on around campus. The food has always been good to me. Plenty of housing options on and off campus. The campus rec center (gym) is super nice! I spent many hours in there. My favorite part about Western is the fact that it's in the mountains! I love outdoor activities, such as hiking, kayaking, fishing, and more. I have made some long life friends here, and a lot of wonderful memories! The reason I gave Western a 4-star rating is because I wish they had an exercise/kinesiology undergrad program I could've taken. Other than that, my overall experience at Western was great! I'm so excited to be able to attend graduate school at Western this coming fall!"
Niche User,4,"Students are passionate and diverse, the staff cares about the future of the university. its a cornerstone of the area and central to life in the surrounding small towns"
Senior,4,"Since a junior in high school, I knew I wanted to attend WCU. I was drawn to the family-type of environment, where you really get to know your professors and you get to know more people more closely. Being a transfer student, I was a bit intimidated at first, but I have really gotten into many student events (especially outdoor events) as well as having interesting classes. I have loved my experience here this far, and would recommend to anyone that loves an exceptional small-town atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,Western is a great school if you like to get outside. The outdoor program here is incredible and I would recommend taking advantage of it. There are always different events happening on campus that are fun to get involved with.
Senior,4,"Western Carolina University is located in the mountains and always offers beautiful, breath taking views. Most of the professors are amazing, kind and ready to teach. The campus is gorgeous and kept clean all year round. The faculty is always trying to find new ways to encourage diversity and kindness across campus. There is always something exciting happening on campus. The campus is also always expanding offering more for students to do and see."
Junior,4,"Western Carolina University is the perfect school if you want to be surrounded by the outdoors. This university provides many outdoor programs that keeps students busy. They decreased their tuition to five-hundred a semester to help students, like I, afford a four-year university. WCU has also been recognized as the number one outdoor school in North Carolina. They offer activities like whitewater rafting, hiking, rock climbing, and fly fishing. Western is not only outdoor oriented but ethnically diverse as well since they have a large portion of EBCI tribal members, like myself, that attend the university. This school is perfect for any student that wants to be surrounded by the beautiful Appalachian mountains and ethnic diversity."
Freshman,4,I really love that everything is close by. I love the fantastic views and the amount of happiness that is here. This school is really amazing and I love it. I wish they could change how people drive because there has been some pretty bad wrecks already. I wish they would give all dorms AC units also. It’s kinda not fair that freshmen dorms get no AC and have to use a fan but the upper class gets AC.
Freshman,4,"As a small school, WCU is very friendly and community focused. If you want to have deep meanings with professors and students, this is the place to be."
Freshman,4,"Last Minute Productions puts on a lot of great programs throughout the year! The parking situation isn't great for freshmen, but i have the storage lot pass and it is tons cheaper than a freshmen or residential pass. I mean you have to park a mile away from campus, but its not that far when you take a cat tran."
Freshman,4,WCU was my best decision of a college. Everyone is friendly and there are many ways and activities to get involved on campus. My experience here so far has been a blast and I can't wait to continue my education here and see what lies next for me at Western Carolina University!
Niche User,4,"Great atmosphere and friendly people, it is a nice rural area, with a great academic, and athletic feeling, when I went to the open house, I met some of the students there, and I felt like I fit right in, I like that there is free tutoring if someone falls behind, or struggles in the course. the campus is a condensed, user friendly campus, and a nice surrounding area. The courses at the university are challenging, but not impossible, and there are many opportunities for internships, and for job shadows, and job creations. Western is a unique school with a very kind atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"I love the scenery around the campus and the staff is very friendly. If you do talk to other students, the welcome you with open arms."
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere and the encouragement of learning, but I would like to see an improvement in diversity and food."
Freshman,4,"Western Carolina University is such a beautiful campus, filled with friendly staff and professors, all held together with students who also make it great. Anywhere you go you will see someone with a smile on their face, and the mountains surrounding the campus are one of the many things that make it so beautiful."
Sophomore,4,"WCU has a great campus and a great atmosphere. The people are wholesome and are there to help without any question. Everyone prioritizes their time to focus on school and friendships. Respectful is a word that comes to mind when I think of Western Carolina university. If I had to change one thing, I would say the communication between the school and their students and staff needs a better connection. There are just a few gaps that would make a huge difference if there was more effort put into fixing them."
Freshman,2,If you come from a larger city do not go here. There is nothing to do outside of campus and youll get bored very easily.
Sophomore,2,"It was more of a suitcase college, many kids went home on the weekends. There was not a lot of different clubs to do compared to the size of the school it was."
Freshman,2,"Did not do much to make freshman feel welcome and meet new people.  Campus feels very isolated,most professors are great and willing to help."
Freshman,2,"Being a person from out of state, New York, I certainly do not recommend this to someone who is not from the area. Many people go home on the weekends and even change their schedules so they can go home for long weekends. There is not much to do in the area unless you want to drive an hour to Asheville. There is also absolutely no diversity whatsoever."
College Junior,2,not involved and live off campus
College Freshman,2,"I won't even lie, there have been some nights where my friends and I got all dressed up to go to a lame ass party that got shut down before we got there. Parties are lame, kickbacks are average. The only good ones I've been to are at the football house, peaks, and sometimes riverwalk. The absolute best parties are off campus sometimes an hour away."
College Freshman,2,Tucks is the only club
College Freshman,2,The Football team has their good games and bad games. Most other sports are vaguely attended. Athletics aren't a big part of campus life but if you participate in a sport you get a little more attention then the average student.
College Sophomore,2,Off campus dining? That is a thing here?
College Junior,2,"I got a scholarship from the school when I first transferred here but it got removed after a year even though I am a Dean's List student. It's very hard to get other scholarships. Forget that I'm a Deans List student. I'm not from North Carolina, which makes it really hard for me to get any kind of help."
College Junior,2,"The food options are cool. Moe's is awesome. But there's no variety. There's only so many items on each menu. After about a month, I get sick of every restaurant on campus. The food upstairs is bad about 85% of the time and they rarely change it up. I feel like I eat the same food over and over again, which is really annoying. The food is also way more expensive than it probably is at the real versions of the restaurants. Moe's definitely does not cost $10 for just a taco and a drink with a side of queso & chips in the real world. I'd bet on that. It's just frustrating that's all. They also give you way too much for the all DB plan, so you're left spending money left and right. I wish I could pick how much DB I want and just pay for that. I feel like I'm wasting my parents money when using it, but buying upstairs block meals is a waste too because the food sucks."
College Freshman,2,There are not many affordable options for students to share a suite.
College Freshman,2,They declined the Golden Leaf scholarship for me because my mom had to take out money from her 401K for surgery.  I was told this made her income too high even though it was for medical purposes.
College Freshman,2,"I live off-campus and it has been a constant struggle. There are many college students that are broke and cannot afford to live in the main off-campus buildings that have all of the fancy amenities. If you can even find a place that you can afford, it is probably so run down that you would not be able to live there. Right now, I live in a studio apartment with my significant other and the rent is more than $600/month, which is the best we could find but way too expensive for such a small place. We find ourselves borrowing money frequently in order to pay rent because we cannot afford it, which is setting us up for more misfortune in the future. We do not have any washer/dryer access, so that is an additional cost. Cooking in our kitchenette is almost impossible. And the cleanliness is ridiculous. But, that was the only option we could find. We have been here for almost 6 months constantly searching for another place to live and have yet to find something that we can afford and that is reasonable. A brand new off-campus apartment complex has just been built, but the prices are way too high for us to move there. I really wish the school would consider the individuals that can barely afford to live in a $500/month apartment and do not want to live in a falling apart, bug infested location, which is about the only thing you will find for that price."
College Freshman,2,"There are always parties going on despite the day of the week, I mean really who needs to study? You just have to be cautious, many on campus parties get busted and I mean if any party gets too big cops are liable to show, so keep it discrete. Even if there is no parties you want to go to you can always grab a few drinks and gather in a friends room"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really care for the campus food. It isn't all that great to me. There isn't a lot of food options, so its take it as you can get it. If you have the choice of being able to just cook for yourself, it would be the better choice."
College Senior,2,"Wow. No. Nightlife here is awful. There's maybe a handful of bars in this area, and all of them are sketchy and you have to battle skeezy college boys the entire time. You'd have to drive an hour to go anywhere that was even worth hanging out at."
College Junior,2,"The health center receptionists are kind, it is conveniently located, and it takes walk-ins.  Unfortunately, the doctors are unhelpful and creepy.  It is difficult for a female student to see a female doctor, as there is only one and she is rarely present.  I was very uncomfortable when I visited the health center.

As far as safety, the students seem to take it more seriously than the faculty.  Awareness is the main form of ""defense"" against sexual assault on campus.  Unfortunately, information is not.  They tell us sexual assault happens, but don't tell us how to prevent it or what to do if it happens.  If I or someone close to me was sexually assaulted, I would not know what to do or who to ask for help.  I'd probably just drive the four hours home, instead of deal with the convoluted school system.  They have the tall blue things to call police if you feel unsafe or something happens, but I sometimes see ""Out of Order"" signs taped to them.  I have been verbally harassed walking to my dorm at night.  I do not feel as safe as I could on campus.  I tried very hard to avoid going out after dark, until I moved to a dorm more in the center of campus."
College Junior,2,"The school advertised a new scholarship system in Fall 2013.  It was like a common app for scholarships.  A majority of students used it, expecting to earn some money towards tuition and expenses.  (The financial aid is less than helpful.  More on that later.)  I applied for over 20 scholarships.  No one heard a word about it until 3 months after they said we would be contacted.  Despite being from a struggling household, maintaining a job, and earning a 4.0 GPA, I received nothing via the new system.

The financial aid office has never been kind when I've called with questions or concerns.  They are often condescending and rude.  In person, they've been helpful and nice.  Additionally, the lack of financial help given is appalling.  I come from a single-parent household and have a brother entering college.  The school still expected us to pay more than half of our yearly household income out of pocket for one year of tuition.  Speaking with the financial aid office proved futile and distressing."
College Junior,2,"There are very few people who do not identify as conservative Republicans.  There are many exchange students from Saudi Arabia, but racial/ ethnic diversity is limited beyond that.  There is an LGBT+ organization on campus, but it is small.  I met a few people who identified with the community, but the community itself is small, especially when you consider how many students there are in total.  I didn't notice vast diversity in economic background.  Most students appeared to be middle class.  There are many Christian churches of varying denominations on or around campus.  The Baptist community is very noticeable.  It's what you would expect from a Southern nearly-Bible-Belt school.  There isn't much religious diversity, if any."
College Sophomore,2,You may as well just bring your car.
College Junior,2,There is not much night life around. A few bars.
College Freshman,2,It is either snowing or raining.
College Freshman,2,freshman parking is absolutely horrendous and other spots fill up quickly 
College Freshman,2,we live in a valley and the only town near us is really small so we dont have a lot of options
College Freshman,2,The guys at Western are all the same. They don't want any type of commitment with females. They just want to use them 
College Freshman,2,It is not a place for blacks
College Junior,2,It is hard not to get at least a B in every class. Most classes are set up for you to succeed without much effort. Most professors do not really care.
College Junior,2,"The school does not offer the best academic wise. I spend a lot of class time watching videos my teacher has chosen offline to show us. Many of the classes in my major have no application aspects, we just learn definitions. Also the focus of my major is not what I had hoped."
College Junior,2,There is never any place to park. We are soon to be correcting the problem with a parking deck.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many places to sit down and eat as far as chain restaurants. There are a lot of fast food places but the variety is not much to be excited about. 
College Sophomore,2,Parking is awful! Unless you get to campus early you may not find a good parking spot. But the bus system for off campus housing is very nice and convenient.
College Senior,2,"I'm a commuter, and parking can be tough to find since we share lots with the residents.  Spots can fill up during the week pretty quickly.  It's easier to find a spot on the weekends, though"
College Senior,2,"There's a few places to eat on the campus, but once you get off the campus there's not much around"
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many options and the upstairs ( cafeteria) food is no good. The salad is wilted and gross by dinner time every night. The floor is always a mess. Watch where you step it might be a cookie, fry, or something else. On the plus side most of the workers are friendly."
College Sophomore,2,"I have not heard a single good off-campus story. The area is vastly over priced, landlords don't fix basic complaints, and there doesn't seem to be any laws protecting the individual in cases with roommates or fraud. However, the area is also home to community college students and other local students, who don't have a choice but to have off-campus living. If you look for off-campus, I recommend looking outside the immediate campus area, and take into consideration the parking issues associated with driving to school. The good news is off-campus housing is plentiful and finding roommates is simple."
College Sophomore,2,"You have to know your way around campus in order for parking to be even feasible. The large number of signs that list tow-away or wheel-lock zones intimidate visitors. There are limited student parking spaces, and the problem has spilled over into the community: all empty parking lots are listed as ""Church only, all others will be towed"" etc. Incoming students are advised to not bother with a car, and just use their bikes or the limited public transportation. If you have a parking permit and have been around for a while, it works."
College Junior,2,"The parking isn't that great at Western for freshman, because they have to park the farthest away and anytime there's a football game they are required to move their cars for visitors to park and then they have to move it back once the game is over. I am not taking my car my freshman year and I would recommend others to do the same. You don't need a car anyways, the RA's on your floor are always asking if anyone needs a ride to go somewhere and we have a bus that takes you around campus which is great!"
College Sophomore,2,The police are very strict about underage drinking and also the use of drugs. Make sure to follow rules about no underage drinking in freshman dorms they are very strict. Make sure you park where you should it is very easy to get a ticket and if these are not payed when it is time to sign up for classes you wont be allowed to do so.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Small school equals small networking pool.  Dependent upon your program of study, internships may be hard to come by.  In my program of study, I had to network on my own and create my own internship opportunity."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Being that the school is in the rural mountains of North Carolina, there's not a lot of diversity from an ethnic standpoint.  However, there is a lot of diversity from a social standpoint."
College Sophomore,2,"The only transportation from the school is going to be a transit that takes you around campus. There are no good ways to leave campus except by a car, but grocery stores and wal-mart and restaurants are all located within 5-10 minutes of campus so if you can just hitch a ride you'll be fine to enjoy everything in Sylva. There definitely is a need for transportation from the school though to actually go out into Sylva for students that don't have cars or don't have connections to anyone with a car."
College Freshman,2,I don't party so I don't really care about the nightlife.
College Senior,2,The mountains are great because you are in the smokies and Cherokee is nearby other than that its pretty sad.
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria food gets old fast, so do all of the on campus resteraunts."
College Freshman,2,"We do have about every fast food place needed,  and there are a few places to go for a good bite to eat.  But there are not many really good restaurants that i would highly suggest to go for great food or nice atmosphere."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few off-campus dining options in Cullowhee. This is a beautiful, rural area. More dining options are available in Sylva. There is a new  Mexican restaurant barely off-campus, located on Old Cullowhee Road."
College Sophomore,2,"Some places are great, like rabbit ridge, laurel oaks and even some trailer parks. There is a lot of close housing as well, but some houses are old, falling into disrepair and they have termites."
Recent Alumnus,2,"WCU is located in Cullowhee,NC with the county seat of Sylva just down the road which houses your basic fast-food restaurants and a few more ""fancier"" options on main street."
College Junior,2,There is almost nothing within 4 miles of campus. Sylva is the closest town and they are just developing their culture.
College Sophomore,2,It is rare to find parking within reasonable distance if you are a freshmen and commuter must get to class 30 minutes early for any hope of finding a spot.
College Junior,2,While there is a fair amount near campus only a few apartment complexes are really nice. If you want to bring a pet the selection is limited.
College Junior,2,"Cullowhee is a small town; there do not appear to be too many options.  I live in Asheville, which is the closest city.  My commute is approximately forty five minutes.  During the spring and fall it is not too bad, but during the winter icy conditions can make the mountainous drive quite dangerous."
College Freshman,2,"Drug Usage – Some People partake in alcohol and drug use, but its not a problem if you dont because you wont be trated any different for standing up for what you believe in"
College Sophomore,2,"Consequences Are Cruel – The consequences for getting caught underage drinking or drug use are harsh. I understand that the student should get in trouble, but the punishments are unreal."
College Sophomore,2,"Some Good, Some Bad – WCU is pretty average when it comes to dining. The general dining area has is ups and downs and if you want to get something a little more nice, you have to pay up a little more than if you were to go to McDonald's."
College Senior,2,Greeks Are Not Really Involved – Greeks live on a far side of campus all together instead of the traditional houses that you think of. They try their best to get involved but I do not feel like the University is very conducive. They dont let them tailgate like most schools or have activities that most greeks participate in.
College Junior,2,"Better Students Get Better Dorms – If you are an athlete or an honors student you may get to live in a newer, or cleaner dorm.

However, if you are an average college student, expect to live in a dorm that is not very clean with no air conditioning or elevators."
College Freshman,2,Not Bad but Routine – The food in the upstairs dining hall isn't terrible but it is routine. Also it is always better for tours and open houses. The rest of the places around campus are good but they start to become old and routine as well after awhile.
College Sophomore,2,"the food in courtyard dining is the same, and disgusting.  the food in the UC is better, but only open on weekdays."
Alum,1,"Avoid this  black hole of ""education"" at any costs.  It is ignorant, racist, red-neck, and hostile.  Professors gravitate here that cannot make it at other universities.  In particular, avoid the theater department, which has maintained its standard of depriving students of an education and casting outsiders who do not even attend the universities in its plays, to feed the egos of its incompetent ""professors"".   I survived this school, and graduated with a degree I was embarrassed to have, as I knew what it represented. This school's ignorance and mean-spiritedness damaged my life, and I had to take classes for many years afterwards at other schools to make up for it.  The surrounding town of Cullowhee is out of the film ""Deliverance"".   I had no self-esteem at the time, and it took me three tries before I was able to escape this depressing place.  Returning to this school to graduate was the biggest mistake of my life.  
You have been warned."
College Sophomore,1,One frat was banned from campus hah
College Sophomore,1,There are not a great deal of scholarship opportunities for an out-of-state student.
College Junior,1,"I'm not very far into my major yet, but the community has been extremely unwelcoming.  They have an official learning community called Whee Teach.  I didn't join, because I planned to double major and didn't want to be cut off from the rest of campus.  Whee Teach participants all live together on the top floor of Scott.  Each freshman is mentored by a sophomore.  I reconsidered joining, but no one I spoke with who had been in the program indicated that they enjoyed it or benefitted from it.  It was more drama than it was worth, from what I gather.  As a result of my not joining, I have been barred from core classes aimed at education majors.  I have been excluded from important information and events regarding my major.  And, faculty from the education department are unwillingly to work with me when I have questions or concerns.  I have also heard from those farther along in the major, that the dept. faculty is very unorganized.  Many transfer or change majors as a result."
College Junior,1,"The main dining hall (buffet style) has been known to make people extremely sick on multiple occasions.  They did away with the vegan section altogether last year, leaving me (and many other students) with extremely limited dining options.  The salad bar stayed, but the food is frozen more often than not.  It's entirely inedible.  More than once, I found gnats in my food.  Others claimed to see roaches crawling out from under trays.  The dining hall (where you use block meals) is not worth the time, money, or health risks.

If you have ANY dietary restrictions, this is NOT the school for you.  

My restrictions are medically necessary, but even after talking with my doctor, the school was unwilling to work with me.  It ended up costing me $1000 in an unusable meal plan.

There are a handful of restaurants, but only one or two offer healthy food.  If you're okay with a diet of pure grease and unidentifiable masses, you'll be fine.  Otherwise, apply elsewhere."
College Senior,1,"we are terrible at sports, but people go to games i guess"
College Sophomore,1,Our marching band is better than our football team. Let that sink in.
College Freshman,1,Freshman parking is the worst.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall is the worst, I was tired of it after the first few weeks"
College Freshman,1,Its always raining and cold
College Junior,1,WCU stands for we carry umbrellas. The Weather is unpredictable and miserable. 
College Freshman,1,Freshman housing is THEE WORST!
College Junior,1,"I haven't qualified for any financial aid such as scholarships.  I'm trying not to get any student loans, so I haven't applied."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is terrible. Finding a spot is so bad they have bumper stickers about being late because you cant find a spot to park. Parking permits are only 80 something a semester. Freshman parking is the worst because you  have to par in the baseball lot and many car windows get smashed in from foul balls.
College Junior,1,It's annoying when your not greek and you approach a greek organization to help you on a project and they want nothing to do with it they have there pet projects they have done every year for years
College Freshman,1,The parking is horrible on campus. They have huge lots full of empty spaces for upperclassmen and the freshmen are left with far away parking that gets filled up to the max. I do not think its fair we are giving designated parking spots. It should not matter where we park as long as we can get a good spot.
College Freshman,1,"If you are 21, there are a few bars, i think 3.  These can be fun i guess, but Western is definitely not known for the nightlife.  There are usually good house parties to go to, but sometimes can be far from campus and with all the mountain roads its not always easy to find a driver.  and police like to bust parties."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing. some bars, but not what you would expect for ""college life"" people rating B obviously dont know what night life is. "
College Junior,1,"If you are an upperclassmen, there are several different lots in which you can park. These are usually near the dorms, but away from classes. Commuter students have a difficult time finding places to park close to classes, and freshmen parking is horrible."
College Junior,1,"Special Diets (Allergies, Gluten Free, Lactose Intolerant, Etc) NOT Met – The campus dining requires residential students to have a meal plan.  This is good because each student is able to eat since the cost is shared among all students in dorms.  However, this rule is so strict that even a doctor's note will NOT let you get out of the meal plan if you have a medical food allergy or intolerance. 

They say that they can accommodate special dietary needs but they offer little or no selections. For example, students with these needs can ONLY eat at the dining hall (not mcallisters, panda express, etc...) SOME of the time, since they only offer special items one or two times a day and usually the same food item.  Unfortunately for me, I have had terrible reactions to their ""safe"" foods.  Could be potential for a lawsuit since I submitted a doctor's note but forced to have the meal plan."

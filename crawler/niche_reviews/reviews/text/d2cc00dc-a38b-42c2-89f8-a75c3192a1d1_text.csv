Senior,5,"The online experience at Brazosport is wonderful. The syllabus is well written for each class. most of the time the teachers will have you sign an acknowledgment that you understood it so there's no confusion. The staff is great so you can always contact them by e-mail, cell phone, text, or college contacts."
Senior,5,"When I started at Brazosport I started late and didn't think I would even be able to attend. However, after going to the school and meeting with the counselor he sprung into action. Dr. Greer helped me get my application started by getting me through the TX.APPLY step to enroll while I was right there in his office. After the initial set up application, we started talking about my transcripts. My transcripts were a little tricky because they came from 3 different colleges so he introduced me to Ms. Mills the advisor/secretary over the Bachelors of Applied Technology Program (B.A.T) She helped me get all the information needed to get all of my transcripts sent to the administration office electronically. Within two short weeks I had made the deadline of getting all my paperwork in, fees paid and was enrolled in my first two classes. I can't thank the college enough for having such great staff. They are thoughtful, helpful, and helpful from start to finish."
Graduate Student,5,Brazosport college has provided me with the best opportunity for success. Choosing Brazosport College after high school allowed me to save money for 2 years and build relationships with everyone on campus. The campus is literally like a family and the professors interact with students and get to know them. There are so many events hosted around campus so there is always something to do. They provide you with free tutoring which helps you whenever you need it.
Graduate Student,5,I enjoyed online learning at Brazosport College. I believe the classes were set up as closely as possible to an in person class. Everything was clearly stated in the syllabus. Professors provided all the learning material you needed and were always ready to answer questions and help when needed.
Senior,5,"The transition to fully online due to Covid-19 went well, and few students actually dropped courses. The spring semester is technically still going after a pause for the in-person classes/trades that had to be completed in person, but only after the college went above and beyond in getting the college ready by creating special classrooms with social distancing guidelines in effect. The college is also handing out facemasks and doing temp checks at the door for all students that have to come in, as well as any employees that must be there."
Senior,5,"We use D2L Brightspace platform for our online classes. It works very well, is simple to learn, and almost never has issues. I have been fully online since the beginning and it works well for me. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA the entire time, and am a member of Phi Theta Kappa. The instructors are great, always available by email or phone if needed, and always helpful. Online tutoring is also available if needed."
Freshman,5,What I really enjoyed in Brazosport College was a great experience with the professors and the Faculty there. I love how they have amazing classes that fit in with my prerequisites and how affordable it is.
Freshman,5,The staff is very helpful and I enjoy going here because it is close to home and offers online classes so I can get college credit while I'm at home
Niche User,5,Financial aid is stellar! The professors are very supportive of all their students. They want nothing more than for you to succeed! Since the school is so small it allows for one on one time with instructors
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed taking the online courses.  The professors were available if I needed them.  The school is good at noticing a student's academic achievement and provides scholarships accordingly.  Only downside is the cost of books on campus.  Though they do offer a price match at the bookstore; I found it easier and more affordable to order through amazon.com and rent or own the textbook that way.
Freshman,5,"Brazosport College has a great atmosphere. Everyone on the staff is always friendly and willing to help with whatever it may be that you need. They make it very easy to be successful at Brazosport College. Classes are small and teacher to student ratio is amazing. Brazosport College even has a great student life. They have the Swamp where students can relax, play video games, billiards and many more. The college even has an on campus child care center with great rates for students and staff members."
Freshman,5,The counselors are extremely helpful with helping you plan for your future no matter what your path is.
Freshman,5,"I am very pleased with my first semester at Brazosport College. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The appearance of the college is modern and artsy and I love it, it is easy to maneuver around and if you get lost, just ask! The resources are very good, there are so may computers available at all times. As well as study locations, the college is usually quiet and supportive to studying students. I have never felt mistreated or unsafe here, that is always good!"
Junior,5,Excellent College to attend if you are considering! Definitely recommend to all students in the area.
Sophomore,5,"What i really like about brazosport college is the diversity of classes available, and since it is a community college you can get to know your teacher, unlike university where you have 300 other students taking the course with you."
Graduate Student,5,"I have loved every moment of my college experience. While classes and schedules may get a little crazy, my college is consistently there to help along the way. I am so proud to say that I have attended this college."
Works Here,5,"The aspect I like the most about Brazosport College is the double role it plays in a providing a close community and bestowing preparedness for university life. I noticed in this institution students and faculty members have close relationships, and everybody knows each other pretty well. Even though the community of this institution is smaller and closer, the courses can still challenge students in a way that improves their academic attributes and responsible decision-making skills in preparation for a four-year institution. So, if you're a student who enjoys smaller classrooms and values close relationships with your professors, and you want to essentially test the waters of college life before moving on to a big university, Brazosport College is the right place for you."
Freshman,5,Brazosport College is awesome. They have so many excellent programs that will meet everyone's needs. The staff and professors are so nice and caring.
Sophomore,5,"The people there are so friendly, and the staff is amazing to work with! The staff is so helpful. They have many activities during the semester, so getting involved ad meeting new people is very easy. The teachers are great, the classes are a usually no more than 25. You ask the teacher for help and there is no hesitation, some even have teacher assistants that stay after class and help you. The security is great too. If you are there late you can ask a security guard to escort you to your car. This is a great school to start with!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience in brazosport college was great. When I needed help for a class, they have programs that they offer. In a lot of occasions I was there most of the time, especially for my writing assignments. They also have a reading program that a lot of teacher take is a extra credit if you participate. They have a lot of programs, and they also have a lot of other activities going on. They  also have a lab where they have a lot of computers and you can use them. Printing is for free, you can just take your own paper and print. There is also a small store that has a lot of supply and also if you need something to snack on. It is helpful, because sometimes people do not have enough time to go and make food. Classes are very clean, and they are small. The only problem is that to sign up for classes, it gets full really fast."
Sophomore,5,"Brazosport College is one of the best community colleges you can attend. It is a great place to get your degree, the college offers so many programs that you can achieve in a couple months if you are looking for a short career; or if you want a long- shot careers their are many classes you can take and can transfer to other colleges without any problems. I highly recommend this college, I'm currently a student here, an i am about to enter the ADN program. It is a great place to put your hands on education."
Sophomore,5,"The Academics at Brazosport College are less than challenging. Some classes especially online classes lack the engaging qualities necessary for enjoying what you learn. However, there are some gem professors (E. Masterson and S. Tarrant are two) whose classes are amazing. The price of Brazosport can't be beat and the amount of help they offer you to get your Associates makes graduating a walk in the park."
Freshman,5,I have really liked going to school at Brazosport. The teachers I have had are some of the best.  The campus is well kept with it's own on campus security.  The class sizes are kept at a good number of students which helps in my learning process. Overall a great school.
Niche User,5,"I just moved to Angleton, 15minutes from where BC is, I haven't been in school for over ten years. The staff are very helpful, friendly and kind. I felt the empty and sincerity from the scholarship/financial aid department."
College Junior,5,They offer many times to take the class or taking it online have helped balance school and work and personal life.
College Freshman,5,The writing center is amazing it has helped me so much and I feel accomplished every time I leave there.
College Freshman,5,"Being at the school, has given me the chance of growth and finding out where I am going to be and how my life will be."
College Freshman,5,The counselors have gave me a copy of what I can transfer to what college and how it works
College Freshman,5,"I'm currently taking the Individual transitional math, helping me with college algebra"
College Freshman,5,The counselors help place in where you need to be for your dream career
College Freshman,5,The professors have actually taught me and I feel more successful just in one semester
College Freshman,5,Love this place I have learned so much in just one semester and met so many good people and have memories that the professors help us.
College Freshman,5,Brazosport college has been great! My professors last semester were all very helpful. The writing center tutors go way above and beyond! I'm glad I'm getting my associates degree there!
College Freshman,5,The professors are great gate
College Junior,5,I believe we have a very diverse group of people in very aspect of the word!
College Junior,5,"The ADN program at BC is phenomenal! All the instructors want to see you succeed! It is small enough to where everyone becomes a family! It is an honor to be a part of the program. Everyone seems to look up to the people in the uniform. I know  I did before I was in the program. The workload and schedule can be a little crazy at times, but it has all been worth it. There is method to the madness!!!"
College Junior,5,"There is a wide variety of subjects offered at BC. The professors all seem to know their material very well! The class load has always been manageable. At times it will get a little stressful, but it is normally my own fault for not having better time management."
College Junior,5,You can rely on the internet access here. There are plenty of computer labs if you do not have one of your own to bring on campus. You can even rent laptops!
College Junior,5,My overall experience at Brazosport College is an experience that keeps me coming back for more. Brazosport college continues to offer better experiences each year.
College Junior,5,"I can only describe it in one word ""Awesome""."
College Junior,5,"All I receive was an A.A degree. It wasn't hard, but wasn't easy. 
As far as internships go all you need to do is volunteer in in the community. You will be recognized if you try hard. I have had many internships, and can say that volunteering will get you to know many contacts."
College Junior,5,"Your automatically accepted. Overall in the Student Body you or any one who decides to go will find a very diverse community. Any thing from White, Hispanic, African Americans, and Asians. There are also clubs on religion that are very good such as Revive BC. "
College Junior,5,"Financial Aid Process was very good. 10/10
All you need to do is call them before you go, and they will help you out with the materials you might need to finish your forms.
"
College Junior,5,"Computer Labs are a plus, printing is one dollar for a package of 100 pages, and as far as the reliability for network goes it is very impressive."
College Junior,5,"What makes Brazosport College unique is the matter in which the administration, staff, and professors have handled their input into making a difference into their jobs. I believe that Student Life has really tried to keep the students involved with the many campus events they have hosted. Since this is a community college all you need to do is follow your transfer guide or finish your core curriculum. The campus itself was remodeled, and some facilities like the Clarion (Music), the Sadler Building (Science and Nursing), and the BASF (Process Tech) Building are brand new."
College Junior,5,"As far as my experience with online courses goes they were pretty challenging, but with enough hard work, and dedication I got through them. When I took online classes it was during the summer, so the work load was a lot, but keep in mind these were summer courses. The registration process was easy, and the student professor relationship was very good. They offered many discussion boards were I truly had many peer-to-peer interactions over questions. Overall the experience was super. "
College Junior,5,"So far my two years of experience in Brazosport College has been smooth, and great. Enrolling online is very easy, and fast. I hardly had problems with the system. Transferring credits has been a breeze, as well. Not many altercations occurred while I searched for ways to transfer. One point I would clearly like to point out is that Brazosport College has many resources to help you become successful. One is the Student Success Center, which provides free tutoring for Math, English, and other courses. The other source is called the Student Café. There they have transfer guides that help you with your transfer process. If you use these resources to your advantage you will find that Brazosport College will make your college experience stress free."
College Senior,5,"The college has an art gallery that is continually displaying student art. There is a very modern, state of the art auditorium where the college and local school bands, jazz bands, and choirs perform regularly.  There are indoor and outdoor stages for production put on by the college drama classes and also area high schools perform at the college faculties as well. The community is very involved in the college as well as local high schools working towards involving students to create interest in furthering their education. "
College Senior,5,"Without financial aid it would not be possible for me attend college. Due to downsizing, I have returned to college with hopes of rejoining the workforce with a better than average chance of gaining a quality job. The financial aid staff have been most helpful in directing me though the continuing process of receiving a pell grant and student loan. They work hard to help every student on an individual basis to get through the red tape and hoops involved with signing up and filling out all the necessary paperwork and forms. "
College Senior,5,With the offering of online courses it has been very easy for me attend and work as well as maintain my personal at home obligations. 
College Senior,5,"As an older adult returning to college to pursue a new career, I have been very pleased with my college experience. Of course I am older than most of the students parents I attend with, but that has not affected me in the least. The professors have been very helpful and college experience as whole has been better than I could have ever expected it to be. The curriculum is exactly what I need to complete my goals as move towards my bachelors degree. One get out of college what they put into it and I have worked hard to make the best of gaining my education. 
"
College Senior,5,"The college provides many areas of study that are a primary source of workers for the local companies looking to hire an educated workforce. There are several petrol-chemical and industrial complexes here that depend on college students to fill jobs. The college offers certifications as well as associate degree programs along with a Bachelors of Applied Technology degree program. Offerings also includes a nursing program, police officers academy, and many technical programs that train students to be ready to enter the workforce with the skills necessary to excel."
College Senior,5,"The tuition for this college was very reasonable and financial aid was a breeze to work with, I got the money I needed to help pay for school and occasionally even had some left over. "
College Senior,5,Brazosport is an excellent college selection if you want to get your basics done or join the nursing or engineering programs. There is a fantastic selection for courses in both of those fields. 
College Senior,5,"My experience at Brazosport college has been wonderful and I was fortunate it happened to be the nearest community college to my home. All of the teachers I've had have been excellent. There are many opportunities for tutoring, Brazosport even has a math and writing center where peers and teachers assist you in your studies. "
College Senior,5,Even though it is very small it serves it purpose very fairly.
College Senior,5,"There is a lot to do. We have a really nice weight room. Our ""Success Center"" gives us the opportunity to have free tutoring. It is really awesome!"
College Senior,5,"We are allowed to print as much as we want with our own paper. And if you are somewhere where it requires you to pay, you can just substitute your unused paper for your printed copies."
College Senior,5,"I love the weight room on my campus. Before I started working last year I spent a whole lot of time in there, and loved it."
College Senior,5,"My college is smaller than a university, so you get more one-on-one help from instructors. My college also is much less expensive than most colleges."
Freshman,4,"I would like more professors to choose from in the classes I know I will struggle in. Other than that, the college has supplied me for the future extremely well."
Freshman,4,"I only take science classes there, so I don't spend any time in the main building, but the college is very nice. The writing center is very good and has helped me with many assignments. Every teacher I've had at BC has been good. It's a very good place to get your basics before transferring to another college."
Senior,4,The best part about Brazosport College is that they now offer a 4 year degree with contracts for graduate degrees with other major universities. The ease of registering and the online class options are wonderful for my busy life and it is what made me decide to go back for the 4 year degree. I can do all that without breaking the bank.
Freshman,4,"Very good, friendly community college. Helpful on multiple levels and the people try to work around your schedule."
Sophomore,4,"They are definitely there to help students succeed. Easy to enroll, and most of the teachers are really there for you as a student."
Niche User,4,I like that they offer the most up to date technology. I would say about half of the teachers I had were whole hearted about teaching and the other half seemed like they wanted a book to teach you. Algebra was my worst experience and Health and Safety was the best experience.
Sophomore,4,"From dual-credit to full-time student, I loved Brazosport college. All classes (online, dual credit-off Campus, and on campus) were great and did not fail to reach my expectations. Only complaint, is the lack of subjects of classes and electives to take through BC, but what they do have is phenomenal."
Sophomore,4,"Overall good education, not much else other than that to be honest. I think it's hard for some students to be part of BC community considering no one lives on campus."
Freshman,4,"It is very resourceful and beneficial to any type of student. Problems can occur due to miscommunication when it comes to talking to staff about schedules so if more resources came available for that, it would make things easier."
Freshman,4,"The staff of Brazosport College are very helpful, from registering for your first class to the professors keeping you up to date on class assignments, if you're unable to attend class some days. The only change I recommend is tutors for all mathematic courses not just the most common ones."
Sophomore,4,"Great school. Great staff. Plenty of 2 and 4 year programs now. Also, trade skill classes. Great local college for the area and has grown a lot in science and trades department. Not a party school or athletic school. No housing or dorms. Does have daycare for parents which was a huge help in the last for friends I know."
Senior,4,Brazosport College is a beautiful campus!  I love that all of my instructors want me to succeed and push me to do my best!  I love how my instructors come up with ways to make lectures interesting!  I would really like to see Brazosport College associating with student loan organizations so that other students have a way to pay for their education.
Freshman,4,"Brazosport college has a variety of academic choices for today's student. I have found this college to be quite accommodating for any course of study. The Dow learning center they built is amazing. I would however, love for the process to be a tad easier, I can't complain. Overall the school is awesome and I am happy to be a student at Brazosport college."
College Junior,4,The career center provides great help for places students can transfer to.
College Junior,4,I've had great experience with the professors I've had. They always have gone above and beyond to help when needed. They also made sure their ways of teaching helped each and every student's needs.
College Junior,4,The degree gives students the opportunity to search for great job and internship opportunities.
College Junior,4,Classes needed are offered and professors do whatever they can for the students to comprehend the area we are learning.
College Junior,4,"Very great college! It offers many great things and opportunities for students to interact. Such as GATOR, and events."
College Junior,4,Brazosport is a small community oriented school. I love being a gator and everything that comes with it. It is a great school to start out on because they transition you well from being in high school to college. I would do it all over again if I had to.
College Junior,4,"Brazosport is a good school for me because it has what I need. I'm getting my basics done before I go off to a university and BC is a great fit for me. The professors I've had are wonderful and make their classes fun while using the time wisely. At Brazosport, they have many helpful events that go on throughout the year. Gator book club taught me about Henrietta Lacks and Hela cells and gave me extra credit for a class. The career fair helped me lock down my choice of being a nurse and taught me how to write a resume. The college fair gave me more ideas of where I could go after Brazosport to continue my education. The only thing I don't like about Brazosport is the woman over financial aid. She is very rude to me and it isn't helpful because I need financial aid, but she makes me not want to go into the office. I do go in though because that's the only way. Overall Brazosport is a good college that is very student orientated."
College Sophomore,4,good flexibility of classes and times
College Sophomore,4,still have other students to help
College Sophomore,4,good help lining up job opportunites
College Sophomore,4,lots of different degree plans
College Sophomore,4,"very highly recognized community college, good teacher refrences for getting jobs/careers"
College Sophomore,4,instrumentation Technology; help me to advance in the I&E field.Lots of training opportunties
College Sophomore,4,wonderful teachers and after hours programs and events
College Senior,4,The classes are small and easy to learn in.
College Senior,4,My biology professor made the subject exciting.
College Senior,4,I had fun with many of the classes.
College Freshman,4,I've only been at Brazosport college one semester and I'm understanding more and more than I expected to. My English teacher helped me so much and I actually know how to write a well written paper.
College Freshman,4,I've been elected Student Government representative and I love the leadership of the association and meeting new people and friends and making memories.
College Freshman,4,Some of the best things in this school is that the student center is always available for us as students. They can help you on anything you need help on and their very friendly and nice.
College Senior,4,My credits and my degree are transferrable to any 4-year college as far as I know. Brazosport handled the transfer of credits from my former school in a smooth and timely manner. The veteran's assistance office is top-notch and the financial aid office is essentially very understanding and willing to listen to students needs and concerns.
College Senior,4,I have taken online classes at two other schools and I have to say that the system at Brazosport is the simplest to use. The head of the online education office is a very knowledgeable and practical person and it is evident in how the system is run.
College Senior,4,"Brazosport College is a small school, and professors here are not paid as well as they would be at a larger institution. This shows in the fact that most of the higher qualified professors seem to actually care about teaching and are not here mainly for prestige or money."
College Senior,4,The counselors are very willing and available to help out. The meetings are not timed like they can be at some larger schools.
College Junior,4,"There are two things I love about BC. One is the gallery. It is in the main building; and, it will hosts some of the most interesting pieces of art. The other thing is the science labs. They are well equipped and set up in a very inviting way!"
College Junior,4,"It is reasonable priced. It does cost a little bit more if you are out of districts, which does add up over time. However, it is very reasonable priced considering all the free tutoring and mentoring available."
College Junior,4,The college is very interactive. There is always something going on!
College Junior,4,"This particular college has grown so much because of the fact of its availability of classes,variety of classes  and the top   Job aspects. Brazosport College emerges with some of top leading companies to ensure students with many options for job placement. I am currently enrolled and will continue to enroll until I revive my degree."
College Junior,4,"job prospects 10/10
career center 10/10
alumni network- not sure"
College Junior,4,"Gator loft (weights) 9/10
Student Center (Tutoring) 10/10
Library 10/10
Campus Activities 10/10
General Campus aesthetics 9/10"
College Senior,4,"Accessibility to computers around campus is very good. There computers located throughout the campus and the wireless network is very good. Sometimes the system runs slow, depending on the number of students logged in, but most times it very reasonable. The library has printers and copiers as does the learning center. Some printing is free as part of our student fees, but for some copies it can be five cents a sheet, which is reasonable."
College Senior,4,"There are many activities around campus in the student center, fitness center, and game room. The numerous clubs have various events happening regularly as well. "
College Senior,4,"Being an older adult student, I do not associate much with these much younger students but from my classroom experience with them  most are very serious about obtaining good grades and moving their education to a higher level."
College Senior,4,"The classes are easily accessible online and system works most of the time. I never experienced any down time due to the connection or web site having problems. Each professor has a different teaching style which takes a few class sessions to adapt to, but overall most are helpful as well as accessible with in a reasonable time frame. The workload depends on the individual professor and the amount of materials that must be covered during the semester. 
The registration process online is quick and easy as well as making online payments. We have a call center, where I work part time, that is there to answer questions as well as assist students with finding their way around the college website. The website is very user friendly once the student has some basic understanding of the different information that it contains, like add/drop classes, finding the cost of classes, and the course schedules and catalog that are there for them to refer to.
"
College Senior,4,"The school is small, but well equip to handle the students needs. The school has an excellent library and learning center. There are several perks that are included in our fees such as free tutoring, plenty of assessable computers, and people always available to help the students with academics, registration. and financial aid.  "
College Senior,4,"I went to Brazosport to get my associates of art, but I honestly didn't take many art classes. I got my basics down, but because it is still a fairly small campus there isn't a massive selection for course loads. I ended up having to take another biology class for my extracurricular because there weren't anymore art related classes to choose from. The job opportunities at the school are just student worker positions working in the office or the library. The only job related to a form of fine arts was a position I took in the theatre as a crew member. "
College Senior,4,"Although there were bugs on occasion, the system is relatively easy to use and very convenient. In my experience the workload is quite reasonable. Generally one assignment is due every week, and after the selected number of chapters are up you take a unit test. In the classes I've taken we have always had assignments that involved posting information on a selected subject on a forum and then commenting on another students post. This was an interesting feature that definitely made it feel more like a classroom. "
College Senior,4,"There is a lot of things we can do together as students. We get encourage to go hangout at the ""Swamp"" which is like a game room and other places like that. "
College Senior,4,They cool thing about the school is that they encourage us to call and email our teachers. The school makes sure that each teacher tells us (the students) when they are available to meet. Each teacher is just a few moments away from a phone call.
College Senior,4,Every one is nice. A little town with a big heart.
College Senior,4,There is some classes where the professor can only be contacted through email.
College Freshman,4,"They have a lot to offer, regardless of your age, grades, or situation."
College Senior,4,I chose Brazosport College because it had a magnificent dual credit program with my school and was located conviviality. I also liked how flexible the times were for classes. Brazosport even offers online classes if the scheduled class times on campus don't work with a student's schedule.  The teachers are also very thorough and the curriculum is well planned.
College Senior,4,I love the fact that our classes are usually composed of a small number. It makes the classes feel more personal and it is easier to form an awesome student-teacher relationship with your professor. The small class sizes also give you more ample opportunity to ask questions and get help. The educators are also quite fantastic. I have yet to have a professor that wasn't willing to work with me or any of my peers if we were having trouble or needed something explained.
College Senior,4,Our school has a massive variety of people attending. There are students from just about every age group and ethnicity. Everyone is very friendly and in attendance to learn. Brazosport College definitely harbors a great community feel among the student body.
College Senior,4,"Brazosport actually has really fantastic on-campus resources! We have a great gym, a sizable library, and quite a few computer labs. My favorite thing about the campus is the fact that we have easy access to a writing and math center along with tutoring and study rooms complete with a white board and markers in the Student Success Center. There are a plethora of clubs to join on campus as well, including the ever famous Zombie Club. The campus also have a few places to eat or catch a quick coffee before that 8am lecture. There are even tons of comfortable, quiet places to study all around the campus. All in all, Brazosport College is a very well equipped campus!"
College Freshman,4,"We have a huge student success center, and the library is very up to date. The fitness center has all the latest equipment. Also, student committees and organizations are always doing something. And the campus is really lovely."
Sophomore,2,"Constantly changing degrees/courses.
Add requirements that force you to go backwards
Always not offering  the advanced/senior classes but numerous beginner/freshman classes which leaves MANY students unable to finish their degrees.
No real support from administration except shrugging shoulders.
Teachers not showing up for classes, leaving you to teach yourself.  Many classes are going to online versions, still full/not available.
Just sick of the money we have put into this school with NOTHING to show for it!!"
College Freshman,2,I prefer in the classroom
College Senior,2,There is not a lot of help for my field
Freshman,1,I don’t like it. I’m being blunt because my teacher has never worked in the field. I’m trying to get my education up but my add  impedes . We lack in money so we can barely get money for a physical dignaostic
Recent Alumnus,1,Do not help at all! Thank god its not a super expensive college or no one would be able to receive any benefits from FAFSA or other scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,1,I really do not like online classes for reasons I have said before in this survey. Not being able to ask questions and have them answered immediately is terrible.
College Sophomore,1,Login Issues – The only problem I have found lately is the issue with logging in to my IT account to get transcripts and info.
College Sophomore,1,"After my first two semesters I went to the financial aid office to fill out my paperwork for my second loan.  I was told on the first day of registration that Brazosport has a requirement of 31 credit hours for freshman before more financial aide can be achieved.  I work a full time job and have completed 16 credit hours in two semesters, one of them was summer, and can't afford to pay for college.  That day I registered for 13 more credit hours to be told that I have less than a month to pay $618 plus books to be able to go to school for the fall semester.  I do think that this can be changed through the proper channels."

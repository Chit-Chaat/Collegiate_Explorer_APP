Freshman,5,"West Virginia University has a great, alive atmosphere. There are plenty of spots to go hiking in or go out with friends. The food is pretty great and gas is super low"
Freshman,5,The majority of my classes are in person and I love my professors. They are very helpful and give great advice. The party scene is amazing and the cops are always all over the place. There is always activities to be doing or great spots to hang out with my friends
Freshman,5,I am taking online courses at WVU and I could not be any more pleased. The professors are very good at helping me with whatever I need as well as the administrators. The academics online is very organized and very easy to understand. I would recommend WVU to everyone!
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at WVU and I love it. The college is very organized and always trying their hardest to help the students. Unfortunately, I am taking my classes online Due to Covid-19. Having my classes online doesn't bother me that much because the school treats me just as if I was on campus. I have nothing bad to say about WVU because they have been nothing, but good to me. I would be greatly appreciative to receive this scholarship because I have not received any financial aid. As of now, I am only a part-time student because that is all I can afford without any financial help. I would be a full-time student if I could afford it. Please consider me. Thank you."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are amazing! I'm in the engineering program and this school doesn't weed you out, instead they welcome you in and want to see you succeed. Tons of opportunities academically and socially. Always something to do!"
Junior,5,"West Virginia University offers a quality education at an affordable rate with many amenities included with the tuition including a full-service rec center, three dining halls, convenience stores, many campuses across the state, and much more! As a student employee of the university, I take pride in what I gain from this institution."
Junior,5,"Even with most classes being online this semester, I was still able to gain an understanding of content and music practices. Many professors do assign more assignments since they assume we will have more free time, which is inconvenient."
Junior,5,I absolutely love attending West Virginia University. The environment is welcoming to all and the atmosphere is unbeatable.
Junior,5,Online learning at West Virginia University was simpler than at previous universities I have attended.
Sophomore,5,It is a great university and I recommend anyone that is a senior in high school to highly consider WVU as an option. It is #1 in forensic science and the engineering program here is amazing.
Sophomore,5,The online experience is almost the same as the face to face experience. I wish to be back on campus though!
Sophomore,5,Very helpful staff that are aimed to help you get your degree. It is a very safe environment and I have never felt unsafe on campus. There is nothing I would change about the school.
Sophomore,5,"West Virginia University is such a LIVE place to be. Every single day a new club or activity is going on in our student union. Everyone is included here, Fraternities, Sororities, ROTC, and Sports all come together to be something bigger than themselves. 
Classes vary in size but every professor is always willing to sit one on one with a student. Students are always willing to get together to study also! It’s a great learning environment.
WVU is a Division I school. Everyone there cares so much about sports and going to games. 
West Virginia University is an amazing place to be !"
Sophomore,5,I’ve taken 2 online classes in my first year on campus. Online classes are a great way to get work done on your own time. Professors are always giving you tips and tricks to understand the content better. Many times online professors will offer in person class days too! When the  coronavirus pandemic struck and we were all forced to go online professors were very understanding. My anthropology even gave us many opportunities for extra credit !
Sophomore,5,I love West Virginia university. Going here is defiantly one of the best decisions I have made in my life so far. The staff  and professors are so helpful and always there if you need help. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the diversity is amazing. I can not wait to return in the fall.
Sophomore,5,"I was worried about changing over to online instruction but it was actually fairly easy, and that is not just because I go t to do it in my pajamas! My professors knew it was going to be a big change so they were helpful and always there to video chat if we needed something urgent."
Junior,5,"West Virginia University has given me the best couple of years so far. They offer so many different activities around the campus through out the semester that allows for students to come together at such a large university. They thrive on trying to bring students of all interests into common areas in order to build up a community within a community. They  do games, crafts, and food options every weekend that are free to the school's students and a guest. WVU has provided me with the sense of home and community while also learning how to become my individual self that is self-relying and independent. Since day 1 at WVU, I have felt at home."
Sophomore,5,"The professors really tried to adapt to this new experience. No professor made me feel bad for missing classes to help sick family members, or struggling more with not being in my normal learning setting. They continued to challenge the students, but with respect to all the things the students were enduring at this time. Teachers adjusted their class times and how accessible information was. An incredible experience, it was all I could have asked during these trying times!"
Junior,5,"It’s a fun school with great people, teachers, and scenery. The sports events are always a good time and there a thousands of fans. I am still attending and everyone semester is an adventure."
Junior,5,The instructors were nice and usually helpful. I was in engineering and their program is very good. I would recommend the engineering school because they focus highly on it.
Sophomore,5,"Everything you could ask for in a school. It's a big campus that feels small with familiar faces. Reasonable class size. Great student life, both night and day. Very safe with the states best hospital right on campus."
Alum,5,"Best 4 years of my life! Great atmosphere, safe, lots of clubs and activities! So proud to be an alum!"
Sophomore,5,Many of the professors truly care about the students and their education. Many are there to help at any moment.
Sophomore,5,"I love West Virginia University! I just transferred here this past spring semester and even though I didn't get the full semester experience, it has definitely been worth it. The advisors, professors, and staff here are amazing and are always willing to help students with their needs. It feels truly like home and everyone here is very welcoming. I feel like I've learned so much already in the little time I've been here. The education and experience is not comparable anywhere else. I've loved every second of being at WVU and truly think my degree from them will go far in the future."
Junior,5,Before I went to WVU I was at my local community college. I did like going to the community college but when I transferred to WVU it was completely different. Life there is much more exciting. Ive met some really good friend that I know I will have for the rest of my live. I have only been there for one semester but I feel like I have learned more there in one semester than I have in my entire life of schooling. Everyone there is looking out for each other. I've been in the library with friend at 2 in the morning trying to do homework. I was never sure where I wanted to transfer to from my community college but now since I'm at WVU I wouldn't change my decsison.
Sophomore,5,"I cannot express how much I love and care for my campus. I was a former student in a urban college of Virginia. I transferred to West Virginia and became a Mountaineer. I have yet to regret or think twice about my decision. The pride of mountaineers is unmatched. Everyone here has a connection and love for their education. The campus is something very near to my heart, it is the perfect mix between city and country. Many opportunities and relationships to encounter. WVU is an amazing college and i would recommend to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"I like how this school feels like a family. Even though the social life isn't everything at a school, the social life here is amazing. The professors are great and all of the people on campus are great too. One thing that isn't great about that school is that some of the dorms are outdated and some don't have AC. It would be great to have more comfortable dorms with at least AC"
Freshman,5,"The application process was very easy and everyone I have spoken to was very helpful and kind. I loved the campus when I visited and I am excited to be an incoming freshman next year in the pre-nursing program. They also have many scholarship opportunities for most of the colleges and programs. There is a very big sports scene which is very fun and it is a big school. The area immediately around it has a little town with lots of restaurants and coffee shops but when you drive 15 minutes away from campus, there is not much there."
Sophomore,5,I feel like this university is home. The people are some of the most welcoming and hard-working individuals I have ever met. The faculty does an amazing job of making students feel welcome in office hours. I love the campus atmosphere and school pride.
Freshman,5,Absolutely great school with so much school spirit!!! Fills Morgantown with pride bringing everyone together. Great professors and numerous resources. Offers limitless opportunities to all students.
Sophomore,5,"West Virginia University is the greatest school on the planet. I have never been in a more united place. Everyone in Morgantown is a Mountaineer, including the teachers and the very citizens."
Freshman,5,"It took me no time at all to fall in love with the campus, after about a week I had already made a good group of friends and we would visit the different places around Downtown and Evansdale. I urge new students to go out and enjoy the experience and make plenty of friends"
Junior,5,"WVU is a great place to be. Although it may be considered a party school the education is good, and the teachers really care about their students."
Freshman,5,West Virginia University and the people there feels like home after you step on campus and make friends that will last forever.
Senior,5,"I am so happy to have chosen WVU as my undergraduate college. Although it has a huge reputation for partying, they still care deeply about academics and the campus. West Virginia University has taught me so much not only academically, but socially, culturally, and everything in between. I am very thankful for all the school has brought me and will continue to have Mountaineer Pride forever."
Freshman,5,I love going to school at WVU. I am a member of the marching band which has provided me a great sense of pride and closeness with all of my fellow students in Morgantown. I love the friends I've made and the relationships I've built with my professors.
Freshman,5,"West Virginia University is amazing. The atmosphere feels like home, everyone is kind, and it has the best spirit (GO MOUNTAINEERS). I do not regret choosing this school and I recommend it 1000%."
Senior,5,"Morgantown is the best place on Earth.  Classes great, parties amazing, the girls are incredible.  You will get laid"
Sophomore,5,West Virginia University was the first campus that I visited when searching for a college to attend. I immediately fell in love with the campus. It felt like home right away.
Freshman,5,the experience has been amazing everyone is extremely inclusive. the classes have been good some of the professors really care about the well being of the students and want to see them acheive amazing thing and advance in there lives.
Niche User,5,It was a very nice experience every time I took a tour or attended an event here. The university is very proactive in helping potential students with any questions by setting up meeting times in which you can call your guidance counselor at the school and ask them any questions you have about tuition and such.
Alum,5,"WVU is a huge college with lots of chances to meet so many different types of people. Dorm life was one of my favorite experiences. There are tons of majors to choose from. The REC center was awesome. There were always study groups, hobby groups, activities, ect. to join. I would highly recommend this school."
Freshman,5,"West Virginia University was the best decision I could have made when deciding what college to go to. The staff actually wants you to do well, and the campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,5,"Its a cool school. The people are interesting and some are pretty awesome. I've had a good time here so far. The food on campus is a little gross. There are very few vegetarian or vegan options which makes it difficult for me to find good food. The professors are good, except for the chemistry department."
Niche User,5,I'm not currently a student there but went for a visit with my family to visit the college. Hands down the most beautiful campus Ive ever seen. Some of the most friendly people Ive ever met.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone at this school is lovely. All of the professors really care about their students and their grades. Love getting to know professors on a personal basis as in graduate school
Freshman,5,The school is very lovely and the sights are amazing. The school offers much to do so you’ll never be bored!
Sophomore,5,"The quality of professors on campus is very high, it is easy to tell that each teacher is passionate about the field of expertise, and wants to help their students succeed in the future. The school also makes it student safety and accessibility to all a high priority."
Sophomore,5,"WVU offers a wide variety of programs and extra curricular activities. There is plenty of diversity among students including ethnic background, social classes, and overall interest in various activities. WVU students have a great sense of school pride and it encourages others to want to succeed while here."
Freshman,5,"There is always something to do, you will never be bored, and the school makes sure that you prioritize the time outside of class."
Graduate Student,5,"I've been attending the University for 4 years now. The night scene is incredible--there is always something to do! It is a small college feel in a big university town. The academics are great, with the University endorsing many students for nationally competitive scholarships."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about West Virginia University! The campus, the classes, the small-school-feel at a big school. West Virginia is a beautiful state and WVU shows a part of that!"
Niche User,5,The thing I like about West Virginia University is how welcoming and influential the staff and professors are.
Sophomore,5,They offer on-line classes that have been very convenient as a wife and mom.  Even though classes are on-line there is always someone available to get a hold of with any questions.
Freshman,5,to be a student at west Virginia university has been a life changing experience I have meet so many amazing people the sporting even spectacular everyone cis so friendly and is looking out for your best interest in mind.
Freshman,5,We were able to tour the campus with several student ambassadors.   They did an excellent job sharing their experiences.
Freshman,5,West Virginia University is very veteran friendly. There is an office in the Mountain Lair to assist with using your GI benefits.
Freshman,5,"It’s amazing! The students and staff are so friendly, I’ve had a great experience, the campus is clean... I recommend it to anyone looking! Everyone is always happy. There’s always something to do!"
Freshman,5,"So far West Virginia University offers me a really great experience that I know I could get elsewhere, yet it offers a lot for you to do and achieve as a student. Even being a freshman, they really show you what opportunities you can get and achieve throughout your years there. It has a really nice family environment within your major, residence hall, etc. and there are a ton of organizations to be apart of as well. Academic wise, there is a lot of resources to help you, even though some professors may not say there are or needed for a course, ask multiple times if you have too. Though the professors do help you with course work, which makes the learning experience better."
Niche User,5,"When I first visited West Virginia, I was a little unsure. It was so far away from home but once I stepped on the campus I knew that's where I wanted to go. The amount of school pride is unbelievable and the campus was breath-taking and there special monorails that reminded me of Disney were just amazing. Between a gorgeous school and a level, one trauma center hospital on campus was absolutely great for me being a nursing major.  So I would rate my experience unbelievable and can't wait to be a mountaineer next year."
Freshman,4,"I took classes online and it wasn't terrible, but I think the in person experience would have been much better."
Alum,4,I attended WVU from 2012 to 2015. I had a great time at he school and met many fantastic friends and professors. Morgantown and the atmosphere of the school are unmatched in beauty and spirit. I definitely miss my time there.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is definitely an adjustment, but my professors have been very lenient and understanding of technological difficulties and just general problems. My classes are mostly hybrid, so I have an option to come to class or stay online. All my lectures are always posted online and I have plenty of opportunities to go to office hours if need be"
Junior,4,"The professors are generally understanding of the difficult situation and try to have a balance of teaching, discussion, and work."
Alum,4,"My four years of undergraduate study at WVU were quite memorable. Within the first few weeks of living in my dorm room, I developed friendships with people that will last a lifetime. Introductory classes that are not GEF electives are hit or miss, but once you get into your upper level classes, you will love it. The professors, especially in the biology department, are very knowledgable and are willing to help you get on the path to achieve your dreams. The only caveat is that you can't be afraid to ask. Traveling between Downtown and Evansdale can be a struggle. The buses are more reliable than the PRT. If you have a car, or know a friend who has one, there are plenty of beautiful outdoor places to visit just outside of town. However, driving in Morgantown is horrendous during the school year. There is always something to do Downtown on the weekends, but don't feel pressured to go out every day. It may be an adjustment depending on where you're from, but the people are amazing!"
Sophomore,4,"same value as in person, better if you hate morgantown. at first it is scary how to organize but it gets easy"
Junior,4,"This concept is hard because every school everywhere was struggling with the switch to online courses after the pandemic happened, and that is unfortunately the only experience I have with WVU's online learning. It went well overall and a majority of the professors were very understanding and accommodating, however not all of the programs went as expected. Some of the testing got messed up, but even through those challenges, the professors were able to ensure that the students were aware of all that was happening. They took on the responsibilities of any faults occurring within their systems. Overall, the online learning service was okay. The important thing is that WVU has kept the students well informed and ensured that they are striving to make the online learning experiences better for everyone now that they have a better understanding on it all. That is what I love about WVU. Whenever they see a problem or fault, they see how they can better it for the students and faculty."
Junior,4,"Spring semester 2020, all classes at WVU were transitioned to online classes. Being in the School of Nursing, my experience was exceptional-- my professors made an effort to not only continue teaching but to modify it in order to ensure that everyone had the ability to truly focus and understand the materials. While online clinical hours were not a ""typical"" experience, I even grew closer with my peers and our instructor through the difficult times. Other semester courses that I had taken were fully online, such as Nutrition, and the material connected well with what I was learning in my other classes and gave me a good baseline of knowledge to refer to as needed."
Junior,4,"WVU gave me such a well-rounded college experience. From staying in the dorm and staying up all night with friends to making it a priority to get to class and spend some free time in the library, I was able to truly find a balance in my life that I had been struggling with prior to attending WVU. Making sure to utilize the campus services, including tutoring and the gym, I was able to find a second home at WVU and build a support system, despite being 5 hours from home."
Sophomore,4,"So far I really like the campus and how it works with the students. Even while the campus is closed because of the virus, I have had no trouble with talking to people about my upcoming semester and what I need to prepare going into it."
Sophomore,4,"I just love the mountaineer energy, excited professors, and school spirit surrounding the school. I think there are such incredible facilities to make the experience incredible from the state-of-the-art rec center, the PRTs, and the overall location. WVU never fails to give activities for every student. From fall fest to the downtown area to wilderness trips and a million things in between. You absolutely feel cared about by each member of the staff. It's a huge school so I was not entirely convinced this would be the case. They are reactive to any issues you bring to the table, you never feel like a low priority. They offer so many ways to help you succeed with free tutoring, multiple libraries, and intensive career services. They have such easily navigatble softwares and websites to help students with job finding and volunteer opurtunities. You will never feel alone here or like no one is willing to help. There is no way to be bored on campus either. It is an amazing place!"
Freshman,4,There is a great community at WVU and most of the professors (outside of the chemistry department) are great and very helpful.
Sophomore,4,Professors adapted very well to Covid-19 circumstances and were very flexible with students as well. It was a minor change in grading and assignments class attendance is all that was lacking.
Freshman,4,There is something for everyone. Not for the faint of heart. School spirit is electric. Facilities are beautiful. Talent abounds.
Senior,4,"I think it is a good college. They are very friendly and willing to work with their students. They have a large, beautiful campus located in the center of town around many businesses, which makes it very convenient. I am not a sociable person and am taking all my classes online, so I am not really into the party scene or fraternities/sororities. Their online module is very workable and user-friendly once you get the hang of how to use it. All in all, a very good experience."
Freshman,4,I like how West Virginia University is so diverse and they care about all of their students and try to do everything to help everyone. One thing I would change is the parking around campus because there is not enough for all of the students who attend WVU.
Niche User,4,Visiting the campus and communicating with the school have both been very good experiences. They helped me learn more about the classes that I would be in and the living conditions that the students get. They have also been very good at emailing scholarship opportunities and updates about the school frequently.
Junior,4,"It is such a welcoming environment, beautiful campus, and overall very helpful professors. Downside is the winter, very cold and snows a lot."
Niche User,4,West Virginia University is a great environment. They create an atmosphere that makes you feel as if you're in one big family despite the large student body. Professors range from being incredibly helpful to extremely unsupportive.
Sophomore,4,"West Virginia University has a lot of internship, club, and study abroad opportunities! There are so many outside the classroom learning experiences, and there's really something for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"I love wvu because how diverse it is here. The people i have met here are all great and super nice, both on campus and the towns people who just live in Morgantown. i also love that there is always something to do here to keep myself and my friends entertained. the school aspect is great. i think i’m being challenged in my class. of course you’re gonna have some easy classes here and there, but for the most part i am being challenged everyday."
Niche User,4,"so far the application process has been easy, with minor hiccups along the way. I love the beautiful architecture. professors are all very kind and helpful, as well as the students."
Niche User,4,I love all the different activities that are at this university.  It is a great sports university.  The students are all very friendly and there is always something to do.
Junior,4,"I have had a good experience at WVU overall. I really enjoy the Interior Design program and am happy with my professors and workload. If I could change anything about WVU it would be the aesthetics of the campus and some of the campus resources. The campus itself is not as nice as some universities, but the classes make up for it. Some campus offices are understaffed and do not have as much knowledge on their topic as they should have. Overall, I am happy with my choice to attend West Virginia University."
Sophomore,4,WVU is truly a great school. The wide variety of areas of study means there is something for everyone and there are also hundreds of clubs and organizations. The campus does what it can to keep students safe and happy. Something I would like to see change at WVU would be more outreach to students to get them involved in campus activities because it would create a greater community.
Freshman,4,"WVU is an amazing school from the campus and the teachers, to the overall atmosphere of the city. Everyone is friendly and willing to lend a helping hand in anyone in need. The city is filled with lots of things to do when not studying, from hiking, biking and shopping from time to time."
Niche User,4,The large campus offers a wide range of choices and opportunities. The education is amazing. My only complaint is that the PRT. The use of transportation by PRT is not reliable.
Freshman,4,"My professor's at WVU seem to actually care about my success, even in massive lectures with tons of students which is nice, the game day experience during football season is incredible, there are always things to do outside of school from sports, intramurals, clubs, etc. It's been a good experience so far."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience at WVU has been pleasant, and without much challenges from the University itself. It is largely in part due to my experience with the College of Creative Arts, along with WVU’s ease of finding assistance through its websites and departments."
Freshman,4,West Virginia University provides an unreal amount of opportunities. It’s a school where you get out what you put in and I believe that provides tons of benefits for every single student. The number of resources you can go to for guidance is significant and its important to acknowledge that resource. As long as you manage your priorities and put what’s the most important first you’ll do great things at WVU.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at WVU. I love the school pride and the campus. It is a bit annoying how the campus is split up but you get used to it quick and it's nice because there isn't a lot of walking involved. The dorms are decent, but i'd recommend avoiding towers, dadisman, and boreman. They are super old. WVU does a great job at making you feel welcome. Welcome week was the highlight of the year and to any incoming freshman, i'd highly recommend participating in Adventure WV."
Senior,4,Very straightforward school where help is always easy to get for those who look for it in any way shape or form.
Senior,4,"They offer a lot of support to help get through your time in school, whether that be tutoring or mental health services."
Niche User,4,The people I met at WVU when I toured made me feel very welcome. I really liked getting to know the campus and the people there.
Sophomore,4,"I love WVU. There is a good amount of options of food. I love even when I hate walking up hills, the mountains of campus. It's helpful that there are multiple campuses so you can be at your specific campus. The one downside is transportation isn't that great and reliable, though that's relative."
Freshman,4,"They offer a great number of clubs, programs, majors and minors. Everyone can find their place here. The campus is beautiful and large, with a PRT system to connect the two campuses while transporting its students between them."
Junior,4,"West Virginia University is easily one of the best engineering colleges around. Classes are in depth and thought provoking. Around campus everyone is nice, and professors all want to see you succeed."
Sophomore,4,It’s a nice school. Tuition isn’t heavy compared to most colleges. Classes might be enjoyable depending on the professors
Freshman,4,"WVU is a very social, outgoing, diverse school. I love seeing the many different types of people around campus. I think the education is fine, freshman year is a little slow, but it'll get better as you progress through the years and work alongside people who share your major."
Freshman,4,I was scared to first go there but I loved it. It's such a nice campus and a friendly environment. Nice parties and football games. Make sure to visit campus and learn more about wvu because its a really nice school
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the classes that I have taken and how much the professors want to see students succeed. There are lots of clubs and events for students to get involved in. If I could change one thing, it would be the dining hall foods."
Niche User,4,"I like the environment of the community, and everyone there is very helpful. On college tour days, the facilitators answer all questions and will help you in anyway possible. The transportation is sometimes not reliable, but everyone runs into that problem every once in a while. Game days are very crowded and very very busy."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers and staff are amazing, overall they do a good job at making you feel at home. There's also a never dull moment in classes. However the food in the surrounding area is terrible and it's overcrowded."
Freshman,4,"The campus is really pretty and everyone is really friendly. The professors I've had have been pretty good for the most part PRT, which is a great idea and makes getting to class easier, is not always reliable. The bus system is great though and students get to ride it for free with their ID. The dorms I've seen have been nice, but the bathroom cleanliness could be improved. Although most of it is do to students and not necessarily the cleaning staff. Overall my experience has been great!"
Freshman,4,"I am in my first semester of my freshman year at West Virginia University. I like that the university is community-oriented, in which clubs and organizations are used to create connections with students. Even though the school has a few people from different backgrounds, I wish it was more diverse so I could embrace more cultures. I have been given a lot of opportunities and experiences within my short amount of time here and appreciate the new world I have been exposed to. West Virginia is a great school to be apart of!"
Sophomore,4,"WVU overall is a nice school with some pretty great professors. What I would like to be changed at the University would be the parking problem. There is not enough parking for commuters let alone faculty, staff, and the students that do drive."
Junior,4,I feel that my school would benefit from more diversity and I have noticed that the administration tends to maintain their diversity score by simply seeking minorities that are more financially secure. I feel that it is technical diversity. The academics and the advisors in my engineering department are wonderful and very helpful when I have questions.
Sophomore,4,"WVU has the most prideful students you'll ever meet.  Even though the campus holds such a high party reputation, this college is what you make it.  There are opportunities for everyone in terms of both academics and social experiences.  There are countless clubs to join making it easy to meet new people within your interests.   Some downsides to this campus would be the food and the transportation.  Do to there being two campuses it can be difficult to get from one to the next, since the PRT seems to break down on a regularly basis.  Even with these flaws it does not take away from the amazing experiences this campus has to offer."
Senior,4,"The school community is wonderful and there is a lot to experience, both academically and extracurricularly. The transportation between campuses could be better, but isn’t terrible. The classes are large, but once you become an upperclassman you get to know your teachers better if you want to do so."
Sophomore,4,"I like that it feels like a big family at times but, at times it can seem like the staff just cares about the money and not teaching or helping the students."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed WVU so far! Both the academic and social atmospheres are great. The Student Health Center is very helpful and majority of the professors encourage feedback.
Niche User,4,"The spirit of the school, almost all of the students when I visited were dressed in gold and blue and telling me how great it is to be a mountaineer, I couldn't really find any flaws other than that some classrooms were a little small but nothing too major."
Sophomore,4,Excellent facilities and opportunities available to students who attenend the university. Professors are competent and care about the learning of their students. All professors have office hours and make themselves readily avialable for discussion when students are in need of help during a course. The professors during online courses aren't as available as many times the student isn't on campus to recieve direct help from the professor. The area around the university is beautiful with a large array of outdoor and indoor activities to appease anyone's appitite for adventure.
Junior,4,"I am an Animal Sciences major and have had a wonderful experience at WVU. The courses are very interesting and professors are helpful. The campus is clean and many resources are offered to students. The chemistry courses along with a couple others are very difficult, in other words, it is difficult to get an A. Resources are offered but I wish there were more ways to show you know material besides standardized testing. Overall, I have had a very pleasant experience at WVU."
Freshman,4,"West Virginia University is what many would consider the pride of West Virginia.  While most seem to attend the school for partying purposes, many flock to the university for the most superior research and education environment that the state has to offer for post-secondary education."
Junior,4,West Virginia University is a beautiful campus with students and community members who show true school pride and spirit.
Freshman,4,I feel at home when I'm at WVU. I love the people and I absolutely adore my college. The professors do a great job and there is always someone there to help you when you're in need. I have made many friends since I've been here and they've been a huge help in keeping me motivated.
Senior,4,"Overall, West Virginia University was a good school. However, I wish that at times it would focus more on improving academics and housing instead of trying to get the football team new uniforms and nicer equipment."
Sophomore,4,"I love WVU because it was one of the few colleges that had my major, recreation, parks, and tourism. They also have a very wide range of majors which is very helpful. WVU is just an overall friendly environment in which I feel at home at."
Junior,4,"I love attending this university. My major has amazing academics and professors. I feel like I have ample resources if I’m struggling in a class. There are many activities for students to engage as opposed to the party scene. My only issue is that the university sometimes hires “teachers” (GA’s) who don’t sctually like to teach or have any teaching experience, and learning from these classes can be very difficult"
Sophomore,2,it was fine at first. if you don't like to party or drink dont even bother. I was battling a mental and physical illness and when I went to student health they accused me of being on speed... which was not the case I was developing a mental health issue
Freshman,2,"When we converted to online school for the COVID-19 quarantine, most of the professors were not at all ready for it, resulting in harder class work and exams."
Senior,2,"It is hard to have your own opinions because the campus is so liberal. If you disagree with your professors, they may publicly embarrass you. It has happened to me in the past, and the professor let another student call me some offensive names in front of the whole class."
Senior,2,Advisors are horrible. Every single person I've met has a horror story about advising. Most of the dorms don't have A/C or are on the other side of campus. There isn't much going on as far as local area besides college life.
Sophomore,2,"My experience at WVU has been how I would expect any other university, student life is very involved and diverse. All the professors are very helpful and very informative in the classes they are teaching. Parking itself has to be the biggest issue, but the university is aware of that and has different systems of getting around for instance buses, and what we call the PRT which is essentially a little motorized cart that is electronically controlled, it breaks down often enough to where kids are late for class or it breaks own when they are on the PRT. Which is dangerous, though it works and alternates between the downtown campus and the northern campus and is the most convenient way to travel for class, and sporting events."
Freshman,2,"very expensive school, all your tuition money is spent on athletes of the school as they are showered with unlimited freebies while those students who are struggling to pay are left to fail."
College Junior,2,I do not feel safe walking around campus after dark. Sometimes I feel safe during the day as long as many people are out.
College Sophomore,2,"Much like the atmosphere of the student life in WVU, Greek life has two extremes here. Only the educational fraternities and sororities are to be trusted, all others have gotten into trouble with WVU at some point for illegal or toxic behavior and have been shut down temporarily."
College Junior,2,"So at WVU the Greeks tend to throw massive parties. The problem is we have had a huge hazing problem. A fellow mountaineer passed away last year due to hazing. Also, the Greeks' parties tend to get out of control and they can disrespect authority. Join if you want to party but if you don't then I wouldn't."
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't much to be completely honest.
College Freshman,2,"Our Greek life can be very intense to some people, my room mate ended up doing cocaine and dropping out of college for a semester after joining one of the most notorious frats on campus"
College Freshman,2,The frats tend to cause a lot of trouble
College Freshman,2,"Dead end school,  nobody cares about students actually learning, all curriculum is surrounded with bureaucracy"
College Sophomore,2,If you plan on having fun in College 9/10 youll get written up by an RA on your floor
College Junior,2,They didnt have any options I could pick from. It took a long time for them to process my information and by the time they did( as a transfer student) I couldn't apply for any scholarships I would have qualified for.
College Freshman,2,Don't live off-campus if you don't have to
College Junior,2,"there are few available WVU scholarships. They don't stack with each other, either."
College Freshman,2,Most housing is far away or very limited. The cost is also ridiculous plus there's always a parking fee.
College Freshman,2,"If you want to pledge, go to a different school. Everyone hates Greeks here. Especially because of recent events on campus"
College Freshman,2,Some bad things have happened with the Greek life. I have no part of it nor want to.
College Freshman,2,My financial aid process was kind of a headache.
College Freshman,2,"My landlord isn't the best but from what I've heard I have the worst one. Everyone else that I talk to has had no problems with things getting fixed or the overall quality of the apartment. My landlord does not fix things right away, and she is hard to get a hold of."
College Sophomore,2,The party life at the university is a very bad influence on the students here. It is a well-known party school that has topped many of the nation's biggest party schools. I am not one to party and I usually avoid the parties. The party scene can sometimes create problems for the rest of the students.
College Freshman,2,"Two words. University Place. The biggest joke, lie, disappointment, let down of 2014. Claims to be finished by Fall 2014. Barely had any bricks laid. Signed way too many leases and left tons of students homeless. Moves those students in way too early when the building is STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. I don't see that shit ever being finished."
College Freshman,2,Never go to frat row after the first weekend if you're a guy. You wont get in. Simple as that. Frat parties suck anyway. Way too many people and not enough beer. Especially if you're dumb enough to pay five dollars to get in. My advice is don't go to frat parties don't go to random parties. Go to parties where you know a lot of people there and then your'e guaranteed to have a fun night with people you enjoy being around.
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of the food. I go to the lair almost every day to get chick fil a to eat good tasting food
College Freshman,2,"The dining is not impressive. There are some good dining hall and there are options, but I don't feel like I am getting the quality I am paying for."
Recent Alumnus,2,The administration could do way more to enforce the rules.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is a lack of enforcement of the rules around here.
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes if felt as though people were getting yelled at for no reason instead of for safety and the protection of the community.
College Junior,2,My first apartment had awful landlords.
College Junior,2,"If you live in a dorm, your RA runs your life. However, outside of the dorm the only things you have to worry about are the police and parking authority. Mostly parking authority."
College Sophomore,2,"I didn't use my plan very much. Mostly for breakfast. The university has a lot of places to use it but I felt there was not a lot of healthy options. Also the Boreman Bistro that was the closes service to me closed at 6.00. With my classes, I needed to eat later."
College Junior,2,"The parking here gets pretty jammed packed and finding a spot on prime times of the day is like feeding time at the zoo. Also if you're parking in decal parking everyday, it starts to add up."
College Junior,2,It is difficult to go through a smooth financial aid process as well as scholarships at this school. The administration and staff in those areas are not very helpful either.
College Sophomore,2,It's a popularity contest and a way to flex how much money your family has. The students involved are very offensive especially during move in weekend where they harass and even drug freshmen.
College Student,2,I believe that it is difficult to travel back and forth from home to the campus.  Because you have to go thru Pittsburgh all the time and most of the time the schedule does not work .
College Sophomore,2,Students do not hide it.
College Sophomore,2,I am not a partier.
College Junior,2,WVU was rated the biggest party school in the US a few years ago.  Alcohol seems to be the biggest issue on-campus.
College Freshman,2,greek life from my view offered nothing
College Freshman,2,I remember when I first moved here I asked a girl who was a senior what students did for fun on the weekend and everything she listed involved drinking. WVU is famous for its reputation as the number one party school in the nation and as far as I can tell they work hard to keep that reputation. This is not the university for you if you do not drink alcohol because the social activities available to you will be severely limited.
College Freshman,2,"The downtown campus has the security poles that are common on college campuses where you can call someone to help you, but the Evansdale campus does not have these. I am in a sorority and I noticed at a meeting recently that almost every girl in the room had mace on her key chain. I would not feel comfortable walking alone at night in certain areas of the city. Also, theft is a concern for me. I always lock my car when I go anywhere and I make sure to hide my valuables. Right now, I am in a dorm and I never go anywhere without locking the door as theft is everywhere."
College Freshman,2,"WVU has two main modes of transportation and they are buses and the Personal Rapid Transit, or PRT. The administration will promise freshmen and parents during orientation that the buses run between the two campuses every ten minutes but this is definitely not the case, especially in the winter. Speaking of which, the PRT is incredibly unreliable in the winter. If it's below thirty degrees which it often is Morgantown, I will not get on the PRT for fear of it breaking down. As a rule of thumb, I give myself 30 minutes to get to class via the buses. Sometimes I give myself longer if I know they will be running slower."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of diversity mainly kids raised white christians from surrounding areas however very few people actually have strong religious beliefs.
College Junior,2,"The weather is all over the place. Prepare for rain, snow, wind, sunshine and humidity all in the same week. Completely unpredictable, even when you check the weather that morning. I keep an umbrella and a pair of sunglasses in my purse at all times."
College Sophomore,2,Parking situations are terrible in Morgantown. The parking is horrible there is never anywhere to park here and they will ticket you constantly. Most of the jobs in morgantown you have to drive to so if you need to work you will need a car.
College Freshman,2,Greek students are bratty and cliquey.
College Freshman,2,You are the only one not drinking at a party.
College Student,2,the police only stand in one location
College Freshman,2,we need more parking options; preferably free. 
College Freshman,2,too much sodium; we need healthier options 
College Freshman,2,they party too much and are annoying 
College Freshman,2,I received very little financial aid which did not help me very much.
College Freshman,2,They need more financial aid for after your accepted
College Sophomore,2,hard to find and expensive
College Sophomore,2,i think the school does not really acknowledge the issue
College Sophomore,2,the Greeks think they run the place just because they throw frequent parties and have tons of fake friends.
College Sophomore,2,"When we get snow, classes aren't canceled. So walking a mile or two in snow is very unpleasant.  "
College Student,2,"Parking permits are way too expensive at WVU. They offer free parking at the coliseum, but those spots fill up fast. The school also feels like they have to shut down the coliseum parking on game days, making it much much harder to find a parking spot. For on campus students, that doesn't matter. Commuters however have to have a parking spot or they aren't able to go to class."
Alum,1,"The professors and advisors are subpar! Also, do they even know how to operate online learning systems? Go elsewhere! They made me come in and sit in a class with a bunch of kids when I went back just to finish a few credits after already holding a degree. This costed me extra time, money, and hassle not to mention daycare cost. Stay away from WVU! Not worth it!"
Alum,1,"Absolutely NO! This university has terrible advising which leads to extra unnecessary time, money, and headache. They favored out-of-state students and no plan for graduation once not accepted into the program that I paid for! They will shuffle you around like a number. I paid too much, spend extra YEARS there, and haven't had a job for 5 years due to the lack of giving me what I paid for and worked for. Might I mention that my GPA was good and never failed a course! This university is not worth it! Please go somewhere else!"
Freshman,1,Projects an image of diversity when the amount of LGBTQ+ or minorities present is scarce. Rape culture here is also very big and overall have not felt safe once since I moved in. They make it incredibly hard to graduate within four years as a way to get more money. One could get the same degree at community college faster and cheaper.
Senior,1,"Absolutely terrible! Do not go there! I literally begged them to let me leave after thousands of dollars and years down the drain for no reason. You will regret every second of it! WVU is trash! If you like paying for free youtube videos, outdated information, and terrible advising... this is your place. I received a better education from a junior college. Don't waste your time! Is there a 0 star rating option? I had less than 20 credits left to graduate and they refused to let me finish in the major and transferred it to another major doubling the amount of credits. You'll be there until your 40!"
Niche User,1,"Save your money.  WVU students are a revenue generator for the town of Morgantown and the University supports this.  They provide plenty of opportunity for the students to party and act inappropriate all in an effort to issue citations that keep this town afloat.  If you're thinking of sending a daughter to WVU you should look on the internet (not too hard to find) how many sexual assaults occur.  Unfortunately, I have first hand experience with my daughter being drugged on campus.  And, not once since it's happened has the University taken time to help her deal with what happened.   This place is an absolute disgrace.  President Gee is all fun, but never truly addresses the serious issues that exist on the campus.  WVU needs a true leader, not just someone that is likable."
Niche User,1,"Gross and old looking campus, town is nasty and has no to do beside drink. Stay far away from Morgantown."
Senior,1,"WVU is a good school that has excellent professors and many different ways to get involved including greek life, honor societies, clubs, and other student orgs. However, the tuition continues to raise every year making it difficult for low income students to continue their education. Also, if you are not into the partying and drinking scene it can get frustrating and annoying to deal with majority of WVU students who are practically obsessed with going out. In addition, despite the efforts of the NAACP chapter here, Muslim student associations, and the LGBTQ center this is not an inclusive campus and can be dangerous for minorities and women in general. WVU had one of the worst cases of rape culture I have ever seen."
Freshman,1,The school isn't worth it. All there is is drinking and partying everyone I know is either transferring or failing all their classes and will probably end u Pedro point out. The campus is spread out and it's hard to get to classes and you feel very unsafe on campus at night unless you want to kill your liver don't choose wvu
College Junior,1,"I was involved in a sorority at the first college I went to and LOVED it. Everyone was so nice, kind, caring, and did so much work for the community. I transferred here and was so appalled by the greek life scene I decided not to join my sorority here."
College Freshman,1,The Greek life here has a bad reputation and I do not see it changing anytime soon.
College Sophomore,1,"Constant parties, alcohol is readily available almost everywhere. It will ruin your life if you get caught up in it."
College Sophomore,1,The frats guys are very rude and can be pushy and do not take rejections well and the girls in sororities can be bitchy
College Freshman,1,People die on a regular basis
College Freshman,1,The administration is terrible. The consistently do dumb things to make everything inconvenient for as many people as possible.
College Freshman,1,DO NOT MESS UP ON YOUR FAFSA AT ALL. My parents weren't legally divorced yet when I had to fill out my fafsa I didn't get any money at all. Now my parents are legally separated and WVU Financial Aid said that my new fafsa didn't make a difference to get me any money. REALLY? Cutting my family income in half doesn't affect my availability to get financial aid? Seriously? It's absolutely ridiculous how I am paying full out of state costs when I have only a single mother barely making 6 figures with two kids in college. I am furious if you cant tell.
College Student,1,The president ordered all greek life to cease because of recent death of a initiate.
College Junior,1,Off campus housing is the worse.  High rent and crappy places.  Parking is next to none and you have to climb hills to get anywhere.
College Sophomore,1,"I live only 20 miles outside of West Virginia in Pennsylvania. It kills me that I can not get any in state tuition or at least a small stipend. It also drives me crazy that most students get the promise scholarship and academic out of state student who work hard and have a 3.9-4.0, do not get extra opportunities for scholarships from the university. My parents are middle class and get no breaks at all. The only financial aid I get is from federal loans. My parents have to pay the rest!"
College Freshman,1,"West Virginia is really nice in the spring, summer, and fall but the winter there is absolutely horrible. This might be a manageable issue if the winter did not go from November to the end of March. That is almost half the year that you have to deal with the endless amount of cold, overcast days. The actual cold would be okay if it were not for the overcast days. Blue skies are rare after November. Seasonal depressive disorder is real and alive in West Virginia."
College Freshman,1,Dont bring a car up here unless living off campus!
College Sophomore,1,I didnt qualify for financial aid so school is very pricey.
College Sophomore,1,I hate campus food/cafe choices. Dining hall locations were very inconvenient and the food tasted old and nasty. 
College Sophomore,1,"Sometimes it is necessary to drive somewhere but with the outrageous hourly rates and the lack of spots, sometimes it is nearly impossible.  "
College Sophomore,1,"The police here are very unfair and uncooperative. I know of many friends who were either unjustly pepper sprayed, cited, or roughed up by the police just by being out on a big party night, even if they were completely compliant and sober. "
College Freshman,1,Offer more financial aid opportunities!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Sophomore,1,Transportation is a big headache due to the PRT 
College Sophomore,1,The weather is extremely ambivalent 
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is very difficult.  The school discourages bringing cars and parking on campus and parking is strictly enforced to the point of towing.
College Junior,1,"Parking at West Virginia University (WVU) is terrible, especially on football game days. Towing companies are always lurking, waiting to tow your car without warning.  The best way to get around WVU public transportation."
College Junior,1,"The PRT breaks down at least 10 times a day, the buses get stuck in rush hour traffic and are not reliable. Parking is a nightmare."
College Junior,1,"The off campus housing is either run down and run by slum lords, or outrageously expensive. If you are looking for a 1 bedroom apartment that is just livable you better be willing to pay upwards of $900 a month plus utilities."
College Sophomore,1,"WVU offers buses and the PRT as transportation options. They both get crowded very easily and aren't very reliable. The PRT breaks down almost every day and the buses aren't always on time and get caught in traffic. However, it is almost pointless to bring a car to school because parking costs a lot and traffic is always awful. Your best bet is the bus, but only if traffic isn't bad."
College Freshman,1,Ticketing is expensive ! And their is hardly any parking anywhere.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at this school is awful! The permit costs are outrageous.  I lived in a building that had 250 parking spots in front of the building and the cost for me to park my car there was over 400 dollars for the year.  Most of the parking areas on the Evansdale Campus come with the regulation that your car has to be moved by 5PM on Fridays until 6AM on Sundays for football games.  The cost is not any less because of this inconvenience and it is impossible to find somewhere else to park your car during this time without getting a parking ticket or your car towed.  There isn't a huge need for a car on campus but it is definitely convenient to get to a lot of the chain restaurants, grocery stores, and big shopping centers."
College Sophomore,1,"Dependin on who you talk to in financial aid depends on how much help you are going to ge unfortunately. Most are not very friendly and they do not help students as much as they can. A tip for getting financial aid at WVU and getting it done, is get it done early and make sure you know exactly what you need and what your'e talking about!"
College Freshman,1,Parking in Morgantown is absolutely awful - if you drive expect to take up 30 mins just looking for a spot. Having a car is practically pointless with the way traffic is and the usefulness of the public transportation.
College Sophomore,1,"The weather constantly fluctuates unpredictably. One day it could be very icy and freezing, then the next day the weather is nice and sunny, and then the following day can be cold, windy, and rainy."
College Junior,1,"Parking is available for a price.  Considering the cost of tuition, parking should be included for those who do not have access to shuttle service or public transportation in the city."
College Freshman,1,"The weather fluctuates quite a bit. One day it may be 75 degrees, and the next it may be snowing and below 30."
College Freshman,1,"If your parents have money, you get nothing. Universities don't understand that just because our parents have money; it doesn't mean the students do. In the mean time, you can go to school completely free on financial aid and have a 1.6 GPA and you get to slack your way to a degree."
College Student,1,"The diversity at WVU is very scarce. Most people are white, but there are also alot of Italians  from New Jersey. Because of the state that it's in there is a very low percent of ethnic diversity"
College Freshman,1,it is so hard to park here.. if you are trying to have guests... forget it.. there is hardly any guest parking
College Senior,1,"Non-Greeks more or less loathe the Greek system. They are unabashedly party mongers who feign interest in campus/political issues to build their resumes through SGA and host popularity contests through activities like Homecoming Court. Those who are a part of Greek life will give you every stereotypical response about why it's so great and important, but truly, to most students they are a joke."
College Sophomore,1,"Permit costs are high; around 300 dollars a semester. I get a ticket from the university at least every two weeks because I'm either too lazy to pay to park in the Mountainlair or I'm too broke; and a ticket from the Morgantown police at least every two months, just for some stupid reason. You can really walk to anything on campus but it's nice to have a car. The PRT is hardly ever reliable and it's nice to have a car when you want to go out to eat or to the mall. Parking is just a hassle."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Strict – WVU is not a strict school especially in the part area. That may be because we are known as a party school but if campus police or whatnot see you drinking and you're underage they simple have you pour out the alcohol and let you go about your way. When it comes to games and tailgating no one every gets in trouble unless they cause trouble. Some way you could get away with murder at WVU and I could believe it. WVU is such a free and open school anyone can voice an opinion and not be told to hush up. The campus is not very strict and while that is a sort of good thing since college students are adult, it can be a bad especially when drinking is involved. The main reason students came under fire for the ""I'm Schmacked"" video was because it made news and brought out the true dis respectfulness the students deliver when they are drunk. I mean, the city bus a nights is known as the Drunk Bus because it's full of drunk people from high street going back to towers or whatnot. People do get underages but it's from the city police, not the campus police."
College Sophomore,1,"When talking with financial aid I have never gotten good service. I'm always on hold, the people are always rude, you have to be transferred 101 times; it's just a hassle. I was told I owed $200. I paid that then I apparently owed another $300 that they ""miscalculated"". Stuff like that happens all the time. You eventually get your question or problem solved but be prepared to put a good half hour to hour of phone time or office time into it."
College Junior,1,PRT Sucks but So Does Finding a Parking Spot – WVU waves the PRT around like it's some amazing invention that simplifies getting to class.  I can guarantee you will be screwed over by the PRT.  It is hardly reliable but good luck finding a parking space.  If you do find a parking space you will probably end up with a parking ticket.
College Freshman,1,parking is pretty stupid when it comes to needing a car at wvu. everyone either walks or rides the bus and/or PRT to get to class or to go out. parking is all on hills at wvu so its difficult to park and theres not very many spaces. just dont bring your car to wvu and you'll be good to go.
College Freshman,1,"No Space – There is a lot of parking available at my school, but majority of it you have to pay for.  Unless you luck out and find a spot on the street, then you can end up spending around $50 a month on a parking place."
Recent Alumnus,1,i didnt get the feel that anyone cared here. Financial aid wont give you s***. you basically just feel like a number. but the professors are cool. very enthused
College Senior,1,"Bus, PRT & Walking – The Buses are always overcrowded, the PRT breaks down if a raindrop falls and in the cold weather walking up and down hills is extremely hard if there is ice. IF you decide to drive you have to pay out the nose for parking and the parking is never close to class."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Security – Instead of having cops at Eat'n'park, there should be more cops downtown where it's actually dangerous. I have never felt safe at WVU at night."
College Freshman,1,Confusing at First – When applying for financial aid at my school I was very confused and did not know how to do any of it. It almost seemed like they thought you should know already and would just send out emails saying this and that needs done. My freshman year it took awhile to get everything in placebut i finally got it and not i have been doing good so far.
College Freshman,1,"Social Atmosphere – There is a lot of noise at night, therefore it can be hard to sleep"
College Freshman,1,"Not Worth It – If you commute then you should bring a car the cost isn't too bad but it is a pain to find parking when you go to a school that has over 29,000 people. If you live in a dorm or in one of the off-campus apartments that have shuttles that bring you to the campus then don't bother with a car. You'll save money and time looking for a parking space."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is difficult. There are not enough spaces in the parking garage and the price is $1/hour. Parking is hard to find in other locations as well. There seems to be way more students with vehicles than parking spots.
College Freshman,1,on-campus Food sucks! pay too much... disgusting..towers options terrible!...all fake..nasty..get ready to puke if eating at towers!
College Freshman,1,"The guys at WVU are conceited and arrogant. The girls are insecure and not modest about their appearance. On average, their looks would rate at about a D, since they are not exactly pleasing to the eye. Their attitudes are poor and not academically focused, and they all dress like bums."
College Senior,1,"People here fight for parking spots! If you're thinking about parking on campus to get to class, forget it. You'll end up spending half hour just trying to find a spot."
College Freshman,1,it is available but there is ticket maids who patrol all day.  My friend currently owes $400 in parking tickets in one semester.

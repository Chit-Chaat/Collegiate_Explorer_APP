Alum,5,"The best school for your money. The community is a close family. I still have the same best friends from UOP today and I graduated in ‘98. 
 UOP teaches you life skills you will use in life everyday, no matter what your major. 
It’s also a great school to move on to any graduate school. Every graduate school knows UOP puts out quality. But my favorite part is the professors, they will sit with you and help you figure out what you need in order to grow academically. It might have a higher acceptance rate, but it’s because they don’t play the statistics game larger universities thrive on. They just want quality students that want to learn and earn a quality education."
Alum,5,"My daughter attends UOP during the pandemic and her professors record lectures, are very understanding and have office hours to help outside class. They are utilizing breakout rooms for group projects, and I feel UOP is doing a brilliant job to create the closest to normal possible for their students. I am amazed with how well they assimilated to the situation the world is facing."
Sophomore,5,University of the Pacific has been known for its school of pharmacy. The view is always lovely and the campus is small ans convinent.
Sophomore,5,"UOP is a very small, welcoming school. You will see the same people throughout your time there and begin to feel a sense of belonging.  This is a unique benefit when combined with the excellent professors. They are always willing to help and do their best to make every class feel important and worthwhile. You get the best of both worlds at UOP."
Alum,5,"A close-knit environment that allowed for constant collaboration between peers, professors, and faculty advisors. I am proud to call the University of the Pacific my home. I have developed more academically in the past two years at Pacific than my junior college and high school years combined. Pacific strives for excellence in all of its students and recognizes their abilities individually. While maintaining a positive experience on campus, the University of the Pacific additionally focuses time and energy into giving back to the Stockton Community. Plenty of volunteer opportunities provided alongside rich experiences that shape the way we view the world around us. Once a tiger, always a tiger."
Alum,5,"The school is small and professors are aware of who you are on a personal level, it's not just advertising. Once when I had a bad day a professor even said I could miss class and get the material later. I am still close with some professors and am attentive to goings on at the school."
Freshman,5,There is a lot to do on campus. Everyone is so involved and helpful. Students are very kind and friendly. It's easy to feel like yourself around campus.
Freshman,5,My experience so far has been pretty good. There are lots of events to go to through the year put on my the ASUOP. There are also a lot of fun clubs to join. The campus is also extremely beautiful so it's nice to take a walk around. A lot of people also like to come on campus and walk their dogs so whenever I'm going to class I get to see some cute dogs. There are also a lot of volunteer opportunities available. There are a lot of opportunities for tutoring and help in the library.
Niche User,5,"University of the Pacific, located in the Stockton, California, is an amazing, fantastic, beautiful, school with great education for all people. I recommend people checking it out as an option to further continue one's studies."
Freshman,5,The University of the Pacific offers students a delightful educational experience with beautiful views with every corner you turn. A majority of the building on campus have brick exteriors which gives the school and ivy league feel.
Sophomore,5,"University of the Pacific is the best! I really fell like I've learned things here that I could never learn elsewhere. All the teachers are so patient and kind. And I always feel included. It really is like one big community. If I had to choose any school in the world, I would definitely pick University of the Pacific over anything else."
Niche User,5,"I plan to attend UOP starting in the fall of 2020 as a freshman. Back in November I went on a recruiting trip for swimming, and on the trip they showed us a tour of the campus, we shadowed a students' classes, met with athletic administrators, and much more. What I liked specifically was how small the school was, this allowed many benefits to the students : closer connections with the professors, more academic resources (tutoring and job connections), and a student community among the campus. Additionally because the school is private, it has more money to aid in financial needs."
Niche User,5,"Although I am only a senior in highschool I believe the University of the Pacific is the school for me. After a bit of research and a campus visit I have learned that this school is truly a well rounded place. Although one thing I would change is the layout of the campus, considering the fact that the Pre-Pharm classes are far from the dorms."
Sophomore,5,"Engineering department is great. Very friendly people. Great instruction. Work load is well balanced. Professors know how to lecture effectively. Besides academics, the amount of extracurricular activities is surprisingly high. Campus is clean. Plenty of parking. The only problem is the lack of variety in the food. Would still recommend to everyone."
Junior,5,The University of the Pacific provides the necessary resources and programs for undergraduate students to effectively explore their passion regarding academics. The small class size gives students the opportunity to create a good rapport with fellow classmates and professors. This opens new doors for students to comfortably be an inquirer and discover what tools best fit for the student to learn efficiently. I was able to further deepen my passion for my health sciences domain through participating in research opportunities. I am eternally grateful to be a part of the research team and this aspect is absolutely a unique character of UOP's Health and Exercise Science that students do not take for granted.
Junior,5,Going to start my first year at the University of the Pacific going to be an extremely unique experience.
Junior,5,"An amazing school,
 and teachers that help you focus on your studies and career goals. They are a private school that focus in their students achieving great scores on their exams and classes to have a successful career in the future. 
the campus is very lively and full of students with dreams they want to achieve just like you. The atmosphere is good and nice, everybody there is kind and resourceful. The have someone assigned for each student to help them do great and help if they are ever in distress about classes or grades."
Junior,5,"Pacific is such an awesome place to be. All of the staff are super helpful and almost all of my professors have been amazing during my first year. Admissions has been particularly wonderful in helping me transfer in from a community college. They made sure I had everything in order so I could transfer and start my new plan of study. Wherever I go on campus, I feel like my needs are heard and I receive as much help as staff and faculty can give. I especially appreciate the counseling center; it has been the biggest help in my entire college experience. I know the school is expensive, but it is definitely worth it considering all of the resources and friendly staff on campus."
Senior,5,I enjoy attending the University of the Pacific because it is such a small school where everyone knows each other. It has such a beautiful campus that makes walking to school so pleasurable. I enjoy the professors as well where they actually make an effort to learn all of their students names and do everything they can for them to succeed.
Alum,5,Great school to go to for higher education. I think the city itself can be unsafe but the campus is beautiful and relatively safe.
Niche User,5,Everyone at the University of the Pacific are so kind and helpful. The campus is so amazing with awesome feature like this one area where you stand in the center and you can hear the echo of your voice. The school takes safety  very seriously and have many security poles that have officers who are very speed to help you with whatever is happening. They also have this really cool dorm area that is designed for student who are wanting no distractions it is called the honor dorms.  I learned all of this from a single tour around the campus.
Junior,5,"University of the Pacific offers a great range of programs. I am currently in the Speech Language Pathology program which is amazing! The classes are not impacted and you have a great student teacher relationship. They genuinely care about how you do academically and offer around the clock help. The teachers really prepare you for your career, they introduce us to actual things we will be using in our field. An overall rate for the school and my program is exceeding expectations."
Niche User,5,University of the Pacific has a beautiful and diverse environment. As a high schooler my visit the UOP was a great experience. Their music programs is one of the best! Its been a honor being able to sit beside them and perform a great concert with them. I hope to be accepted and be a part of that community.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the atmosphere of the campus. It is well protected. It's campus security is well alert and you never have to worry about walking in the dark alone because they will accompany you. It is very easy to make friends. It offers many different clubs as well as programs to benefit the student and make their college experience worth while. Plus they have the best turkey burgers. They are to die for and they are affordable. They are super good and if you are to take anything away for this review is that their turkey burgers are the bomb.com. Wow that made me sound older than  I actually am.
Graduate Student,5,Love the small classes which creates a tight-nit group with the students and the professors. The food is great. The scenery and events are lively. I can always find something to do. (Free food at these events is a bonus.)
Alum,5,"UOP is a great school, with a beautiful campus, family-friendly atmosphere, and excellent educational programs. As a recent graduate, I felt safe, and valued as a student. Most of the faculty have doctoral degrees, and they truly care about providing an excellent education."
Niche User,5,"On my campus tour, it was amazing! I learned about all the extracurricular activities on campus ! My guide was great! I am looking to apply here !"
Sophomore,5,I love this school. Being a part of the Conservatory of Music on campus has made me more aware of many things going on in myself and in the school. I have found out more about me at this school than I even realized. I am so happy to be ready for college and very prepare to see what comes next in my life and see what the future holds.
Senior,5,Pacific is great because the professors and faculty genuinely care about their students. They see our success and their success and are always open to provide feedback and guidance.
Freshman,5,Upon visiting UOP I felt the environment was very pleasant and everyone made me feel welcome. The dorms were nice and spacey when I was taking a tour of the campus. I could truly envision myself spending my four years here!!
Freshman,5,"Well it is my first year and it is not what I expected. Honestly, I expected it to be like Hogwarts and I was slapped in the face with reality, which is my fault. The only thing they are missing is giving away amounts of money fairly, because they focus to much on athletics when they don't win a lot."
Niche User,5,The University of the Pacific was a great school and really opened my eyes to new considerations I should think about when applying to colleges. UOP is a great school I hope to be able to attend in the fall.
Freshman,5,"University of the Pacific is a university that takes care of their students. The students are not used for their money; the students instead are taught the necessary topics for their major, and utilize that knowledge in their careers."
Junior,5,"This was the first time I was away from home but this school has a good culture and welcoming environment that it made me have an easy transition. Due to the fact that the campus is located in Stockton, the school gets overlooked. Since being at Pacific I have had no problems, I always feel safe and you can turn any corner and see a security office or emergency phone. If I had to change anything I wish we could have more school spirit. I see other colleges with so much spirit and they make athletic games fun. I feel because we are a difficult school within our academics it tends to overshadow the athletics."
Niche User,5,"I was in a STEM program at the University of the Pacific. I was introduced to many different fields and I became interested in the field of engineering. The campus was amazing and beautiful, and is a great school for engineering and law. The location is not quite the best, but you get use to it and have fun with the diverse student groups. This private university is great with helping students in need of financial help with their tuition by offering programs for low-income students."
Freshman,5,"UOP isn't just a school it's a community. My time at UOP for jazz camp was amazing, the food was great, so were the music professors. The dorms were okay, I stayed in the dorms by the clock tower. As far as now I love my school and the one thing I would like to change is I would like to see more public art from the students who attend there as well as more music from students too"
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming environment, students, and staff. I was able to be a part of the tiger family very quickly. The campus was close to home which made commuting convenient."
Sophomore,5,They are very helpful to students with learning differences.  I feel like each professor cares about me.
Niche User,5,This school is so damn pretty i wish i could go her but damn those requirments. maybe someday :( i suggest anyone who can to make this there number one choice and attend this place.
Freshman,5,I really like it here at th University of  the Pacific because it has a comfortable environment.  The class size is not that big so I was able to adjust and adapt quickly to the people around me as well as the environment. The work load of the classes hasn't been overwhelming yet but this is only my first semester. 
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, personable and compassionate professors, high  quality education, delicious food, and intelligent, kind peers"
Niche User,5,I have never attended UOP but I plan to attempt to enroll in the future. I have only ever heard fantastic things about UOP and what a degree from the University can grant you access to. 
College Freshman,5,I love the diversity at UOP. I met a lot of new people here. I believe that academics is what people come here for though.
College Freshman,5,The campus security can escort you to wherever your going. There is many emergency buttons around campus. The campus is really safe.
College Freshman,5,I'm currently not in one because of the restriction but I hear great things about people and life in fraternities and sororities!
College Freshman,5,I am very satisfied with University of the Pacific and the opportunities that they give. The experiences you can have at this institution are worthwhile.
College Freshman,5,The university of the Pacific has a sister graduate dental school. therefore it's easy to access connections if you're planning on going pre-dent.
College Freshman,5,The police are often on patrol and there are special numbers located on the back of the student ID's in case of an emergency.
College Freshman,5,I enjoy the housing selection I was given and I am also happy with who was chosen as my roommate.
College Freshman,5,"The greek life is very large at this university, and the housing is very nice."
College Freshman,5,"University of the Pacific has Division1 sports, and their athletics are top notch."
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes are small, which gives the perfect opportunity for teacher/student interaction, than opposed to a lecture hall full of 300 students at a bigger school."
College Freshman,5,"I get a lot of emails from the Career Resource Center who provide a lot of opportunities to assimilate students into the working world. They often host mock interviews and resume writing/review sessions. The pharmacy program has rotations in different environments where you gain experience before graduating, so you can have a better understanding and advantage in the workplace right after graduation."
College Sophomore,5,The Greek life at UOP is amazing.
College Sophomore,5,I love the campus and the Conservatory!
College Sophomore,5,"For the location that we are in, we are a super safe campus."
College Sophomore,5,Professors really know how to teach and make sure to provide help for students.
College Sophomore,5,Absolutely no hazing for social greek organizations because of the struck policy at school.
College Sophomore,5,"There are so many asians everywhere you look, but Pacific is one of the most diverse campuses that I've seen"
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are very small which I love because you get a one on one connection with your professor and they are personally interested in watching you grow. Different teachers have different teaching styles so you have to find teachers that are the right style for you. Professors are very passionate about teaching and most are willing to explain if you approach them.
Junior,4,"Difficult to transition. Overall great to organize myself, get myself together, finish homework on my own time and not have to commute."
Junior,4,"Professors, food, facilities, peers make up this campus that make up your memories.  I pretty much love it all. Great opportunities are here. I feel home here."
Junior,4,"I like the focus on student-professor interactions as well as group work. In addition, availability of professors and access to various resources makes the experience even more merrier."
Junior,4,"During the spring semester, online classes were okay due to the lack of time and resources given to professors. However, I look forward to the change to labs and other pertinent resources this upcoming semester as well as feeling of actually learning from a professor instead of one on my own."
Junior,4,The campus wants us to be involved. Getting into the clubs and getting to meet new friends. Everyone is there to help you graduate.
Junior,4,"The professors are on top of things. They are there to help you learn and get the best out of it. Even if having issues with a concept, they will reteach to help you get a better understanding."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the experience. It seems like a very fun place to go and I am very excited to go there for the school year.
Freshman,4,I am not sure yet because I didn't start classes yet. I am excited and can't wait to start learning new things.
Sophomore,4,"When we went online for Spring 2020, it was quite confusing at first but most of the professors already had experience with teaching online courses so the transition was not as rough. They always made sure to have office hours for us to ask questions outside of class and most lectures were recorded. It was definitely different from in-person learning but the curriculum remained the same."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed my first year at this university because it was really easy for me to find my place - I joined several clubs which helped me find the people who share the same interests as I do and it is generally pretty easy to find the resources that you need to succeed. I'm really excited to go back for my sophomore year after this pandemic.
Graduate Student,4,Professors did their best to try to make online learning possible. It went by smoothly but I still prefer in class than online.
Graduate Student,4,Staff is great there. Teachers really work hard to help students do well. Staff around campus does their best to help you too and they're really nice. The free events they have on campus are fun and I enjoy my time there a lot. It would be nice if they lowered their tuition or lowered some of the extra fees.
Senior,4,Online classes tend to be a lot easier than the classes I've taken in person but be prepared to work on a lot of assignments.
Alum,4,"I bloomed at this university. The professors with small class sizes and open office hours made it easy for me to gain professor recommendations as well as grow as an individual. There were a lot of club activities and it made it easier for me to meet people. However, because of the location, there isn't much to do off campus unless you drive two hours away. This was a pro for me as I was able to focus more on school and my studies and ultimately graduated in three years."
Alum,4,"Moving classes online for this COVID-19 outbreak turned out well for me. I have heard that some professors switch made it more difficult and burdensome, but I personally had a great time. My professors in the psychology department were flexible and worked well with technology making it easier."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Pacific was made better by the fact that I liked a lot of my professors. They were friendly and understanding, not to mention very accomodating when it came to the sudden shut-down of the campus due to COVID. I don't party nor do I participate in athletics, so I don't have a very strong opinion on either of those categories."
Sophomore,4,The overall campus is nice and pretty. The campus is really big so be prepared to do a lot of walking. One of my main issues is that this university is smack dab in this unnotable city where this a lot of crime.
Sophomore,4,The small class sizes are a great benefit to your education. The professors know who you are and are very invested in your learning and understanding. It is a small campus so the social life is lacking but there are lots of opportunities to create more things on campus.
Junior,4,"The most of the professors care about you and are willing to talk to you if you approach them. The course work is definitely tough, and arguably tougher than a lot of other schools. There are a lot of Asians because of the Pre-Pharm/Dent programs, but there are some diverse niches. I think it is overall a good school if you can afford it or get scholarships."
Junior,4,Pacific is a great school that focuses on student learning and provides excellent faculty and services to ensure students achieve that.
Freshman,4,"I wish there was more variety of events around campus, but besides that, I have loved my college. The professors were even more flexible and caring than I could have ever imagined. I am really excited to spend my next 3.5 years here."
Sophomore,4,Love the professors!! Hate the people in charge; The school runs on the whims of a few rich people in charge.
Junior,4,"The thing that drew me in first was the campus. Not only is it gorgeous, the campus and student body size is small, which was what I was looking for in potential universities/colleges. The campus doesn't feel unsafe despite being located in Stockton, CA. Courses can be difficult but are manageable; science courses are particularly challenging (looking at you, Organic Chemistry). Professors are extremely helpful; I have yet to take a course where the professor has been incompetent enough to complain about."
Freshman,4,"My experiences at the University of the Pacific have been fairly positive.  Classroom sizes are fairly small compared to other colleges which is something that I really wanted in college.  The highest amount of students in my classes was 30.  Due to the small classroom size it is very easy to communicate with the professor.  Some professors are more distant than others, but that is to be expected since not everyone is the same.  The campus is very easy to remember.  Won't have problems constantly getting lost or constantly getting classes mixed up.  It is very easy to get in contact to staff though email and I usually receive an email back within a day.  I don't live on campus, but I have heard that the housing on college is well liked.  I feel like our safety on campus is well protected.  The college police is easy to get in contact with if you ever feel threatened."
Freshman,4,The professors really care about students' success. It makes the whole experience so much better by seeing the personal attention each teacher gives.
Freshman,4,"A great, intimate, educational environment, with a good balance of social activities and academic resources."
Senior,4,"The campus itself is beautiful. Stockton itself is a dangerous place, but UOP works hard to keep everyone safe. Most of the professors I had were passionate about teaching and cared for their students."
Graduate Student,4,I've had a great experience at University of the Pacific. My favorite part being the small environment in the classroom.
Freshman,4,Pacific is a nice school with a lovely campus and small classes. The professors I have had have all been really nice and keep up with everyone's performance in class. Lecture halls do not exceed past 60 or 80 people which is great for discussions and questions.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, and the dorms and food are great. The professors I have are amazing, and I'm having a great time here."
Sophomore,4,"First of all UOP has a beautiful campus in which you can enjoy the scenery on your free time or while your studying. Classes are often small which makes for a more individualized learning experience. On top of that Professors are very accommodating, they are often very willing to help you with topics during office hours or even outside those hours."
Junior,4,"I like the academic part of Pacific. We have really amazing professors and the curriculum is challenging and rewarding. I also like the community feel of Pacific. We have friendly students and faculty as well as staff. There are many programs at Pacific that help students wellbeing and enjoyment of the university. I would like to see administrative priorities change, students feel ignored and neglected by administration and regents."
Alum,4,Overall good university.  Good for students right out of high school.  The masters education program is great for teachers who want to continue teaching and pursue a masters degree at the same time.
Freshman,4,The University Of The Pacific has a small campus with not an overwhelming amount students walking around thus making the environment comfortable and easy to get around.
Sophomore,4,University of the Pacific is a great school. The people there are nice and fun to be around although there may be some unfriendly ones.
Freshman,4,"Personally, I truly enjoyed my experiences within the University of the Pacific as I felt that the staff truly cared for each student attending. However, a downside to the University itself is the tuition prices, which can have a heavy impact on a student as well as their family."
Junior,4,University of the Pacific 's curriculum is rather rigorous compared to other institutions but your professors and tight-knit community is always willing to help you on your journey towards success!
Sophomore,4,"After I completed my first year of college, I wouldn't ask for a better college to go to. I personally find it astonishing how the professors in the Political Science Department are there for you in your academics and personal life."
Graduate Student,4,Good class sizes make it easy to interact with professors. The University is safe and welcoming. Lots of like-minded students. Many activities going on at campus.
Junior,4,So far so good. I have not yet started classes but have communicated with multiple admissions staff and all have been very helpful.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the resources available for me to succeed. Many teachers are very approachable and willing to make changes to make out learning experience as seamless as possible.
Freshman,4,The University of the Pacific is a private non-profit organization. It is a small school with an excellent Biological sciences department and Pre-health programs. There could however be some improvements with regards to the organization within the departments.
Sophomore,4,"I love the school's guidance. There is so much help on campus. There is also, so much to do on campus. Since the campus is so small you will get to know a lot of the students and faculty. The only down side is that the university is so expensive."
Sophomore,4,"University of the pacific is a good school, but the classes are tough.You have to be mentally prepared for everything."
Sophomore,4,My experience so far at the University of the Pacific has been great. I love that the class sizes are small enough to where I can actually get one on one time with my professors. The campus is also so beautiful its like it's own world outside of the city it is surrounded by.
Junior,4,"The main features I like about the University of the Pacific is the smaller campus and population. The smaller campus is easier for me to navigate and find classes, while the smaller student population allows for a smaller classroom. The smaller classes allow for more interactions between students and the teacher, with more attention on the students. Professors are generally easy to contact, and are very dedicated to helping you"
Sophomore,4,"Not many people outside of NorCal know about UOP, but it really is a great school. Everyone on campus is so friendly, kind, and always happy to help. Not to mention, the campus is beautiful. As a student, after my first year, I've already built relationships with professors, thanks to the small class sizes and outstanding faculty. I feel like going to school here is really preparing me for my future!"
Graduate Student,4,"Very friendly and beautiful campus. Small student body and small classes (usually no more than 100 for a lecture). Professors usually very easy to approach, and generally friendly student body who help each other out often. Greek life is prominent, especially the professional fraternities. Downside, it's in Stockton."
Junior,4,"This is a small yet beautiful campus surrounded by nature and is nearby quite a few shopping centers, restaurants, and stores. With such a small campus, the classes have less students which means it is easier to talk to your fellow classmates and professors. Even the lecture halls are petite compared to the University of California lecture halls. Unlike public universities, the professors here are always available to help you during their office and no appointment is needed. For such a small cafeteria, there's a surprising amount of diversity in the food. The food on campus is within reasonable price and quite tasty. As with all universities, public or private, there is a fair share of awful professors as well as incredible professors. And last but not least, the biggest downside is the cost of tuition is so high that unless you have rich parents, you will need to take out multiple loans to pay for the tuition."
Sophomore,4,"Very pretty campus, everyone wants to see you succeed. Lots and lots of available help around, like tutors, study group, individual meetings with teachers, etc."
Senior,4,University of the Pacific is a great place for students who want a more personal relationship with their professors.
Sophomore,4,"I like that the classes are generally small, even for freshmen GE classes. All of the professors I've had so far except one, are very helpful, and you are able to establish a more personal relationship with your professors due to the small class sizes. All of your professors will know your name, and they really care about helping you individually, how you are doing, and care about making sure you succeed, especially in SIS (department of International Studies). Another pro is that since its a small school, everybody knows everybody for the most part, and everybody is very friendly. For this reason, its also easy to make and find friends, and you'll see the usual students you see around the usual times you see them when you go to the cafeteria, the lair, the gym, or the library.
The Freshmen dorms, the walls are VERY thin, you literally could hear everything so it could get annoying if your floor or neighbors are loud and you want to sleep, study, or just want some peace and quiet."
Sophomore,4,"University of the Pacific is a great school. Campus is small and classroom size is small. Cafeteria food isn’t that great, but compare to other schools, it’s decent. There’s various club and work opportunities. Campus safety is also good because Stockton is not exactly a safe place. There’s not much around campus, but there is a mall and some variety of restaurants. Stockton is also about an hour from major cities like San Jose and San Francisco."
Sophomore,4,"Just finished my first year at UOP and I am glad I came here. The academics are great, professors are well experienced and genuinely care about helping their students succeed. Every professor so far has been available for office hours and even encourage you to see them any time of day and they are really helpful. Student life is some what boring. There’s hardly anything that goes on around campus and a lot of the events are professional assemblies. Campus is really nice and you actually forget you are in Stockton because it’s so calm and peaceful on campus. The campus is safe. UOP has university police officers driving around at all times of day and there are emergency call boxes pretty much everywhere on campus."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very clean campus and everyone is super friendly, some of the courses are challenging so be ready to work for your grade"
Senior,4,"I enjoyed the science programs. All of the professors are very good at teaching, care about their students, and are passionate about their subject. There are also valuable undergraduate research opportunities."
Niche User,4,Pacific is a beautiful and campus and are very driven to giving their students the best education they can possibly get.
Senior,4,"I liked the overall East Coast feel of the campus. During the tour, it seemed easy for me to gain a sense of direction of where I was going. I liked the dorms and felt satisfied with the variety of vegetarian food options offered."
Alum,4,"Quaint, small college with direct access to professors and a fantastic Greek life system. Conveniently located a short drive to the Bay Area, San Francisco, and the state capital. Off campus housing is affordable and Stockton is a big enough city that there are plenty of employment opportunities off campus. The school is adorable and very picturesque."
Sophomore,4,"I loved how hands-on the staff is, and the available resources that they have. I went through a lot of difficult/traumatic experiences and the staff made it extremely easy to keep up with my schoolwork, and they equipped me with the resources that I need so that I can get back to normal."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't very many employers recruiting on campus. The career center is fine for resume advice and help, but there aren't many people who can help with finding a job or internship. There are not many resources available at this school."
College Freshman,2,"UOP is in Stockton, and it's generally much safer than the surrounding neighborhood (enough that I can walk around by myself in the early morning) but there have definitely been people who've been mugged and assaulted and raped on campus. There are sketchy people who come on campus too, since it's an open campus, and the bridge is not safe at night at all. I don't like walking around at night especially by myself. I carry pepper spray most of the time. The school has police patrolling sometimes and safety cameras on the bridge only and safety services."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many people pay attention on athletics, and the sport games are not a big deal on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't heard anything about sexual assault on campus, but I've heard one fraternity is known for sexual assault. SHE is also known for it, but we don't have that fraternity at our school. As for safety, it is kind of scary walking alone at night. For example, I go to the engineering building to print sometimes at 3am and its scary because i have to walk a good amount to get there. There are lights but they could be brighter. There's also STRIPES which you can call if you don't feel safe walking home."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not in a social sorority, but I am in a professional fraternity. When I first came to college, I didn't even know what a professional fraternity was. The professional ones aren't bad at all, but social sororities and fraternities are bad. Sororities are the worst; they're exclusive and cliquey. There's mean girls in every house and they don't live up to the sisterhood that they claim to exist."
College Student,2,The lifestyle here at Pacific is one you have to make an effort to enjoy.
College Student,2,It only helps if you know people who can get you hired.
College Student,2,The school is very quiet and the tuition money is not spent effectively.
College Freshman,2,"The most popular dorm hall for freshman is South West (they have sinks in the dorms) with Grace coming in second.  The other options include the Quad buildings.  If you're looking for the social scene and ""crazy dorm life"" choose South West: residential advisors hardly ever enforce the rules, people play soccer in the halls at 3 AM, and it's just great for social people.  Want a more quiet place?  Choose the quads, but beware of their location!  They're pretty far away from the main campus (cafeteria, library, and market place)!  South West and Grace are the best for closeness to food and/or the library!  If you play a sport you'll probably be placed in the dorm hall closest to the ""home"" of your sport (basketball=arena so south west, soccer=soccer field so the quad buildings, etc.)  If you need repair for your dorm GOOD LUCK getting the resident office to send you a repair man!  I have a leaky faucet in my dorm and the residency office was contacted TWICE but still no one has come to repair it!  Housing is pricey as hell which is pretty much why everyone is looking towards moving off campus ASAP!"
College Freshman,2,"This school is great if you're looking for a quiet, secluded, and small college.  It also helps if you're majoring in Pharm or the other science fields!  This school is also great if you're a male water-polo player considering that this is the #2 college in the country!  If you don't identify under any of these categories: this school is NOT for you.  The high tuition you'll pay for attending this school will mainly go to either sports team, both good (water polo) and bad (all the other teams), or maintaining the appearance of the campus- I'm talking lawn mowers and leaf blowers running at all hours of the day.  You'd think that for such a high price, the college would reserve money for maintaining the dorms or keeping internet connection up but no.  This school is misleading and if I had the chance to recommit in my senior year of high school I would choose a different college in a heart beat!"
College Freshman,2,"Not great at all. No real enforcement of anything. I know its college and all but it's not cool when people are running through your hall at 3 a.m. Plus the athletes seem to get off the hook way to easy. They can play music as loud as they want, but as soon as a non-athlete plays it at the same level, they get told to turn it down."
College Freshman,2,"It's typically what you think of when you think of a frat: snobby and self-centered. The school revolves too much around greek life. Most of the greek life students are very arrogant and unfriendly. The parties they throw aren't even that great. It's supposed to be a welcoming environment, but its all about cliques and who you know."
College Senior,2,Safety is pretty bad here because unless you just stay on campus. Off campus is terrifying.
College Freshman,2,"My major is environmental science. The location here is horrible for it. The program here focuses on geology. Frankly, if I gave a shit about rocks I would have become a geology major, but I don't."
College Freshman,2,The UC has the same food every single day! The Grove should not be allowed to be considered a grocery store.
College Freshman,2,"I enjoy my classes here. I think that the work load is manageable. I am getting good grades. However, I feel very lonely and unsafe. Also this is a terrible location to be an environmental science major. I want to transfer."
College Freshman,2,"Only one of the Fraternities usually has something going on on either Thursday or Friday night, which gets REALLY boring. The athletes are very cliquey, so there parties are usually uncomfortably excluding."
College Senior,2,"I do not get a lot of financial aid, and I take out a lot of loans. Tuition is very expensive, so it's very frustrating paying for school every year because I have to take out a lot of loans and my parents have to spend a huge portion of their income to help me, because my college savings have been wiped out just from one year of college"
College Sophomore,2,They do not give you anything. If it wasn't for all my other outside scholarships I would not be able to stay at this school.
College Sophomore,2,It can be dangerous. There is a lot of crime and poverty.
College Senior,2,"The biggest sports on campus are basketball and water polo (we don't have football), but even then the games are not always well-attended."
College Sophomore,2,The only thing I hate is when the internet kicks me off periodically.
College Freshman,2,I don't really know where any parties are and night is boring.
College Sophomore,2,"Shuttle to airport is expensive and difficult unless you have a car. Car parking is also expensive! 

There is a train station but a little sketchy! Buses are non existent. However the university has weekend shuttles."
College Student,2,Don't go to any clubs in Stockton. Go to Sacramento or SF. The bars are all pretty good. The parties are pretty great.
College Student,2,"There's no getting around that we pay far too much for on campus housing. The RAs are okay, but some of them are strict for no reason. They are all helpful when you have roommate problems though. "
College Freshman,2,Certain parts of Stockton is pretty dangerous. Just avoid those areas!
College Senior,2,"The dining isn't great, even for campus standards, but it will do when you don't have many other options. In comparison to buying your own groceries and doing your own cooking, on campus dining is not all that healthy and a bit of a rip-off. Meal plans can be used at the grocery store on campus, but it has a very limited selection (best for grab-n-go) and is way over-priced."
College Sophomore,2,"Although pricey, it is important to experience living on campus. Some dorms do have perks like sinks or carpets and each hall is designed differently. Most people in my house lucked out and don't have roommates which was one of the best parts of move-in. One think I would want is for the windows to be cleaned as often as they use the leaf-blowers. "
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not a party-person, but the amount of times I hear, ""Dude, that party last night, and the night before, and the one before that was sooo fun!"" so I can't help but assume that everyone enjoys their nights at on or off-campus parties. "
College Sophomore,2,"The unpredictable California weather is not much of a surprise. Extreme cold in the morning, extreme heat in the afternoon and freezing nights are normal and expected. "
College Sophomore,2,"Other than our incredible water polo team, the rest of the sports aren't very popular. Our basketball teams are mentioned a lot but the attendance at games (for any sport really) isn't outstanding. Just a handful of people who are bored on a week night. "
College Sophomore,2,"All of the food is centered in one dining hall, which isn't that bad compared to the small school size. There are different stations such as pasta, grill, taqueria, healthy destination, deli, salad bar, asian foods, and a place for all american favorites. The menu rarely changes, with the exception of the daily specials. Other than the lack of variety, if you switch up which station you eat at everyday, it's not too boring. In addition to our one dining hall, there are food trucks on parts of campus that are on parts of campus that are too far from the dining hall, there's a good variety of lunch choices like the mac n cheese that is everyone's favorite. The best thing is Tapingo, especially during lunch and dinner times when waiting in line is a hassle, or if you forget your ID card, the app will still let you buy food. "
College Sophomore,2,"Stockton already has a bad reputation, but we do have the Miracle Mile with a lot of shopping plazas and places to eat, UOP hosts many community events like Safe Trick or Treat for younger kids who live in areas that aren't safe to be out at night. Homecoming is also a big community event that attracts a lot of attention."
College Junior,2,Stockton doesn't have a lot to offer but there a nice jazz hang out. The city enjoys theatre & has a few places you can go watch a play. There is an arena to watch hockey or concerts. Stockton also has a city baseball league & baseball field. But thats pretty much it. On campus there is also entertainment.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much to do in Stockton! It's not a big city where the atmosphere is thriving. Stockton is a good size town but the local college life here isn't that great. One could go to sac.
College Sophomore,2,"The process to get into pharmacy school was horrible. You have several different applications to complete, along with essays. Then you have to what for an invitation for an interview. The interview consist of of several interviews, essay and meeting with student panel. Then hurry up and wait to find out if you made the cut."
College Sophomore,2,"Stockton is a big city, but it's not the safest. The University seems to be the ""gem"" of the city. The area surrounding it is dirty and there is a lot of crime that happens. There is a Minor League Baseball team and those games are fun to go to. There is a mall about 2 miles from campus which is nice because it is so close that it doesn't seem that unsafe to go to. But other than that I wouldn't walk anywhere, at least not alone."
College Freshman,2,"Not much variety after having to eat the same food all year long. Choices get boring. Service is slow and workers are Rude, especially at the Coffee house in the UC. Food is usually cold and unsatisfying. Fruit is never ripe and they do not wash the fruit and vegetables before they sell them. Workers do not all wear gloves like they should and are not properly trained in food preparation."
College Freshman,2,"Beautiful and small campus. Greek students do a lot of drugs, and think they are better than everybody."
College Freshman,2,Adequate dorms. Rooms are small and air conditioning/heat and very tempermental and break a lot. Students are very irresnsible and leave the bathrooms and halls dirty. Library is great! The dining hall is always dirty.
College Freshman,2,"There is a problem with alcohol, cigarettes, acid, weed, and many other drugs that you hear students talk about. Mostly those in Greek life, though."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms, are very neutral in their conditions and cleanliness. There are weekly custodians who clean things in a fashion that one would not call efficient. The rooms have decent furnishing, but space is a fairly large problem. The main problem lies with the residents irresponsibility. A select group of residents disregard the fact that they share a dorm with other residents and proceed trash the bathrooms and hallways, which makes it uncomfortable to live in. The main benefit is the close proximity that any dorm is generally close to any class on campus."
College Freshman,2,There are many parking spaces on campus but most you have to buy a permit. Even with a permit it is hard to find empty parking spaces. There are different permits and different prices for them. The highest priced permits are closer to classes and buildings. Make sure to get to school about half an hour before class to get a space.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather is bipolar especially during the Fall and Winter seasons.  Coming from a sunny state, I don't like all the clouds and the rain.  I like to exercise outside so I can never do that on campus.  The weather was a little cold for me to walk on campus, but of course if you have the right clothing, you should be fine."
College Junior,2,Police patrol around the campus a lot and if you get into trouble with them it's all bad
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office is incredibly awful at communicating the requirements to receive aid, and pretty disorganized on top of that. I was running around for weeks filling out paperwork and then finding there was more left to fill out. Very frustrating to be a week into the semester and still not be able to make a payment because you can't receive your money due to incomplete paperwork."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Basketball, water polo, volleyball, and baseball games are really fun to go to, but hardly any students go, unless it's an ESPN game. I iwsh Pacific never got rid of it's football program. I felt like I missed out on a big part of college because we didn't have football."
College Senior,2,"It get really hot during the summer.  During the winter it's super cold and it rains a lot.  Spring weather is nice but it has days when it's hot and or cold.  Fall is about the same as spring just hotter, sometimes we don't have a fall and jump right into winter."
College Senior,2,"Pacific could do a better job at providing other services to students to help them feel safer.  There aren't a lot of on campus crime, everything tends to happen off campus, but your guard should always be up anytime you're on campus or off campus."
College Senior,2,You'll notice that the majority of the population here is of Asian background but that doesn't take away from the somewhat diverse community here at the University of the Pacific.  Guys are not as attractive but everyone has there own pick in the type of guys they like.  The ladies tend to look the same here.  Only once in a while will you notice a very attractive guy and a beautiful lady walking on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Limited during the morning and days but very open afternoon and night.  However, the open spaces are far from class, and dangerous to walk to alone at night (if you have night classes)."
College Sophomore,2,"UOP is pretty generous when it comes to loans.  I am on a partial academic scholarship which helps for the cost of my tuition a lot. But I've heard that the process to get financial aid is not hard, but not easy."
College Junior,2,"Biochemistry Is Death – Some professors are very helpful, however, there are the ones that make you want to quit altogether."
College Junior,2,"It's Just Okay – You can find things to do if you want to, but they aren't everywhere"
College Freshman,2,"The school is strict, but mostly on academics.

SOCIAL, however, is a different story. I have not seen one student busted from a party or from usage of illegal substances. If you make the right connections, you could be able to be sly past those ""warnings.""

ACADEMICS is tough, however. Cheating results in failing. BUT, only if you get caught! It's pretty easy to cheat on things, but only if you can do it right.

So, in my opinion, the school is strict, but lacks enough motivation to become more strict. Students can basically run this whole school themselves."
College Sophomore,2,"No Longer One of Ten Most Miserable Cities in the US – Stockton might be a great place, but I'll never have the luxury of knowing. Coming onto this campus, I knew that I was practically never leaving it. The crime rates and my lack of car pretty much cemented this. Campus is not bad but, eh, Stockton gets a C- from me."
College Student,2,"On campus dining is overpriced, but the quality and variety is relatively high. At the University Center, there are many options, ranging from a pasta station to taqueria to a salad bar. All of food is purchased locally and Pacific takes initiative in preparing very health-conscious meals. For students who are on the go, there is the food truck near the south of campus, which offers very delicious options that are perfect for those running late or doesn't have much of a break between classes. Dining around the campus is plentiful and always fun to explore, especially since most are within walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,Honestly Unsure – I myself have not been invited to a party on campus but i go to many with my friends who do not go to Pacific. This leads me to believe that there are not many parties on campus and that the nightlife is not that great. the school does however try to hold events for the students.
Recent Alumnus,2,No Fun Policy – Very strict about drinking on campus and loud parties. Its hard to have a good campus party thats fun without it being shut down.
College Junior,1,They think theey run the school and have a complete dominance over it. They also fail to admit their academic performacne is subpar.
College Freshman,1,"I hate it here, my English teacher cannot spell humming bird, my psychology teacher did not show up for 3 weeks and the food is so greasy and disgusting."
College Freshman,1,"If you come to Stockton, never order fish! It's the worst! Places do not really stay open very late. If they do it's probably not very safe to venture outside. The quality of most restaurants here is horrible! The vegetarian/vegan, fresh, and organic availability is almost nonexistent.."
College Senior,1,The on campus food is unbearable at times. I almost never spend my money on means. The only place I spend money on campus is at the groove to buy snacks. The groove has reasonable variety and value.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do on campus or off campus. I am going here because of the amazing opportunities.
College Freshman,1,I think University of the Pacific does not help with financial aid which makes it hard to go to because it is expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"If you are planning to transfer to University of the Pacifc I advise that you do not. Try a different school that is cheaper and more professional. You can get a degree that's worth the same, that's the same level, as University of the pacific. They have a financial aid office that does not help in anything. A women in admissions who is horrid and rude and must hate her job because she treats students with no respect. I have not yet got a chance to see how the teachers are but from office experiences, they are no help. You are on your own. I'm sure there is one person in the office that's willing to help but I did not meet that person. "
College Sophomore,1,"I had a horrible experience with my financial aid. Long story short, I had to defer my enrollment for a year."
College Sophomore,1,"The process was a pain in the butt, and I didn't receive as much as I would have liked. Both my parents and I have to take out hefty loans just to barely get by. I would suggest trying to apply for as many scholarships possible, or not coming from a low income family; which unfortunately I do."
College Freshman,1,"Most greek students are into drugs and alcohol. They are all rude, overbarring, and stuckup. "
College Junior,1,"Stockton is not known for a great lifestyle for college students. As a matter of fact it has been voted the unhappiest city in the country and has a homicide rate that is steadily increasing. BUT. It really isn't as bad as the news makes it out to be. YES, there are bad neighborhoods. So use common sense and don't go there. Act dumb and dumb things will happen to you (like texting on the levee late at night. That glow from your phone will practically attract people to come and rob you. So don't. The text can wait.) Stockton is super close to other great towns, like San Francisco and Sacramento, so there are nice places to visit within a good distance."
College Freshman,1,"The local atmosphere is okay. There are shopping malls and lots of good restaurants nearby, but there is not much to do in town besides going to the hookah bar or seeing a movie."
College Sophomore,1,"Need a Car – Its nice to get off campus, but without a car off campus dining is near impossible.  Mircale mile is about a mile and a half away and has several places, but even though the school raves about its safety, people were held at gunpoint in that area.  With a car there are various places, mainly in Sacramento which is a good hour away. Don't go to Stockton for good food..."
College Student,1,"Not Much to Do – Stockton does not offer much to do outside of campus. Although there are different festivals and local events, not many students are aware or even interested in them. Miracle Mile offers a variety of restaurants and eateries, as well as a couple of nightclubs, which is very nice, especially for a weekend date. Locals are always excited to meet Pacific students and are very proud to hear students' stories. However, Stockton's location is extremely convenient, especially being in the valley and close to   popular places, such as San Francisco, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, etc."
College Junior,1,"Parking is terrible.  There are no free parking lots, and only if you find limited parking on the street is it free.  Student permits are $100 for the lots actually close to the classes, and $25 for a 5 minute walk to the closest classroom building.  If you want the closest parking lot, you have to get there before 8 am, usually by 7:30, otherwise the next closest parking lot is 2 minutes away."
College Junior,1,"Why Am I in Stockton – Stockton is not a favorable city to live in by any means, however the University of the Pacific is truly a diamond in the rough.  People do not venture to far from campus in Stockton except to local bars that many college students frequent.  The streets are pretty unsafe and for many students here, Stockton may as well be Detroit.  There are robberies, assaults, shootings, and an abundant of foreclosed homes and businesses.  the general community is pretty sad, but they do what they can to support Pacific.  Many of the members of the community attend the shows, games and other events put on here at Pacific.  Sure I can not imagine living in Stockton after I graduate, but my experience at the University of the Pacific itself has been amazing."
College Junior,1,"Parties on Campus – While I have not attended any parties on campus, Pacific is such a small school that you hear about them anyways.  Many times, the frats throw parties that lots of people attend, even those under 20, and alcohol and drugs such as mariuana are known to be available to attendees."
College Freshman,1,"Drive Your Own Car – stockton is not a great city, high crime rate. so if you need to go somewhere, its best to drive your own car. public transportation is not an option"
College Junior,1,"Strict? Oh, We Got Strict. There really isn't much to do on campus, and depending on your RA/ ARD/ RD, they can be extremely strict. Judicial Affairs can take up to weeks for you to find out whether you are getting called in or not."
College Sophomore,1,"Perhaps over 90% of the students are Asian. There are only a few Caucasians, almost no Europeans, Africans, or Australians. It was a while before I even met any Latino or Hispanics. Therefore our reputation is that everyone is a pre-dent or pre-pharm because that is what most Asians there are. Many people form clicks in accordance with their ethnicity so it is difficult for those who are not Asian."

Niche User,5,I don't take classes online but I have heard from those that do that it is an easy and painless process.
Niche User,5,"I loved the culture of the school. From the moment I stepped on campus, I just knew that this was the place that God was calling me to be at. It truly is a place full of the Lord's spirit."
Senior,5,My online learning experience with PBA was quite good despite the sudden move to online for the rest of the summer due to the pandemic. The teachers made sure that Zoom classes were done in a timely manner and they made sure that the course work was managable evenwith the suddent transition to online.
Senior,5,"What I liked about Palm Beach Atlantic University is the friendly staff and student body! I remember one experience where my chemisrtry professor actually was willing to go as far as to fight the Enrollment Office to keep me within his class. But alas, the battle was lost, but that moment still sticks with me and that proffessor and I are still on good terms with each other."
Sophomore,5,Love it! The school has an amazing community. The school and its leaders truly care for the students. PBA prepares students for future servant leadership.
Freshman,5,"Online experience at PBA is called HyFlex, only people with COVID or in isolation go on Hyflex, all other students are in the classroom social distanced."
Freshman,5,"It's a great university and everyone should come to PBA it's a great community, PBA is near the beach and has a great business program."
Sophomore,5,Individual Attention is excellent! Academic support is so helpful. Small classes make you visible and important. The value for your contribution is appreciated and rewarded.
Sophomore,5,Great communication! The availability of professors is awesome! There are small classes so you really get lots of attention.
Niche User,5,Amazing location! Great Christian community! It is currently my top school and I am hoping to be there in 2021
Freshman,5,I haven’t taken any online classes and I don’t plan on doing that either but they have been really helpful over the phone and face to face as well.
Freshman,5,The staff and everyone is so nice and understanding and super friendly. They’ve helped me with everything that I’ve needed to be able to go into the new school year. I really appreciate everything they’ve done for me thus far into my admissions process. It has been a bit hard to find scholarships and get loans they’ve also been super helpful with that as well.
Graduate Student,5,I only took one class online and it was great. I usually am pretty hesitate when it comes to learning online but the professor made the class engaging and fun and I thoroughly enjoyed the class.
Sophomore,5,The community at PBAU is really special because it is very open! They are extremely welcoming and the community turns into family! The smallness of the school makes it much easier to have a closer relationship to professors and get one on one help!
Freshman,5,"PBA is a wonderful school and being on campus is really enjoyable. It's an open campus right in the heart of downtown West Palm Beach. Chick-Fil-A and Eistein Bros - two alternative restaurants other than the cafeteria located on-campus, are the go-to student hubs to have a good snack or lunch and to hang with friends. The library is huge and is a perfect place to escape and study or get other work done right next to your classes!"
Niche User,5,I've had an amazing experience in this Christ centered liberal arts university. Everyone is so enthusiastic about learning and growing spiritually.
Freshman,5,Palm Beach Atlantic is great! It has many different career path options you can take  with highly experienced teachers and staff members in every field that are very willing to guide to where you want to be.
Graduate Student,5,I attended PBA for undergrad and I am currently working on my Master's here. One of my favorite things about PBA is that we have quality professors that actually care about investing in their students. I have had professors pray with me and advise me in the field I am going in to and I am so grateful for their impact on my life. The WPB area is also so beautiful.
Niche User,5,"THE

Niche User,5,"I really LOVE Palm Beach Atlantic University. Everybody there is really sincerely friendly and really cares. It has a very homey feel to it. They also have really great academics, and wonderful teachers."
Niche User,5,"I went to visit my brothers at school, (PBA), I was lucky enough to experience the dorm living by staying over night in one of their friends dorm rooms. The experience was so much fun that the curfew wasn't a problem.  Not like most schools the cafe/food was amazing, a bunch of varieties never a disappointment."
Sophomore,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a great school for every student! Students who desire academic prowess will find it in the classroom and among the student body. There are several fun activities and events hosted at the college as well as in the surrounding city of West Palm Beach. The campus is friendly and inviting, and there is a strong sense of community at this campus."
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending Palm Beach Atlantic university. The college is located in the center of downtown west palm beach. This is  a Christian college.  This is not a party school. So far my experience has been amazing. The professor are great. The staff members are very helpful.


Although it’s the beginning of my college education, I have no complaints .  I was a bit scared about living on campus. However, I feel great.  

I believe I made a wonderful choice for my college education."
Junior,5,"This place holds such a special place in my heart. The education is great and the professors really care about the students. They know you by name and get to know you more than just who you are according to your grades. Athletically, the school is doing great and is continuing to grow. The coaches love their athletes and speak up for them when necessary. You aren't just a game winning asset, but also a person. The school and location are also just beautiful so that's just another benefit."
Freshman,5,"I will be attending Palm Beach Atlantic University this fall and I am super excited because all of the professors I have met so far were all helpful and kind and every time I have visited the campus, it was beautiful and clean! Plus the students are friendly as well!"
Freshman,5,I think that PBA is a good school if you want to be closer to god and if you want to focus on your academics. The people are very nice. Also the professors are amazing.  I would suggest that anybody should go here. The school might be. tiny. but everyone at PBA has a big heart and soul.
Junior,5,A great school to earn your full four-year degree and amazing location. It is just minutes away from the beach. They especially make you feel like you are at home.
Freshman,5,"PBA is perfect for my major! though it is really expensive, the experience is really great. I love the loose feel of the experience. I love the scheduling in the school, and how you have 50 minute classes. i feel like i have the time to recuperate after each class, get even some homework done between classes for the others  that day. Its such a breath of fresh air compared to high school. I dont like the political and social focuses of the school however. i think we should be concerned with education here especially because of the price tag. im tired of the debates and panels and influencing mic nights at this private christian college that costs $30,000 to study at and live at per semester."
Freshman,5,I personally feel as if this college is not like no other. The teachers and staff are very welcoming and positive role models.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy that PBA is not a huge university. It's easy to get to know people and be involved in school activities.
Sophomore,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic is a smaller university with a family feel. From having your name on a parking spot when you go for your campus tour to the personal follow-up after your visit, you really feel welcomed. Although the campus is in downtown West Palm Beach, it doesn't feel city-ish."
Junior,5,"I'm 60 years old and a junior in the Psychology program.  I am a Christian, and love the way PBA incorporates Christianity in their program.  The classes are small and the teachers are kind and understanding."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved being a student at PBA. The community here is the best part; the professors are amazing and the students are so welcoming. As a part of the honors program, I have learned so much and been challenged to grow in my faith. I wholeheartedly recommend Palm Beach Atlantic University!"
Junior,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is an excellent institution that provides an all-encompassing experience to its students. The connection to faculty is so strong and allows students to not only floor personal queries but also build strong relationships with professors in order to further learn and network. Furthermore, the academic quality of lecturers is very strong; however, it will always depend on the student whether or not they are proactive and responsive. 

PBA has also provided me with an environment to build life-long friendships and grow my faith! Lastly, through the Rinker Center for Experiential Learning (RCEL) I have also had the tremendous privilege of studying in South Korea at Korea University, on study abroad (KU is ranked #86 in the world and provides PBA students a great opportunity to learn and network abroad)."
Niche User,5,"I love PBA, when i took a private tour with my parents I fell involve with the school. Very clean, quiet, friendly school. I am applying here and hope to be a Sailfish"
Senior,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a comprehensive interdenominational faith-based university with a core emphasis on character formation by integrating a Christian worldview with the liberal arts and selected professional studies. It is located in West Palm Beach, in the U.S. state of Florida approximately one mile from the Atlantic Ocean on the Intracoastal Waterway.

Sophomore,5,"no complaints! i'm so happy i decided to attend PBA. so far i have had a great college experience! Student life creates events every week for students to do, the teachers are very helpful and amazing to learn from, and the atmosphere is great. my favorite part is the chick-fil-a on campus!"
Junior,5,Transferring to Palm Beach Atlantic University is one of the best decisions I have ever made. It's close to home and I have developed incredibly as a person and in my faith. I never have to worry about professors being demeaning about my faith because they're all so welcoming and kind. The atmosphere is different and everyone is out there to reach their dreams with God by their side.
Junior,5,The campus is big and there are a lot of places in the library or just around campus where you can study. There are private rooms in the library if you really want to focus and want a quiet space. The professors are really approachable and very friendly. There are school activities to those who are living on-campus and to the commuters as well to encourage students to enjoy their college years as well.
Junior,5,I love how it is centered on religion and they really care about their students. Each faculty member teaches with love and puts their students first.
Junior,5,I liked how professors are very approachable and how they can give a one-on-one consultations on office hours. They have helped me a lot in my studies especially when I have questions regarding the topic. They were not only a professor but a friend and a family who shares the love of God.
Graduate Student,5,"I start school in August, but the staff at Palm Beach have been with me every step of the way. I am currently active duty military, and they make it a priority to inform me of events and other information that would be beneficial to me once I arrive in August of this year."
Freshman,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is not only a great place to grow in one's academia, but also a great place to grow in all areas of life. Personally, I have grown mentally, emotionally, physically, and most importantly spiritually. The professors are amazing and personable. The area is astoundingly beautiful. The campus itself is absolutely jaw-dropping. I honestly have nothing bad to say about the university. I would, however, warn a potential student to not be put off by the rules. Yes, at first some of the rules seem daunting, but they really aren't as strict as you'd think. There's so much overall freedom, that a curfew for the first semester really isn't that big of a deal. Also, most RAs or other authority are reasonable."
Alum,5,"So proud to be a Sailfish!    I'm impressed by the professional and ministry accomplishments of my peers.  If I had to choose again, I would definitely go to PBA again."
Niche User,5,My overall experience touring Palm Beach Atlantic was fantastic. Our tour guide was very welcoming and did an excellent job of showing us around the school. I loved the atmosphere of the school and I could really picture myself attending school there. I know it would help me in grow in my faith and really prepare me for life after college.
Senior,5,"In this Christ centered community, your faith will only grow. The love within this campus is overwhelming to me each and every day."
Freshman,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a Christian Private School dedicated to it's students.  The professors and faculty are truly looking to bring out the best in students, to help them with their personal career and walk with the Lord.  Every person is welcoming and interested in your personal PBA experience starting with the RA's all the way up to the President himself!"
Freshman,5,Intimate campus... EVERY one gas thw caring attitude... it's a rea l family regardless where you come from or yoye nationality. The most important is everyone love God. The professors care like you are their p wn children. Such an awesome atmosphere! I am hu.bly grateful!
Freshman,5,PBA is an amazing Christ centered institution. The location is beautiful too. The community is wonderful. Everyone is kind and there for each other. The professors are also great and want you to succeed.
Sophomore,5,PBA is a phenomenal school. The professsors really wants to see you succeed in life and they try their very best to help you.They also become great mentors and great friends when graduating.
Freshman,5,"I start this coming august. However, from the campus tour that I participated in, I have learned a great deal. The teachers are determined to see you through, and it helps with the class size at a minimal. They're are a lot of resources here for you to take advantage of to better your studies. I can't wait to start."
Junior,5,PBA is an amazing school where professor and faculty really care for your education and personal life. I have made friends that I will have for life and experienced so many amazing things here at PBA. It is a school that allows you to go past academics and grow as a person a place where you will be known and loved. PBA really is my home <3
Junior,5,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a wonderful Christ and community centered institution of higher education. The school is in a beautiful location, and the professors are great! I have definitely enjoyed my time there so far. There are so many ways to get plugged in on campus and off campus."
Freshman,5,Palm Beach Atlantic University is a thriving private college. They provided me with the knowledge and ability to thrive in my community. All of my teachers have been excellent and have proved to me that they love what they do. I love the healthy environment that is spread at this school and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
Freshman,5,"A great community with professors who know you by name, truly care about you, and do their best to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Palm Beach Atlantic University was incomparable because of the staff and the environment that is encouraged on campus. The school sets high standards and encourages students, through positive reinforcement, to meet those standards. Faculty and resources create an excellent academic program that offers opportunities to excel in whatever one's desired field of study is. Overall, PBA is a college that offers life, academic, and personal experience unparalleled within the academic community."
Freshman,5,"I have been at Palm Beach Atlantic University for almost 2 semesters now and I must say, I have never been so confident and happy with myself making a major life decision. I have gained a multitude of knowledge not only in the classroom but also on campus itself. PBAU is a great place to be and it is somewhere I would highly recommend high school students to explore."
Sophomore,5,"PBAU has a diverse atmosphere with Christian foundations.  The professors are supportive, approachable, and generally hope to see their students succeed.  The small classes generate an environment for learning."
Alum,5,I love the atmosphere found all around the campus of Palm Beach Atlantic University. Everyone is kind and caring and you can always find a smiling face to talk to. The only thing I would change would be better parking for the commuter students. 
Freshman,5,"I love PBA! It is a wonderful faith-filled school! If you want to be surrounded by people who love the Lord you should come here! If you're looking to party or anything like that do not come.  There are many many rules but if you're like me, they won't bother you!"
Sophomore,4,"Zooms have been great. I have only done a short period online, but the professors are kind and attentive. Even with online learning, I am still able to learn a lot."
Niche User,4,I have been doing a lot of research on the school and it seems as if there online program is popular and very good!
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed the atmosphere and the students and facility. The facility would be my favorite thing about the school. They go above and beyond and have a genuine heart for students and learning. I would definitely recommend this school.
Junior,4,"So far, Palm Beach Atlantic University is fast paced and positive. Currently, I am going into my junior year of college and am enrolled in the Public Relations program. Additionally, i am a minor in the communications field of study. PBA faculty and staff are friendly and approachable. Nonetheless, their rigid rule structure helps develop trustworthy workers. Personally, I enjoy the undivided attention being received during class times. The campus is smaller, so buildings and rooms are easy to navigate. The student to professor ratios are small (usually 25:1). This creates a positive learning atmosphere, while encouraging questions to be asked."
Junior,4,"Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, the rest of the spring semester transitioned to online classes. Despite the shift, the professors were still easily approachable and attentive to students with many questions. At the end of zoom meetings (from home) the professors will take time to speak with each student directly. This provided a sense of comfort knowing that the staff cares about the education you are receiving, and of course how one is doing overall."
Sophomore,4,I had a great first semester at PBAU but unfortunately not a great second semester because we had to leave early and attend online classes due to the coronavirus disease.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the coronavirus disease, my university had the transition to online classes. I did not have the best experience and it was very hard for me to do so. some of the classes I feel were hard to learn online instead of in-person like my chemistry and biology class. I also have a Chromebook laptop and some of the websites necessary for me to have for the online classes were not compatible with it."
Senior,4,"Believe it or not this was the school o wanted to go to since I was a kid. I wanted to be a guidance counselor and all the guidance counselors I knew went to PBA. Academics wise the school did not disappoint. The professors are amazing and you learn a lot. The only downside is that there is little to no college life. The rules are strict making it hard to live your best college life. If you want to focus on academics then this school
Is perfect for you but if you see college as a time to let lose then try looking somewhere else"
Senior,4,Online classes are decent. You can work more at your own pace and teachers are always available if you have any questions
Junior,4,"Beautiful place with beautiful people. A great place to learn, grow, and get involved. The teachers are kind and caring, and there are incredible internships and job opportunities in the area."
Junior,4,"I love Palm Beach Atlantic University for the connections and the community that I have found here. From the very beginning, all students have been so friendly towards me and I have found a wonderful group of friends. The location is beautiful, I have learned so much through the honors program, and because I go to a Christian school, I have found a good church and mentor along the way. The only thing I would change about the school is their housing options, bu they are creating new ones for the upcoming school year."
Sophomore,4,Palm Beach Atlantic University is a great school. The campus is small and in a great location. The community is very good and the staff and faculty are very nice.
Freshman,4,I love everything about my school except the dorms/housing and the cafeteria food. I'd like to see more food options in the future.
Junior,4,"I love most aspects of PBA. It is a relatively conservative school, but it is a great place to grow in your faith with professors who are experts in their fields. You go here for the beautiful location and amazing academics and you stay here for the community."
Sophomore,4,"The professors I have interacted with truly want the best for you and your future. That paired with a huge support system of friends who are always uplifting makes for an amazing experience. Also, everything is in walking distance and there is a lot to do in the city."
Niche User,4,"Palm Beach Atlantic is located in West Palm Beach, which can be a risky area; however, campus security helps to make sure one another is safe. Their athletics is top notch and a great part of the program and the professors do an excellent job to make sure that you understand the material learning as they offer night classes, as well talking to them one on one. It truly is a great experience if anyone gets the chance to go here. Partying isn't something I have experienced but yeah I've heard its good. Diversity is surprisingly kinda good because we have the opportunity to connect with people from all over the nation as well as the globe and that's a really cool thing to experience. Palm Beach Atlantic University is really really nice."
Sophomore,4,Palm Beach Atlantic University is a wonderful school with great opportunities and a wonderful community. One thing I would love to see improved at my school is more encouragement from the school to cultivate students passions and keep them in touch with the things that are important to them. There should be a better space for students to express the things that are important to them.
Freshman,4,"It is a great university with kind professors and staff. The location is fantastic as well. The university is located on the inter coastal and is about a mile away from the beach. There is lots to do in downtown West Palm between plays, live music, food and the beach. I would highly recommend this school."
Niche User,4,"I just got accepted here! They are very fast wiht their decisions and help you out so much! Once they had all they needed for my application it took only 2 weeks to know if I was accepted or not! They called, emailed, and texted me! I love how they are technology advance, because I know that young people like me prefer text messages. I haven't seen the campus but my best friend's sister goes there and she loves it!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the passion my professors have in what they're teaching and in seeing their students succeed. I never had an issue with my professors or classes. However, what I've had an issue on and wish could change about PBA is the level of communication. I've missed out on some things and had a few things happen that I believe could have been dodged if things were communicated better to me from certain offices."
Junior,4,"I love Palm Beach Atlantic University. I love that we have a lot more one on one with professors, since our class sizes are small. I haven't had much to complain about my professors because I was able to learn something from all of them. I very much recommend this school! The only downside is the cost of tuition. Is is very expensive, and the only way I can afford it is through scholarships and grants. Other than that, its a great school with a great education system."
Sophomore,4,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a great school! Some of the academic areas are not the best such as business. However, the education program is very unique and the professors are generally all very caring."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school, It's honestly such a great place to be. Holding a campus leadership position is a must. The community experienced here is only rivaled by that of the leadership positions on this campus. Everyone seems to genuinely love each other. The campus atmosphere is relaxed and conducive to civil conversation and intelligent exchanges. No one goes around asking what your political leanings are, and we seem to be one of the only campuses in America where that doesn't matter, or change people's views of each other. You can be democratic, republican, libertarian, or just about anything and be apart of a great community and cross the political boundaries that our society tries to arbitrarily enforce to create deep meaningful relationships."
Junior,4,Christian University that has a wonderful environment and lovely campus. A campus that always has fun activities whether it is sports or a hall dance. The academics usually do not give much busy work and the staff is helpful.
Freshman,4,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is the perfect college for me. Being about a mile from the beach in beautiful, sunny south Florida, how much more perfect can you get? The beautiful location spreads to the campus. PBA is clean, open, and everything is within walking distance. With it being a smaller school, it is a unique college experience that allows students to have close relationships with professors and create a unified student body. The academics are amazing (I would highly recommend the honors program!)and the sports are competitive and entertaining."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, PBA is a great school. Most of the professors are very knowledgeable and care about their students. All of the professors want you to go to their office hours because they want to get to know you. However, the school is not at all diverse and needs to spend their money more wisely. They will plant tons of new plants every semester but will take forever to fix something that breaks in a classroom/dorm room."
Senior,4,"My experience at Palm Beach Atlantic has been really enjoyable. All of the students are friendly and the professors are encouraging. Beware of some of the science professors, they are more demanding academically. I've enjoyed being about of the Sailfish family."
Sophomore,4,"I am an online student at this University and compared to other schools I have attended, this University is one of the best. My academic adviser is almost always available for questions and to guide me and my teachers have all been extremely hands on. I even have their personal cellphone numbers just in case I need help with anything after regular school hours."
Sophomore,4,"It's a small school and that works for me, but it's not for everyone. It's a Christian school and academics sometimes integrate that Christian worldview."
Freshman,4,"I liked the friendliness of the staff and students, along with the amazing location and weather. It is a small school, which means that some options are limited, but at the same time it is still a great place to get a solid education."
Sophomore,4,"Overall PBA is a good school. Most people are quite friendly and the professors are generally always there to help you. It is very strict, but it is manageable; you will likely not get expelled unless you blatantly and openly rebel against school rules. The school is very Christian and conservative as a whole, and if you have a different viewpoint you may be shunned a bit. But you will likely find a community that still works for you."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed this school, though I didn't end up staying, the setting was perfect, and the atmosphere was very laid back but also very supportive."
Niche User,4,Palm Beach Atlantic is a beautiful college with lots of activity for students to participate in. PBA  has an amazing selection of food on campus including a chick-fli-a for students. The college is located right down town so student life is amazing with plenty of things to do in your free time. Not only do you have the amazing city wrapped around you their is the perfect west cost only five minutes away head over the bridge and boom there. Palm Beach has a great student/ facility ratio of 13/1 meaning you get the most amount of one-on-one time with your professors helping with the success of your academic score.
Sophomore,4,Palm Beach Atlantic University has a beautiful campus. The location of the school is right down the road and is located in the heart of West Palm Beach. The professors are always there for your and will assist you for anything.
Freshman,4,"Palm Beach Atlantic University is an excellent school with great diversity as well as a warm, home-like environment. The people in this school are thoughtful and exude genuine, Christian values through their actions. Academically, this school is thought-provoking, relating Christian experience to those of the real-world and analyzing the purpose of a well-rounded education."
College Sophomore,4,"The Health and Wellness office is in an awkward place, and I have never been there. Campus safety is very present, and their heart seems to be for the students, which is incredible impressive because most students seem to dislike Campus safety."
College Sophomore,4,I love all of the professors for my major. However I had had a few negative experiences with other professors. So far I have enjoyed the majority of my classes and the honors program is hard but worthwhile
College Sophomore,4,I would imagine that in ministry my degree will be respected and it will be helpful in finding a job
College Sophomore,4,I love the housing communities I have lived in and I love living on Campus
College Sophomore,4,A couple of disappointing classes but a wonderful community
College Freshman,4,"Many of the professors are amazing at their jobs. However, some should be avoided at all costs."
College Freshman,4,The staff at PBA all do their best to help you get jobs and internships both during and after college.
College Freshman,4,"The price of housing is low compared to many colleges I looked at, and all of the buildings are close to each other because it's such a small school."
College Freshman,4,The soccer and volleyball teams are great. The basketball teams are pretty good too.
College Freshman,4,PBA is an amazing school. The environment here is so different from any other school I've visited and this makes it incredible to be apart of this community.
College Freshman,4,"The teachers really care about your future. They want to see you succeed in everything you do, whether it's in the classroom or out.  The curriculum is very clear and is taught very well."
College Sophomore,4,I like my class sizes. I wish there were more professors to teach the same courses for specific majors.
College Sophomore,4,I love PBA! My only problem is that because of its size (which I love) I am forced to take classes with certain professor that I wish I never have to see ever. It's unfortunate because a certain professor has said extremely racist and sexist comments to the girls in the class and will single a few of them out in class and completely tear them down.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe and secure
College Freshman,4,It is a great school!
College Freshman,4,I am trying out for softball this coming Fall and have attended many games and spoke with the coach. Student involvement is great for all sports. Athletic facilities are beautiful and well managed.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't begun classes yet, however everyone I have met through financial aid, orientation, and moving in is incredibly helpful, loving, caring, and Christ-driven. I feel excepted here without even really going here yet. It is a wonderful school with wonderful people and learning experiences."
Recent Alumnus,4,PBA is a safe school. They have Safety and Security Officers that Patrol the perimeter at all times.
Recent Alumnus,4,I absolutely loved living on campus!  I had the best experience living on campus. The RD's and RA's are absolutley wonderful.
Recent Alumnus,4,The Athletic Department is definitely awesome.
College Junior,4,Security patrolls the campus 24/7.
College Junior,4,All around  a great school.
College Freshman,4,The school campus is bright and aesthetically attractive. Classes are typically small so they feel a lot more personal and it's harder to get left behind.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't see drugs or alcohol on campus, but what bothers me is the little off campus spot in the middle of campus where students smoke. That's it's downright disrespectful and annoying. And we know some people have alcohol."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my honors and major classes, but lifetime fitness and general education classes felt more like a waste of time because I didn't learn anything, and I wish these classes had been more challenging."
Sophomore,2,Online does not mix well with PBA. It wasn't the best and I didn't feel like I got the best of an experience nor that I academically did my best with online.
Senior,2,"This score receives a poor rating based on the perspective of a current student. This school throws a student in numerous loops, that inevitably result in the student owing more money. I would recommend exploring other schools. As for, I have been here 6 years with absolutely nothing to show for , aside from maybe a few good working relationships with a few professors.  Save your money, and your time."
Sophomore,2,It’s awful here. It’s boring unless you have a lot of money. The school is very expensive. 🥴🙄🙄🙄🙄
Niche User,2,"As for enrolling as an adult student online, I did not have a good experience. I felt it was very disorganized and the follow up was bad. Which made me question the type of education I would receive and if this was going to be my experience with the professors I encountered for the next few years. It came across that there would have been no support and I would be completely on my own if any questions were to arise. When you are paying a much higher tuition you expect more. I saw it as too much of a money risk and decided not to enroll."
Senior,2,"I regret going to this school. Like the only people who really enjoy this school are vapid invalids. Like if you actually like PBA, you probably have very little brain power. 
If you want to go here you have to be the type of Christian that gives Christianity a bad name. Too many rules and no personal freedom. Propaganda everyday. The beach isn't even that great because it is owned by rich white people. There are no waves and the beach closes at 6.
You can't trust anyone here."
College Sophomore,2,"We literally have two sororities and no fraternities. I thought about joining a sorority but was discouraged because I was told it's time consuming and lots of drama, and ain't nobody got time for that. Personally, I would love,to see Greek life emerge in our campus as a system of community service organizations and ground s of pee who get close over four years. I would like that."
College Freshman,2,"New centers and equipment, but small gym with dress code. Athletics are gaining size but very small."
College Freshman,2,It is not much of a presence on campus. I believe there are a couple sororities but I don't believe we even have fraternities.
College Sophomore,2,"No parties, which is awesome!"
College Junior,2,"Personally, I don't like it because I am a very picky eater. Otherwise, it's not that bad. My favorite is getting flex dollars to use at chickfila!"
College Freshman,2,"Very strict. No guys in girl dorms or girls in guy dorms, only on certain days and they are constantly checking on you. There are a lot of breathalyzer checks on weekends, EVEN IF YOU'RE 21 OR OLDER. It's insane. Oh, and there's curfew for new students..."
College Freshman,2,"There are parties (all of them off campus because nothing is allowed on campus), but all the parties are literally the same people doing the same thing and it gets so boring."
College Freshman,2,The only thing they have for vegetarians and/or vegans is this really gross tofu or old salad. All the other stations give me some serious stomach problems. I don't eat their anymore unless I have to grab a banana or maybe some cereal.
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing is so expensive due to the university being located in downtown. The average is somewhere around $1400.00 per month for a 1-bedroom, and the cost increases when the number of bedroom increases."
College Freshman,2,It is very difficult to receive funding.
College Freshman,2,The Cafeteria offers a small selection of food.
College Junior,2,"I do not normally party, so I do not know where the parties are at on campus. I have heard that Clematis may be a good place to party. I would rather read, however."
College Senior,2,"Sad to say but on campus housing in ridiculously expensive and off-campus housing is even more expensive than that. Because of the school's location alone everything nearby is already expensive. Only well-off students or those who have family and friends in the area or cars to live further away from campus live off-campus. As expected from such high prices, everything is up to par, especially safety and security."
College Senior,2,"I believe that we are all adults and should be treated as such. Transferring from another college and coming to this one was definitely a huge shock when it came to school policies especially those that govern campus housing. In this sense the school is ran like a daycare and some rules interfere with a student's personal endeavors more than is necessary. From forced breathalyzers to R.A. entering the rooms of freshmen at night to make sure they are there, the school goes much too far."
College Freshman,2,It is expensive to live off campus as on campus
College Sophomore,2,"The school is really strict, some times it can be a bit much"
College Sophomore,2,"It can get really annoying, the campus strictness. Sometimes you dont feel like an adult because of the rules implied. Such as visitation in dorms. They should trust that students will make adult decisions and as Christians, have some morals. If not, then that should be our problem, not the school."
College Freshman,2,"I got a boot on the first day of school -_-. On school days it is a little difficult to find parking, but if you buy a garage decal it is easy, and convenient."
College Freshman,2,"I don't really like the Caf. They don't have very many options, their food is very greasy, and they are open at inconvenient hours."
College Sophomore,2,"Tickets are super strict, lots fill up very fast, parking passes are costly, and the need for a car wavers so much (it seems you don't need a car until you need to go to target, want Taco Bell at 2 am, or need to go to the mall to get your computer fixed). "
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall has a horrible smell that definitely sticks with you during the day. We have an okay variety of food but even that gets old after going there so often. We don't always have the healthiest options, and sometimes as being a vegetarian, it can get boring! Flex dollars can be spent at a Chic Fil A and Einsteins, plus an overpriced snack shop and vending machines. The variety again is okay, but it gets old. "
College Sophomore,2,"The school is rapidly acquiring many students--so much that there is not enough parking. They are purchasing some land near the center of campus, so hopefully they turn it into some more parking."
College Sophomore,2,The school doesn't really help you out too much they just send constant messages that you need to do it but don't help you with the process. Financial aid is really up for you and your parents to deal with and figure it all out.
College Freshman,2,"The campus cafeteria is HORRIBLE. The first couple of weeks of school it's delicious, and at orientation-WOW YUMZ! But after those first two weeks, it's quite like eating pig's food. There has been more than one occasion where I or one of my friends have received meat that was so under cooked that it was bleeding. I have a friend who got food poisoning from the under cooked chicken our caf gave her once. I recommend NOT purchasing the all access caf food plan."
College Freshman,2,The South Florida weather is entirely too hot and consists of sporadic torrential rain storms on almost a daily basis.
College Freshman,2,The prices for housing off campus is very expensive and I'm not sure that there is some close to campus. The only good thing is you have more freedom but I'm not sure paying so much a month would be worth it. Within a year the amount you pay total for rent is more than housing on campus. 
College Junior,2,Most of the dorms/apartments need to be redone. I am constantly putting in work orders because the buildings are so old. 
College Junior,2,"We just had a very large incoming freshman class and yet the campus did not add any parking. It's almost always a nightmare. Once you have a parking spot, you don't move the whole day for fear you will not be able to find another one. "
College Junior,2,"I rarely eat at the cafeteria, and when I do I always eat the same thing because it is the safest. They really need to redo the cafeteria in general, because there are not many options. "
College Junior,2,"there are not that many study areas, the curriculum and professors are helpful"
College Junior,2,"there is not much transportation help, since the school is so small. you either are on campus or commute, theres no transportation to help, really"
College Junior,2,"pba is relatively small, and the surrounding area is expensive"
College Junior,2,"there are not that many options on campus, and they are pretty pricy"
College Junior,2,the local weather is always windy and rains quite often
College Junior,2,"there is access at the library, but theres not always computers avaliable"
College Junior,2,there are limited amount of majors
College Junior,2,"not too many parties within walking distance, but relatively close in Cityplace and others alike"
College Senior,2,"The academic building and the library is beautiful. However, the on campus housing needs some serious rennovating."
College Senior,2,"West Palm Beach is a very interesting place. It is either getto or rich, making finding an apartment either to expensive or dangerous. To get a decent priced apartment in a decent area, you would have a 20-30 minute commute to school."
College Junior,2,computers are available in the Library. Internet speed is horrible. Wifi is super slowwwwww!
College Junior,2,Professors here expect you to know your stuff and self teach. Most professors think you are fresh out of high school which is great if you are. But some of us are returning students and have a hard time acclimating. Also free tutoring sucks!
College Junior,2,"other than school location, which is by the beach. The school is very old and it's falling apart. Bathroom doors are super rusty, laboratory ceilings are constantly leaking, and sometimes classrooms have to be closed out due to mole!! But the chapel, which is mandatory for all students, looks amazing!!"
College Freshman,2,"Pro: close to campus

Con: rooms are old, cracked walls

Cost about the same as on campus

Security not as secure compared to on campus"
College Freshman,2,HOT  HOT HOT HOT! But there is a beach so it makes it all better!!!
College Freshman,2,"There is nightlife right down the street, but the majority of it is for students 21 and over.  For students under 21 there is plenty to do, but it is costly."
College Senior,2,"So Many Rules! The dorms at PBA have way too many rules.  There are curfews and people only allowed over for a couple of hours one day a week.  After you go to college you should have freedom, not stricter rules than your parents."
College Sophomore,2,"No Space – There is plenty of parking but it is very hard to get the spot you want. You are assigned to a certain area and you have to park in that area whether it is the garage, or the various lots around campus. Yes there is a lot of parking but spaces fill up quickly. Most of the people don't use there cars until the weekend so if you go out during the week be prepared for a not so good spot when you come back."
College Sophomore,2,Punishments Are Tough According to the Violation – I have not had any experience with school punishment but I know that my school has no tolerance for drugs or alcohol. The campus police with stop people randomly as they are walking back to their apartments at night and use a breathalyzer on them.
College Senior,2,Below Average – Everything from the Athletic department to the student support is below average compared to other school. Some teams are good but most teams play off campus so it is hard for students to attend. I had more support at my high school games. If i were a serious athlete I wouldn't attend this school.
College Junior,2,"Apartments Are Costly – The university apartments are available, but not space is limited.The apartment facility is old and not worth the money. The off campus housing are very expensive and not numerous. The only affordable housing off campus are located in near by houses,but there are not a lot of availability."
College Senior,2,"As a student, you are required to attend 12 chapels per semester. This is not a choice, which will be proved after you are penalized $40/chapel you miss. I would like to make it seem more interesting by calling it ""indoctrination,"" but that would entail some depth to it. No, here you will get a weakly brewed pot of watered down Sunday school preaching from the official PBA pastor, Bernie. He relates to you the way a lawyer speaks to a 4 year old. Nothing interesting or deep, no moral support for the tumultuous issues going on in the stressful life of a full time student with a full time job... just some poorly strewn together notes on a napkin about what he's done that morning that might amount to something religious he can feed us. 

Don't get me wrong, there is the occasional GOOD soeaker, but when none are available, the default is Bernie. Again, this is not a choice you get to make - you MUST attend in order to avoid the financial punishment. 

What if you are Catholic and the loud and in your face rock music isn't for you? There is a Catholic chapel one Friday a month. If you can make it and don't have a pressing test or assignment due, you can avoid Pastor Bernie and the nerve racking Evangelicals and somewhat enjoy a break from the chaos."
College Sophomore,2,PBAU parking is very limited. Even though I live on campus and do not have a car I still hear other people say if they are not here early finding a parking spot takes forever!
College Freshman,2,"Not That Diverse but Mostly Accepting – Mostly white people on campus, though the school is clearly trying to change that. There are people of other races here, and from different countries, and they're treated pretty much like everyone else. There's just not many of them, and it's obvious. Most people are identified as Christians, which makes sense, though there are atheists as well as people of other religions."
College Sophomore,2,"I havent began my courses for my selected major yet but the workload in general is hard and the curriculum is pretty tough. Being in West Palm Beach, there are plenty of internship oppurtunities and the facilities are very nice."
College Senior,2,"Could Be Better. I live on campus and this will be my third year without a car. A car is convenient but not absolutely necessary. The parking can be atrocious because PBA is a small campus with much of the parking reserved for commuters and professors. The parking garage guarantees a spot, but at a hefty fee."
Senior,1,"Just spend a few minutes researching the quality of professors at the school and you'll get a pretty good impression of why you've made the mistake of even considering this school... Low quality professors, nearly ALL there just because of the location and money results in low quality education for the students who (to be honest) aren't really here to learn- this school is mostly just used as a safe house for christian parents whose sons and daughters couldn't get into a legitimate school. Job prospects are nonexistent unless you're a nursing student (but that's a constant no matter which school you go to so why not go to a cheaper school?);No company lauds about the student who graduates from  PBAU...."
Sophomore,1,"Unless you are a devoted christian/missionary, please do not come here. It hurts that I have thrown away two years of my college experience all for athletics. I would have preferred to go to any other school from my view point now and it is now one of my biggest regrets choosing to come to this school and staying for not only one year but two. Professors are less qualified than my AP high school teachers and religion on the campus forces students into an insensitive and unaccepting culture. These college years are meant for creating memories, friendships, connections, and expanding your knowledge. I can confidently say that PBA lacked in all of these areas. I am a normal student who wants to learn and hang out with friends and party. Although clematis was fun, it is not even remotely close to a normal college experience. Please listen to my advice and don't waste your time here. I played lacrosse here and almost all of the athletes say they wish they wouldn't have came here."
Freshman,1,The absolute worst decision i've ever made.  If you want to sit and do absolutely nothing every single day of your life come here! Nobody is friendly and they will start middle school drama just for fun since there's nothing else to do.  The surrounding area is unsafe and nobody goes out. If you get caught with alcohol they make you sit in a class about being an alcoholic and they fine you. Definitely not a college feels more like a church jail.
Junior,1,"You are paying for the location. Teachers are a joke(They just read off powerpoints), student body Is weird homeschooled kids, small campus, you have a curfew, you have RAs who are nosey and go through your personal belongings, the religious aspect is a front and is not honored in the times that matter; had a boy take advantage of me on campus and when I spoke out to the school instead of punishing the athlete, they tried to kick me out of school because I had proof and it would affect their image; there was 100% no consequences for the boys actions. Food is terrible,clicky student body, Any event they hold on campus is a joke and obvious they didn’t put any effort into. The only plus I have from my three years experience at this school is the location."
Alum,1,The absolute worse college I could of experienced. The teachers are absolutely horrible and hypocritical “Christians “.
Alum,1,"Ok here's the deal.  This is a church school.  It's unofficial ""bent"" is evangelical, conservative Southern Baptist.  If you even think you might be gay, I would jump off a bridge before coming here.  Homosexuality is an absolute no-no and they have zero interest in dealing with this issue.  I repeat, if you are attracted to guys, coming here will not help and will actually cause  you great emotional and spiritual harm.  (I say all this because this school seems to attract more than its fair share of closeted gay guys trapped in their family's evangelicalism and they think they can come here and be cured - it absolutely will not cannot ever ever happen - you are gay, there is nothing you can do about it, it is who you are, God made you exactly that way, so better start dealing with it like millions of others before you.)   Lots of rules and there are seniors here who have become so expert at breaking the rules, they make Jason Bourne look like an amateur."
Freshman,1,"Do not come to this school. No one even goes to the beach.  This place is full of boring, weird, strict people.  70% of incoming freshman transfer after first semester.  I thought this would be fun because it is close to the beach but no one even goes anywhere.  Very boring place.  Only come here if you want to become a pastor or a missionary because everyone here is majoring in pastoral ministries."
Niche User,1,No Diversity at all and horrible business school. I felt so outof place and there are alot of immature kids that go to the school. The fact that they accept anyone is kind of scary because that means any bad student and get in. Since the school is in Florida alot of kids are going to want to go there to party and not concentrate on there profession. If you are a serious business student that wants to concentrate on making connections go to any other better school
Niche User,1,"PBAU is the worst place to go if you want an ethnically diverse environment! Coming from someone of color it was hard to ""fit it"" with the people there. 9 times out of 10 it was hard leaving my dorm due to the fear of being judged or looked at differently."
Alum,1,"I will start by saying the only thing that is positive about this school is that some of the professors are brilliant and they know how to challenge their students. Downfalls are cliquish, expensive, unorganized, incompetent, uninformative, unaccountable, and is the least Christian faith-based college I have attended. If you want your college experience to be full of unnecessary issues, then this is the school for you. Otherwise, I would run from this school and never look back."
College Freshman,1,No greek life on campus besides religious based soroities
College Freshman,1,We dont have greek life.
College Freshman,1,We don't have one? I have no clue.
College Freshman,1,"Don't come here to get drunk, come here to get an education."
College Junior,1,"There is literally nothing around us, which is odd because we live smack dab in the middle of the city. I have to drive to Taco Bell for those late night snacks. There is a Chick Fil A on campus, which is a major plus. But the other on campus dining, Einstein's, is absolutely terrible and expensive. I wish there were more dining options around campus."
College Junior,1,We do not have a Greek life.
College Junior,1,there is no greek life
College Sophomore,1,There isnt really much that goes on during the nightlife such as parties go
College Sophomore,1,"I don't think it's even fair to say that we have a ""Greek life"".  We have maybe two sorority sand no fraternity's. Basically anyone who wants to join can. Most people on campus are not even aware that there is a Greek life, the two sororities never really do anything. "
College Freshman,1,OMG florida weather. BIPOLAR is the only explanation needed here.

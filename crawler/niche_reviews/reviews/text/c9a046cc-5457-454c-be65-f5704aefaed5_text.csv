Freshman,5,Bradley was very good at transitioning to online learning to accommodate for the safety of their students.
Freshman,5,"Faculty and Staff are always smiling and willing to help in any way possible. From professors to janitors, they always put students first."
Senior,5,I have found my best friends at Bradley and have been accepted after changing majors. I love Bradley.
Freshman,5,"I like the small campus atmosphere and one-on-one assistance with professors.  The campus classrooms are all centrally located and easy to get to.  I like the camaraderie with my classmates, dorm mates and other students.  I think the classes are challenging, innovating and provide a great base for my future endeavors."
Freshman,5,"Bradley is the perfect size and really offers a lifestyle for everyone. Everyone is really welcoming and you really get a sense of community here. Although there’s not much to do in Peoria, I don’t have a car so I pretty much stay on campus. Which can get boring but it keeps me from spending money. Definitely recommend getting involved in any organization once you’re a freshman so you don’t feel as lost (even though it’s a small school) being part of a group keeps you busy and helps you not be as homesick. Overall, I’m satisfied with my decision to come here, especially since they offered so many scholarships."
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit, the school was extremely welcoming and made it feel like home to me the minute I stepped foot on campus."
Freshman,5,"Bradley University has been amazing for me during my time here. The classes are challenging, but are taught by professors that are knowledgeable and more than willing to help. Professors all have office hours and are willing to meet you outside of them if need be. There are tons of clubs and extra-curriculars to be a part of as well. The food on campus is also usually very good."
Freshman,5,"A really nice place, years of history and helping students to grow as a person. Since the opening of the school was to help other to  have a future. A great place to have friends that with be with for  years and help you while in college."
Freshman,5,"Tons of clubs and activities. The buildings are nice, and the professors are good. When it rains, the campus floods."
Niche User,5,"I really like the small campus, while having Peoria nearby. Everyone is very nice and the campus has nice safety features."
Graduate Student,5,"I chose Bradley due to its ranking, history and alumni. Bradley reminds me of a baby Stanford University; similar beginning as well as heavy emphasis on academic rigor.  I hope that I find myself in a position to be a donor in the future."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at Bradley University is so nice and welcoming! I never felt out of place and I have always felt included. The students here are very outgoing as are the teachers. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and although it is pretty much in the heart of Peoria, there is a very ""small-town"" feel to the campus. I love Bradley and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to call a four year university their home!"
Niche User,5,"Bradley is a welcoming college campus I first time visit the campus when I was going into my sophomore year of high school. The campus and people made the visit so welcoming I felt like I had already been a student, the community around the campus is so positive. I applied and I got into the nursing program it has been my number one school for the past two years. I am so honored to have gotten into such a great community and school that will provide me with the proper skills to pursuing my nursing career."
Niche User,5,I thought the campus was very nice. Even though I visited on a very rainy and droopy day the campus stood out as very welcoming and energetic. Their new engineering building is also very nice. It is equip with up to date machines and technology to give its students the best possible experience.
Alum,5,"Although Bradley was extremely expensive, I honestly see why it was worth it! The professors are top of the line, and most have doctorate degrees; the campus is safe, beautiful, and the dorms are comfortable. I loved the individualized attentiveness of the professors--most classes had 20-35 students in them--versus mostly lecture halls with 200+, so you are not just a number, and there is more student/teacher interactions personally."
Freshman,5,"Bradley University is overall a wonderful school. If you are looking for a school that will give you personal connections with professors, wonderful resources, great internship opportunities, and is a mid-sized university then I extremely encourage you to consider Bradley. There are so many resources here to help each student succeed. I personally am in the Psychology program here at Bradley, and it is an absolutely awesome Department. Professors allow you to work with them in their personal study labs and encourage you to truly succeed here in the Psychology program. The Department of Psychology is one of many departments on campus that are filled with wonderful people."
Niche User,5,"I really loved my visit on campus and with the professors and admissions counselors! The Tour guide, Jason was amazing and really made it seem like a great place to be. it was one of two that I visited and that I felt totally comfortable in!"
Freshman,5,"Oh, the joys of a new start. Bradley is an excellent place to find your niche as everyone is so welcoming and inclusive. Finding friends is easy, finding any club or activity is easy, and although the classes may not be the easiest, a good education and hard work here at Bradley will get you far for your future."
Niche User,5,I recently went on a visit day and it was wonderful. Someone was so nice. It was very informative. We even got to see students work.
Sophomore,5,"Bradley University was my last choice for college. I decided to attend a visit day, and as soon as I got on campus I fell in love. Bradley offers a unique experience, and a good staff to student relationship. I am close with a few professors from my freshman year, all of whom remember my face and check up on me when they see me."
Junior,5,"Bradley University is a great school for academics and not much else. Located in Peoria, IL; the Bradley campus itself seems as if it is secluded from the rest of Peoria. This is great for students and faculty but does not give much to do on the weekends."
Sophomore,5,"Bradley has a great program for Mechanical Engineering. The only problem is that you need to be careful what you choose for your schedule, for all professors are held in high regard but some are a little better at others at teaching."
Freshman,5,Bradley is an amazing school so far! Everybody is extremely welcoming and it truly a home away from home!
Freshman,5,"So far, so good! 
Going into my freshman and I already feel so welcomed by everyone there. They truly make you feel at home!"
Sophomore,5,"Bradley University is a great school. The Professors are great teachers and take a real interest in their student's education. The campus is condensed, so it is really easy to get to class on the really cold days when you just want to be inside."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Bradley! From study abroad to internships to hands-on experience in the classrooms, I made so many great friends and connections to prepare me for life after college."
Graduate Student,5,The processing getting into the school was long but enjoyable. My admission counselor is more than amazing. The entire staff is great. The online class format is easy to follow.
Sophomore,5,"I'm very lucky to attend a school that gives their all to the students. In each class, the teacher knows my name and gives me as much help as I need."
Freshman,5,"Bradley is a nice mid size college. I like how the class sizes are small and allows you to interact with your teacher and not in a lecture hall with 100 other people. One thing that needs to he improved is the wifi. In most buildings the wifi BUsecure doesn't even connect. Because BUsecure doesn't work, I usually use BU guest. But even then the wifi might not work. They are working on fixing it and should be good soon. Overall it is a good school."
Senior,5,"I am in my last year at Bradley University, and I have had a wonderful experience here. Most of the professors are great - they are engaging, kind, supportive, and caring. Sure, there are a few professors who do not fit this profile, but they are far and few between! There are so many ways to get involved on campus, and the student body, at 4,500 undergraduates, is a great size.  While the price tag may seem high, the financial aid department does a wonderful job of meeting needs."
Sophomore,5,Bradley University has always felt like a safe space. My professors work hard to get to know me and are always knowledgeable about the materials at hand. My professors also work their best to make sure they are available whenever possible as to help students even further. The only thing I would like to see change would be the price to attend but even with that they offer tons of scholarships based on merit.
Niche User,5,"It's a great combination of a personalized, private university focused on undergraduates with the programs and options you find at schools a little larger like an engineering school, a nursing program, Division 1 sports, a Graduate School, and 5,400 students."
Senior,5,"Bradley university is a tight knit school and the professors are wonderful. Every single advisor I have had have helped me through my time! Despite my everyday struggles with life, Bradley University has made it a little less hard to maintatin academic excellence."
Junior,5,Bradley's nursing program is amazing. I really feel that the professors want my to succeed. There are so many resources at Bradley it makes it hard to fail.
Sophomore,5,One of the best experiences that I have had at Bradley is small class sizes and individual attention from instructors.  The small class sizes allow me to get answers to questions easily.
Graduate Student,5,I have not yet started taking classes at Bradley.  The admission process was clear. The admissions  counselor was available and helpful every step of the way.  she really seemed to care that the whole process was as easy as possible.
Sophomore,5,"Bradley University was a nice, well rounded university where everyone enjoyed others company. Everyone is nice and the campus is great to involve in your adult life."
Freshman,5,I like the wide variety of opportunities Bradley has to offer as well as the safety and security the campus has available. Not only will you have a one on one connection with counselors but you have people that continue to push you to better yourself as a student. Bradley University truly wants to ensure success in their students as well as push their students to do the best they can do.
Sophomore,5,"I really love how small and intimate Bradley campus is. I have had the best relationships with my professors and their goal is to truly help their students succeed. Also, while living on campus at University Hall, I had the best experiences! I would recommend any student to apply to Bradley University!"
Sophomore,5,I am currently writing this review from the standpoint of a returning sophomore and I can honestly say that throughout the entire school year of 2017-2018 I was engulfed in the Bradley lifestyle where I was treated like family! I adore the majority of the professors and the passion for their work the instill upon their students.
Freshman,5,"The people at Bradley treat you like family as soon as you step on campus. The campus is gorgeous and the perfect size. The mid sized university gives you 1 on 1 learning and big opportunities. I have seen schools with newer and bigger dorms, but they are still pretty good! Bradley is the perfect school for me, and could be for you too! With only 5400 students and an eight minute walk from one side of campus to the other everyone gets to know each other. They have an amazing gym with a salt water pool and a rock climbing wall."
Freshman,5,Bradley is a great small community for students. I have visited campus a few times and it has been a very welcoming experience. Staff and students were very nice and answered questions. When communicating with staff they reply quickly and are eager to assist.
Graduate Student,5,Wonderful academics and easy to get in touch with the professors.  The local area has great restaurants and lots of activities to offer.  I enjoy the the capability of using online classes and it makes easy to advance my degree.  The advisors make it easy for you to reach them when you need to.
Alum,5,"Bradley provided me the education to excel in life. I was able to get a very well paying ME job thanks to my grades and my degree saying Bradley on it. Bradley is definitely the place to go for a mechanical engineering degree, hands down. 26th in the country? yes please."
Sophomore,5,"Bradley University is an awesome mid-sized university -- with all the resources of a larger school, but the personalized attention of a small school. I chose Bradley University knowing it would be an environment that would challenge me, but simultaneously allow me to thrive -- and that's exactly what it has done in my short time here. I have access to well-qualified professors that care, and a wide range of opportunities that they are more than happy and willingly to help me pursue."
Sophomore,5,"As a transfer student, Bradley has been so accommodating, helpful, and welcoming. I feel at home on this campus due to the excitement I have towards my major, courses, and the campus groups I have become a part of. I always feel encouraged at Bradley and am so happy I found my way here."
Sophomore,5,"Bradley University has so much to offer, the students and faculty allow you to grow as a person and as a student. I was able to get the full experience of a small school campus with big school opportunities"
Sophomore,5,One thing I really like about Bradley University is it's small class sizes. Some of my classes in college are smaller than classes I took in high school. Because of that I am able to have one on one help from my professors themselves- not their TA or their grad student. I also feel like i'm able to focus better in classrooms with 20-25 classmates instead of large auditoriums with 200+ students in them.
Sophomore,5,Bradley University is a unique place to go to school! Everyone here is welcoming and the campus has a great environment!
Freshman,5,"As a freshman I've grown to love this school. The professors care alot about the student's learning experience and are always willing to answer questions. A major part of the campus is greek life and i highly recommend joining a fraternity/sorority because you definitely don't want to stay in the dorms. The campus food is okay. Also, if you're looking for a school with outstanding athletics youre Coming to the wrong school."
Niche User,5,"They had everything, such as the Newman Center, Saint Mark's Church, Greek Life, 2 quad areas, and great dinning halls. The best part is that they have an awesome education program where I would be able to start it as a freshman and work in the Elementary schools right away with over 100 hours in the classroom. After the 4 years, I would be directed on the right path towards the career path that I am interested in. I didn't find anything that needed improvements and am so excited to start school in the fall of 2018!"
Freshman,5,I could not be happier about my choice to attend Bradley! Most faculty genuinely want their students to succeed. The academic environment is always very friendly and uplifting. I love that Bradley has its own police department; I never feel unsafe on campus.
Sophomore,5,Bradley University is the perfect sized school with a close community filled with people who want to help you succeed. Professors care about each individual and it's a very personal experience going here.
Freshman,5,"To be honest Bradley University was never really on my list of colleges I wanted to attened But, they were the ones who gave me the most financial aid so I chose Bradley. After being here, I glad im made this decision because Bradley has such an inviting community and a diverse campus. Also classes here are pretty small and the professors here are amazing because they want you to succeed and will help you out in anyway possible. Finally, Bradley always have events going on 24/7 so there is always something to do and not get bored."
Senior,5,I transferred to bradley to be closer to home. It was the best decision of my life. I found the perfect major and have a great advisor. I have made friendships that will last me awhile.
Junior,5,"Bradley University
I like Bradley University because I am able to commute easily to and from campus. The campus is not overly large and I feel I am able to communicate with other students and faculty on first name basis. The area surrounding the school offers plenty of options for nightlife, food and shopping. The campus is generally pretty safe, offering emergency buttons and hotlines for free rides around campus or requesting a person to walk with you when needed. The surrounding city further from campus also offers plenty to do. The Riverfront holds many activities during the summer and fall. Most of the faculty are also involved in the community which is nice."
Freshman,5,Bradley University is an overall great school. The campus is in a great location and most of the restaurants are within walking distance. The professors are helpful and informative to prospective students. The engineering program is excellent and allows for students to work on real world issues.
Freshman,5,Bradley University if a perfect school.  It is a medium-sized university making it easy to get to know your professors well.  The Alumni at Bradley are very involved with and supportive of the students.  The social life at Bradley is fun and exciting with many opportunities to become involved.  It is my home away from home!
Freshman,5,I love the campus and how everyone is so nice.  The staff is really good about helping and being there to answer any questions you might have.  The food and amenities on campus are awesome. The recreation center is really awesome.
Freshman,5,"Bradley gets less credit than it deserves, I can't believe how involved this school is with your life and what goes on with you. Teachers care. It's been one semester and I already have formed amazing relationships with teachers. You will find your people here, I promise."
Graduate Student,4,It is a very diverse community that does its best to include everyone. There is always something to do besides academics. The facilities have impressive equipment for all types of degrees. The professors are great and do their best to aid students.
Graduate Student,4,Professors do their best to teach over online. The university has invested in new technology to help aid students such as virtual machine and sites.
Senior,4,"I love the small campus size about Bradley, it offers a home away from home feel for me even though I am a commuter. There are a plethora of inclusive activities and clubs, that are easily accessible and involve many fun adventures. I do not think I would have gotten the same opportunities anywhere other than Bradley! If you are unsure about it, just go for it I have made tons of friends and connections the past three years here!"
Sophomore,4,"It was difficult at first having online classes due to the virus, but the professors were very adaptable and it was a learning process for everyone involved."
Sophomore,4,My freshman year of college was an interesting one. The community on campus is a very pleasant one and the overall environment is gorgeous. I always felt safe on campus and living in the dorms was fun. The only thing I would change about the campus is the available food option. I'd like a little more variety.
Freshman,4,The campus is a nice size. It is not big. It is a very cozy and warm atmosphere. The staff is great and they really want to help you grow.
Freshman,4,"Bradley is overall a good school. The campus is a good size and located by useful stores. Most of the professors have the students' best interests at heart. Bradley has a clean campus, but the food could improve a little. Advisors could be a little more helpful to the students. Good private school for those who want a private university. Sports are very good at Bradley. They try to work with their students for the most part. The cost is a little high, but there are ways where they work with you to help."
Junior,4,High promise of career outcomes and internships. Places to eat are closed too often and give little variety. It's secure on campus but unsafe surroundings.
Junior,4,Overall Bradley is a great school. I love it there even though there are some flaws. They try to make it about academics more than sports which I appreciate.  This school tries to focus on its students.
Sophomore,4,"Bradley University has offered me a lot of wonderful connections through my professors, advisers, and other students. The passion that many of these professors have in their field of study is very helpful in wanting to attend classes and staying motivated."
Freshman,4,I like the small campus and small class sizes. The small campus gave transitioning to college a seamlessly easy feeling and was not too overwhelming like many larger schools may have been. The small class sizes allow teachers to be more connected to their students and allows for more one on one time and other personal interactions. The only thing that I can think of about changing would have to be the cost but that can be said about 99 percent of colleges in the United States.
Freshman,4,"I like all my professors and my major, Animation. The Slane School of Communications and Fine Arts is excellent and even has by second choice for a major, Sports Communication. I like the size of the school - about 5,000, the food is good, and I've met some cool people!"
Freshman,4,"Once I arrived during orientation, the staff and student aids were very welcoming, registration for classes was pretty easy, and they were good at getting the student accustomed to the campus and it's opportunities. So far my classes have been relatively easy but, someone who wasn't in any art programs/extracurriculars may find the classes/assignments challenging, but not impossible to complete. The professors are extremely understanding and willing to help a student through and issues. There is a diversity issue on campus but I have yet to feel any discrimination against me based on race or any other factor. There is an Office of Diversity and Inclusion that focuses on making all types of minority students feel more welcome. The food on campus could be improved. I wish there was more consistency in quality and a more diverse menu to make people from every type of household feel less homesick."
Freshman,4,"Don't listen to a lot of these reviews. There is WiFi, but it isn't the best. The campus itself is very safe, but, remember, you'll be near Peoria so exercise additional caution at night. There are some really bad teachers, but they represent the minority here. You can SIGNIFICANTLY cut out costs by joining a fraternity by up to $7,000 a year. It's possible to party here, but you gotta be smart. The university does crack down, but they're not very good at busting parties. The academics here are really good, though Sakai really sucks. Fraternity culture is simply wonderful. If you're looking to become more social, join one! The university dorms are decent, but fraternity houses are much better. I was surprised by the food at the university. Not gourmet, but definitely pay for the same quality at a higher end hotel. The campus, especially during fall, is beautiful. Overall, your experience is highly dictated by how dependent and smart you are with your time."
Freshman,4,"It is a very good university,  everyone is extremely friendly. Small classes with teachers who are invested in you. However, it is expensive and it seems like they enjoy taking money for the simplest things."
Niche User,4,The staff and students at Bradley are very welcoming and want to be a successful student. Bradley gives you that small sized school feel but has several chance to join clubs and other no school related activities.
Senior,4,Bradley is a wonderful private  school for student who are looking to better their future. Classes are small and very challenging and recently it was voted as the #1 school in the country for providing jobs after college
Sophomore,4,Bradley University is a close knit community with excellent staff and faculty. Professors are very good at their job and are able to have one on one time for each of their students as needed.
Sophomore,4,"For a mid-sized school, this university has everything you want. Greek life, tons of student-led clubs, small class sizes, friendly professors, and competitive sports teams. Dining hall food is either hit or miss, but there is always something good at the Student Center. The campus is also nice and small, so a walk to class from the dorms is no more than five minutes. The only downside is the area surrounding the school."
Sophomore,4,The professors at Bradley University hold each one of their students to a high level. The academic success of students is tremendous. It is easy to get involved since there are over 200 clubs. I wish there were more on campus activities.
Sophomore,4,I like the student to staff ratio. I can easily connect with professors. Campus is large enough but also quick to get to classes in a timely manner. Lots of food options compared to other small school. Dorms need to be updated and maybe even add another residence hall with another dining hall. Staff at Bradley do want to help you further your knowledge and help you succeed. Not the best school to go to for watching athletics for fun since some sports fields and courts are out of the way of campus.
Sophomore,4,I love the teachers in my major so far.  Its a good school but its hard to find internships and the career office isnt that helpful with that. The professors in the Business school are very nice and if you get to know them they are very helpful. You meet a lot of people with similar intrest and you can make lots of friends. I feel like the school makes you take some random classes but its not terible but I'm not personally a fan of taking unnecessary classes.
Junior,4,This is a small tight-knit community that provides ample opportunities for success.  Bradley is a surprise around every single corner. It constantly leads you towards a  full college life of academics and community.
Freshman,4,"It's been pretty good here. The campus is a great size, and the staff is very friendly. The dining hall food is subpar, but at least we have Moe's."
Niche User,4,"It has a great sized campus, and a lot of good opportunities outside of classes. I was able to learn a ton about programs, and it made preparing for college a much clearer experience."
Sophomore,4,"I dislike the location of the school, but the school is top notch. They are very helpful with enrollment and questions about majors. They are also very helpful to those who need help with exams and extra help in the classroom such as myself. The smaller student to teacher ratio is also very helpful, most professors will really learn your names and work on helping their students as much as they can."
Sophomore,4,I transferred to Bradley this year and everything is great so far. The only thing that I would change is I believe that the school should do more to help students find scholarships.
Alum,4,They are very welcoming and the campus is up to date and well kept. I enjoyed the atmosphere. The students and professors all have a desire to be there and be part of everyday life.
Junior,4,It is a pretty good school with very good academic advisors and I thoroughly enjoyed and I am still enjoying my experience here.
Sophomore,4,Bradley has a great campus located near both downtown Peoria and the shopping centers and malls. The buildings are all pretty up to date and the faculty are all very welcoming and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"Bradley University is a great 4 year university to attend. The campus is beautiful, the student body is diverse, and the staff and faculty are helpful and engaging towards a student's success and well being."
Sophomore,4,"Bradley University is an extremely welcoming environment. All of my friends and professors are extremely supportive of me and each other, and I'm really proud to call Bradley my home."
Sophomore,4,Things I like about Bradley is the activities that they have. The fact that they have a lot of organizations gives students the chance to meet other students. I would like for there to be more diversity and more chances for the minority groups to be as dominant as the “superior” group.
Sophomore,4,"During my first year at Bradley University, I appreciated how the University not only expressed their interest in diversity but their extra effort in showing students what the definition of 'inclusion' is."
Senior,4,"Bradley, being a smaller school than a state school, allows students the opportunity to more easily connect with professors in a meaningful way. A mentor or an adviser can easily be found in any of the halls at Bradley. Additionally, getting personalized help from more bureaucratic departments like finances or class registration is easier and more productive for a student just starting to understand how to be assertive (since we all know adulting is hard). It does not lack opportunities to participate in activities and clubs and grow despite being a smaller school. Because of this, Bradley is an engaging school with a  lot of benefits!"
Freshman,4,"Bradley is an excellent choice for students looking for a mid-size private school. Its business, engineering, and nursing schools are regionally renowned and campus culture is close and connected. Beautiful campus with excellent professors and small class sizes."
Niche User,4,Bradley is a very beautiful college. I am lucky I get to go there this fall to further my education.
Sophomore,4,"Bradley so far has been a great university small private school and very accessible. Have met great friends here, but does get boring at times because if you want to get out of campus you do have to drive. People here are very nice and a lot of people know each other another good reason to attend Bradley. Being a minority here at Bradley can be an issue at times especially since it is a predominantly white institution, but you get to know the minority population here very well and are treated like family and we have a great diversity building here called the Office of Diversity and Inclusion who helps a lot with events to get to know each other."
Alum,4,"Bradley has small class sizes which allow for plenty of one-on-one time with teachers and students. Teachers take a personal interest in students and it shows that they want all of their students to succeed. There are a lot of resources available (education, outside involvement, internships, career, etc.) if you have the drive to take advantage of them."
Senior,4,"I loved the small feeling of Bradley's campus, it felt special to know almost anyone I passed around campus. I do think that Bradley could put more effort into focusing on the growing number of students and their needs."
Freshman,4,"Bradley has a beautiful campus with new buildings being built this year.  The campus is small, and you can easily walk from one side of campus to the other in under 5 minutes.  The art teachers have been amazing teachers and resources."
Graduate Student,4,"I am an online student in the FNP NP program. I love the professor and schools seeming effort at ensuring the online students recieve as close to an in-the-classroom feel as possible. The due dates and style of writing from class to class is very similar and the professors respond quickly to questions.
I am not fully on board with their spacing of classes for full-time students as it seems slow in some semesters and too much work in others."
Junior,4,"Bradley University is a great school. It is like its own little community. Being from a small town, it has a similar feeling as living in a small town. Always seeing someone you know."
Freshman,4,I really like the small class size and everyone is very friendly.  It had a family feel to it.  The instructors know you by name and you are not just a number.
Freshman,4,"I love the environment at Bradley! The campus is beautiful and it is easy to feel at home. Roaming off campus can feel risky however. The ""Bradley Bubble"" makes it easy to not leave, but I encourage you to experience the rest of Peoria with friends. The dorms are great (except Wyckoff) and the Student Center is a life saver. It's easy to meet new people and make friends with the social activities planned within the first few days of arriving on campus. Getting involved in a sorority was a really good idea for me personally and I think students should at least try rushing. I met my closest friends in my sorority and I do not regret joining my house. I recommend meeting your roommate on the sights they provide, my experience with random roommates was not great. Get involved quickly, it will make it much easier to make friends and keep them. Bradley is an amazing place full of amazing people and amazing professors."
Freshman,4,Currently enrolled at Bradley in my first semester.  Challenging but the instructor are supportive.  Movies ever Saturday night.
Junior,4,"Bradley is a good engineering school that is very challenging. It is hard work, but it pays off at the end."
Niche User,4,"Bradley University, in Peoria Illinois, is a remarkable place; it is a town college, so it is near different stores and restaurants. There are many activities on campus to ensure a student's enjoyment. Although it is a mid-sized school, it still has the family, close feel compared to other universities I have visited. I high suggest visiting the campus, not only because it is my first choice for education, but to experience what Bradley and Peoria have to offer."
Freshman,4,"Bradley University is a great college because of its many great characteristics. One of its big selling points is that it is a mid-sized school. This is an advantage because it has a lot of the opportunities that a larger school would have as well as the opportunities a smaller school would have. There are not many places where one can have both kinds of opportunities at one school.
Even though Bradley University is considered a more expensive school compared to other school surrounding Illinois, Bradley is a private school which means that it can award larger amount of scholarship money and grants.
So far I am truly impressed by all of the wonderful opportunities I have had at Bradley University. All of my professors are truly amazing and devoted to helping their students understand their curriculum and teachings.
Whether a prospective student wants to study the arts, nursing, STEM, or anything in between, Bradley University is a great place to further one's knowledge and education."
Senior,4,"I liked my major. I think some of the general education classes were just time-fillers, but overall I love the Bradley community and love the professors in my major area."
Sophomore,4,The main thing that I enjoy most about Bradley University is that I am comfortable enough to be thoroughly involved on campus while still keeping up with my studies.
Junior,4,"A small, friendly campus.  Because of its size, it feels like a close-knit community, but there are fewer opportunities than they offer at larger state schools."
Sophomore,4,"Bradley is an amazing school with an amazing nursing program. There are so many opportunities to succeed on this campus, for any major, and so many resources to take all of that success into your career."
College Sophomore,4,Most teachers get to know students. Many course options.
College Sophomore,4,"It is fantastic, the majority of people I know in my major have had incredible internship opportunities and no problems finding a job upon graduating"
College Sophomore,4,"Our health services center SUCKS. Not sure if thats even related to this question but it does. I feel pretty safe around campus, the popo are always around"
College Sophomore,4,"I only lived in the dorms for one semester before moving into my sorority house, but I liked it. The dorm sizes were decent and it was a fun community to live in. The laundry machines were almost always broken, though."
College Sophomore,4,"It really depends on the teacher, some are incredible, passionate and so helpful, and others are uninterested, unhelpful and hardly speak english. Fortunately, the majority are the former."
College Sophomore,4,"The workload depends almost entirely on your major. Business and sports communication majors have a significantly less workload than an engineering or computer information systems student. When it's nice out, studying outside is comfortable. The class registration process is finicky though, since class sizes are limited and may not accommodate every student that needs to take the class."
College Sophomore,4,Drug and alcohol safety is enforced quite heavily here at Bradley. The rules are enforced for everyone's safety and in a way that still allows people to have fun; the rules are not there to simply restrict students from doing what they want to do.
Freshman,2,"I attended Bradley my freshman year as an engineering student and decided to transfer after an overall lacking experience. The academics in general I felt were very underwhelming and unprofessional. One thing worth mentioning specifically is that the university recommended to me, as well as many other students, to take physics at another school and transfer the credits as Bradley's department is VERY bad. There are good professors here but sometimes the good can't cancel out the bad. Also, unless you pretty much strictly party, Peoria doesn't have much to offer.  Very overpriced for a below average experience."
Niche User,2,"College is very overpriced for what they offer. There is very little to do around and near campus. Campus is very cliquey. Math and physics department is lacking. Transferring after one year, hasn’t made that process easy either. They put on a good show.."
College Sophomore,2,All dorm living is bad.  Bradley's housing is just like any other campus.  Small rooms that you have to share.  I would recommend finding a different place to live if possible.
College Student,2,"Everyone knows the basketball team sucks, but tries to make up for it by acknowledging that they are mostly freshman and have ""potential"". From my understanding, most of the games for the sport teams here occur far off campus and aren't heavily attended."
College Junior,2,School is not very spirited in varsity sports but intramural as are awesome and fun.
College Freshman,2,I feel as if we are not that into sports.
College Freshman,2,"The campus police overdo their jobs, but essentially do nothing at all. They basically enjoy flashing their lights and pulling students over."
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are so small, I don't care what building you are in. It's going to be difficult to comfortably fit in there. You really have to take decorating seriously or you will feel like you are in an asylum. Most of the buildings are pretty old, so theres obviously some issues. Some buildings have it worse than others. The RAs don't do much to enforce the rules unless you go to them at your whits end"
College Freshman,2,"The policies on drugs and alcohol SOUND very harsh and they make it seem super scary in hopes that you just wont have any. In reality, they are too lenient about some things and too strict with others. There are people being taken away in ambulances almost every weekend because they are too drunk. Everyone knows that there are parties and that underage students are chugging beers and doing shots, it doesnt matter if you tell them at the door that you are under 21"
College Freshman,2,"most of the attractive people are in Greek houses, and often don't like to date outside of the Greek system. It's really dumb."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorm life is pretty lenient. Students don't get referrals unless they are being obnoxiously loud, drinking, or smoking. The Strictness lies within Greek Life. Joanne has tried to get rid of Greek Life before, and if this were to happen, a lot of students would transfer and there would be fewer incoming students. I am involved in Greek Life, and when I rushed students in the fall, one of the main reasons they came here was how in to Greek Life Bradley is. I hate how they are getting rid of the Greek competitions. We don't do it to put each other down, we participate to have fun together as a united community."
College Sophomore,2,"Fan support/School Spirit is lacking. I cam from a very school spirited high school that always supported athletics. Coming to Bradley, I saw that no one went to the athletic events and have no idea what goes on in the athletic community."
College Freshman,2,i dont go out and it really is not my scene but i know other fraternities and sororities have there days. college is fun.
College Senior,2,I don't go to them for a reason...
College Freshman,2,"Bad. Parties at the frat houses are the same thing everywhere, with the same drama in every one. Bars are far away and not very ""bumpin'."" Everything is pretty close."
College Freshman,2,Most dorm buildings are pretty old. The rooms are fairly small. There are no private bathrooms; everything is shared. Which means it gets pretty dirty. There's little sense of community between a group of random strangers on a floor.
College Freshman,2,"Most people are white upper middle class, with strong religious and political beliefs. There is a strong Christian presence on campus, which means most people tend to be very Conservative. There are a number of African-American, Asian, Hispanic, and Indian students here and there. A majority of the campus is straight, while there are some homosexual students."
College Freshman,2,"Terrible. To most people in the social scene, it's life. Everything revolves around drinking. Non-Greeks just kind of keep to themselves because they just want nothing to do with them. Greek houses range from cruddy houses to a few nicer ones."
College Freshman,2,The art program here is pretty weak. Classes are simple and unchallenging. There isn't a wide range of study whatsoever. The facilities are small but that's all that's needed for such a tiny department. Work outside of class is completely manageable.
College Freshman,2,There are only a few places to eat right off of campus.
College Freshman,2,I have never been peer pressured but everyone knows that almost everyone goes out so if you do not go out to parties (which all have drugs or alcohol) you won't meet a lot of different people.
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do outside of campus. It is necessary to have a car or take the bus to any of the big shopping areas with different restaurants.
College Freshman,2,"I have never taken the bus or train home, as I get a ride from friends, but people who have taken the bus home have told me how it takes almost twice the time to get home on the bus."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have a car, I don't recommend off campus"
College Senior,2,"I haven't Intership.ya, I'll plan"
College Freshman,2,"The process to apply for financial aid and scholarships was not hard but it is very hard to receive either. Also, on the scholarship end, I was offered the least amount at Bradley. I also did not receive much financial aid. It was awful trying to get money for Bradley."
College Freshman,2,"This is another topic I cannot comment much on because I am not familiar but, most people just drink at fraternities or in their room/apartment. I am not familiar with the bars and clubs and do not believe their is much around Bradley that are great places to go."
College Freshman,2,"At Bradley there are few alternatives to going to parties. Events are few and far between. When there is something going on, no one knows it is happening because there it is not sufficient advertising for it. Also, the attendance to the events is low. The atmosphere at Bradley can be stressful because of the large partying community. A large percentage of the campus is involved in Greek life. For relationships, many people participate in random hook-ups. "
College Senior,2,The athletic center is state of the art and very nice. Wide range is things to participate in at the center. Library is one of the worst in Illinois. No real traditions here at Bradley considering the sports are almost obsolete here at Bradley. None athletes do not go to any Bradley affiliated sports games. 
College Senior,2,The academic's at Bradley are awesome and teachers are extremely helpful but the social scene is terrible if you are not 21 years old. 
College Freshman,2,it is not that much off campus space to park 
College Freshman,2,Its only majors that involve art or science
College Freshman,2,They barley help you choose your classes its up to the person on how they chooses they classes
College Freshman,2,The college just sit in the middle of no where 
College Senior,2,Bradley is strict about silly things. There is almost no campus parking for those without a parking pass. The student apartments are on the opposite side of campus from the academic buildings and it is quite a long walk. But if you have a parking permit for the apartment you cannot get a parking permit for the campus lots forcing you to walk in the dark and inclement weather. This is scary because Peoria is not the safest city to live in.
College Senior,2,All exams are given during the same weeks during the school year and most professors don't care if you have 9 projects due in one week and you just can't find time to get things done. In one of my classes this semester our professor assigned groups for 2 different projects. The groups for each project are different but the work time for both projects overlap each other. Finding time to meet with 2 different groups all around the same class schedule is almost impossible. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"I feel like many of the guys and girls at school were extremely shallow and judgmental.  I was lucky to find quite a few good friends there, but I definitely feel like I picked the few good apples from the tree."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's constantly raining and it's always cold.  It's only nice out for about 2 months of the school year so we don't really get to experience it much.  It snows a lot, and classes rarely get canceled."
College Junior,2,The food options on campus are not very healthy at all. Not only are they not healthy but they are quite expensive as well.
College Freshman,2,The diversity on campus is average in my opinion. There is diversity on campus but not many people of a minority ethnic/ racial background. There are students of all cultures which is great to see but I wish there was more. I am use to a big cultural experience everywhere I go because I'm from a big city so coming to a smaller city and a very small campus the diversity level is not the same.
Recent Alumnus,2,The largest scholarship awarded by Bradley isn't even half of what the tuition costs.
College Freshman,2,"The campus strictness is pretty lenient on alcohol at Bradley. The police understand that students will drink no matter what and as long as parties don't get out of control, you're pretty safe to drink on campus. There is a three strike policy so you cannot get too crazy or you will have to suffer the consequences."
College Freshman,2,"The police work very hard and do what they can, but Bradley is not situated in the nicest neighborhood.  

The campus itself is extremely safe.  The police have a very good watch on things on campus and it would be very tough to get away with anything untoward while here. There are a few dozen emergency telephone posts with direct links to the police and they respond very quickly and are very happy to help with anything.  A couple weeks ago I was very sore from a lengthy swimming session and blinded from the chemicals in the pool, used a post to give them a call and they drove me back to my dorm.  Very courteous.

They also have a very good eye on alcohol and drugs.  If you like to party, be very careful where you hang out and who with. 

The trouble is the surrounding town.  The police siren has been nicknamed Peoria's city anthem- it is not the nicest place in the world, and we see safety alerts in our email on a weekly basis about off campus robberies.  DO NOT stray off campus at night.  If you leave during the day, don't go alone.  Campus Town's stores are not a long walk away, but even so it's a sketchy neighborhood.  If you can get a car, do it."
College Junior,2,I am lower middle class and it is difficult to relate to those here who are upper middle class and upper class. The students here tend to have a sense of entitlement in some cases. If you join something and you have to pay everyone assumes you can afford it. There are lots of liberals and they tend to get kind of stuck up about it.
College Junior,2,Being a southern girl its rough to find a Chicago boy who can deal with my accent and lifestyle
College Sophomore,2,Unaware Off-Campus – I'm not completely aware of off-campus housing at Bradley.
College Junior,2,Public transportaion is fair on Bradley Campus because when waiting for a bus it usually take about an hr to get to your destination depending on where you are going. The only great thing about the public transporation is that you only have to pay a dollar for one ride which is really convient to college students getting from one destination to another.
College Freshman,2,"Could Be Better – Although our teams are pretty good, games are not held on campus so many students don't go and that leads to little school spirit. Other than attendence problems all the students that go consistently are very enthusiatic and love to cheer for the team."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Bad Teams Lead to Lacking Spirit – People don't come to Bradley for athletics. We have lots of athletic people, but are teams are just not very good. Due to this and a general feeling of being overworked on campus, there is a lack of school spirit."
College Freshman,2,Sketchy Neighborhood – Increase security around off campus housing. Make it more affordable
College Freshman,2,"I find it to be very difficult to find an internship, especially if you are just a first year student. Most psychology internships require some form of degree/training, (neither of which I have), so you have to either have a lot of time on your hands to look for one, simply been working or have done some type of psych volunteering. But, if your like me you will be struggling."
College Sophomore,2,"Depends Which Dorm You Pick – There are several different options for dorms, and it really depends on which you pick. There are two or three buildings that are really low end, but others are just fine. Geisert definately has the best food in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,Weekly reports about muggings and robberies within 5 miles of campus. Having a long distance to walk from the dorms to fitness facilities and library it's very uneasy walking in the dark.
College Freshman,2,School Spirit – There is not that much school spirit due to the fact that there is not a football team at our school.
College Sophomore,2,"We do not have a football team here at Bradley. Our two big sports are mens soccer and mens basketball. There is a lot of student support for the basketball team but the other sports lack student attendance.All of our athletic facilities are brand new so they are very nice. There a something called the Red Sea, which is basically our student section at games. If you join you get season tickets for basketball."
College Junior,2,"The Facilities are pretty average, they are outdated but they are currently making an effort to update one of the old residence halls and building more facilities on campus...an effort is at least being made."
College Freshman,2,"Social Atmosphere – The Greek life is very present. Other than on-campus social activities, there isn't much around campus town. Around campus town there's only a couple restaurants and that's it."
College Freshman,2,Computer Labs – Average amount of computer labs. But diverse in that it offers both PC's and Mac's to cater to the different users.
College Senior,2,"I am not a member of the Greek society. I think that Greek members think they are better than everyone else because they let Greek letters represent who they are. Some of my friends happen to be Greek, but we are not friends for that reason.  I know some fraternities that are highly friendly, and others that are just douche bags. The sororities are a bunch of ""Mean Girls"" type of girls.  Some fraternities  and sororities have their own house, while others are living in regular houses (without their letters engraved).  I am not too big of a Greek fan."
College Senior,2,"I do not general dine at the dining halls, I know there are about 4 different places to choose from, I have heard they are fairly pricey, average food with quite a variety depending on where you go.  Otherwise meal plan dollars can go toward restaurants and fast food places near campus such as jimmy johns, McDonalds, a couple Chinese places and some nicer restaurants"
Niche User,1,"I went to Bradley for two years and left immediately. The teachers aren’t anything better than what I could find on YouTube. 
There is almost no diversity of students, all your basic seltzer drinking girls and countryesque frat boys. 
I transferred to Columbia in Chicago and was blown away by the diversity and genius-level teachers. All homework at my other school was project based, unlike at Bradley where everything is so darn dull. The Administration at Bradley is also very sad."
Senior,1,"Very unsafe area, there are people being robbed at gunpoint every other day. I was made to take Unnecessary classes and was never able to get the classes I needed for my major, therefore graduating on time was not going to happen. Huge waste of money as it is very expensive to go here. Staff does not care about your well being. I suggest you keep looking for other colleges, this one is way overpriced and has very high crime right on campus."
Sophomore,1,"Ugly campus in a dangerous, run-down area. It's not safe to walk off campus at night due to gun violence. Bad on-campus and off-campus housing. Dining service food is inedible. Minimal dining in area. Professors are incompetent and/or unqualified. Some of the students can barely write in complete sentences. Classes are painfully wrong and the administration sucks at scheduling. Classes are at weird times, so count on having early morning and evening classes. Degrees take ridiculous numbers of credit hours for the major so don't count on any electives if you want a minor. The rec center is nice, but it's always full of professors and it's awkward to run into them. You won't find friends unless you at least drink. Tons of weed on campus, plus some hard drugs. Do not choose Bradley for any reason."
College Freshman,1,"I've applied for numerous scholarships! However, based on a number, Financial Aid believes I don't have the need for scholarships (all of the scholarships are based on need.) Universities seem to not realize, a number is a number. If the student only has one income to a household, the value of the number decreases. One income has a long way to go, if no one else is contributing. This seems to be a reoccurring issue for minorities, to which no one is representing well."
College Freshman,1,"Girls range in appearance, but most of them all look the exact same. Their interests are all the same, too. There is zero sense of individuality. Everything is a competition. Identity and a sense of personal style are sacrificed for yoga pants and North Face jackets. ""Cool"" girls party at the frat houses on weekends. Relationships are pretty shallow and insignificant.

Guys blend together in the greyest shade of unintelligible sludge ever. Mostly all dudes wear what are essentially pajamas to every conceivable event. Everyone likes SPORTS. Everyone likes terrible pop music. Everyone says, ""brah."" Drinking is basically everything. Relationships are shallow and things can get pretty misogynistic."
College Freshman,1,"I hate it. It's not my school of choice and my program is small, unchallenging, and uninspiring. The work is a normal amount, again, nothing challenging. Curriculum is basic, flat, and boring. The facilities are adequate for the size of the program."
College Freshman,1,The RA's on my floor in my hall sucked they let anything happened under their nose. People didn't want to go out much and the college should become a public school because they charge extra money for each kid for no reason. Everything on campus have a fee even the parties 
College Junior,1,There is no much diversity on campus. There should be more students from other diversities like me. It will make things more interesting.
College Freshman,1,"Even though we are a D1 university, our school lacks school spirit. Not having a football team really sucks, and our basketball teams aren't bad, but no one really shows up. It is sad. Our facilities are great for both our athletes and our students. We have a great workout facility and have some great classes to offer. IM sports aren't very big either, they are on a much smaller scale"
College Junior,1,They are not helpful unless you go in. Sometimes you will catch them on a good day but good luck if it's not....
College Sophomore,1,Repetitively Boring – The dining halls had the same food each week with little variety in the menu.
College Sophomore,1,"Basketball Team Not up to Par – The only thing that Bradley shows interest in is its basketball team. We take pride in being division 1, but they fail to mention that we came in dead last in our conference last season (Missouri Valley Conference). Students are enthusiastic in most games, especially against our rival, ISU, but when your team doesn't perform well, it's hard to keep the morale up. Also, the basketball players walk around campus like they're rock stars when in reality, they're just tall and can't make as many free-throws as they should."
College Freshman,1,"On-Campus Food – The cafeteria people are incompetent. For example, I ordered an egg white omelet one morning and the lady did not know how to crack an egg. She cracked the egg and dropped eggshells into the bowl and had the audacity to dig her fingernails into it to fish out the yolk. Let's say that's the last time I'd eat at Williams Hall again. 
At Center court, I ordered a wrap and the lady behind the counter did not even know how to wrap it up. She had to try it multiple times and get another lady to teach her. By that time, my wrap was already falling apart from the multiple attempts. Did I mention all those hands on my food?"
College Junior,1,"Not So Good – Transportation around Bradley isn't so hot.  There's a bus system, but its pretty unreliable and only hits a couple major places.  There's a charter bus company that does regular runs to the Chicago area.  The buses are pretty nice, all things considered, but they're pretty expensive and it can be hard to get a spot on holidays."
Niche User,1,"My overall experience is poor. The entire system to pick next-semester classes is ridiculous. I am a commuter, and I work at night, yet I can't get a class to fit my schedule. I drive to Bradley two or more times a day because my schedule is horrible. Teacher's must think I have unlimited free time to walk to the Bradley library and work on group projects. Well they are wrong. If I did it all over, I would not come here again."
Niche User,1,"Parking is a mess, but luckily I don't have to deal with it on a daily basis. I try to find a spot in the deck at the end of the weekend, and I don't see my car the rest of the week because it's too difficult to try to find a spot during the week. We desperately need more parking because the current system just isn't cutting it."
Niche User,1,"Campus parking is the biggest joke and waste of time. Although they are constantly making efforts to better the parking situation, nothing ever seems to work. Commuters have to fight each other just to get a parking spot in the mornings. If you have an afternoon class, forget it; you might as well walk. And if there is snow on the ground, you should just take the day off!"
Niche User,1,Do I park in between the lines or on top of the lines? I'm confused. It's not easy to park because half the student commuters have the parking skill of buffoons. It would be nice to actually be able to open my door so I could get out and go to class.
Niche User,1,"Parking is the single most inconvenient part about attending Bradley. I commute from my house about 15 minutes away from campus, but I have to leave about 35 to 40 minutes early to make it to class on time. I waste way too much time trying to find a spot, and I know a lot of other people feel the same way. There just isn't enough space or enough spots. It's so frustrating."
Niche User,1,"Trying to find a parking spot makes me late to class quite often. There just aren't enough spaces, so I'm hoping this parking deck they are planning to build with help. You shouldn't have to spend a half hour driving circles around the campus and stalk someone who you think is leaving so you can steal their spot."

Alum,5,"Although the cost is steep, Lewis University's Education program is one of the best I have been apart of."
Alum,5,All professors were willing to work with you if you gave them effort. They were always willing to meet!
Alum,5,"The campus is beautiful, the student life is very diverse, the classrooms are very up to date with the latest technology, and the professors were very knowledgable."
Alum,5,"I took 2 classes online while at Lewis. They were relatively easy, did not require too much work, and the professors were always helpful."
Sophomore,5,So far so good. My professor has been extremely clear on expectations and makes herself available for questions. All staff when applying and enrolling were extremely helpful and walked me through every aspect of my education before letting me off on my own.
Sophomore,5,I am glad that I chose to go to Lewis University. Everybody is very friendly and the professors are kind and very helpful.
Junior,5,It is a school that offers a variety of interesting classes that will challenge you to learn new things.
Sophomore,5,I just finished my first year at Lewis. The professors were friendly and great with instructing us thoroughly. I felt very safe while on campus and the food tasted ok.
Sophomore,5,"Prior to the virus, I had taken 1 class online. It was very organised and I learned a lot. Once the virus came about and remote learning was popular everywhere, the university and my professors did a great job with transferring all of their classes online. Most of my time there involved reading, writing, and researching. Blackboard did a great job with integrating this, and my professors did a great job with communicating what we needed to get done."
Sophomore,5,"Lewis university isn’t a college you go to in order to party and just do normal college student things. If you want to become a great PERSON, Lewis is for you!! I’ve grown so much due to the staff and how we are treated."
Alum,5,Lewis University is a tight-knit community of driven students. The support you will receive from administration and professors is unparalleled.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy going to Lewis University. Although it is a Lasallian/Catholic university, it is a school that is open to those who have different religions and beliefs, which contributes to Lewis' diversity. I see people of different races and talk ti people with different religions all of the time. There are amazing professors who challenge you and are accessible to help. Also, the tutors in person and online have helped me to excel in classes that at first, I felt were hard for me. The campus is beautiful, always clean, and easy to navigate."
Junior,5,Lewis University is a fantastic school and in my opinion has some of the best teachers. I attended aviation-related classes and all the teachers have had countless years of experience in the aviation field and clearly have a passion for it. They are always very informative and have a lot of insight into the field.
Senior,5,I love that Lewis is a place where people from all walks of life can come and understand one another. I appreciate all of the opportunities that attending this school has afforded me. I have one more year here so one thing I would like to see change is the quality of the food. I often have to but food and cook as well as pay the meal plan fee to be able to survive.
Junior,5,"My experience so far has been great at Lewis. I love the campus because it is surrounded my nature and a green environment. Classes and professors are great. I really enjoy having the accessibility to be able to talk to my professors about class. However,  what I would like to see is an increase of variety of food options and more activities.  Other than that Lewis University is a great school. I also like that it is a christian and catholic based school."
Junior,5,I am a junior this year at Lewis University.  I am in the Unmanned Aircraft Systems program.  I am enjoying my classes and learning so much.  Lewis has been a great experience for me.
Freshman,5,"They had a very beautiful campus. The staff was very friendly. The cafeteria isn’t the greatest, but it’s still pretty good."
Junior,5,It is a good school and I am transferring in the fall and plan on presiona marketing. The people who work there are very attentive on helping all.
Senior,5,The adult program is flexible and available on-line / campus. the professors in the health care leadership all are professionals working in health care. lewis university allows students to have a quality education while living a busy life.
Sophomore,5,"Lewis U is a great school and I knew that but at first I was very skeptical about it. It is a small school and it is semi isolated. I was coming from California where all the schools are big and centrally located. When I got to Lewis, realizing how close it was to Chicago was amazing. It's a short 30 minute drive in. The school being small turned out to be a major plus because class sizes are kept to thirty maybe forty students and the professors know your name and care about you as a person. Another benefit of the small school is that you don't need to leave your dorm until five to ten minutes before your class starts because its a short walk."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman and so far I have had a great experience at Lewis. Being an only child, I thought I would have a hard time adjusting but it was the total opposite. I have met some great friends and my professors are helpful and dedicated to ensuring the students succeed. I am apart of the the dance team, which we perform at the basketball games. Since I am a dancer, this allowed me to continue some form of dancing."
Freshman,5,"I feel like my experience at Lewis University so far has been great. I love my professors and they have been very dedicated to their jobs. Also, my track and field experience has been great and I feel like I am really improving in my running. Th overall look of the school is very pretty with all the different trees because it is an atrium. This year they finished building a new student center and it looks amazing with the new features. The center holds our convenience store and new a new dinning hall with a lot of study rooms and gaming areas. I live in a dorm and I love using the study rooms in our dorm as well as the library to study with friends."
Junior,5,"Lewis University is an amazing school. The professors there are so approachable and personable. They make sure you know the material that you are learning and they want you to do good in the class. They care about your grades and make time for you if you are struggling. There are so many different opportunities for everyone on campus. The university always holds fun events for students to take a break from school work for a little while. I also love how the campus is so diverse, making it easy to engage with people and learn about a variety of cultures. Overall, Lewis University is an outstanding campus that wants you to succeed and feels like home."
Junior,5,"Lewis has great professors and everyone, and great academic bldgs. Everyone I have come in contact with at Lewis has always been super helpful. The campus is super quiet all the time which makes it really peaceful."
Freshman,5,"I love Lewis University. Great Professors, easy classes, and smooth transition from being in High-School. Overall I wish that there were more things for residence life and commuters to get involved in but the education you will receive is phenomenal."
Sophomore,5,Great school with wonderful professors. It is mostly a commuter school. Wish there was a little more to do in terms of student life but overall the school gets the job done if you are commuting. campus is beautiful especially in the summer. Teachers are really cool and truly care about your success. It is really easy to reach out and get help with anything.
Senior,5,"I love Lewis University and feel as though I have gotten a wonderful education.  My professors have ""real world"" experience and they are readily available for me.  I feel as though they are not only instructors, but they have a personal interest in me!  The campus is beautiful - it's an arboretum; and my fellow students are kind and invested in learning. I have made many wonderful friends here. Lewis University is definitely a 5-star institution!"
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student here. The students, teachers, and coaches are amazing. The school is also in a great area which means there is always fun things to do both on and off campus."
Sophomore,5,"Lewis is an amazing school! The staff are all very helpful. The students are amazing, friendly and diverse. The campus is beautiful. The Flyers Den has the best food and the library is my favorite place to chill when I’m not at the den."
Junior,5,"I chose to pursue my education at Lewis University because I have my family members who have previously or are currently attending the university with me. The university is a hub for creativity and growth. In my time here, I have found that their is an overwhelming amount of support for students by faculty and staff. Everyone here cares about bettering the lives of students."
Junior,5,Lewis University has been a great place to attend college for the past two years. Cannot wait to start my third year.
Alum,5,"Lewis has come a long way since my wife and I attended in the 1980's, however it has evolved into a premier regional college.  They have added numerous new dorms, and educational facilities and have broken ground on a beautiful new Student Union to be envied by other facilities!"
Freshman,5,"Lewis has such a positive environment. From the dorms to classes, everyone is welcoming and ready to teach/learn. I've had nothing but good experiences so far."
Freshman,5,Midsize school with a very close campus. Various activities to do and teachers are willing to help. Small school very helpful for students from small towns but does not lose the appeal to city students.
Niche User,5,Everyone there is very nice and helpful. When I had a problem with my login in with mylewis portal I got help from them the very same day. They will help you with finanical aid as much as they can.
Graduate Student,5,"Lewis University offer many online programs which are convenient for the working adult.  I appreciate the friendliness, support, and encouragement of the faculty members.  The online program is easy to navigate and faculty members are easily accessible via email or phone."
Junior,5,I like that Lewis is small and a close community.  There are plenty of course options and convenient times to schedule.
Graduate Student,5,Excellent university. Very hands on with their students. Will contact you when they feel you need it and are always open when you contact them. Professors are good and want you to succeed
Freshman,5,Awesome College. Great location for Veterans and those who plan on serving. Small Class sizes are beneficial unlike larger colleges and universities.
Freshman,5,"Lewis is a wonderful school. Everyone there is very friendly and caring in all different ways. The professors go out of their way to lend a helping hand so everyone can succeed. I am grateful i have the opportunity to attend Lewis. From the student life to education, it is a perfect school. I am happy i get to spend the next four years there."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer, and coming into this school was very welcoming. The professors are great and truly care about their students and their success. The campus is small yet beautiful!"
Freshman,5,"I have been at Lewis University for one semester, and I have greatly enjoyed my time here. The atmosphere of the university is very friendly, and the landscaping is beautiful. The faculty are very responsive and ready to help the students in any way they can. They genuinely want to help their students learn. I have benefited from the real life experience of my professors as they show the importance of learning. Learning is not about cramming knowledge to pass tests and obtain a good grade, but rather it is gaining tools to be used life-long. I am majoring in Business Administration and Accounting, and I see already how the classes I am taking will apply to any job I may have in the workplace."
Freshman,5,"As a Freshman at Lewis, it has been a very nice first semester as I am writing this the professors are great, and there many opportunities for activities on campus."
Freshman,5,I love going to Lewis University! I love how small and home-y the campus is. The professors are all super friendly and won’t hesitate to help you in any way that they can.
Junior,5,This school is gorgeous in every sense of the word - both aesthetically and academically.  I will be attending in the Spring and I've already had a wonderful experience with exploring the campus.  Faculty has been very kind and helpful!
Sophomore,5,"The past year and a half that I have been at Lewis have been beneficial to me. They have helped me grow in my personal life and my academic life, and I would say that the teachers have been a major help to me. The professors that I have had so far have challenged me and have been very encouraging, which allows me to grow and become further educated."
Senior,5,"Lewis University is a unique campus. The school may not have a football team, but the school is not lacking in the energy, personality, or the spirit that comes with it. The school instead pours its energy into other programs, such as their division I Volleyball team, Division II baseball, stellar soccer, and incredible track and field team. 
lewis is accepting of many kids who need second chances when it comes to academics, which may make it seem like its ACT scores are low, but don't let that fool you. I've met other students here with ACT'S as low as 18, and as high as 34. 
Lewis is also always progressing, and making a bigger name for themselves with every year. For instance, Lewis is currently in the process of building a newer and bigger student union, with a larger 24-hour c-store, and an all you can eat buffet. they also plan to build a bike trail that runs all the way to the target nearby, a new student housing center, and a new baseball field on campus."
Sophomore,5,I am currently a sophomore at Lewis and I love it! The staff have all been very kind and helpful whenever needed. I also like the variety of students. Lewis is a place where I feel safe and secure.
Niche User,5,I am looking into transferring into Lewis University next semester. I emailed the dean of students and I got an email back right away. She is doing everything she can to help me out in the transferring process.
Junior,5,"The professors are amazing, the environment is fun and safe. What I love about it is that they value diversity, and no one can feel excluded from the student life in Lewis University."
Alum,5,Lewis University is a fantastic institution that provides working adults with various programs and options to help them meet their educational needs.  I highly recommend Lewis University to anyone that is looking to attend or go back to school and receive a high quality education with convenience and high caliber.
Senior,5,"I loved Lewis. Easy to get connected. It is a ""suitcase"" school, however, because many students leave on the weekends. Large commuter population."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Lewis university. My experience so far has been very positive. Making friends is easy at Lewis, and the faculty truly do care about the students."
Freshman,5,When I first went on the college tour of Lewis I believed that they would only be nice to me because they wanted me to come to their school. But after becoming apart of the Lewis community I was surprised how people continued to express polite and courteous attitudes everyday. People were very welcoming and many of my instructors focused their efforts on my success. I have no regrets in choosing Lewis to pursue my education in and I feel that with all the resources and personal interactions I can have with the people here. That I can do nothing less than succeed. 
Graduate Student,5,I was a flight major and I loved every second of my 4 years. I was a resident student. I was an orientation group leader as well.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is willing to help. They are all very understanding.
College Student,5,"I absolutely love how many classes are available at Lewis. I wish my program gave me more freedom to choose other classes to explore, but I can always go back! The professors are super nice and willing to work with the students. Class size is small, which is great because there is so much learning going on."
College Senior,5,We have trained police officers on campus. There is always a way to get in touch when you need them. There is an entire team of staff meant to make sure students who are worried about someone on campus can get those people help before anything escalates. Teachers are there to talk. The countless are always available to help with anything and give you resources outside of themselves to help you too.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are very supportive. They guide you through any issue with the course work and give you a chance to complete your assignments with the most knowledge.
College Sophomore,5,Jobs/ internships are done through academic advising. A lot of information about when we need to start looking for an internship and where were given on the first day of class.
Alum,4,The online learning experience was pleasant at Lewis University. I found most of the instructors to be very professional.  I received feedback in a timely manner.
Junior,4,"Overall, Lewis University is a great school where they value their students and provide many resources to make sure each individual receives the tools they need to have a successful experience."
Sophomore,4,"Thanks to the stay at home order, all spring 2020 courses were moved to online. All of my professors moved to an online format for teaching. My professors posted videos of their lectures every week that I had to watch. What I liked about that was if I did not understand something, I could just replay the part of the video that I did not understand to try to understand it better. If that still did not help me, I emailed my professors and they always responded within an hour. I felt like I did not lose any learning during this quarantine."
Junior,4,"Online classes are often easier than in person classes, however it can be easy to misunderstand something online. Professors will usually work with you for any difficulty you are having."
Sophomore,4,"It was difficult at first with this epidemic that we are going through. Switching from face to face into online classes was the worst thing to ever happen for me. It was so much at once i had a hard time adjusting. However, Lewis staff made the transition a lot smoother knowing the we are going through so much."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are really good and knowledgeable, and the class sizes are small so students get to know their teachers."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the online experience. Professors were very accommodating and made the switch to online classes a lot better.
Graduate Student,4,"My educational experience at Lewis University was one I can go and write a memoir about. The professors who taught courses here brought a lot of real world experiences from their past careers when a certain topic arose in my lectures. This especially in my Criminal Justices courses because some of the professors were former Law Enforcement on a federal and local level. If I could change anything about the university, I would have to say the cost of attendance. Everyone no matter who you are should be able to afford to come to Lewis University and get a very good education."
Senior,4,"Lewis University is an OK school if you are just planning to go to school to learn and go home. I do think it is a great school for someone who is looking to get the “college experience”. Although, many people at Lewis mention the different clubs, sports, and extra activities Lewis have, I do not see much happening on campus. The teachers at Lewis are great, at my two years of being at this school I have never had a bad teaching experience. All the teachers and staff pushes their student to be the best in their career."
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking into applying at Lewis I say do it!!! Lewis is a great school for those who like a small pretty campus. The class sizes are small, allowing for better and easier communication between teachers and students. Additionally, the professors are absolutely amazing! They're funny, fun, and super helpful. I could always count on my professors to help me with any issues I have. Only issue I have is with parking."
Sophomore,4,"I haven't officially started yet but so far, everyone has been very helpful in making sure everything I need to start my program is in place, on time."
Junior,4,"Lewis is a very great place to go for college. They offer many opportunities for academics, leadership, clubs, and internships. Many students come back for grad school. The campus life is very busy for everyone as students are involved in sports, clubs, and other student activities. This is non-city campus that has a gate— great for safety. The police and professors are always able to listen to concerns and new possibilities for change. I really love being a part of Lewis!"
Junior,4,It provides a good faculty to student ratio. You are able to engage more in a smaller classroom. It’s a beautiful campus and nice to walk around or even study outside on a nice day.
Senior,4,"Lewis University is a great school to go for academics. It is an expensive college, so I recommend applying to as many scholarships as possible.  Campus life is somewhat okay, it is primarly a commuter school, so it can be pretty dead and quiet sometimes around the campus. Overall it's a good school to get your education at."
Alum,4,This is very well as for practicing their Catholic side. What i do not like is that they charge a lot to here. To this date i am still paying back and i will not my degree until i pay back all of it.
Junior,4,"School itself has a nice campus, it is big and the staff are helpful in getting around and finding where to go. It is a catholic school so there is a lot of christian imagery around. the teachers are pleasant to work with and fairly understanding"
Alum,4,"All the professors I had at Lewis were extremely helpful. Class sizes are small, so it's easy to get to know people. There are lots of areas to study, both inside and outside. There are also a lot of after-school activities to get involved in. However, I wish there were closer areas to park. I also wish there were better food options."
Junior,4,Lewis is a very transfer friendly school! One of the most affordable in the area. I've had good experiences with all of my professors so far!
Sophomore,4,"I like how diverse and how the students are close. You can always meet a friend in one of your classes. What I would like to see change is the parking lot. It is very crowded when it comes for commuters such as myself. Other than that, I say Lewis is a great school to attend!"
Graduate Student,4,The application process at Lewis is very quick and there are advisers to guide you it. They have a good computer science program and specializations in relevant areas with interesting elective classes.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful. Everyone from admissions, to financial aid, and beyond is excited to help in anyway possible. Scholarships and aid make it pretty affordable and I feel like I’m getting a better education than a state school for just a little bit more money. The Aid office does take longer than the community college I attended, like weeks longer... 
Be prepared for a bunch of upfront costs though. Parking passes are expensive and Aid is usually an issue when trying to buy books. Make sure to have all your ducks in a row, or it gets messy and stressful to get organized before the semester. 
Overall I think it’s a great school and a pretty good value. I almost overlooked Lewis but I’m glad I didn’t."
Sophomore,4,"Applying to Lewis was an easy process, counselors and faculty are all very helpful when answering questions.  The campus is just big enough for a university feel but great student to teacher ratio."
Junior,4,Lewis University is a wonderful school! The professors are amazing and the campus is gorgeous! I adore that God is included in the classroom as well. The only downside is the cost but it is definitely worth it.
Sophomore,4,"Lewis University is small enough too let you get to know many people there but still has many activities to keep you busy. One recent thing they added that I enjoyed is bike rentals placed nicely around campus. Although I enjoy the food their you may find yourself eating a lot of the same things as the weeks go by. One thing that's big at Lewis and what I found me and my friends doing together were intramurals. It was a good way to stay active if you're not in a sport and a good social activity. The intramurals can range from paintball, ultimate frisbee, flag football, badminton and more. When it came to the dorms one thing I noticed was some of the doubles rooms varied in size when we did measurements and we got pitted with one of the smallest doubles in the hall. Although some of those rooms were likely meant for Resident Assistants or other staff they were given to us despite having to pay the same for room and board. I found the teachers, for the most part, good quality."
Sophomore,4,"Lewis University has a great campus and a lot of activities to do in your free time. The only complaint I have is that some of the professors do not seem to care and take a long time putting grades in, but that is only a few. Other than that, there is a lot of parking and the scenery is beautiful. Lastly, their biology program is amazing!"
Alum,4,I was a transfer student from Waubonsee and found Lewis U to be a very great place for me. The small classes and one on one times with professors helped become a successful student. I feel I would've been very out of place at a big university.
Senior,4,"I really like how close a student can get to their professors. The professors really make a lot of time for their students and care dearly for them. I would say for an English major this school is perfectly fine to attend as for a Communications major, especially in the field of journalism, it's a little lacking. I wish that they pushed students a bit more because, in the real world, things are more competitive snd that competitive element is missing at Lewis. Otherwise it's a very open and accepting community. Campus life is a little dull seeing as it is a commuter-heavy schoop so it's tough to get students back on campus. However, it is easy to create relationships with those in your respective major and you grow a small community there as I have through Communications and English. It's just hard to branch out from your majors, unless you live on campus."
Freshman,4,"Lewis is a great school, the teachers are awesome and theres always someone available to help. The only thing I don't like and would like to see change is the amount of clubs, they dont have very many club options to pick from if your not into sports."
Sophomore,4,"Lewis has a very open and supportive environment. Campus and class sizes are small, but that provides the opportunity for more student-professor direct contact and allows the students to have great communication and learning experiences. Lewis is diverse, but a large population of the students are commuters so if you're looking to stay on campus, that may be something you would like to take into account. Lewis is a school that is focused on the academics of their students and fostering of personal and professional qualities."
Sophomore,4,Lewis is a very comfortably sized school with great professors and many accommodations for students.
Freshman,4,"Lewis is a small campus that easily makes people feel at home. The faculty to student ratio is small, so professors are familiar with who you are, and it makes the learning environment more comfortable."
Sophomore,4,"My experience has been minimal as a commuter student. The admission staff I have been in contact with have been great. The university does extremely well with communications about what’s going on on campus. The campus and classrooms are clean and comfortable, but some classrooms seem to need some updating."
Sophomore,4,"I like the class sizes and the atmosphere. But campus life is very boring, and there isn’t a lot to do off campus either."
Freshman,4,I enjoy this school very much but I wish there were more things to do around the campus to make it more interesting.
Freshman,4,"I like how small Lewis is. It is easy to connect with people on the campus and is also easier for me to be in touch with my professors. The classes are small in size, so the professors pay more attention to your own personal needs in the classroom and care more."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, everyone is friendly and kind. The professors truly care about you, your education, and your well-being. There are many resources you can use if you need help personally, professionally, or academically. You can count on your professors to help you when you need it. The labs are excellent in the science department and there are plenty of research opportunities. If you want to participate in research and work hard, you can. I love my experiences here, and know many of my friends do too."
Freshman,4,"Lewis university was over all above decent. I'm a freshmen but it enough toes that it's a good school and offers majors most other schools don't. for example, Forensic criminal investigation. ( My major) I over all enjoy Lewis university and call it home."
Senior,4,Lewis has been a great experience. The staff is patient and friendly and make the extra effort to assist students anyway they can.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Lewis University is a great school for academics; small classroom sizes and one-on-one time with your professors. The one thing that bothers me about Lewis is that there's almost no clubs, parties, or anything to really do besides school work."
Freshman,4,"I like that Lewis University is a place where you are individualistic with seeking information and once you make connections, they become great references."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus!  It's very peaceful and absolutely gorgeous.  The students are always welcoming and friendly to everyone.  However, the dorm room I'm living in is very small.  Also, their art department isn't as great as I had hoped.  I am a graphics design major, and I feel like I'm not getting as great of an education as I would if I were a nursing major or an aviation major, which are the school's two well-known majors."
Freshman,4,"Lewis University provides an amazing learning experience, with a beautiful campus to walk around on. Lewis offers many different majors, each with excellent professors determined to grow their student's knowledge and help them prepare for their fields."
Freshman,4,the food is not that good except for the sub station in charlies place but there are so many good places to study around campus with little distractions
Sophomore,4,"I am a transfer student, who transferred to Lewis University. It is my first semester there and it has been amazing! I have recently joined a business professional fraternity. It will help me further succeed in my business career. I have made some awesome friends and the teachers there are very knowledgable as well. I would not have it any other way."
Senior,4,"The faculty and staff are very supportive and helpful. It's nice to know that they are there for you and want to help you succeed. Most of the faculty and staff are friendly and always take that extra step to help you in any way that they can. I've had professors email me about events going on through the university or outside the university because they thought I might be interested in attending. Likewise, I have been emailed about opportunities such as scholarships or events I can volunteer for on campus. Overall, I'm very glad I chose Lewis University. The curriculum was challenging and at times exciting. I worked for my campus for four years and have loved multiple jobs I've had on campus throughout the years. Lewis is a wonderful school and I would recommend it to anyone."
College Junior,4,"At orientation, we had a session with the Campus police chief. He went over with us all the safety that goes into keeping the campus safe. The police department has a great website and facebook page that gives you tips, and things happening on campus. All over campus are emergency phones that are easily accessable in case of emergency. I feel safe on campus."
College Junior,4,"Being a new student, I am not really familiar with internship and job prospects as of yet. The school website does have a great link I have visited that does give all the information."
College Junior,4,"I haven't really gotten to be a part of the athletic atmosphere here at Lewis as of yet, but I hope to join in soon."
College Junior,4,"I am a transfer student at Lewis University and this is my first semester here. I am an older student going back to college in hopes of gaining my bachelors degree, and I am always made to feel this is the right school to be at. I have never second guessed my decision. The professors are excellent at that they do, and they have so much compassion for teaching in their fields. The environment is amazing, and I am so glad I made the choice to not only continue my education, but to do it at Lewis University."
College Sophomore,4,The school offers lots of help to all those who need it and truly help us to succeed.
College Senior,4,I am enjoying the professors I have for my major classes. They are all helpful and knowledgeable in their fields. I am a transfer student and wish that I attended Lewis for all four years because I have retained a great amount of information from classes taken at Lewis.
College Senior,4,There are a lot of resources for helping me pursue my future career. I am planning on applying to a Physician Assistant program nest spring and I know that the writing center will help me with my paper and that the career center can take a look at my resume and help me with the interview process.
College Senior,4,I feel safe walking around campus. If I ever feel unsure of an area I am walking in I always know that there are emergency buttons to press nearby. Most of the time I am able to see a student volunteer from campus safety or there is a police officer on bike or driving by in a car.
College Senior,4,"Professors at my university challenge your critical thinking skills. It is not about just taking a test and receiving a grade, it is about being able to apply the material to real life situations and future occupations. Professors are very approachable and their are services available to the students that include a tutoring center, a writing center, and study groups."
College Freshman,4,I think the Greek life makes people feel even more at home. They really help bring the college community together and don't treat you different if you're not in one.
College Freshman,4,I would choose this school again because it has a very welcoming and warm feeling to it. Everyone here is really nice and helpful.
College Student,4,I will not be receiving a degree from Lewis. I am in a program that is affiliated with Lewis
College Student,4,"I feel safe walking around campus. Considering I am extremely paranoid, that's something huge."
College Student,4,I've always liked going to school and being challenged. It's great to be at a school with the profession I'm interested in.
College Freshman,4,"Even though we are a D2 school, we still try our best to show school spirit and support for all the athletes."
Niche User,2,I really have no background on the university bu what I like about it is that they offer Aviation school.
Senior,2,"I have poor experiences with professors, when expressing my concerns regarding inappropriate behavior, nothing has been done to follow up. It seems that just because a teacher has tenure, they are allowed to degrade us in any way they please. Additionally, Lewis University doesn't provide accounting majors with the skills neccessary in order to prosper after we graduate."
College Freshman,2,If you are looking to party then Lewis is not the school for you. Most of the students are commuters and go home after class so there is not many parties at all.
College Sophomore,2,"I have personally not had any trouble with getting my financial aid, but I have heard so many terrible stories from other students about their experience with financial aid."
College Freshman,2,there is no social life here. it is an ugly school with little pretty girls or hot guys. everyone is religious
College Freshman,2,No one cares unless it's mens volleyball
College Freshman,2,RA's are assholes and the cops get into your stuff
College Sophomore,2,"I wish I would've known my financial award letter before I enrolled, I would have went somewhere else"
College Junior,2,"Off campus housing is horrible, it costs to much, can't have parties usually. And they are way to small for the cost"
College Junior,2,"Other than Mcdonalds and fast food places, it is hard to find food"
College Senior,2,"There is really nothing to do in Romeoville off-campus. It is a very boring area, but that works just fine for me. There are a couple of bars in the area if so desired."
College Sophomore,2,There is no interaction at all. You need a car to get any where
College Junior,2,Their is not no places very close to the campus that would charge low rent because they are all mostly homes nearby.
College Junior,2,"Their is nothing nearby, the closest is about 12 minute drive and that would be like a gas station."
College Junior,2,"Lewis University is a commuter school and therefore there isn't much to do at night. If there are any parties, they are off campus because the University Police Department is very strict in enforcing the rules."
College Freshman,2,"Lewis is a closed campus so of you do not have a car, you are not leaving campus. Any ""parties"" are busted rather quickly or there is just small gatherings. Lewis is also in the middle of nowhere so there is nowhere to go."
College Sophomore,2,Good and safe communities but very expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you come to school and do not move your car at all you will have a parking spot. The parking lots are small and the problem is that only students are allowed in student lots and commuters in their lot and visitors in theirs, and if anyone doesn't have the right permit campus police gives you a ticket.  The campus is small so parking is not to far regardless, but it can still be a hassle."
College Sophomore,2,Is no real night life except of campus at sports houses.
College Sophomore,2,Very low-key with no special housing. Greeks at my school are more for service.
College Sophomore,2,"I did not pledge, but a friend did, let's say, we are not really friends anymore.  She got in trouble for sitting with me at lunch one day, because I am not pledging."
College Junior,2,Science majors have it rough
College Junior,2,There is no apartment complexes around there. The nearest would be about 20 minutes away.
College Freshman,2,I didn't get much. Would be a lot nicer to get more so i'm not buried in debt...
College Sophomore,2,everyone parks on campus. we are a small school.
College Sophomore,2,WE LIVE AND GO TO SCHOOL CLOSE TO STATEVILLE PENITENTIARY!
College Sophomore,2,"public transport is sparse, cabs are almost non existent. a car is the most efficient way to get off campus. "
College Sophomore,2,it is more of a commuter school and a lot of students leave right after classes on weekdays and go home on weekends. so not a jumping nightlife
College Junior,2,Not many students go to sports unless it's for mens volleyball which is D1 here.
College Freshman,2,"The campus does not provide much transportation. The only transportation provided is shuttle buses that go to and from Walmart and Target. Lewis does have an airport, being an aviation school but it is not offered to the student body. I believe there is a train station not too far from campus but it is a bit of a walk. The best way to find transportation is to find someone with a car who is willing to drive you or go with you somewhere. The good thing about Lewis is it is not hard to get a parking pass."
College Freshman,2,The Greek life at Lewis is not very popular. Nobody really hears much about it. Therefore Lewis is not affected much socially by the Greek life. I do not see  students involved in Greek life very often so i'm not sure how non-Greeks feel about Greeks. There is no special Greek housing. All Greeks live in regular dorms.
College Junior,2,Their are a variety of restaurants around the school campus. None of these restaurants offer discounts to students.
College Junior,2,Getting caught in the rain is pretty frequent. Buildings are far enough away to make sure you get soaked between classes. Chicago winters are fun for nobody.
College Junior,2,"Its Chicago, you can never depend on the weather. You have to walk to classes can be a distance in the cold and snow or rain. Lewis rarely cancels classes."
College Senior,2,I mean there is always people going to be doing drugs.  It is not very potent or obvious though at all.  A girl drug overdosed but students don't get caught with drugs very often.
College Senior,2,Workload is difficult. Maintaining a full time job while a full time student is extremely difficult. But it does force you to learn the material.
College Junior,2,They do their basic job but the network for Internet is really slow
College Junior,2,"I have not had an internship, but their job center is difficult to navigate."
College Sophomore,2,When you go to the financial aid office everyone gives you a different answer. If you want to talk to someone make sure Irish counselor because most of the time it Is a student there which makes it difficult for them to understand at times
College Sophomore,2,"There is parking by most of the buildings, the thing that u don't like is that there are people without permits that park there along with teachers. I think there would be more parking available is the security would patrol the area and check permits once in a while.  The price for the permit was $50 last year and this year it is $75 this was because they made more parking but I think this made it harder to find it."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking at Lewis can be hectic at certain times of the day, but distances are reasonable for motorist. The school has recently added a new parking lot that has help the flow of commuter and resident parking."
College Junior,2,"Lewis's night life is not all that fun. If you are looking for a spectacular night life, go somewhere else. This school is mainly laid back so parties rarely happen."
College Sophomore,2,The dining at Lewis University is very Mediocre. The food is over priced and not necessarily that great either. There are no well known restaurants on campus and not that many around campus either.
College Senior,2,"Parking is tight, especially as our student body continues to grow.  Resident parking isn't too bad, but commuter parking can be hard to find.  In the past couple of years Lewis has added new lots, so it's getting better.  This year they increased the permit cost to $75 a semester for residents and commuters."
Recent Alumnus,2,International Student Center Is Terrible – The International student center does not care about its students. They are not willing to help with any immigration issues you face.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Fast Food for Students on the Run – There aren't that many places to choose from off campus at Lewis.  You need a car to get to these establishments.  There are no student discounts that I know of and its the same old stuff (Wendy's, Taco Bell, Buffalo Wild Wings).  If you are willing to drive to Joliet there are some good bars and restaurants in the downtown part of Joliet and if you are old enough you can hit up the casino. :)"
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Is an Interesting Part of Campus, but Not Popular – I don't see many openly Greek people roaming the campus, but it is clear the organizations exist. It's not necessary to join in, but the option is there."
College Junior,2,"Greeks Unnoticeable – Although there are sororities on campus, the scene is every limited and there seems to not be a lot of presence of one on campus. Furthermore, there are not designated living quarters for these students so there is no special treatment or area for these students."
College Sophomore,2,Don't Do It Alone – The apartments nearby are not all that great and are pretty expensive. If you live off-campus in your own place I would suggest getting a roommate. Most places don't take big dogs--especially ones like my pittbull. I would suggest if your parents live nearby be a leach a little longer until you can get someone who wants to share the place and you have a sure income.
College Junior,2,"The computer lab is sually overcrowded but is always a good option to relax, sit with your friends and study. The finals week is extremely overcrowded but we always get free coffee and the lab is open 24 hrs which is the best part in those hard and most stressful weeks of finals."
College Sophomore,2,Social Life. there is bascially no social life. Most activites or parties are off campus. I know we are at school for education but when you want to relax and take a break its hard to find stuff to do especially if you are a resident
College Sophomore,2,No Clubs! There is nothing nearby where you can walk and this is where problem with transportation comes in. Must have a car to be able to go out and relax. Nearest places are about 20min away however way to far to walk and no easy way to get there!
College Sophomore,2,"Living Outside of Lewis – Living off campus does not sound like a bad idea but there are a few things to take into account.  First, the neigborhoods around campus are not the best.  The cost of living is increasing.  Its almost impossible to get anywhere off campus if you are like me and do not own a car.  I would live off campus however if my school provided adequate housing."
College Junior,2,"I do not really know much about Greek Life because I am not involved in it.  However, what I have come to notice is that there are no soroities that I would join.  This is because many of the soroities have a specific race/ethnicity that dominates each soroity.  With that there are none that really have any white females in them."
College Junior,2,"Come Early If You Want to Get to Class on Time – Lewis has many parking lots around campus, but most of them are small. You can always find a parking spot, but it most likely will not be close to the building your first class is in. It's advisable to give yourself a half hour to find a parking spot and do whatever walking you'll need to do. The upside is that the campus isn't that huge, and that if it's really cold or hot, you'll be close to some building to duck into. Parking permits are $50 per semester, and if you bring a car to campus, the permit is required whether you're a resident or a commuter."
College Senior,2,Small Town – Not many opportunities to do things. Very small campus and full of communters
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus housing by Lewis University is not much better than living on campus because you still need a car to get to school. Lewis is surrounded by crop fields and quarries, so no apartment buildings are within walking distance to school. The only pro would be freedom of RA's if you have your own place, but I doubt it's much cheaper than living on campus. Also, there is nothing to do in the area that can be fun."
College Sophomore,2,"In all, there is not much to do around Lewis University. The nearby towns of Lockport and Romeoville are boring, and many people refuse to go to Joliet because they think it's unsafe. Around Lewis there is nothing but Route 53, a quarry, a prison, and corn fields. Also, even though the campus is beautiful, it's not all that big and there is almost nothing to do on campus. After living on campus for three semesters, you realize that Lewis is like high school with dorms. You can only begin to appreciate Lewis when you start commuting."
College Sophomore,2,"Out of Resident Student – i do not reside in Romeoville, i travel from chicago to attend my night classes at LewisU. there are fast food restuarants and gas stations that sell snacks. there are no student discounts"
College Freshman,2,Prices Are Expensive – prices are very expensive. i do not have a job and no not have money to buy. food. also if you buy with cash there is tax which i do not think is very fair for commuters who dont have a meal card and just want something to eat while at school.
Alum,1,"Communication is very poor with the Bursar/Business office! Prior to applying for graduation, I called and asked what I owed, and paid the amount that was told to me in full. I was able to complete my graduation application, attend the graduation ceremony, and they even mailed my diploma. I thought all was good....wrong! Nine months after graduating, I tried to obtain an unofficial transcript, and was told that I owed almost $3,000! Ummm...why was this not brought to my attention sooner.  This is the level of professionalism that you can expect from Lewis University's Bursar/Business Office. Do I recommend? I think you could do better elsewhere."
Junior,1,"Absolute joke, they were jumping through hoops with the Covid-19 situation.  My UAS professor held my mid term test for six weeks after the exam.  Only saw it two weeks before the final.  Never got back to me either by phone or emails when I had questions.  I don't think he knows what he's doing."
Junior,1,"Deep financial troubles, the university has ""lost"" $6.92 million dollars.  The leadership at the school is running it into the ground.  Over priced and over-rated.  No a scholarly institution."
Sophomore,1,"I though my previous college has some bad teacher. First semester here, every teacher does not know how to teach, is very rude, and totally non-understanding to outside situations like life and work. If this was not a required school for my 2 + 2 program, I would find a different school. On top of it they make you pay so many extra costs even though the tuition should buy ANYTHING THEY WANT"
Niche User,1,"An adjunct faculty member of Lewis recently died. This person taught at Lewis for twenty years. The faculty member taught anywhere from three to five classes a semester, what elsewhere would constitute a full class load. This person went to the annual adjunct dinner, as well as volunteered for May Institute, seminars, convocations, and panels.

Lewis's official answer to the adjunct faculty member's death was a copier paper sheet sent to the family in condolence, on which had been copied a Scripture verse, and the heading, ""On behalf of the Brothers of the LaSalle Community, I want to extend our deepest sympathies..."" That's it. A few individual colleagues took the time to offer Masses, call, attend the visitation. Not the Christian Brothers, and not the administration that represents them."
College Freshman,1,"there is no party scene here whatsoever. it does not matter if it is a week day or weekend, there are no parties or social gatherings. every one that has a car goes home on the weekends because it is more fun at home, then on campus. its very sad and I wish I knew this before I started college here. I am trying to transfer out."
College Freshman,1,It is very dead during the weekends because its a commuter school. Plus side is theres lots of ways to get to the city and party there
College Freshman,1,Campus Police are always everywhere busting kids.
College Sophomore,1,"There is never parking in the main lot or in the over flow for parking. Your best bet in trying to find a parking spot is getting there before any classes start, or right when they end having hopes that you will get a parking spot for a student leaving. I had teachers that if you were 1 minute late to class you were not allowed to enter or take a quiz or exam. Numerous students were late daily because of the parking."
College Sophomore,1,"When I first applied to Lewis I had asked what my financial award letter would be, I was told it was being reviewed. I emailed at least once a week asking if my award letter was in it. It was still being reviewed, until the middle of November I received it. My award letter was nothing I was expecting, and shortly after learned that my account was now past due, and I was not allowed to enroll in classes for next semester. I would suggest not going to this school if financial aid is a big decision on where you will be attending."
College Junior,1,Horrible if you are in the wrong spot. They give tickets almost non-stop.
College Junior,1,"There is no parties at all on campus, greek life is weak."
College Sophomore,1,Mostly fast food and junk
College Sophomore,1,"i received very little financial aid, resulting in me working more hours than i should to be able to stay in school"
College Senior,1,"There are two maybe three places to eat nearby, and they are not worth going to. The off-campus dining selection leaves much to be desired."
College Freshman,1,"The food on campus is terrible. It is so unhealthy and it tastes bad. They do provide fruits and vegetables but they are almost always bad. Not once did I eat on campus and be like oh this is really good. The only place I ever really spent my money was at the Common Grounds and even then it was all unhealthy. I was never worried about the cost of food because I had so much money on my meal card. Overall, if I could live on campus and not be forced to have a meal plan, I would do it."
College Sophomore,1,There is no transportation on campus
College Freshman,1,"Off-campus housing is not offered through the school, which in my opinion sucks."
College Freshman,1,Chicago Weather sucks. Especially for flying
College Freshman,1,I wish there was something to do... I'm bored as hell every day especially weekends. I watched 9 movies this past weekend.

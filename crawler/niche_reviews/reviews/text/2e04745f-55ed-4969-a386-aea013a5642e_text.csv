Alum,5,"I loved going to UCF. They have top notch professors, lead scientists, many extra curricular things to do (sports, outdoor clubs, their own trails, etc.) It is a very large school and parking is horrible."
Senior,5,All my classes transferred to online due to Covid and I adapted to it pretty quickly. I like the idea of not having to commute to campus every day and it gives me more time to work on other side projects that I haven't had time to commit to
Senior,5,I started attending UCF in 2015 and I'm glad that I decided to go to this college. This college was not my first option but I don't regret going here instead. I have met a lot of great professors here and long term friends. The campus has a lot to offer and I'm glad that I can utilize that.
Freshman,5,"Most of my classes have been online. The professors are doing a good job keeping up with online materials and such. One thing that I like to see change is a lot of the professors have moved completely online, where there isn't even a live zoom call. It makes some of the material harder to learn as I feel like I have to teach myself some of it. I understand that it is up to them and is their preference, but I think that zoom lectures could be beneficial for students."
Freshman,5,"So far I have enjoyed UCF. The campus is beautiful and the classes that I am in have been enjoyable. I know that with the current pandemic professors are working extra hard at ensuring quality education for students is maintained, and I truly believe that they are doing a fantastic job."
Freshman,5,"Really great professors and they help you a lot. Although its been a tough year, the professors make you feel as though you are in a classroom."
Freshman,5,I really love this school. It has many great opportunities for me to be successful and they offer so many things to do.
Senior,5,"I think UCF is a great school, easy online classes, instructions are clear, professors care.
The school has dozens of degrees to offer, and in these difficult times have created programs to help the community advance and combat the stresses being faced."
Junior,5,"I got accepted not too long ago, but I have asked some friends of mine how's the overall experience. They say their professors are really engaging and well-spoken. No regrets whatsoever."
Junior,5,"The campus is great! It's really sad that COVID-19 forced all of us to learn remotely, but I have toured the campus before we all became dormant- the campus' environment is SO dynamic and well-focused. Everywhere you go, a feeling of accomplishment and comfort is all you can ever think of. I am so happy to call this place home!"
Sophomore,5,"I love UCF for how large it is in the sense that there is always something to do on campus. That the whole place seems inviting and fun yet strives for good academics like the ton of research opportunities. As well as the amount of reached out help they offer. I love the most is its location, Orlando is the best place for absolutely everything. The beach is an hour away, Universal/Disney, downtown, etc. There is always something to do or explore. I think the only thing I would change is for a bigger push for teacher-student relationships. It can be too big where finding a mentor may be hard."
Senior,5,"I like that the professors want their students to succeed. If you confide in a professor or reach out to faculty, they make it worthwhile, by giving you amazing connections and propelling forward your academic experience."
Sophomore,5,I love how there are many things to do here and the hundreds of clubs that are available too! The school has a lot of traditions that students can participate and have fun and the professors are pretty great too.
Sophomore,5,"So far, my online experience with the university is pretty ok. UCF is doing enough on their part on their online learning platform in my personal experience. I also think that the professors are doing their best to adjust to these new circumstances, so props to them."
Freshman,5,Online classes are great at the Nicholson school. Great teachers and organized curriculum. Wonderful experience.
Freshman,5,"Great online classes, nice campus, and great area. Lots of stuff to do. Great amenities. Places to relax, study, and connect with others."
Senior,5,During the covid-19 pandemic it has made it mandatory for most of us to take classes online and i must say it has been a good experience. classes are more organized and well put together in comparison as to when we were on campus so overall I give online classes an excellent rating.
Junior,5,"I have online courses at the moment, and they are super easy to follow! The professors allow you to go at your own pace as well as answer any of your questions when needing assistance with something relating to the course. The courses are very organized through week-by-week modules, so it is much harder to get off track. It is super easy to get good grades and understand the courses because of how thorough and easy the information provided is. Also, grades are very easy to check and monitor to make sure you are doing well in the course. When it comes to doing assignments, you are given plenty of time to take and submit them, so time limit isn't a stressor. Some online courses require students to attend online lectures on a Zoom call, and those lessons are also super helpful and productive. I have had a few courses like this and the professors are always on track with the content. Overall, UCF's online courses are great!"
Junior,5,"I love everything about UCF. They're academics, sports teams, and overall energy is amazing. There isn't truly anything I can think of that needs fixing."
Senior,5,"I love my school. I love the atmosphere, and I love my hospitality teachers! I know I am right where I am supposed to be. UCF is the best."
Senior,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere of the campus as well as the students and professors that walk around campus. UCF has a great Hospitality Management degree where I am learning and networking a lot. I feel that I am very successful here.
Senior,5,"I have taken numerous online courses because I have a part-time job, and I can honestly say that my experience has been mostly pleasant. It is completely dependent on the instructor, however, all of my professors have been very specific and clear with the layout of the course- with detailed syllabi, grading scales, and outlines of general expectations. If you are a student who is able to effectively manage their time, online instruction is a great option for you at UCF."
Senior,5,"Beautiful campus, amazing resources for students, great school spirit. If you want the typical ""college"" experience, UCF is a great place to do it at. Not only is the football team notorious for their success, but the games are even more fun than it looks. They have a ""pantry"" style store for lower income students to get free grocery items, which is an amazing amenity considering the financial status of young college students. Campus is huge, but easy to navigate as it is a giant circle. Lots of opportunities to make new friends, join new clubs, acquire new hobbies, etc..."
Junior,5,There are videos of the professor lectures that explain the content well. There are recorded lectures etc.
Junior,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE I couldn't say it any other way. Making the decision to go to UCF was the easiest decision I've ever made
Freshman,5,"In the classes that I have online, my professors make the effort of being available to us when we need help with a concept or topic. They have set aside time where they encourage students to reach out and set up a zoom call or online appointment, so that we can succeed in the class."
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending school here, and one of the things that has automatically caught my attention here was how much of a community this school really is. Everyone I have met and talked to has been kind and there is a genuine respect among all of the students, faculty, and staff. I have truly been blessed by attending this school and it truly feels like a second home. I feel that I will succeed here and hopefully I will be able to continue living on campus. This school could not be more fitting for my goals because my professors and mentors truly care about my success. UCF provides services and opportunities that allow me to chase after my goals and dreams. I am grateful and proud to call myself a knight."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the diversity aspect. UCF was the most diverse university in Florida, admitting over 2,000 international students a year. They also had racially diverse clubs so that every student felt a piece of home when they were at school"
Alum,5,"I took some online classes, but not many. These online classes allowed me to have the flexibility to work, and have extra time for homework. They should allow many elective classes to be online, but not offer that for core classes."
Freshman,5,"Over all experience so far I still great I am motivated to pursue my goal, an done day be one of the graduates of knights. One changes I hope is to create campus in Port St. Lucie"
Freshman,5,"I’m taking online classes, all staff are very helpful to attend to your needs. They want to be part of our life to a hive our goal. All we need to do is commit our selves and determination."
Freshman,5,"I loved attending the University of Central Florida. Go, knights! The atmosphere of the campus is surely something all incoming freshmen need to experience. At UCF you have a wonderful night-life to balance out the courses you take on campus, it is noticeable that the teachers love doing their jobs and will help you the best they can. Since COVID-19 happened, all my classes had to be switched online because I did not want to risk getting the virus. The online courses I took we're manageable, it was something fairly new to me, but they made it help accessible 24/7."
Alum,5,"I loved being a student at UCF. The campus is incredibly clean and everyone there is exceptionally friendly.  Where I come from, we are all very proud knights and even after we graduate, our spirit still lives on. Charge on knights!"
Alum,5,Taking online classes was exceptional. The professors were knowledgeable about the subjects they were teaching and made it very enjoyable for everyone to participate in class. They foster communication amongst your peers and promote positive communication.
Junior,5,UCF is a very diverse school with a ton of activities and ways to make the students feel at home. UCF is also taking precautions for the COVID 19 pandemic going on right now.
Junior,5,"UCF is an amazing place, walking around you find students of every background spreading positivity. The only thing I would like to see change is to have professors who are kind and open-minded like the students."
Sophomore,5,"I'll give UCF's online courses a 5 star rating because I would hope it will be a great experience. I will be taking online classes this upcoming fall semester. I never had any previous experiences with UCF online classes so I cannot give any helpful feedback. However, my friend has had an online class and it seemed to go well. There were no problems at all with the learning style, from what I was told."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at UCF and am majoring in Nursing. I have had the BEST professors so far. They are always making sure that the class understands everything and the classes are very easy and understandable. The campus is also huge so you can meet many new people! There are also many ways to get involved including greek life and clubs!
Freshman,5,I prefer taking online classes because it is more convenient and all my professors were so nice and always made sure the class understood the material.
Sophomore,5,"Studying online doesn't feel any different from face-to-face courses. The professors are always very willing to help students and the material is oftentimes delivered through various methods to ensure that regardless of how you most effectively learn, you thrive in each class you take."
Sophomore,5,"Studying online doesn't feel any different from face-to-face courses.

Sophomore,5,"Since the minute I first stepped onto campus, it has been nothing but amazing. Everyone is so helpful, the campus is beautiful and the sports are fun to attend. Though I am a reserved and don't like to get out of my comfort zone, UCF has made it such an easy transition for a person like me."
Alum,5,Very friendly students. Loved group projects that stimulated real life. Studying on the quad like nothing else in this world! 5 Stars!
Junior,5,The University of Central Florida has helped me with my education. Everyone treats you very nice and makes you feel comfortable to study.
Junior,5,My online experience is very good. I take some classes online when they are not available on campus. The programs is fair easy and organized to study.
Freshman,5,"I'm enjoying my experience here at UCF. I'm a first-year college student so I haven't been on campus yet, but I'm excited to make some good memories."
Sophomore,5,there are many resources for studying and most of the professors are very good. there is also great school spirit.
Junior,5,"The school is very large with over 50,000 students. The population is somewhat diverse. The school has a myriad of resources and amenities."
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience with online classes at ucf. Not only are they flexible with my work schedule, but my instructors have been very accommodating due to the pandemic."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed the support and resources provided by the university towards student success and wellbeing.
Sophomore,5,"UCF is absolutely amazing. If your an incoming freshman and comparing colleges, really consider UCF. My freshman was everything I could of possibly ever wanted . This college is DIVERSE, there is something here for absolute everyone. The hardest part ab UCF is how big it is and you can feel very small as incoming freshman, especially out of state. As long you say yes to every opportunity  you will do fine here and have a blast! I thought the work load was tolerable and for how large UCF actually is, I believe the professors do a great job helping their students if they are reached out to. Go knights! 
Oh, don’t get the meal plan 100% not worth it"
Sophomore,5,Professors did a fine job for adapting so quickly. I thought they were all pretty understanding and provided extra help if needed.
Junior,5,"I had a lot of positive experiences ever since I started attending the University of Central Florida. A lot of research opportunities were offered to me as well as academic resources such as grants, scholarships, tutoring sessions, etc. Plus, there are a lot of social activities to do on campus. Students can go out for a jog, have lunch outside or at Memory Mall, and even catch a movie. There are also clubs and organizations students can join based on their interests and identity."
Junior,5,"After the dramatic shift from the classroom to a virtual setting as a result of COVID-19, the University of Central Florida have done a great job with the transition. It felt unusual for students to suddenly take classes online that were meant to be in person, but the professors managed to teach their courses as they would in the classroom and were able to assist students adapt to the environment and answer questions in regards to the learning objectives."
Freshman,5,I have taken several classes online and they have all been a success. The teachers I have met so far are helpful and considerate.
Senior,5,It's a huge diverse and loving school. Always an event going on at the school. The energy is so vibrant and amazing.
Junior,5,"I am a new transfer student. I will begin taking classes in 3 weeks, so I can't speak about the professors yet. 

My experience with the admissions staff and advisors has been very helpful to this point. They are good at communicating and keeping students informed, especially in this era of COVID uncertainty. 

I will be pursuing my degree using their online program, so I don't expect to have any interaction with the physical campus."
Junior,5,"My courses begin in 3 weeks, so I can't honestly rate this yet.
I am looking forward to having access to some courses which are typically held in person only, but, due to COVID, are being streamed in the fall semester.
Expecting the best!"
Senior,5,Starting Spring 2020 my classes for the reminding of my journey due to COVID-19 are fully online. I actually prefer online classes then face to face because it works better with my work and personal schedule. I like how online classes are easy to navigate and how all my teachers are interactive with us checking in to see if we need any help and just overall making it less stressful.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love it at UCF. UCF is very underrated atleast in my opinion, obviously I may be a little bias about that. However, the good thing about UCF is that it is in Orlando so it isn't like other campuses that do not have anything outside campus. There are a bunch of attractions outside you will never be bored. UCF is also very diverse it is the 2nd biggest student population in America so you definitely can find your niche here easily. Everything is so accessible and lovely. GKCO!"
Alum,4,The few online classes were good and easy to maneuver. Most teachers are quick to respond and very helpful.
Junior,4,"The University of Central Florida has been a great college experience thus far. My first two years were filled with fun football games, great friends, and a lot of learning. Once the pandemic started, UCF was quick and responsible with their actions. They were clear and helpful as they even gave out CARES money to people who needed it in this hard time. Now that campus is open once again, they have been excellent at ensuring safety and providing students with options that they are comfortable with. Furthermore, as an electrical engineering major who is minoring in math, the course selection here is great and challenging."
Alum,4,"The online courses at UCF are very interactive. The professors do a wonderful job communicating information and do allow for in-person meetings if you are having trouble. The classes do cost slightly more, but they allow for flexibility with your schedule which is a plus."
Alum,4,"UCF has great resources to help you advance your education and set you up for success in whichever career path you plan to follow. Not every professor will be a match, but rest assured that your education will be well-earned. The campus is beautiful, as it is still being remodeled yearly."
Graduate Student,4,"I also liked the online learning, the teachers were always there to help. It was easy to navigate online."
Graduate Student,4,I liked the fact that UCF has a lot of different resources on campus to help students with classes and other needs.
Senior,4,I have taken a couple of semester of online classes. For the most part they have been good. It is more of a teach yourself way to do school. If you learn by hands on learning online classes might be hard for you. If you like to work ahead and working on your own time then online classes are a good way to go.
Senior,4,This is a great school full of so many opportunities. Fun campus atmosphere. You can find any and every type of club. I have had so many job and internship opportunities because I go to the University of Central Florida. I recommend this University to everyone. Warm weather all year round and teachers that are there to help you succeed.
Senior,4,UCF offers a diverse selection of degrees and programs for the local community. It is a leader in the standards of education.
Sophomore,4,Classes online have been a huge change and shift. I would say there are plenty of professors who have handled it perfectly and others who are struggling to adjust. I think overall they have done the best they can but could try to be more lenient and understanding towards the students' adjustments.
Senior,4,"Online classes are okay, it really depends on how the teacher organizes the class. However, if you remain on top of your work and due dates, you should be in good shape."
Freshman,4,This is my first semester at UCF.  All my classes are online this semester due to COVID-19.  All my professors are doing their best to help us stay engaged and interested in our classes.  I hope to be able to go on campus next semester or next fall at the latest to get the full campus experience.
Freshman,4,All my classes are online this semseter.  My professors are very understanding and are doing their best to help since we're not able to have classes in person.
Freshman,4,"To be honest it’s kind of boring and the classes themselves are not that challenging. Also, the staff seem pretty superficial."
Senior,4,"Overall when it comes to academics it has been a good university, but my one complaint has to be the parking services. For the campus being so large , finding parking is a struggle and the parking towers are always either full or have blocked areas for some reason, so if you want to get good parking, either early morning classes or afternoon classes are the way to go."
Freshman,4,University of Central Florida is an amazing safe space for all kinds of students. We have many resources and clubs to fit every persons interests. The only bad thing about it is that we still pay full tuition for online classes. This is a great school
Freshman,4,Online learning is hard but UCF has made it a fairly easy process. We have multiple resources for help if needed and our professors give us due dates way ahead of time to ensure we have enough time to do our work despite any possible technical issues.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the variety this college has to offer. With so many students and such a large campus, there’s a place for anyone and everyone."
Senior,4,It is going well so far. I feel that the professors are giving a lot more work to compensate for not being in class. It is a little frustrating trying to learn and network while being on screen.
Senior,4,"As a returning student, I found that college w wasn't the harsh, study all the time drudge it was the first time around.  I've enjoyed my experience but would like to see more help for students in finding tuition assistance.   I know we are adults, but the integration doesn't seem to be there.  The professors are knowledgeable and fair. I found no liberal bias or pushing of agendas, just teaching.  College  has added a ""fun"" component that I think prevents burnout.  Ucf is a great place."
Senior,4,"With the virus now, a lot of classes are online.   Professors have modified courses to be more informational lookup and study.   More essays and topic discussions that involve the whole class.  For me, it cuts commute costs."
Junior,4,"There are so many ways you can learn if your teacher is too busy with so many students. There is tutoring, SI sessions that helps a lot."
Junior,4,"It was hard at first with everyone including the professors have to transition to online, but going into fall with the right preparation has been easy thanks to UCF"
Alum,4,I honestly found at mix with the online classes. It was either completely overwhelming or totally manageable.
Alum,4,Was a great school and more affordable than others. One negative was huge class sizes so attendance was not required in most classes. One on one attention is rare unless making office hour appointment.
Freshman,4,"I would not want to change anything about the University of Central Florida it is a nearly perfect campus. They have wonderful night-life surrounding the campus, not to mention the theme parks surrounding the area. UCF has some of the most amazing teachers they will assist and help you in any way they can. The atmosphere of the campus is surely something all incoming freshmen need to experience. The online courses I took we're manageable, it was something fairly new to me, but they made it help accessible 24/7."
Junior,4,"Yes, I have taken classes online. UCF is very good at making sure that all the students are able to succeed if they choose to participate in the online program."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with UCF is okay, I am still attending the school now. I am a sophomore, majoring in Criminal Justice. UCF has plenty of activities and clubs you can participate in, making your time there fun. UCF in my opinion is not the most perfect, it has problems just like any other campus. One of my biggest issues is that UCF is not diverse pertaining to people and other cultures, but the campus is very positive and is entertaining. With what the campus has to offer and the way everyone is treated with kindness and respect, it definitely makes up for what it lacks. UCF has different staff and resources, that will help you every step of the way. There is plenty of space to walk around the campus and accommodations that is offered, so you can be comfortable and feel safe. UCF cares about your safety first, which is why I choose UCF every time."
Sophomore,4,"At the beginning of this pandemic, everyone was adjusting and accommodating as much to the student's needs as possible, although it was a difficult transition we still made it through. Summer semester was easier to navigate through and I'm confident I can adapt easier to the upcoming Fall semester."
Alum,4,I loved my on line courses. Instructors were able to make homework enhance book selections which made quizzes and tests easy to study for. Instructors were easy to get a hold of and responded quickly.
Freshman,4,"I've only had one class at UCF and it was SLS 1501. This class is basically just an intro to UCF and I had no problems with this class. It was very informative and it taught me a lot of what to expect in college. My professor was pretty nice and I hope to have more professors like I her. Since we're in a pandemic, I won't be able to fully experience everything that the college has to offer, but I 'm still grateful to be apart of the community."
Sophomore,4,"The web course portal is very easy to use, and many online professor do a great job on teaching.  The school also use cengage and webassign which cost student money."
Freshman,4,So far being an online student for the University of Central Florida it has been a great experience. The people and teachers I have met so far are really nice and helpful
Senior,4,"Since starting UCF the Fall of 2018 for my bachelors degree I really liked how the school provided resources for students and work study job opportunities.  Resources like career services, the tutoring center, counseling center, food pantry, and the health center.

I would only change two main things about UCF which is lowering the prices of student housing and providing health insurance for part time students. Finding housing is one of the main things that I struggled since starting UCF along with finding health insurance with my part time work study job."
Senior,4,They use Canvas and the learning capability really depends on the professor and how they've set their classwork up.
Senior,4,The college is one of the largest and yet still struggles to provide and retain an adequate amount of professors for its students. The student population continues to grow despite the constraints.
Freshman,4,"Although I haven't been to the UCF campus yet due to COVID-19, I am extremely excited to attend this University in the Fall. The faculty and staff members seem to be very attentive and show that they care about the students and their futures."
Freshman,4,"Yes, during summer of 2020 I have taken two online classes and some far I am doing fairly well in both classes. My teachers held daily meetings via ZOOM where they answered any questions that you may need answered while providing very good notes and lectures for all students to understand."
Sophomore,4,The University is pretty great. There's a lot to do at the school. Many activities for all kinds of people.
Sophomore,4,I am currently still at UCF as a sophomore and I love every second of it. I got to meet some amazing new friends and join some great clubs that I'm sure will be in for the next couple of years.
Niche User,4,I personally do not take to online classes but the system at University of Central Florida has helped me adjust.
Freshman,4,"UCF has great professors and a very large and diverse student population. The food on campus isn't so good, but the atmosphere of hard work and diversity makes up for it."
Freshman,4,"I've only taken two classes with UCF, but the classes that they've offered through webcourses have been well instructed and I feel like I'm not missing out by going virtual instead of attending a physical class."
Junior,4,It's pretty good.  Some of the ways that their programs are formatted is a little dumb and crazy to jump through.  The coronavirus situation is not helping either.
Junior,4,The online classes are pretty good.  The professors are doing their best since everything had to go online so quickly.
Alum,4,"Amazing experience in the heart of Orlando. You have great bars, beaches within a hour drive, and of theme parks. If you need to work your way through college, there are bountiful opportunities and in a variety of sectors. You are in a little tech bubble in Orlando as well, so internships are easy to come by. Plug yourself into the school, and it will make for an amazing four years."
Sophomore,4,"Although my freshman year was cut short due to COVID-19, I had the best experience.I lived on campus in the dorms with random roommates and they became my closest friends. The dorms are clean and I was in an L shaped room so my roommate and I were not on top of one another. Academically speaking, I did really well and loved all of my professors with the exception of one whose teaching style I did not like. I highly suggest going on RateMyProfessor. UCF has a lot of amenities for students including counseling (CAPS), All Knight Study, the gym, a career center and more to keep students motivated. The dining hall food is trash if I’m being honest and I don’t suggest getting a meal plan your freshman year unless you have no way to go to the grocery store, it isn’t worth the money. The night life is great and I love going to UCF events. My biggest issue with UCF is how hard it is to pick classes, and how hard it is to contact the right person or department if you have a problem."
Junior,4,"UCF is a large school, with over 60,000 students and one of the largest campuses in the nation, there is always a club or group for students to get involved with.  Professors are quite knowledgeable and for the most part, really do want their students to succeed and come out of their classes having learned something.  The music program prides itself on producing musicians ready for the real world of music entertainment and education."
Sophomore,4,"Most of my online professors have been very easy to get along with and have been very understanding, as a student with a part time job and a lot of bills they have made it very easy to make up work and answer very quickly."
Sophomore,4,UCF is a school that will promise you that your dreams will come through with a little bit of effort. Depending on your program that promise can be a hit or miss.
Junior,4,I have taken many online classes for UCF and most of the professors work very diligently to make sure that we the students are properly learning about the subjects we enrolled for.
Freshman,4,I am currently taking online classes for the summer term of 2020. It has been flexible and manageable with the workload given. The professors are willing to reach out and communicate with students with any issues the best they can.
Freshman,4,One thing I like about UCF is the atmosphere. Student life is very vibrant and connected. Staff members and professors are amazing in making sure students are safe and are taking the right classes as well as making the most out of their college experience.
Junior,4,"The only online courses I have taken at the university are those of spring 2020 due to the cover-19 crisis. I had an excellent and easy time navigating webcourses and keeping up with all  my assignments. Professors I had made the transfer from in person to online easy, and having recorded lectures turned my whole semester around."
Freshman,4,UCF is full of amazing people and opportunities. The students are diverse and the campus feels like its own little world.
Freshman,4,I've taken the sample online classes of 2020 and they're a good indication of what's to come. I worked with a similar program at school and it was a wonderful experience. I will for sure take more classes online in future semesters at UCF.
Junior,4,Classes are very effective and evenly dispersed. For my major I have a lot of options to choose from.
Freshman,4,"I did not personally take any courses online but I did have to go through the orientation process online. Although I do not think UCF handled it perfectly, I do commend the staff members for being able to guide thousands of incoming students strictly online."
Sophomore,4,I liked how inviting and fun the campus life was when starting there as an out-of-state student. There is always something to do and there are so many resources that you have at your disposal. The people are also incredibly nice and always want to help.
Sophomore,4,The online classes I took were pretty easy. The teachers offer extra credit for some and the class layout is pretty simple. I would recommend taking in person classes for harder courses
Junior,2,"well, as excited as I was to join ucf. I was disappointed to realize that were being charges the same amount of money for remote learning as in person learning. i find it unfair for a university of such high standing to not try and help their students. we are also paying for luxuries only available during in person classes."
Junior,2,"it is my very first experience online at ucf so I cannot sat very much. teachers seem nice , however are making us buy expensive textbooks, when most information can be provided virtually without fee."
Senior,2,"I hate almost all online classes that I have taken. The professors are so used to teaching on the whiteboard that they don’t know how to make an online class engaging. If given an option, I would choose in person class, even with the risk of my health."
Freshman,2,Student/customer service was the worst quality I could have ever experienced. Dorm rooms are small and security isn’t the highest.
Senior,2,"I spent two years as an upperclassman at UCF in the CECS department, and it was a horrible experience. This school does not train you to be a ready engineer.  They do require A LOT of self-study. The professors are there to research, and they expect the same from the students. Most of the tests were math-based, and I met plenty of upperclassmen students who had no idea about the fundamental aspects of material science (i.e., water weakens concrete mix). Keep in mind, these students could do chemistry and math like champions, but they couldn't connect the math and science to the real world. It's scary to think that these are the next generation of engineers."
Senior,2,"It's a large university that, quite frankly, cannot handle its size. Instructors aren't the most willing to work with large numbers of students, and Departments are certainly ill-equipped to handle the number of students. However, if you do manage to squeeze yourself into the section of the course you need to graduate without delaying your academic plan, the instructors do a phenomenal job of conveying their interest in their disciplines."
Junior,2,"The University of Central Florida, or UCF, is an American metropolitan public research university in Orlando, Florida"
Junior,2,"I am currently a Nursing major at UCF. If I was in another field of study, say Engineering or Business, I would probably rate UCF with 1 star. . maybe no stars? There are many problems with this school, but they really all stem from one root issue: TOO MANY STUDENTS. We have over 60,000 students. I knew this when I began here, but I had no idea what a negative affect it would have on my education. The entire school seems very fatigued. Nearly all of your classes will have 400+ students in them, so there is no real opportunity to develop a relationship with your professor. Parking for a class takes over an hour. The whole place is simply fatigued. The only saving grace of this school is there are some incredible professors, but honestly. .  only a handful. And the party scene? Horrible, if that's your thing. Greek life has a really gross culture, and the 3 bars around campus are filled with 18 year olds spilling cheap beer on you. Do not come, please. Go anywhere else."
College Sophomore,2,Not a big part of campus
College Freshman,2,the police buttons around campus are easy and reachable
College Junior,2,Don't like frat houses or sorority houses.
College Junior,2,"I dont feel secure especially walking to my car at night. I know there is only so much they can do, but i feel it is lacking."
College Freshman,2,There is not a huge abundance. It is there but not very often.
College Freshman,2,Our teams are not really good. The football team has not one a game.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the off-campus fraternity houses could be mistaken as tear downs
College Senior,2,I've never been a fan of Greek life. I've seen friends lose hundreds of dollars a month to greek organizations while not getting anything out of it. I find these organizations predatory and not worth supporting.
College Freshman,2,We're not good at football
College Sophomore,2,We didn't win a single football game last season.
College Freshman,2,First year dorm Libra is pretty awful. Like prison.
College Junior,2,The football didn't win a game last season so there were not that many supporters.
College Freshman,2,"You can get a good education, you just have to find good teachers. Really mediocre overall, but with some bright spots."
College Freshman,2,"They are bad at the major sports, and the pretending to be good gets old. Everyone is either a UF or FSU fan."
College Freshman,2,"Student life can be fun, but Orlando is either boring or too expensive. The school itself is poorly run."
College Freshman,2,"Orlando has a lot of jobs in hospitality, but it is extremely competitive for good jobs."
College Senior,2,"some Greeks do good service for the community, but others think they are better just because they have Greek letters. looked down upon by non-greeks usually."
College Senior,2,"The majority of my professors at UCF have been very disappointing. I have had many classes where I have had to teach myself the material, I do not think that should be the case considering how much I am paying for the classes. I do not feel like the quality of the education offered is as good as it should be."
College Senior,2,There have been too many security incidents at UCF lately. I have been affected by the recent data breach and UCF has not taken sufficient measures to fix the issue. For the rest of my life now I will have to be aware of potential identity fraud.
College Junior,2,Greek life has gotten into a lot of trouble recently and it doesn't reflect well on any of the sororities or fraternities.
College Freshman,2,So hard to find a job on campus
College Junior,2,The party scene on campus seems really bad and practically nonexistent
College Junior,2,The party scene on campus seems practically nonexistent.
College Senior,2,I didn't like it too much.
College Sophomore,2,Our school spirit is strong but it is hard to get excited for a football team that lost every game this past season.
College Sophomore,2,Needs updating and a overhaul on pricing. A through cleaning in some places too
College Sophomore,2,Football is terrible. The rest are doing good. Management needs work
College Freshman,2,"School spirit is great, teams don't win very much."
College Sophomore,2,Safety is one of the things I am worried about due to the emails I receive about criminal activity
College Sophomore,2,"I am not a huge sports fan, I am just trying to focus on school. All I know is that our football team sucks."
College Sophomore,2,Our football team's performance this year was one of the most depressing things I have experienced in my life.
College Freshman,2,I feel like a lot of the professors here don't really care whether or not their students succeed or fail.
College Freshman,2,"Maybe most dorms are like this, but it is WAY too small.  Not enough room to put anything, it's impossible to make any food other than microwaveable, and the set-up of the rooms/bathrooms in Hercules are very inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,"University of central florida seems to have got to large to manage the influx of students that apply there, I was constantly given incorrect information, or paperwork I submitted was misplaced and I had to take more time out of my busy week to gather the paperwork to resubmit."
College Sophomore,2,"Facilities are great. Performance is okay, but because of our conference we can never actually achieve anything. in 2013-2014 our football team was undefeated, won the conference, and the best we could manage was the tostitos bowl. When we won you would have thought we won the national championship and we just stopped riding that train this last fall. School spirit is good at tailgates but when we have to actually go to the games, the stands are empty by the half."
College Sophomore,2,Class styles and sizes are frustrating.
College Sophomore,2,The worst teaching styles I have ever encountered.
College Freshman,2,"When entering a new school such as this one, it is important to have the staff there to help and support you. The staff at this school has proven to be inefficient in my opinion. I have encountered numerous occasions where they misplace important documents, overcharge there students, and ignore requests. It is crucial for a school to have a professional staff, and I feel as though the students run the university more than then the staff does."
College Junior,2,"It's difficult to find a job, internship, or opportunity for money because of the amount of competitive students. I often struggle to find service learning that I need to pass my courses."
College Junior,2,This year was rough with school spirit because of our awful football season
College Freshman,2,"I feel like southern schools in general don't offer as valuable degrees, but UCF seems respectable enough. My issue is that I have no been able to connect to any people in my field of interests, no internships, no alumni network, and unimpressive career center."
College Senior,2,"The courses themselves are fine, there are a variety of days, times, and courses.  The major problem is the professors, most definitely research your professors.  Although be warned the college of science tends to wait until the start of the semster to post who teaches what class."
College Freshman,2,"The only pro to living on-campus is the convenience of waking up 30 minutes before a class and still being able to walk in the door on time. Other than that, the buildings are old and mediocre. Nothing stands out that I would entice me to recommend on campus housing to a friend at all. The mandatory resident assistants have an eye on you, the housing rules are extremely strict and good luck if you are found in violation of them... you're getting kicked out of on campus housing. Finding a cheaper apartment 5 minutes from campus is much easier to deal with. There is significantly more freedom and you can coordinate with your friends much easier than any UCF affiliated housing."
College Freshman,2,We lost all of our football games this semester...
College Senior,2,Campus housing kind of sucks and off-campus options are expensive.
College Senior,2,"Greek life is big, it's not a make or break, and does provide opportunity, but overrall is overrated and superficial."
College Sophomore,2,we lost every game this season.
College Freshman,2,I constantly feel stressed out or that I am behind on work.
College Sophomore,2,Very little concern for students
College Senior,2,I do not like UCF at all.  I have not liked Orlando since the first week of my freshman year but somehow I stuck it out until the end!  I never feel safe in the area surrounding UCF and I have heard way too many stories of bad things happening such as break-ins and people getting mugged.  The school is not very nice and could be cleaned up a lot compared to other universities.
College Freshman,2,"It's too far from home, the student body wishes they were at UF or FSU, and academics are weak."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My favorite experience at UCF was the footballs games.  They were extremely competitive, and we would eventually go on to win the Fiesta Bowl!  The large class sizes at UCF was detrimental to my learning.  I found it hard to learn with so many other students in the same class.  Sometimes there was not even room for you inside the classroom!"
Junior,1,I have taken several classes online and I would say some professors don't care at all about the students and just throw random material together.
Niche User,1,"Bad. Not a good experience for the cost. Should have better housing, professors, food, financial aid and advisors. It’s not the best for academics. Focus is too much on sporting events."
Junior,1,I have not taken an online course at ucf. I can not comment on the experience but i would believe it to be top grade.
Niche User,1,"Worst 2 years of my life. Off campus housing sucks, traffic, difficult to make connections with professors and friends. Classes are huge and there is an interpersonal atmosphere. It's just very large and that comes with positives or mostly negatives."
Sophomore,1,I love how all these reviews act like UCF is a great school. Its terrible. Business major? Go to your local community college than this joke. All the classes are reduced seating format (Meet with your professor 5 times a semester to do group busy work). The kids at this school are the rejects of all the other Florida school so you can imagine how they are. Party scene is horrible most bars are occupied by high schoolers. Frats are nothing here either. Most kids i know spend all day in their dorm playing video games and pretending they are having the time of their life.
Freshman,1,Their financial aid system is selfish and completely unhelpful to students in need.  The housing office is also very heartless and cruel when it comes to money.
College Junior,1,The hazing is ridiculously dangerous
College Freshman,1,"The current Dorm I am in is small, cramped, no kitchen and I have unsanitary roommates."
College Senior,1,I would not recommenced this school or it's classes or professors.
College Senior,1,There's always alerts going off for safety issues it seems.
College Senior,1,"I'm not a fan of greek life. It's like a cult. If you're not in, you're out"
College Senior,1,"I've been steered in the wrong direction by advisors, ripped off financially, and they've made it so that the program I selected for grad school is unattainable due to it being at such a high tuition rate. They offer no assistance financially. I am more in debt than I thought I'd be after graduating from UCF, and I am graduating late due to being misinformed or not informed of certain expectations at all."
College Sophomore,1,I was robbed at gunpoint in a student apartment complex
College Sophomore,1,Last year we lost every single game in an epic failure of a football season.
College Sophomore,1,"I go to a certain club, and apparently I realized it's them that are right behind our room when we're on the third floor and make too much noise all the time, yet once they complained about OUR noise, when we never complained to anyone and kept it to ourselves . . ."
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks suck. They take up space and are loud, smelly, drunks."
College Junior,1,Crime is a huge problem
College Junior,1,They are a awful team with poor morals
College Junior,1,"My boyfriend was assaulted by a group of pledges as part of their ""hazing."" Disgusting."
College Freshman,1,didn't win one football game
College Sophomore,1,Not a fan of the Greek life. A frat house at UCF was caught hazing the boys and got in big trouble from what I hear.
College Freshman,1,Team performance this year was terrible. Not the best way to get freshman excited about their 4+ year journey.
College Sophomore,1,We lost all games last season (football).
College Student,1,50% of the curriculum will not assist me at all with my career!
College Junior,1,"I am not the person to do drugs or smoke as I ave no desire too. However, I am offered these and encounter these on a daily basis."
College Junior,1,I personally do not involve myself in greek life. Most individuals that I have come in contact with that are involved in Greek life have a very snobby and I'm-better-than-you attitude. Greek life is ridiculously expensive and can be a huge distraction from academics.
College Freshman,1,I hate greek life. I think it's stupid.
College Junior,1,"I love my college, it's definitely does stand for opportunity."
College Senior,1,It is probably the most frustrating school to have a loan taken out.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office at UCF is second to none when defining a place for the most horrid student experience. The staff is terribly incompetent, poorly trained, and rude. They can never give anyone a straight answer and only respond when a parent calls and makes a scene about expediting the aid process. At 23 years old, I should be treated as an equal and a valid customer of the financial aid office, there is no need for my mother to call when in need of a straight answer. Yet after countless attempts via phone, in-person, and email, no one can answer my questions or provide me with a meager level of assistance."
College Freshman,1,I don't qualify for financial aid yet paying for school is a struggle because may family isn't wealthy.
College Sophomore,1,"I would not choose this school again. Not only did I have to fight for credit for previous course work, but it was like starting a four year degree all over again. (and I already have an A.A.S.) The cost is not worth the title on the degree anymore. The amount of strain and stress of dealing with trying to get things done-especially for what I am paying is ridiculous. I did not feel like an individual student at any time but rather a number they had to get out to keep up their reputation. They charge extra fees for taking on-line classes, when essentially that should be cheaper. Currently one class whose actually cost is about $300 is $700 because of non essential fees-which you cannot decline. Technology fee, an extra $100+ for distance learning, differential tuition fee, health fee, athletic fee (even though I do not use the gym etc. during semesters as a distance learner), and the list goes on adding up to more than $350 for each class taken."
College Junior,1,Very hard to get financial aid
College Junior,1,yes its close. If you want to take out another loan to live there.
College Junior,1,so hard to find any scholarships
College Senior,1,"The bars around campus are trashy and gross.  Downtown itself isn't too much better either.  I'm sure there are a few hidden gems, but I haven't found them yet."
College Sophomore,1,"Needs based. You can work really hard, and most scholarships require that fasfa shows that you need money."
College Freshman,1,I have absolutely no FA and I am out of state with no scholarship
College Junior,1,The pros of living off-campus is that you can live alone and have some privacy along with a kitchen to cook some actually food.
College Junior,1,"The entire Orlando area, including UCF main campus has been experiencing extreme crime and is definitely in need of higher police presence. Stabbings, shootings, robberies, and kidnappings are only a few weekly occurrences. The UCF alert text system is reliable, but often very vague."
College Junior,1,this university needs to build another garage since there are so many students enrolling this year.
College Sophomore,1,"There are so many robberies, parking is so hard to find, parties all the time, and a cap on utilities."
College Sophomore,1,There are no cameras in the parking garages and people are constantly getting robbed or raped
Recent Alumnus,1,"I went to Knightros with my friend last Tuesday. The cost for breakfast was about 8 dollar and the cost for lunch was about 5 dollar. My friend really wanted to have egg in the breakfast section so she paid the 8 dollar. However, they have already finished the transaction and take away all the eggs for lunch section. We thought that was really unfair and felt like being lied to."
College Senior,1,Since I am a international student there aren't as much options of scholarships to choose from. Even if so they're only able to pay for books but never able to cover out of state tuition.
College Freshman,1,"I am paying ridiculously overpriced out-of-state tuition, and it seems like all of my friends I've made on campus have received financial aid that covers much of their greatly reduced in-state tuition, and they're abusing it by struggling to keep it by maintaining their GPA. I personally find it ridiculous because I pay so much more than them, received almost no aid other than a subsidized loan, and my GPA is a remarkable 4.0."
College Sophomore,1,I cannot stand that something as non-education related as sports overshadows the very reason for a university: To be taught and LEARN.
College Student,1,"Its not bad at all, but they are some complains that i have."
College Student,1,Its not the worst in the whole word. But they are rooms for more improvements
College Senior,1,this is a bad habbit to create. it will never have a positive impact on anyones life.
College Junior,1,I honestly hate school here because I am in majority lecture capture classes and I would much rather be in a small class that talks and gets involved than not going to class and watching online.
College Junior,1,"Greek life is great, but ucf is too strict and makes it impossible to have fun because they dont want to ruin the reputation of UCF."
College Junior,1,"It is just extremely difficult to do, and they are always denying certain things that I need. I used to get the full amount of financial aid, and after they cut me back I will be in huge deficits with my loans. I had to take three and my mom had to take one as well. The financial aid is always a huge wait, and they barely help you because they are concerned with getting through as many people as possible."
College Junior,1,"I had lost my bright futures for some reason and it took me forever to get it back. I called the state and they told me that UCF had to do its part, I called UCF and they referred me to the state. I went back and forth many times. The people who work at the office aren't helpful either. They yelled at me for questioning them. I had to talk to the Ombuds to get my money back."
College Junior,1,Visit Orlando but don't stay here. It's horrible and I hate it.
College Junior,1,Party way too much and that is why u can't finish.
College Junior,1,"Don't live at University House, that is all I can say."
College Sophomore,1,I have never lived on campus.
College Junior,1,Due to my situation it was a hassle for me to apply for financial aid. I am currently taking classes but I pray that my financial aid does come through if not I would have to drop out of school and work until next semester.
College Senior,1,They took it away for me. I'm desperate for money.

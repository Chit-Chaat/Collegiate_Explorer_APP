Junior,5,"I have taken my fair share of online courses at WNC, and my overall experience was pretty good. I would say that it really depends on which class and professor you have online. I had taken a finanical accounting course online my first semester of college and it was much more difficult than I would have imagined because I did not have that in person one on one with the professor, however I have also taken an anthropology course in which the professor would post lecture videos every week, which was very helpful. I think that with this who pandemic thing going on and many more classes going online many students will struggle and so will the professors, but I think out of all the classes I have taken online and will in the future at WNC are great and the professors make it very easy to get in touch with any questions or needed help."
Sophomore,5,"The students are great, the classes are challenging, but well worth it in the end once you get your associates degree. It's a good stepping stone for those who do end up going onto a university. I have to admit there have been quite a few people who stay at the community college and never go onto finish a bachelor degree."
Sophomore,5,I love this school. The size is manageable and the staff are dedicated to their students. The professors lend out a hand that is helping but structuring in order to form students that can think for themselves and succeed in academic and career atmospheres.
Niche User,5,I have only been going to WNC for a couple years and mostly online but its been a great experience. The professors are incredible and the campus is lovely.
Freshman,5,nestled along the mountains in the valley of Nevada this great college offers help with whatever you may be experiencing problems with while attending school. they have helped set me on the right track to transferring and obtaining my degree.
Sophomore,5,"The community is excellent at this college. I also really appreciated the library and tutoring center who all really helped me throughout the semester. Not to mention the teachers who all are super accommodating and want you to succeed in their class. One thing that could be improved is the bookstore as they almost never had the books I needed and if I ordered them, they rarely came before I needed them even if I had ordered them way before the semester started. Go attend this college but get your books from somewhere else or you'll regret it."
Freshman,5,"I just recently finished my first semester of college (which was small due to the fact that I had dual enrollment in college and high school) with WNC, and I cannot begin to express the great experience I have in being here!  The academics are a blast, and the professors care about the well-being of the students.  For anyone just getting started with the rigors of college, Western Nevada College is the place to start!"
Freshman,5,"It overall has been a good experience, but I highly recommend really researching your professors before enrolling to get a good experience out of it. I do wish there were more diversity in professors and students as well."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Western Nevada College partaking in their “Jumpstart” program. Basically, through this institution, I am able to take duel credit high school/college classes as a junior. I am enrolled in 15 credit semesters and am a full time student. WNC has made attending college at an early age extremely easy! The staff and instructors are so helpful and honest and are always there for you. I feel welcome and accepted. I am receiving and amazing education for a wonderful price. I absolutely love WNC."
Freshman,5,"So far, the college is excellent. I have gotten many answers to questions I have had, counselors are knowledgeable and helpful, and the financial aid off is very helpful for all of the financial advice to help pay for school. The campus is small, yet sprawling."
Junior,5,"As a senior in high school, I was accepted into a Jump Start program at Western Nevada College.  The transition from being a senior in high school to a freshman in college felt so comfortable with the help of my instructors and the resources Western Nevada College provides for their students. 
Western Nevada College is a great college for someone to expand their education. There are many classes where students can choose to explore their interests. The counselors at Western Nevada College are such great guiders. They do their job at a beyond and lead their students to big successes."
Freshman,5,WNC is by far the best value in Colleges.  You get a great education without the huge University cost.  They offer all kinds of Technical programs and well as degrees.
Freshman,5,Western Nevada college is definitely getting a good bang for your buck. Its a good way to get 1 on 1 interaction with your teachers. I love the atmosphere their. Although I must say one of the things that me out about this school is there is no sport teams or student clubs. Beside that when it comes to education and the staff I recommend attending this school for someone seeking to get their associates and eventually transferring
Freshman,5,Western Nevada Community college has a lot to offer. The campus has numerous computer labs for students to utilize and free tutoring services. Each building has its own charm and gives a welcoming experience for anyone looking for a college education. My overall experience has been nothing but positive and I look forward to the coming semesters as I continue to pursue my major in Computer Science.
Freshman,5,"It's a great college that encourages your interests. All of the professors I've had have been really helpful with easing me into the college life, and are willing to help you with almost anything."
Niche User,5,Went through the program to get my GED in less than a month. The instructors and staff involved in this program are fantastic!
Sophomore,5,Western Nevada is great at showing their students how they can succeed in life. They actually go out of their way to help their students aucceed. The only thing that i would like to see changes in is more extracurricular activities.  Thos would allow students to create better connections and friends.
Niche User,5,"Western Nevada College has great counselors that help you figure out what is needed to graduate early, transfer, and continue your education."
Junior,5,The small class sizes and teachers who care make it possible for everyone to be successful in college. I just wish there was a bigger selection of classes to choose from and more times that classes are available.
Sophomore,5,The campus is great there is a lot of places in which you can study and do your work. Its peaceful the people around are very friendly.
College Senior,5,My classes are very well scheduled and seem to have a good balance between the work loads of each class.  The flexibility I have to choose from when picking classes allows for me to have many options and allows for a less stressful decision making and allows for my daily schedule between work and school to be uninterrupted or changed drastically.
College Senior,5,All of my professors are real caring and compassionate and have a love for their job which makes loving the class a whole lot easier!
College Freshman,5,I haven't taken any online courses yet.
College Sophomore,5,I personally work as a work study at the Veterans Resource Center and love my job. I get to help Veterans who are new go the school  on how to apply and also get benefit information. There are also many other student worker positions avaible for students that can really help with financial needs.
College Senior,5,"Since the beginning of my junior year I have attended Western Nevada as a Jump Start student, giving me the ability to begin my college education before leaving high school.  It has been wonderful, my professors have always treated me like an adult and are more than willing to help me figure out who I want to be and how I can get there.  Yes, it has been extremely difficult and at times I admit, I felt like giving up.  However, with the college's help, I've pushed through and am well on my way to being who I want to be."
College Senior,5,"Most of the classes have many hours you can choose from ,but i dont like that others only have one class and one hour to choose from."
College Senior,5,The professors here are very qualified and straightforward trained with technology.The courses offered had many varieties although they could use more.The class sizes were not too big nor too small that you get more attention.
College Senior,5,The process to go into college was plainly simple and very straightforward.The paperwork was not overwhelming enough to have a heart attack.The campus also did a great work with tour and student orientation which was fun.
College Senior,5,"The academics offered at the college are great.My proffessors are understanding and very attentive when you need help or have questions.The registration process is easy and handable.Special study options could be more opened ,for there is limited help there."
College Senior,5,"My specific Major at my school is my basic AA for Social Work.The workload is hand-able ,for I am a full time student here.The curriculum is greatly understandable and great.The facilities are always clean and student study friendly.There are some job opportunities ,but not the best."
College Senior,5,I really like the student study center where they help you with homework and study.I love the library which has many online books and research opportunities.
College Sophomore,5,"Tuition is very cheap, is easy to pay of with a job"
College Freshman,5,They give you free money.
College Student,5,"I have really enjoyed my first year of college. It was challenging, but yet I enjoyed it. I have met some amazing new friends and I really enjoy the atmosphere of college life."
College Junior,5,The only thing I dislike is that you have to pay for it.
College Freshman,5,They took me step by step through the whole process.  Answered all of my questions fully.
College Freshman,5,Students are willing to help everyone even if they do not know each other.
College Freshman,5,I love the fact that if the on-campus library does not have what I am looking for they have many other connections to receive it.
College Freshman,5,"The Wi-Fi is fast and reliable.  The library offers many different types of computers and programs.  The use of personal computers are optional, but are highly recommended in the classroom."
College Freshman,5,I am receiving the best education.  They have helped me to file all financial aide paperwork and have workshops to try and receive scholarships.
College Freshman,5,Many people are going to this school to become an RN. I can not wait to join the nursing program.
College Freshman,5,There are many classes to choose from and different teachers and schedules also.
College Freshman,5,It is very personable school.  Perfect size classes.  I am very blessed to go to such a great school so close to home.
College Freshman,5,"My experience with working out my schedule has been amazing. The classes were easy to find and there were many options to most classes. It was easy to find classes in the morning, afternoon, evening, and night classes. There was always someone to talk to for assistance and my counselors helped me out a lot. Overall it was a very pleasant experience."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall I give WNC 5 stars because of the friendly, informative staff and flexible classes. The campus is kept clean and well organized as well as the classrooms. I believe that my college stands out from other schools in the way of which the staff and students interact with one another. There is mutual respect and care when it comes to the staff and students of WNC."
College Junior,5,"The community support, the competitive sports, the high academic expectation, and the close proximity to my family."
College Junior,5,"The layout of the campus is very student friendly.  Resources are close, the athletic fields have easy access, and the availability of the gym is convenient."
College Junior,5,WNC has a great baseball program incorporated with a high GPA expectation by the coach.  Our baseball team as been ALL ACADEMIC every year except since the program started.
College Junior,5,"There are a variety of majors and minors to choose from and the counseling department is very instrumental in making sure degree requirements are met, and that times do not interfere with athletes and their sports."
College Junior,5,I received a baseball scholarship which helped substantially with my finances.
College Junior,5,"Big variety of athletic and academic student body, never a dull moment."
College Junior,5,Class flexibility has worked well with my baseball schedule so far.
College Junior,5,"WNC is a great athletic/academic college, and I am honored to be playing baseball here and earning a college education."
College Senior,5,"I have noticed that there are several places to study and relax at our school.  I do not ever have any problem finding a quiet place to study, hold review sessions with classmates, or go over flashcards.  Since the new construction of ADA-compliant walkways, and the addition of crosswalks, I really enjoy walking around campus to clear my mind or get to where I need to be on time.  I find the Library to be a great place to study and use computers.  The student center is where I enjoy a snack and study.  Overall, I really like what WNC has to offer its students that spend time on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely adore their online classes! Especially the ones where they are completely self paced. It allows you to do the work as you want to, as quickly/slowly as you want to, and get the grades you feel you deserve. Definitely easier to communicate with instructors, and possible to get A's!"
College Senior,5,my goal is to graduate with my associates degree in deaf studies..my teachers work very hard to make sure students like me will be focused on starting a career as  an American  sign language interpreter. they teach the students the  skills they need and help the students learn what to expect  when they go into their new careers. it's a career I am looking forward to thanks to the teachers at western Nevada college
College Sophomore,5,They were very nice and showed my mom and me everything I would need to know for the school and the places I need to go to get things done with.

College Senior,5,i have been able to attend school full time only because of the wonderful grants and student loans that i have taken advantage of.  my personal budget at home is very tight but my daughter and i both know that we can do this. the outcome will benefit her life as well as mine. i am excited about going out in the world and making a difference no matter how small it is.
College Junior,5,"I just found out today that not only do I have enough credits for my general studies degree, but that I am a mere 3 classes from an arts degree as well!"
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, I had a great experience with the community college from professors to the staff. The staff made it as stress free through the process of applying for college and learning how to navigate financial aide to campus. The teacher were amazing and personal with their teaching styles. Helped me push through and finish college at a steady and consistent pace."
Graduate Student,4,With my online classes I successfully succeed and found my grove through these classes with time. I was taking about half of my classes online as I did work a full time job. Being able to go to work and school was a goal I had and accomplished with being able to go remotely online. The professors were amazing online I felt as I learned just as much if It would’ve been in person.
Junior,4,I really like all the different courses offered at Western Nevada College and the affordable price of courses. I would like to see more interest from the counselors in their students.
Sophomore,4,Western Nevada College has many amazing professors and overall good atmosphere. The counselors are great! They really help you in choosing the right classes for you or to help plan out how to transfer to a 4-year university.
Sophomore,4,"Many instructors hold Zoom meetings for their online classes, which is pretty typical for an online class. Most online classes are manageable. However, there are a few instructors who I feel assign too much work, which I’m not sure if it is to compensate for the amount of time that would be spent in a traditional classroom setting. But either way, most classes are alright."
Sophomore,4,There were decent online course options facilitated through the Canvas medium. The instructors put a lot of time and effort into formulating curriculum.
Freshman,4,Western Nevada College is the ideal first stepping stone for greater endeavors as it supplies a great campus with an amazing atmosphere of support and much more at times. Nothing seems to be done that cuts corners around campus and though like most colleges some professors are a hit or miss ultimately it comes down to the student and I personally love it.
Sophomore,4,I am currently in my third semester of WNC. I like it a lot due to the smaller class sizes and smaller campus. The biggest negative of this school is getting help from the counselors can be extremely difficult at times. Overall it’s a really good experience and they offer good programs.
Sophomore,4,This school is great. The teachers are friendly and helpful and the classes are no more than 25 students. With the classes being so small it is easy to ask questions. Overall this college is all I’ve known but it is great to me.
Freshman,4,"They have an outstanding people-orientated culture. Help is everywhere you need it! Being a Freshman in college I was nervous to start, but WNC made it a very welcoming experience. I knew where to find my classes and how to make my way around campus. The professors are really good at what they do, and classes are small so you get more one on one time with the professor."
Freshman,4,"I am just starting at the Fallon campus, but all the help I have gotten is great.

I will write more when I have been there at least 6 months."
Freshman,4,"I'm in the program Jumpstart which allowed high schoolers to take college classes. This program saves money and helps kids get used to college work all while staying with their parents. Overall I enjoy jumpstart so far, and can't wait to start my second year next year when I have grown even more through this experience."
Senior,4,"Nestled against the soaring Serria Nevadas and overlooking the quaint capital city of Nevada, Western Nevada College is a (literal) step above the rest when it comes to community colleges. The teachers are in general passionate, well-educated individuals, who are genuinely invested in helping their students succeed. The school staff are accessible and knowledgeable, the campus is clean, and there's plenty of parking. WNC is a great choice for anyone looking to take some affordable, educational classes."
Sophomore,4,"Western Nevada College was the perfect starting college for me. I really like the Jump Start program that is offered, allowing high school students to get college credit. This is a small school that is the perfect place for getting a start on your college education. The classes are engaging and the teachers are good."
Sophomore,4,"I attended Western Nevada College for almost two years now. I enjoyed the safety and quiet environment. One thing I would like to change is the improvement of the college feeling. The college does not feel like a college, just a simple place where your're forced to learn."
Sophomore,4,"Western Nevada community college is a great college many people use it to get into nursing program and then move on to Unr' s program . Seconds biggest would be it's trade programs. Automotive, welding,machine tool and computer technology . Great programs great teachers . I know im just hitting the most popular area's that I know of."
Sophomore,4,It is a great community college that is just what people need to start off their college journey before entering a four year institution. The staff do their best to help students improve their knowledge in their courses by providing extra help and also had a student center with tutors for free.
Freshman,4,With online classes I would like some more on time interaction between the teacher and the student. Right now my online classes are behind on grades and class work by the week. Overall the best experience I have had is with the Latino outreach group that the college has to reach out to Latino students who are first generation college students in their family. This groups has been very helpful when it comes to getting challenging enough teachers because I have already taken some of the classes I have to take as core classes.
Sophomore,4,Faculty and staff are very friendly and helpful and the campus has great classes and opportunities to offer.  The only reason I would not give this community college five stars is the hassles I have had to endure getting financial aid for my classes.  In the end I received my aid however there was a lot of useless steps and directions given in the process.  All in all a great place to get the first two years of a degree done at little to no cost  out of pocket.
Sophomore,4,Western Nevada College has provided me with an inexpensive two-year degree. I am generally pleased with my experience here and have been able to take courses that go towards my degree as well as are enjoyable.
College Senior,4,The online class server Canvas is used and that definitely makes the online classes hassle free.  Canvas has excellent tech support and the layout is user friendly and easy to navigate.  I prefer the in person courses as you gain that personal feelning when you are surrounded by peers instead of just a monitor.  The online classes however are set up to make it as interactive as possible which is nice.
College Senior,4,many of the courses here are job or career oriented so they are geared towards helping students in their intended future field of work.  The courses provide the needed information and are very thorough and well put together as well.
College Senior,4,All of the resources for students on and off campus are helpful and informative.  A great thing about Western Nevada is their website online.  The website is easy to navigate and provides plenty of information for students.  The student center is well designed and geared towards students and provides many resources for achieving success.
College Senior,4,Professors stick to their curriculum and really care about the further education of students.
College Senior,4,"So far I have been very impressed with the care and compassion of the professors here.  The grounds are kept well and the classrooms are hardly ever overcrowded, and when they are overcrowded they are always for popular classes so sign up as soon as possible to guarantee your spot in the class!"
College Freshman,4,Scheduling isn't difficult but hopefully have a flexible schedule.
College Freshman,4,I didn't fail any of my classes
College Freshman,4,I enjoyed being able to say that I successfully finished my first year of college without much problem.
College Freshman,4,First college to attend and found it extremely enjoyable.
College Junior,4,"I am able to work a full time rotating shift (4 nights, 3 off, 3 days, 1 off, 3 nights, 3 off, 4 days, 7 off) and successfully participate in discussions and other homework requirements."
College Junior,4,"The workload is about the same as for an on campus student, you just do not have the ""seat time"" requirement in quite the same way. Instead of going to class and participating in the discussion or instruction, you instead log onto the campus website, and post your discussion information and reply to other students' postings."
College Junior,4,"As an online student, I feel that I miss most of the interaction on campus students receive. However, the professors try very hard to keep in contact with the online students, so that we don't miss as much of that interaction."
College Junior,4,"There are some classes that are very demanding, and others that are more relaxed. All are fun to learn from."
College Junior,4,There are a lot of online classes available. I am learning from and connecting to my professors from 200 miles away!
College Sophomore,4,I love the wide variety of classes and times for classes offered. I  know a lot of full time students who also work full time and they never seem to have a problem coming back each semester.
College Sophomore,4,In 2003 I started taking classes through WNC's construction program and upon completion in 2005 I had a job in gardnedville ranchos with Builders of Western Nevada. The opertunity and education was great and the job hiring was right away.
College Sophomore,4,I love the small classes offered at WNC.  Professors are highly knowledgeable and love to help students in their free time. The acdimic skills center also provides a great resource for students who need help. Also the library provided has great computers and vast array of books.
College Sophomore,4,The degree that I I'm pursuing at Western Nevada College is in Asociate of Science. I get to take a ton of great science classes with professors who love their jobs.  These higely educational and interesting classes keep me glued to my seat and itching for more.  Field trips to local areas help students use what they have learned in a class environment and apply it to real world situations.
College Sophomore,4,I love attending Western Nevada College.  The professor's are amazing and always eager to help students. The college also offers a free tutor center for all classes and has great hours for students. The student body is great with students eager to learn and apply their selfs to a better life.  While working at the college at the Veterans Resource Center I vet to meet a wide variety of Veteran students who help mentor myself and other new students.
College Senior,4,"There is definitely a wide variety of courses to participate in and all of the professors are very outgoing and have fun with their career. The classes tend to run on the smaller size which helps with office hours and the quality of the content taught, however, I feel like many of the professors could handle much larger classes while still maintaining similar results."
College Senior,4,"Even though this is my first college experience it was everything I could have asked for, and more. The professors are extremely easy to get along with and they genuinely care about your success. They are always willing to help whenever possible with about anything that you can ask them."
College Senior,4,The professors are good at what they do.  They know how to teach properly and they are friendly and easy to approach.
College Senior,4,This school has a small campus.  It's easy to get around on foot and everyone is so friendly. The professors are good at what they do and they know what they're teaching.
College Junior,4,There is a large variety of class times available throughout the week as well as online classes available for a variety of subjects. There is a job of flexibility and one could fit their education around any schedule that they may have.
College Junior,4,The post grad services at this school are great. The counselors at the school are available and willing to help with all of the transferring needs and even have certain classes that are required for other universities in the area listed so that students know what to take in advance. For students not wanting to transfer the school has job opportunities around campus as well as on the website.
College Junior,4,"I think that there is a lot of value in a degree from this school. Although there aren't many employers recruiting on campus, this school enables students to transfer to other universities after receiving a degree to further their education. They also have great programs, such as nursing, that help students go right into the work force after receiving their degree."
College Junior,4,"The class size varies between subject but I haven't been in a class where it was overwhelmingly large. The classes are usually adaptable and enable everybody to learn. There is a large variety of classes that you could take at this school and almost all can be applied to whatever degree you're trying to attain one way or another. I've had both good and bad experiences with professors at this school. I've had one professor that has been incredible and whom I've learned a lot from. I could really apply things learned in his class to real life as well as my academic future. I've also had a professor who wasn't my favorite and strayed from the syllabus and class description a lot. A lot of useless, irrelevant information was given and it was honestly a waste of time. Professors are really hit and miss but most of them are really great and want to help you learn. They make themselves available to you."
College Junior,4,There were plenty of courses that could be applied to my specific major. There were specific courses and more generalized courses that surrounded the major and they were made available at numerous campuses and times to fit everybody's schedules.
College Junior,4,"It's generally a good place to go to school. The campus is pretty easy to navigate and they have a lot of resources to help one be successful. It's very hit or miss professor wise and I've personally had professors who genuinely want to help and make themselves available as a resource, and I've had a professor who clearly didn't care at all and gave us irrelevant information that was not needed for success in the class. Overall it's a great and affordable place to start continuing education."
College Freshman,4,I like the reward for taking 5 classes each semester.
College Junior,4,Very helpful staff. understanding and caring.
College Senior,4,For my first school I like it a lot it is nice size classed but classes have gone up in price.
College Senior,4,"My school is very affordable beings it is a junior college. ALso, everyone is very motivating and pushes you to be the best you can be. It i s a great learning environment for students."
College Senior,4,WNC is a great school to attend. It could use more class times but overall its wonderful.
College Sophomore,4,Classes are fun and easy to follow.
College Senior,4,One of the best thing the college offers is a great locally owned cafe which has great healthy and affordable food.I would choose the school again because of the class sizes and how affordable it is.I do not find it unique that during summer some classes are too hot to be in.
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled in a program which will transfer directly to any Nevada Higher Education School. I will be working toward my Degree of Applied Sciences, and I will be transferring to University of Nevada Reno to obtain a Bachelors of Applied Sciences. Everything to this point has been straight forward in my application process. My expectations on behalf has been set in a straight forward and easy to understand manner."
College Sophomore,4,This school is extremely affordable while many schools in the United States cost at least double what I'm paying here. The majority of students here are much more friendly than those you would meet on larger campuses. It's much easier for me to socialize here than colleges I have attended in the past simply because it's much easier to run into and know everyone here.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes aren't too large that it feels overwhelming, our professors are extremely helpful and they definitely want students to succeed. The course selection here seems typical of a Community College. There is a wide range of courses to choose from, and many technical programs to take advantage of as well. Class styles seem to be fairly typical lecture based classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school has several technical programs which I feel will be beneficial to the students. I myself am working toward my Comp-Tia A+ certifications while working toward my associates of applied sciences. Few employers will proactively recruit on campus, most employers will post flyers on public billboards and advertise career fairs, however, I haven't noticed any hiring events on campus."
Freshman,2,"Teachers are disrespectful, don't have patience with students, only go teach because it's their job."
Freshman,2,Financial aid office was not very helpful with filling out the form or answering any questions.  The counseling office was trying to advise me to go into a direction that would not be beneficial to my continuing education past this school. I would never get called back when asking for information.
Sophomore,2,"While their Advising Dept. is wonderful, Financial Aid is mostly staffed with student that don't REALLY know what they're doing.  Frustrating.  Campus is nice, facilities nice, but online courses were mostly a HUGE disappointment.  I got very little response from the professors and several seemed to think that since the course is online, they must BOMBARD you with assignments.  I DO NOT recommend online here."
College Sophomore,2,"All this school has to really offer are things that are part of the Career and Technical Education Department. Nursing being the strongest, then business, then computer technology, then automotive/welding. Anything else is basically just a side class or transfer classes to another higher up college like University of Nevada Reno."
College Senior,2,"I did not enjoy the online classes available.The classes are really different from a classroom,for there is not relationship with the teacher nor the students.The teacher also never talks or refers to you which is much to say they just assign things that they think you should know which you don't. They also assign too much assignments that are impossible to do."
College Freshman,2,The tutor center need more tutors in subject that student don't understand (however the tutor need to under it too) like chemistry for instance there is not help that understand any of the work.
College Senior,2,Western Nevada College really doesn't do much for graduates.
College Student,2,There are not a lot of classes available in Fallon.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Since Western Nevada College is a small campus, there are not many opportunities for it to be set apart from other schools.  There is not a wide sense of school pride.  For example, few students wear clothing to demonstrate and support school spirit.  Few events occur throughout the school year and only with minimal attendance."
College Student,2,My major is Psychology but at Western Nevada College I am considered a Liberal Arts major. I just had to transfer there I have a year then I can transfer to a University
College Junior,2,"most resources are online, and if you dont have a computer you are basically out of luck"
College Junior,2,"There are always issues with the computer network. It doesn't work in every building, and not in every room of the buildings where its supposed to work. The network isn't very well integrated either, you need a completely seperate login to go online than for anything else."
College Sophomore,2,They do no work with students to get more classes and different teachers to teach the pre nursing technical classes. Have done lots of sheets of signatures from other students to get classes added and it never happens making it hard to take the classes you need. Also need some different teachers.
College Junior,2,"Our school is truly ordinary and rather behind for wanting to transform itself into a grad school. About the only thin WNC offers is a scholarship, and free parking.  The city provides a bus route."
College Junior,2,"I understand that times are hard but this is still a college campus and 10 cents a page gets expensive, and only two buildings on campus have wi-fi. Which makes doing your work a pain in the but and very inconvenient.  If you go to the library it is always crowded due to a lack of computers, they now have laptops one can rent but they are not very good and tend to fry fast."
College Sophomore,2,"Only Night Classes – I'm a morning person. This college has no morning classes, only 4 days a week, and not much variety. I had a problem choosing classes because each class only has one section per semester."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Enough Focus from the School – I was a Musical Theatre major and am among five of my graduating class. The program is being cut due to insufficient funding from the state. 

What was taught for this degree was fairly basic, and although it was an easy and fun degree to obtain, it didn't provide me with (in my opinion) enough knowledge to amount to an Associates degree."
College Sophomore,2,"Worth It – Education is worth it, but it would seem admin is not quite up to par for the most part, or thier system for 2012  isn't working right still waiting on laon stuff to go through, after three months"
College Student,2,"They have everything that a college should have, but its nothing special."
College Senior,2,"Not Much in Career Center – I went to the career center to see what kinds of jobs might be available to me post-graduation, and I hate to admit there wasn't much that would challenge me or teach me anything relevant to my career of choice. This may be due to Carson being such a small town."
Freshman,1,"Professors are great. Round about Cafe is wonderful- great staff and food. Lifted Cafe had numerous health violations, staff was rude. 

The Faculty is not here to help you whatsoever.  The Dean of Students Scott Kinkella is a liar and shows bias based on gender. The head of the Student Government Lilly Leon Hicks will also go to great lengths to show bias towards gender. 

This school has stolen close to $1000 from me and still refuses to pay me back. Since then I've attended Truckee Meadows Community College and it has been a much better experience."
College Sophomore,1,"Even though my math class was in seat, she forced us to pay $100 to turn in any homeworks, quizzes and tests she assigned. She did not let us use any calculators for the class and was gone for most of the semester but somehow she believed we could teach ourselves advanced algebra. Many teachers who provide online courses are unforgiving, mess up their own assignments but expect the students to adhere to their word even though the teacher messed it up. DO NOT TAKE ONLINE COURSES HERE!!!"
College Senior,1,"I get no scholarships and no aid, even though I'm an independent, single student working and going to school full time."
College Student,1,"There is no career center, alumni network or internship connections."
College Sophomore,1,They are very high and that makes this school more expensive when it should be lower rates for students.
College Junior,1,"communication is poor...the system doesnt notify you of issues, it only locks you out and you have to guess what's wrong OR call them and hope they call you back before school starts so you don't miss out on a semester."
College Sophomore,1,there is a very poor selection of classes. especially for the students who have to take classes at night because of work. i was trying to change programs but couldnt because of the lack of classes available
College Sophomore,1,i have never recived fin aid. the classes most of the time get cut short or half the teachers dont know how to teach there subjects.
College Senior,1,It was ridiculous trying to get my aid whenever I was a college freshmen. I had to make the people in the financial aid office search for my transcript and my aid information. I almost didn't go to school because they lost my information. Horrible process. Huge waste of my time. I wish I would have gone somewhere else.
College Sophomore,1,Classes Are Full – I'm a nursing major and while the classes do prepare you for certification it doesn't let many students in at a time and they are very difficult to get into.  It is impossible for a working student to complete the nursing program.
College Student,1,"You Ain't from Around Here – If your a resident tuition is very reasonable, however if your not your charged double and the make it nearly impossible to prove residence"

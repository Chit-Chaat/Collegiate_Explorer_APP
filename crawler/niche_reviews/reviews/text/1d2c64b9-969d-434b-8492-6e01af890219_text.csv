Sophomore,5,Mills is a college for students seeking a tightknit community and intimate class sizes. It offers the peacefulness of a private campus and all the opportunity of city life the moment you step off-campus.
Alum,5,"Mills college has the flexablity because it is a liberal arts university, I appreciate the inclusiveness of all."
Sophomore,5,"Mills is great for academics and meeting likeminded (read: progressive) people, but it’s pretty small and there is no party scene on campus. Great location (Oakland), beautiful campus, wonderful kind people."
Freshman,5,I received a substantial amount of financial aid from Mills College. They do a very great job in making sure all your needs are met so that you can live comfortably on their campus.
Sophomore,5,Mills has been a wonderful college and helped me develop my interpersonal skills as well as confidence in myself. I feel at ease knowing I am getting the best education possible. The campus is small but beautiful and feels like home. I would change the class sizes to make them bigger so more people can enroll.
Freshman,5,"When I first heard about mills college in my sophomore year of high school. I never put any thought or attention to it being that it was an all-girls school. But when my senior year came I felt like it was the right choice for me so I applied and got accepted! Walking into campuse you instantly fall in love with it. The campus is such a beautiful place that I enjoy getting there every morning. Mills is such a diverse place that me being a Latina I have never felt out of place nor uncomfortable. At Mills, you get so much support from your fellow classmates since classes are so small and from the staff. The staff is very kind and, always find ways to help you in any way they can. The best part is that they believe in you and what you can accomplish. From the top of my head, something they can change is lowering the food prices since not everyone is well financially stable and, Making our campus a free smoke environment to help our students stay healthy and our air quality less polluted."
Graduate Student,5,I liked the learning environment.  Small Class sizes beautiful campus.  Really could connect with professors if needed help.
Alum,5,I like that Mills was an all-women's college for undergraduates where you didn't have to worry about shaving your legs. The campus had great food and lots of great activities.
Graduate Student,5,I like the class sizes and the individualized focus of the professors. I am a pre-med post baccalaureate student.
Sophomore,5,"Professors are engaging, care about a student's wellbeing. More personalized classes, very friendly environment and very diverse in culture. Would recommend to everyone."
Freshman,5,"I have been treated as an individual at Mills, whenever I reach out to them and not just a number.  It's a quaint college and I think it makes a difference!"
Sophomore,5,"It’s my first year here, but it’s the most beautiful and supportive campus. From the minute I applied to the second I moved in, I felt fully prepared and cared for. They help you every step of the way and build a real sense of community."
Sophomore,5,"Mills College has been exceeding its expectations every year as a school in my eyes. I feel like I am getting a valuable education and I am more than happy to say I've always felt safe on my campus due to the numerous support networks established for the students and faculty alike. 

Tuition is expensive but I am lucky enough to receive scholarships and federal student aid and I truly do feel the money spent at this institution will be worth it considering the high graduation success rate at my school."
Junior,5,"Mills college is the oldest Women's College on the west coast. The campus is beautiful and professors are excellent. It is a private college so it costs more then a state school. However, once admitted they will work with you to pay for your attendance if finances are an issue. They have a significant scholarship fund to offer from."
Niche User,5,I loved mills its beautiful and unbelievably welcoming and the people there are nice the school is really safe and amazing I love the community and how empowering it is for women like me and of different backgrounds. I do wish that it was a bit cheaper is super expensive and I just don't know how I will continue paying for the school
Niche User,5,I LOVE MILLS SO MUCH. It’s so diverse and happy and lovely and it had such a nice campus! Mills is the best. Everyone should come. I love mills
Senior,5,"I love this school because of the small class sizes, the professors and advisors are great. I also love it because it is children friendly. I can bring my 7 year old with me to class when I needed to and we have a parenting lounge for that purpose. This school is awesome and I look forward to staring my Graduate year next fall in the accelerated degree program to obtain my Masters in Public Policy with and emphasis on housing policy."
Niche User,5,"The campus is really beautiful, but the tuition is about 28,000 dollars a semester and I can't afford it."
Alum,5,Professors are highly accessible.  Classes are small.  Internships and work study opportunities are great!
Sophomore,5,"I like Mills College because it is an all girls private college in Oakland, California.  I have found this city to be ethnically diverse.  There are many students from many different places. The class sizes are very small also. It offers a Bachelor's-to-Master's Graduate Program in Psychology that interests me.  During my final two years I will be given the opportunity to enroll in internships that will provided me with hands on experiences in the area of my studies.  One thing that I  would suggest for improvement would be not to raise the tuition rates.  The tuition is already really expensive."
Junior,5,"I am a returning student, and coming to Mills was the best decision I've ever made for myself. The student population is small, which allows for more personal relationships with professors and other campus employees. The tuition is rather high, but I'm completely confident that this is investment in my future will more than pay off."
College Junior,5,"So far its been a great experience. I enjoy the classes immensely and am excited about being on a campus and in classes that are small. Having small class sizes is really conducive to being able to get to know professors and other classmates. I would definitely go here if I had the chance to do it over again, it is expensive, but the quality of education I'm already getting is making it worth the financial hardships I'm in right now."
College Junior,5,"Dorms are so nice, a great option for students."
College Freshman,5,I have never heard or experienced any crime or safety issues on campus. There are few alerts that there is a mad man running around from the police but no one was harmed and it was shut down quickly. Also I don't really think that happened. The only harassment comes from the EF international students that come during spring semester and they have had lectures explaining that what they were doing was not ok.
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely comfortable being myself here, and I feel like my teachers genuinely know me."
College Freshman,5,"The Queer Community at Mills has helped me understand myself so much more than any one community before, and I am so interested in what I am learning about that it feels like cheating!"
College Freshman,5,There's hardly any partying on campus. A Mills party is a few people getting together to have a few glasses of wine and talk about social justice issues.
College Freshman,5,See above answer - there is hardly any partying at all and it's not pervasive
College Freshman,5,"It's extremely diverse for the most part, and extremely welcoming. Everyone's political beliefs are clearly liberal though. There could be better official support for some of the ethnic diversities, but the students take care of that."
College Freshman,5,I WILL be able to get a job
College Freshman,5,I LOVE not having any greek life on campus!
College Freshman,5,"Despite the challenges that Mills has, it is an incredible school. I feel accepted, challenged, and inspired to succeed each day I am here and couldn't have asked for a better school to attend."
College Freshman,5,There only has been like one sexual assault case in the past like 2 years. They usually happen outside of campus when the students go to Berkley and whatnot for parties and get togethers. That's when things happen and the students have to be more careful.
College Sophomore,5,Most people have single rooms which are amazing! The buildings are beautiful and there is a sink in (almost) every room which is nice.
College Freshman,5,"From what I see, Mills is one of the most accepting communities that I have had the privilege to be a part of."
College Freshman,5,"Mills was one of the few schools I applied to. Once all my applications went out, I dearly hoped Mills would be one of the schools to accept me. Mills has helped me explore college with the mind that I can learn and study while having fun. The class size is fairly small, the professors were humorous even while lecturing, and the students were strong open minded leaders with great respectful opinion. I tell everyone I know not to judge Mills from the gate looking but from the gate looking out. Even those who look in get an idea of how beautiful and relaxing Mills is!"
College Sophomore,5,"Social justice in every class. Not all profs are great, but the community as a whole is excellent."
College Student,5,"Fall semester just started two days ago, after 4 days of Orientation.  The teachers are so open and supportive; I really believe that they want us to succeed and do well.  Older students go out of their way to find the new students and check in with them."
College Junior,5,"I COULD NOT IMAGINE A BETTER PLACE TO BE! I by no means considered attending a women's college. It wasn't until I visited Mills campus and sat in on a couple classes, that I realized what a unique and empowering institution Mills is! The professors are exceptional; they have extensive published research, but are most passionate about teaching. Professors make themselves accessible by offering office hours throughout the week, responding immediately to emails and occasionally giving out their cell/home phone numbers. Professors want you to develop a relationship  with them and hope you take the time to meet with them outside of class. Because the classes are typically 15 (or less) students, professors expect everyone to do the reading and participate in class. Mills students are passionate, articulate, outspoken and empowered. The Mills student body is much more racially and socioeconomically diverse than the other 22 colleges I extensively researched. When students with varied life experiences are expected to participate in class, discussions are dynamic, highly educational and exciting! 

I was fed up with the quality of education at my high school and was pleasantly surprised to find a college that teaches you about  influential people and achievements OUTSIDE the white, masculinist, heteronormative, capitalist narrative. At Mills, I have learned about groundbreaking grassroots social justice movements in the Bay Area (and World) that were organized by queer people of color. Prior to Mills, I thought I was fairly educated on social justice movements, my white privilege, and politics. HOWEVER, I knew nothing compared to what I know now (two years later.) I have learned how to THINK CRITICALLY, recognize implicit bias and question all authors, politicians, policy makers and influential people to determine if they are perpetuating structures of oppression or challenging them. Overall, I LOVE MY CLASSES and LOVE MY SOCIAL LIFE AT MILLS EVEN  MORE!"
College Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed my Mills experience. I think our academic programs are amazing. All of my professors have impressive resumes and are also genuinely invested in the success of Mills students. We have lots of wonderful on campus resources, I am particularly impressed with our Career Center and our Residential Life Program. Socially speaking, I have made friends here that will last a lifetime. We are by no means a ""party school;"" however, the surrounding areas make it easy to access nightlife if students are interested in it.   Because it is a women's college, it is true that meeting men may be more challenging than at a co-ed school. However, our partnership with UC Berkeley allows us to take classes there and make friends there. I have dated in college and did not find it significantly more challenging to do so than when I attended a co-ed high school."
College Freshman,5,"Absolutely amazing professors, awesome classes, easy online registration. Prepare to be challenged."
College Freshman,5,Eclectic and lovely variety of buildings -- lots of grassy and green areas. While Mills is fairly laid back there are plenty of fun things to do on and off campus; consider stopping by the Solidarity Lounge or grabbing a ticket to the Black and White Ball.
College Freshman,5,"The area right outside of campus is fairly sketchy -- wouldn't want to go out after dark. However, other parts of Oakland and Berkeley are only a bus ride away, and the campus bus can get you to a BART station in no time. Trust me: you'll love the Bay Area."
College Freshman,5,"So many great places to eat off campus -- whether you go to Lakeshore, Fruitvale, Downtown or to a food truck."
College Freshman,5,Public Safety makes sure everyone is protected (and in their rooms!) on campus; Mills is also pretty strict on academic issues as well.
College Freshman,5,The academics are fantastic and Mills offers as much opportunity to their students as possible for securing job options.
College Freshman,5,Bay area is fantastic. I love it here.
College Senior,5,Class sizes are small (10-30) and you get to know your professors on a personal basis (most of them). They generally all care about your studies and will accomidate you to the best of their abilities.
College Sophomore,5,The classes here are excellent especially in the sciences. I feel extremely well prepared for haw tI plan to do in life and the academic experience here is priceless.
College Sophomore,5,I have had many connections with people from Mills College and since it's located next to a city there's many opportunities available for those who actively search for them.
College Sophomore,5,Mills College is very aware of safety (sexual safety especially)--with the students being the ones who instigate sexual safety the most.  Mills College is very safe when it comes sexual assault (everyone is very proactive against it) and since there's no guys M/F rape is almost a non-issue on campus.  Mills can work to have safer places for people who do have incidents and can also try to educate the student body more efficiently.
College Sophomore,5,"Mills College is located in an incredible place. The Bay Area has so much available to those who actively look for new things to do and every outing is guaranteed a new discovery. The bus routes are always running so people can get almost anywhere they need to go.  Shops, entertainment, sports, nightlife, food, and culture are more than abundant around Mills and there's something for everyone to have a good time during college.  I would be careful during the night though. Being in a big city can be dangerous and so if you do travel at night always travel with a friend and know exactly where you're going so you can be as safe as possible."
College Sophomore,5,"Mills is probably one of the most diverse campuses in the nation.  People come from all socio-economic backgrounds and there is a large amount of ethnic diversity.  Additionally, the LGBTQ community on campus is an important part of many peoples' lives and is widely accepted in all aspects of the college."
College Sophomore,5,"For science majors, if you TRULY like what you're doing and are ready to commit a lot of time and energy to the major, getting into the program is a breeze.  The testing into the major can be difficult to those that aren't passionate about the sciences but they're manageable if you can focus and correctly do the test.  The science programs in Mills are difficult and thorough but if you like what you're doing then it will be a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,5,"The standard dorm room at Mills College is a single room because Mills is so small.  The rooms are spacious and fully furnished (including a desk, twin bed, semi-walk-in closet, dresser, sink/mirror, bookshelf, and window), and are pretty clean. Additionally, the communities are small so you get to know everyone and can create study groups efficiently.  The buildings are Colonial architecture and simply beautiful and there's plenty of common areas where people can conglomerate and talk."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a huge amount of diversity at Mills.  The ethnic profile is very broad, and acceptance of different sexuality and genders is widespread."
College Junior,5,"Mills College is an all women school in the middle of Oakland. It teaches young adults the necessities of life. With less than 4,000 people on the campus, everyone knows someone on campus giving the school a warm, family feeling."
College Junior,5,"YOU CAN ORDER ANYTHING FROM THE OFF CAMPUS DINING OPTIONS!!! It's awesome. It so good. You can use multiple websites to order food. From grubhub.com to seamless.com to the restaurants actual website. Many of the places do not have a student discount, but they are cheap enough that you do not need a discount. A meal for 4 is easily $30."
College Junior,5,"The campus is very diverse. There are many clubs on campus that are targeted to different political beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic and racial groups. The college does not discriminate and if students feel that someone or a group of people are discriminating they can either talk to the Division of Student Life  or create a protest so to stop the problem."
College Junior,5,"As a person who only played basketball once when I was 7 years old, I can definitely say the athletic department at my college is amazing. They teachers and staff care to help everyone feel comfortable in the gym."
Sophomore,4,All of my professors have done their best to keep online classes accessible and engaging. The small class sizes help to ensure each student has the opportunity to participate in Zoom meetings and Canvas' learning platform has been very helpful in keeping track of upcoming assignments.
Alum,4,"I took one hybrid online class, and it was very good. Basically you were able to read the information and create content on your own schedule."
Junior,4,"The community that you will find in you classrooms really makes Mills so unique. All the friendship and connections I have made have helped me grow immensely and have made me feel so supported. The Black professors and professors of color are outstanding. However, Mills as a social justice institution falls short and lacks in support of its Black students and students of color at an administrative level."
Alum,4,"Mills is academically rigorous with plenty of support to help you through. Professors are welcoming and knowledgeable, but don’t put up with excuses. 
Socially, Mills is lacking a little. There are few organized campus events that are inclusive and actually interesting. There really isn’t space or time for partying or socializing beyond academically. 
The campus is gorgeous and there are plenty of places to study, relax, and explore nature. 
Overall, I feel well prepared for the career world because of my time at Mills and I would do it again."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed my first year at Mills. It's a small school; has its pros and cons. The professors are great and care about their students. Public transportations are easy to access. Party scene on campus is non existent.
Junior,4,I absolutely love the community as well as academics at this school. It is so inclusive and welcoming.
Senior,4,"I appreciate that Mills is a historically women's college, and now accepts nonbinary people as well."
Alum,4,"I majored in Ethnic Studies at Mills College. I was happy to have a supportive environment full of strong, intelligent women and people of color. Oakland is my hometown and there is always a lot to do and experience on and off campus. The Olin Library was my home away from home."
Junior,4,"As a transfer student, it can be difficult to adjust and settle in. Besides the acclimation period, I've enjoyed the professors' passionate lectures and the many academic resources. The school's culture can feel isolating at times, so you really have to put yourself out there to make connections. The food is good! The advisors are willing to work with you to create your own major."
Graduate Student,4,Mills College has small classes and gives you a great hands-on learning experience. Their administration can be a little unorganized which can be frustrating. You need to self advocate
Freshman,4,"I am a current student at Mills College, and I have had a great experience so far. They offer immense support in a multitude if areas. There are a large number of social groups, and everyone is very welcoming. The campus itself is beautiful, and very well kept. The community is full of different shops, and fun local businesses. The professors are really engaging and try to accommodate for every individual student and their learning preferences. I have found my passion through Mills, and they do everything in their power to encourage you to find your passions and follow them. There are classes offered in a wide range of academic interests as well."
Junior,4,"Mills College is a beautiful, idyllic campus with many welcoming and friendly faces. Mills College is a great school if you simply want to get your degree. Their isn't really a social life. However it is located in Oakland which is 30 minutes away from UC Berkeley and about an hour from San Francisco. Some upsides to the school is the one-on-one with the professors because the small classes."
Sophomore,4,"Mills's community is welcoming to different kinds of people, the professors I've met are all knowledgeable, supporting, and welcoming. The quality of instruction is good, though the administration in the school is considerably not that efficient nor the best."
Junior,4,"I like the small university environment. My favorite part is the class size but I would like to see more courses available each semester. However, there are some downsides to being such a small school of barely 1,000 students total. Funding is extremely low and I think the school needs to take better advice in the financial department. Poor management has led the school in debt which has significantly impacted faculty and students. I love the professors here but it is a shame that they are not paid enough and that our school's way of handling its financial situation is by laying off exceptional professors and raising housing costs. This school is incredibly accommodating and accepting students of all backgrounds which I do not find elsewhere. The location is great - the Bay Area has so much to offer and our school is nestled in East Oakland which makes a trip to SF only 13 minutes away. The school needs many improvements, but I am overall satisfied with my college experience so far."
Alum,4,Mills was a challenging place where I knew I could flourish. The overall dedication of the institution to academic discipline and social justice were apparent throughout the efforts of the various academic programs on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Mills is a wonderful school, it is small and easy to create community and get the support that you need.  Mills is home to many intelligent, kind, hard-working, and determined women who strive towards making their communities more inclusive, safe, and loving environments."
Alum,4,"Mills was a great college.  The classes were small, and the discussions huge.  We were a bit inside our own bubble, which was a downside, but I wouldn't trade my experience for anything."
Junior,4,"I live the diversity and freedom of academic view points, free from standardized textbooks. There is no IT school nor official department so technologies suffer and can cause unnecessary stress."
Junior,4,"The two years I've had here, have been the very best. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to attend this institution. I have had the ability to focus on my academics and also play D3 collegiate soccer. The educators here are very personal and although quirky I have never felt like a professor didn't care about my education. I have been pushed further than I could imagine. The social justice aspect of this institution does not fail to push me to be my very best leader. This school is so cool and empowering to the young women that they provided us with transportation to Oakland's Women's March. I have never been happier to be surrounded with such powerful womyn."
Sophomore,4,"Mills was not my first-choice college, but I can't imagine going anywhere else now! I love going to a school that cares not just about our academics, but about our passions and the causes that matter to us."
Niche User,4,"I'll be transfering to Mills this fall and could not be more excited. Everyone I have met is so kind, thoughtful, progressive. All the staff seem so supportive and I can tell they advocate for each student. 4 stars only because I still have a lot to learn about Mills."
Sophomore,4,"I love Mills overall, but since I am a commuting student, sometimes I feel like I miss out on a lot of activities and events that I would have liked to have participated in. But yes, the campus is beautiful and professors are great. I like that we all have similar values and want to make the world a better place for everyone."
College Sophomore,4,I'm excited about my degree.  We have resources on campus to help make decisions about careers and where to take our education.  There are many opportunities for internships on campus all the time.  Especially in the Graduate School of Business.  I feel as though job and internship opportunities are well advertised in the building.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Mills.  My education is worthwhile, I've met wonderful people, and I feel comfortable expressing my opinions.  Financial Aid is a bit of a mess.  They are not clear about due dates, how to complete and when to complete certain documents, and you can never get ahold of someone in the M center.  They don't answer questions thouroughly and with detail.  That would be the only center on campus I don't appreciate."
College Sophomore,4,Security on campus is a little lax but it's a great deterrent to see a guard gate at the front of the school.  Public safety takes a while sometimes to respond to issues.
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed the ability to have a single room and not have it be crazy expensive.  Each room is unique and I appreciate that.
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the politically and socially active atmosphere on campus.  Every student has some passion or a want for a level of involvement in the outside community.  I have enjoyed all of my classes, but particularly those in the economics department.  I feel prepared for my degree."
College Junior,4,Transferred halfway through my sophomore year and have been so happy.
College Junior,4,Accessible services if student seeks them out.
College Junior,4,All classes are thoroughly enjoyable
College Freshman,4,It has a great campus and is extremely friendly towards the LGBT+ community
College Sophomore,4,"The college is historically known and offers many avenues through which I can develop my craft and market myself as an artist. The program is prestigious in my field and I believe that with the assistance of mentors, career services, etc., that I will be suited for many positions upon completion of my program."
College Sophomore,4,"The location is beautiful, and there are many different options for housing. If you are married or want to live there with your significant other, it's a bit more difficult as there is only one section for families, and priority goes to students with children."
College Sophomore,4,"As an incoming student, I only have my experience in meeting with faculty and graduate students. As far as the program, I have heard nothing but positive feedback from the students. The faculty is most helpful in describing the coursework and expectations attached to the program. Financial aid services are top notch, and I have always been met with knowledgeable individuals who are immensely helpful when it comes to fees, scholarships, and grants."
College Freshman,4,I really got lucky with my room this year because I'm the only one in my hall that has wood floors. Each room has its own sink so it's really convenient. I've never had to wait in line for the bathroom. The carpet is not the best and the basement game room and kitchen are the worst so I barely go down there but I wish we had a better kitchen because I like to cook.
College Freshman,4,"This school suits me really well because there aren't a lot of people and the classes are just challenging enough. I get my own room and I've never had a class bigger than 30. It's very calm and quiet, no big parties which is just my style."
College Freshman,4,"Campus crime is sparse and the surrounding area's crime has only occasionally bleed through into the campus, though never in any serious capacity."
College Freshman,4,The alumni network is very strong because the school is so close-knit and small. I am confident that I will find a job once I graduate.
College Freshman,4,"I love the antique charm of the buildings, and I have a single room with a porch attached. Very close to classes, I can get to my classes in about 5 minutes."
College Freshman,4,"We are a Division III school, and sports aren't a huge part of everyone's campus life, but those involved feel a huge connection to their sport and team."
College Freshman,4,The professors are extremely willing to help their students and the small class sizes only help that. The curriculum also has a ton of interesting options and sometimes it's hard to not take them all. The registration process is confusing and needs to be better organized and disability access needs to be EXTREMELY expanded to meet more students' needs
College Freshman,4,Much better than most schools but we have a LONG way to go
College Freshman,4,"I haven't explored the volunteer/internship options much, but the alumni network is great. Because it's such a small school, and the students and alumni really love to support each other."
College Freshman,4,"Although there are some things that could definitely be bettered (more activities on campus, easier access to study groups, more dining options), if you're aware of the atmosphere when you apply, you get what's advertised. It's nice to have small, hands on classes and close links with your professors. It's also a very liberal college, especially among the students. Pretty welcoming, both with students and professors."
College Freshman,4,"Depending on the building, some housing options are better than others. For freshman, it's almost guaranteed that you'll get a single room if you want one. The RA system could be better, because they're usually either too involved or not involved at all."
College Freshman,4,"Very hands on, social justice focused, studious atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,The campus is relatively safe
College Freshman,4,i am looking forward to getting a degree from Mills College
College Freshman,4,All the classes i am taking are Gen Eds and nursing courses
College Freshman,4,I love my dorm room. It is a close walking distance to my classes but the social environment is a little lacking.
College Freshman,4,I am having a great college experience! I am making lots of friends while on the path to obtaining my BSN!
College Freshman,4,LOVE Mills and am excited to instigate more change
College Freshman,4,All the buildings are comfortable and great!
College Freshman,4,"I don't have much to do with the athletics on campus, but from what I have seen, they're great!"
College Freshman,4,"The career center is very helpful, I havent gone but I heard that it is. They really push the whole ""get an internship early"" kind of thing but it is hard when you also have to work because then you have tp juggle and iternship a job and school."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very welcoming and are usually very approachable. They usually mold to their students and try to do things so their students feel welcomed and listened to. I love how small the classes are and there are a variety of courses it is just hard to take it all in I wish they were organized on the website better.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are great and the material isn't hard to learn you just have to apply yourself
College Freshman,4,The staff genuinely wants you to be more involved and get into sports even if you're a rookie. They have a lot of school spirit!
College Sophomore,4,The safety and security on campus is overall great.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors are very helpful and supportive. Teaching style for most professors are great and easy to follow making learning fun and exciting although some of the subjects may be very challenging. Class sizes are small.
Junior,2,"Cons: A lot of students are socially isolated or unfriendly for such a small school, many students want to transfer, many departments are closing due to lack of funds, no ability to apply financial aid to study abroad, many of the buildings and the dining hall are completely inaccessible to students with disabilities, a lot of outspoken cis-men-hating women who are not necessarily seeing the bigger picture, some professors in WGSS who try to shock their students into caring while not thinking about creating a good classroom environment of respect/ do not support an environment of positive mental health while dealing with subjects that are so easily very very depressing. 
Pros: beautiful campus for tree lovers, a handful of caring professors, you can be as liberal as you want and learn hard truths about our country that are good to learn, you don't have to wear a bra"
College Junior,2,"Most people I know who have gotten well-paying jobs relevant to their degrees have had to seek out those opportunities on their own, with next to no help from Mills."
College Freshman,2,I have no idea about any internships or job opportunities but maybe that's because it's just my first year. I also have not actively looked yet.
College Freshman,2,"Needs to reach out more about internships and jobs, making sure that every student is stable and ready to enter their career."
College Freshman,2,The athletic department needs more funds and diversity.
College Freshman,2,"Completely non existent. You have to go off campus, which is great, but most 1st and 2nd years don't head out until the weekend."
College Freshman,2,We shouldn't have an open campus
College Freshman,2,If you want to party you have to go off-campus. The Mills shuttle comes on a schedule and can bring students back to school from specific locations.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I stayed on campus my first semester, and it was pretty awful, considering what I expected it to be. The alarms constantly went off, people in the dorms were noisy, and I had a hard time adapting to living on campus."
College Junior,2,"Mills is fine academically but not worth the $65,000 price tag. Honestly you can probably get a better education at any UC for less than half the price. The administration recently proposed cuts to the historic and beloved dance and book art programs, in addition to about six other majors, and a lot of people are thinking about leaving. Mills has the potential to be great, but it is unfortunately being run into the ground by an administration that only cares about its bottom line. The proposed cuts are completely disrespectful to the students who pay through the nose to come here, and if they're implemented, I know enrollment will likely plummet. Brilliant professors who have been here for years are being laid off, and many more will likely seek more stable employment elsewhere. 

Also, for a school claiming to be open-minded and tolerant, a significant portion of the student body at Mills tends to be extremely militant and hostile even towards those who share their liberal ideology. Don't think there's anything wrong with a male professor teaching a women's studies class? Too bad, you're in the minority and you will likely be told that your beliefs are wrong and oppressive. 

I had such high hopes when I came to Mills. Likely won't be coming back next semester."
College Freshman,2,"If I could make my college choice again, I WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO MILLS COLLEGE. Don't make the mistake I made. This school does the total opposite of what they claim to stand for. There are so many cliques on campus and the majority of the students are very weird. This is a school where 'outsiders' in high school come together to find friends. 

Since this is an all women's college, people just talk sh*t about other people. There is a lot of drama and people get irritated of each other very quickly."
College Freshman,2,"If you're a single LGBTQ-oriented person, then this school is great for you. Otherwise, straight women utilize other methods to find people to date. It's not bad, as the surrounding colleges and Bay Area have very attractive men in general."
College Freshman,2,"I did not feel safe on campus as I was harassed by students but due to the fact that it had not yet gotten violent, nothing was done."
College Senior,2,School gym is very small. Not much support at sporting events.
College Sophomore,2,I don't see much student guys.
College Sophomore,2,Mills is literally isolated from any nearby grocery stores or fast-food restaurants. You will have to take the bus. Only best way to get everything all at once is to take the shuttle to Berkeley. Students who live on campus who cannot adapt to the dining hall food would just suffer or forced to pay more for the point system at the Tea shop.
College Sophomore,2,"Attending this school is rather expensive. The quality of education is great depending on the professor, but not good enough for the amount you are paying for. If you have trouble paying for your cost of attendance, then good luck on getting help from the school. The school is very stingy about giving additional aid, specifically students of color who are really having trouble paying the expense. They are so cruel."
College Junior,2,"The area directly surrounding the school is sketchy and I would not recommend living off campus because it is unsafe. There are few neighborhoods where it would be ok to live, but those can be about 15 minutes away. There is a shuttle running from Mills to UC Berkeley so living near Berkeley would not be bad."
College Freshman,2,Nothing in Oakland so you have to either go to Berkeley or San Fran. 
College Freshman,2,It just doesn't even seem to exist. 
College Freshman,2,There are few computer labs and the wifi is a crap-shoot
College Senior,2,"The M Center is where you go deal with financial aid. They are very disorganized. Every year I had some of paperwork lost, even when I turned it early. You must follow up with them constantly, either by phone or by going into the office, or else your award letter may come in right before class begins, which is an inconvenience. I did get financial aid and when I need more they would give me a bigger loan."
College Freshman,2,"Sports are not a huge deal at a Division III school like Mills. They are fun for those who are in them, and the program is not bad, but no one really goes out to watch all of the time, and our teams are not always the best. They are nice for those who have not done sports before, and just want to try it out."
College Freshman,2,The social scene on campus is very bland. The people in my social circle make no effort whatsoever to have fun or go out at all.
College Freshman,2,"Lot of people smoke weed/cigarettes and drink but no one really goes harder than that. the ""drug scene"" is really pretty mild- there are exceptions to this and it does depend who you hang out with although but overall its pretty tame"
College Freshman,2,"While the majority of the facilities that I have been in were great, the one nightmare that looms present on campus is the M Center. In a single semester, I have been down there so many times to handle financial screw ups by the individuals at the M Center that the woman at the front desk knows me by name. It's completely maddening to go down there because it feels like no one knows how to do their job. One person from Student Accounts will tell you one thing and then a financial adviser will tell you something COMPLETELY different. The financial aid that I accepted back in August wasn't even dispersed into my account until NOVEMBER, requiring my family to pay more than they had to. And in my humble opinion, they're still paying more than they should be paying. The M Center needs to be a lot more organized than it is because I honestly do not feel comfortable paying the M Center such large sums every month only to have them mess up later on. "
College Junior,2,"Piedmont, great for yuppies. Temescal neighborhood ,Rockridge same...

Oakland/Berkley... need I say more."
College Freshman,2,"Not a big athletic life, but there are a few sports teams to join if you want to."
College Freshman,2,"The food is not *always* terrible, but there is only one dining hall and it is at the top of a gigantic hill."
College Sophomore,2,There is absolutely nothing to do at night at mills except hang out in dorms doing random stuff with friends
College Sophomore,2,"The Area RIGHT Around – Oakland and the Bay Area as a whole are amazing, but the area directly surrounding Mills is not somewhere you want to be around nighttime."
College Senior,2,"Public Safety: Mhm, Yeah Right – Public Safety on campus is hardly very helpful. They're around to unlock doors and shut off alarms accidentally set off, maybe even escort a drunken student back to his/her dorm. However, as far as safety is concerned, I don't know that there is much they can or could do in the case of a serious incident on campus."
College Junior,2,Miles Off Campus – we dont have cable because people were stealing it. there are bugs real bad. its close to the campus though but lifes rough.
College Junior,2,"Average Food, Very Short Dining Hours – Founders, the only dining hall, is very hit-or-miss (and located at the top of a steep hill). There isn't a lot of good seafood and the meat is often tough and/or dry. However, the salad and taco bars are always great. There's also an ice cream/frozen yogurt machine. Dining hours are really short and, as a result, you'll be spending most of your money at the Tea Shop, which closes at 10 PM and has both pre-made and made-to-order meals. Weekend brunch, however, is always awesome."
College Junior,2,"Check Out the Neighbors – Although there are some pretty cool places to live in Oakland (Rockridge, Peidmont), most are not very affordable.  Since the school is located in East Oakland it is important to make sure the neighborhood is safe since this side of the city has a high crime rate.  If anything I would recommend living near lake Merritt."
College Sophomore,2,"It Is What You Make of It. This is a small campus and there are no fraternities or sororities. On campus parties are usually small exclusive gatherings of friends, but still a lot of fun. If you don't have a social group established to party with I think that it could be really lonely. Essentially, you have to create your own fun or party off campus. If you're into the bar/club scene there are tons of options available, though transportation could be an issue if you lack a car and are afraid to take the city bus."
College Junior,2,"FAFSA Is Awful – Don't get me started on FAFSA . . .

Otherwise, Mills does its best. Student loans . . ."
College Junior,2,"Free but Awful – Parking permits are free, but good luck finding a space anywhere near your class!  Your  best bet is to park in the stupid far-away lot by the gate rather than drive around campus looking for a spot, because you'll just make yourself late.  Otherwise, the free deal is pretty good.  Fines are a bit steep, but not unreasonable, just mind your parking permit type and where you park."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of people drink at Mills, but there are very few (if any) large parties. Most are low-key and small. It never gets rowdy, RAs are all over parties that get too loud. 

There is a bit of a weed problem in the dorms (but I assume no worse than any other school), nobody seems to get in trouble for it.

Overall, if you are looking for a party school, Mills is not for you. The atmosphere is very academic. If you are into low-key drinking with a small group of friends you will fit in fine."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Place for Partying – If you want a real party pick a different school we do have dances but only fetish ball,  and Black and white ball are good"
Senior,1,"The professors, campus, students are amazing. It's a great place for those reasons, and the small classes are nice.  However, the M Center is the worst student accounts and financial aid department I've experienced being in 2 community colleges prior and 1 Uni. It is unbelievably negligent and causes a lot of stress for so many students when over 50% of the student body struggles with a mental health anxiety disorder. Every year there are alarming emails with no follow up that demand $15,000.00+ in payment within a week or so, and the threat of late fees, before they offer you a financial aid package, putting so many students and families at personal risk to attend this overpriced college. They can't manage their pocketbook and it really affects students and professors the most.  It's such a disappointment since the school tries to boast social justice issues, especially economic disparities. I would probably do an affordable and incredible CAL state school if I could do things over."
Alum,1,"Mills does not offer many online classes. Since COVID-19 distant learning took place, I think there is room for improvement. All the classes use different platforms, the equality of the education is not the same, accommodating the students needs were not met."
College Junior,1,"This school is the opposite of everything it purports to stand for. I can tell you from personal experience that Mills's social justice mission statement isn't so much a genuine statement of purpose as a steaming pile of bulls*** designed to attract more students in hopes of reversing the school's massive debt crisis. I was (wrongfully) accused by another student of violating the school's code of conduct. With no evidence and no investigation, they charged me with that violation, threatened to expel me, and forced me to move out of my dorm for over a week. Eventually, they allowed me to return to my living space, but they admitted no wrongdoing on their part, and handed out no consequences to the person who falsely accused me. 

I tried to put it behind me, determined to move forward with the good friends I'd made and the few good experiences I'd had at Mills. Over the summer I received notice that my scholarship was no longer being incorporated into my financial aid package, making me unable to attend. All emails and calls I've made to the M Center have been met with radio silence.

As if the administrative problems weren't enough, dealing with the student accounts and financial aid offices at Mills are a nightmare. I've heard of second semester seniors being automatically dropped from their classes and locked out of their dorms for failing to pay an intersession registration fee. The incompetence of the M Center is notorious, and most students avoid dealing with it altogether.

A few of my professors have been amazing, but most have ranged from mediocre to just alright. Devastating budget cuts to the letters department have left them with three--yes, three--full time professors. Mills offers three foreign languages (but only two foreign language degrees, French and Spanish), unlike most ""top tier"" liberal arts colleges, which offer as many as ten."
College Freshman,1,"Again, there is no party scene. It's basically a bunch of you and your friends hanging out in the dorm rooms."
College Freshman,1,We dont have any and we have no desire for any
College Freshman,1,"We don't have Greek life, parties, frats, or sororities."
College Freshman,1,"To me, it's a good thing we don't have greek life;)"
College Freshman,1,There is only one sorority on campus but no one really considers it greek life. This sorority accepts anyone.
College Freshman,1,"THIS CAMPUS IS EXTREMELY DRY. 

There is some drinking but rarely. 

Also, it is not fun to only drink with girls all the time. 

I HATE THIS SCHOOL"
College Freshman,1,You go off campus if you want to do anything.
College Freshman,1,No help finding housing and scholarships go away.
College Freshman,1,The party life on campus consist of a group of 5 people sitting in a room and drinking vodka while trying to be quiet or smoking weed behind a dumpster.  Some first years go the frats in Berkeley.
College Junior,1,There is no greek life on campus.  There are Berkeley fraternities/sororities nearby.
College Sophomore,1,"Mills sports teams are in division three, so sports significance at Mills is like of any other division three school. The teams are compiled of maybe a few very experience, then a few with some experience, and then more so with no experience at all. We don't really have varsity and junior varsity and we don't win a lot of our games, so fan support is low. However school spirit is still high."
College Freshman,1,This school is a hell hole. All the people I talked too is considering a transfer. PLEASE DO NOT COM EHERE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. LISTEN TO ME. All the people that walk around look gloomy. The weekends will make you think you are walking through a ghost town. 
College Freshman,1,"It's okay – Academic wise, it's okay. Just okay. But I would recommend that you should rethink about coming to this school. Most of the people in my residence hall are considering a transfer. This is not the school for everyone. The people here are super scary and awkward. One girl I never met before started tickling me out of no where. This is a hell hole, I promise you this. Very terrible school. They are also taking away many facilities cause the school is almost going bankrupt. DO NOT COME."
College Freshman,1,The people are SUPER awkward. 
College Freshman,1,This is one of the worst schools you can go too. The school is filled with super awkward people. You hear gun shots mostly every night and public safety just sits around doing nothing most of the time. There is NOTHING to do during the weekends. The women here are overly competitive. It is not worth your money. DO NOT COME HERE IT IS HELL. 
College Senior,1,"Completely Disorganized – Mills spends a phenomenal amount of money on scholarships but the financial aid officers are incompetent. 

I lost my scholarship with no notification from Financial Aid until the day before school.. I petitioned to get it back, and once I did, they forgot to notify me that it was reinstated.

How can it be so difficult at a school of less than 1,000?"
College Junior,1,Getting Worse – Financial Aid has been less generous because supposedly we are in a tight budget. I'm currently paying way too much and it's difficult to think that I might not come back next semester. This thought is common with many students.

Alum,5,Grove City College provides quality laptops to all its students. The professors try to implement technology organically and in meaningful ways rather than a forced or obligatory supplement. I learned a lot about technology during my time here.
Sophomore,5,"What's not to love about Grove? Teachers are friendly, staff is friendly, heck, everyone is friendly here! There's something for everyone and you'll hardly be bored on campus!"
Sophomore,5,Grove City College transitioned to online classes during the Covid19 pandemic. It was a smooth process. Professors were accessible and helpful as classes shifted to remote learning.
Niche User,5,"I have only been there as a duel enrollment student, but I love everything about it.  It's a small but vibrant tight knit community of people dedicated to their studies and each other.  Grove City offers a top notch education experience, with difficult courses that will challenge you, and also has professors ready to sit down and help you with whatever you need, whenever you need it.  There are always on campus events and interesting things to get involved in; you will never get bored. Overall, I would rate my experience with Grove City College as excellent."
Niche User,5,"Grove City did a great job transitioning to online despite the sudden changes required by the coronavirus situation.  While online learning is certainly a step down from learning in person, Grove City did a great job of trying to implement all that they could from normal student life into online alternatives and helped keep everyone in communication and learning, despite the difficulties posed by online learning. Overall, my online learning experience with Grove City College has been excellent."
Sophomore,5,Very good undergrad program in mechanical engineering. Equal parts challenging but the teachers wanting you to do well.
Alum,5,"This was and is one of the most impactful experiences of my adult life. The friendships I made there, as well as one of the best educations at an affordable price made this school mean so much more than a college degree. I have extremely fond memories, and stories to share for a lifetime with the friends I made, as well as the lessons (both life and book) learned from my professors."
Freshman,5,"The faculty here is very understanding, flexible, and willing to help all of their students. Most professors will take the time to know you individually and support every student. The culture includes a christian based beliefs and they strongly stand by the community. It is a beautiful campus, and they offer lots of clubs and sports for being such a small school."
Junior,5,"Grove City College has a friendly environment with strong academics. So not only can you receive a good education, but you can also make lifelong friends and chose to participate in numerous different opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Grove City College is a solid choice for those looking for a private education at an affordable cost.
 
The campus itself is on the smaller side, with the walk to the academic buildings from the dorms taking a max of 5 minutes. The size of the classrooms and the faculty also compliment this as professors are able to have more personable relationships with students than they would at a university.

 Professors have terminal degrees in their respective fields and also have scheduled periods of time for office hours where students can get help with classes, which has been a major blessing.

The cons of Grove City are that the party scene outside of the sororities and fraternities on campus is lacking. The local area is also lacking due to it being a more rural town, so having fun off-campus typically means a drive to Slippery Rock or other neighboring cities.

Overall, Grove City is a good choice for anyone looking for a serious education."
Alum,5,"Grove City College provided an excellent, well-rounded education and many lifelong friends. In my experience, graduates tend to go on to do well in their fields and vocations."
Freshman,5,"Grove City College is a wonderful small Christian College in Western Pennsylvania. The professors are kind, easy to talk to and always willing to help students. The academics are rigorous, but it is worth it. Grove City has a beautiful campus and excellent students and professors."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community at Grove City College! It is obvious to me that the professors care more about their students succeeding than then do about their paycheck. They view their students as individuals, rather than just another number."
Sophomore,5,"Community is huge at Grove City College. From the interactions between students, to professors and even the locals of Grove City, PA there is a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Everyone is super friendly and willing to lend a hand when you need it. The academics are challenging but leave you more than prepared to accomplish what you need to in your future career or field. There are tons of opportunities to get involved on campus ranging from Greek life to missionary outreach organizations. If there was one thing I would change about Grove City it would be more scholarship opportunities for students or job openings for students on campus that need to make money to afford school."
Freshman,5,"Grove City College is an academically rigorous school. The student community is a beautiful thing, everyone is very welcoming and kind. There are some very judgmental students, but other who are very down to earth. The professors are wonderful and very caring, challenging, but caring. The food is not the best, but could be worse. The dorms and campus are absolutely gorgeous."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Grove City College. The college has rigorous academics and offers a large amount of majors despite being a smaller sized college. The college offers many career advancement opportunities throughout both the spring and fall semesters. There are several internship fairs, and most students have a job in their major within 6 months of graduating. The college is also less expensive than most other private schools, and has mandatory debt seminars to teach students how to wisely handle their educational debt."
Niche User,5,Great Christian oriented school.  Student financial aid very limited.  Beautiful campus with fantastic professors.  Recent improvement in meal plans a plus.
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in high-school and I have applied to Grove City and visited the campus twice. I fell in love with beautiful and historical location of the campus. The student to faculty ratio gives prospering students a unique opportunity to receive one on one time with the professors. There are many activities, clubs and events that Grove City offers to get students involved and make them feel welcome. I absolutely love the close knit community. Grove City is also Christ-centered, and it is guaranteed you will grow in your faith. Overall, Grove City is an all around amazing school with high-level academics, christian values, and an amazing staff and faculty that will make you feel right at home."

Junior,5,Grove City College is a great school. This school is apologetically conservative and Christian. The professors are great and if you go to their office hours they will help you. Grove City can be academically challenging but you will really learning things here and more so learning how to think. There is no party life at Grove City however their are other things to do for fun and all of the students are involved in on campus groups.
Freshman,5,"I had my first visit to Grove City College my senior year of high school and I knew instantly that this was the college for me. Currently, I am a freshman at GCC and the support I have received is miraculous. The staff at this college truly wants you to succeed with the degree you plan to obtain. As a Christian-based college, the professors base all of their teachings around biblical principles. While there is Chapel services on campus, it is encouraged to attend a local Church every Sunday. Although academics and the Chapel services are of dire importance, the college endorses the students to be involved with the many clubs, sports and events they have to offer. I have personally felt a connection with GCC and know that this will always be my top choice of college."
Senior,5,It has a  safe and friendly atmosphere. The academics are rigorous but helpful for learning the material. Some professors seem to care only about getting through the course but most care about their students and show interest in how to teach them better and help them learn.
Junior,5,"Sometimes the college is conservative to a fault.  Its standing up for classical liberal and modern conservative principles make it stand out though.  

Here I have a great group of friends.  There are problems though when people get in their own bubble of friends and don't interact much outside of it.  People here are more likely to be introverted than elsewhere."
Sophomore,5,"Grove City College is an incredible place. When I was looking for a college a had a list that Grove City checked every box for. It was small, private, and conservative-leaning.  Despite this knowledge I never could have been prepared for the experience that I would have. The moment I walked on campus on move in day I knew I had made the right choice. The people were so welcoming and kind, the classes were interesting, the culture is very Christ-centered, and I felt like I found a home away from home.. I  cannot say enough good things about Graove City. It has changed my life for the better. I also apologize if there are some errors in this paragraph, my computer kept acting up as I was typing this and wouldn't let me correct things. Thank you!"
Junior,5,"Grove City College has a remarkably kind and loving community. Everyone is ready and eager to get to know and support each other, especially the incoming freshman class. Over the last year I've really gotten the opportunity to be involved with several groups on campus being welcomed warmly and ecstatically into them. I've made some of the closest friends I've ever had and when I struggle I'm always supported and helped by not only my friends but the professors and faculty.  It's a small campus but still lively and there's lots of things to do and groups to join. The bowling alley, student union, and rec centers make great places to hang out and have fun, or just as a place to study and going shopping in the town or making late night runs to Walmart and Sheetz is always an adventure. I love Grove City College and I can't wait to head back in the fall!"
Freshman,5,"I love the community, the people I work with, and my classmates. I enjoy the time to worship the Lord through chapel, vespers, concert choir, worship teams, and so much more."
Freshman,5,"So far I have had a great experience here at Grove City College. My freshmen year has been a great experiences and has brought me many challenges. I am glad that I chose this college because I have had such a good time with my new friends despite being so far from home. I am very much looking forward to the future here, especially with baseball and my academics."
Freshman,5,"The encouraging community and focus on studies is the best thing about Grove City College. The people I have been surrounded with take their studies seriously and it has boosted my GPA efficiently. 
The buildings are close together for easy access and the professors truly care about their students and connect with them in personal ways."
Works Here,5,"Grove City offers a broad range of majors from the liberal arts to laboratory sciences, engineering, and business. An academically rigorous Christian college, its career services office frequently ranks among the top 1% in the nation. Employers recruit at this college like few others. Its stunning campus was designed by the same firm that did Yale, Notre Dame, and Stanford. Students form rich relationships and are highly involved in campus life. Grove City doesn’t artificially inflate its price to an exorbitant level, like most schools, only to discount it with ego-stroking “scholarships” that are merely paper discounts. Why? Lots of students lose even though they think they too are getting a scholarship. Not at Grove City where its honest pricing model starts low and they offer need-based and merit-based aid. Known by employers for graduating highly competent students, Grove City starts its alumni on a holistically prosperous life journey."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing professors! I have close personal relationships with several. I'll go to their offices regularly, not simply for class help, though they are generous in providing that, but just to talk about life and interesting issues."
Freshman,5,"Along with being a great school to practice your Faith in, the music department is very modern, and professional looking, full of life, and pride. If you want to be a music major, I encourage you to take a look at this music department!"
Sophomore,5,Grove city is a small school which makes it feel more at home. The professors are excellent and really prepare students for what’s the come next. They offer a lot of clubs and IM sports where there’s pretty much something for everyone
Sophomore,5,"I love the ""small-town"" feel of the college and of Grove City itself.  At GCC, the student body more resembles the town Mayberry from the ""Andy Griffith Show"" than it does a rigorous academic institution.  Yet, Grove City College is not lacking in stringent academics!  The college's professors know how to push students to work hard and reach their full potential while not allowing them to become overwhelmed."
Sophomore,5,"While I am only going into my second year, I thoroughly enjoyed my freshman year at Grove City. The professors are fantastic and the classes are interesting and rewarding. It being a smaller campus heightens the experience, as students won't get so lost in the crowd compared to other larger campuses. Similar to high school, there will definitely be some sort of activity that you can get involved with that will help to transition and stay connected."
Senior,5,"Grove City College has prepared me so well for my future profession while also providing an environment where excellent friendships and community are present. GCC professors take an active interest in the welfare of students, are immensely knowledgeable about their given fields of study, and are approachable. A kind student body exists at Grove City College, with students frequently greeting each other on the sidewalk, even if they are not acquainted. Attending Grove City College was one of the best decisions of my life."
Freshman,5,It's an excellent college with great opportunities for students of all backgrounds!  The food is good too!
Niche User,5,"I  am the third sibling in my family to attend Grove City College and have been looking forward to attending for years. Throughout the years of visits, family events, and ceremonies for my older siblings, my appreciation for the college has only grown. In comparison to my current college (where I  am transferring from), Grove City is a place where real learning, growth, and academic success are common."
Freshman,5,"Grove City is a very challenging school but they're also very good at preparing students for careers and graduate school. Great student culture, good professors, great student-to-teacher ratio, many opportunities for students to get involved in a wide variety of activities around a beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,"My college experience has been great! The classes are challenging but rewarding, the professors take time to make sure you understand the material and provide help if you don't. Residence life is welcoming and active and I feel right at home after just a few months. If I were to change anything, it would be the food options, the food isn't bad, there's just not a ton of variety. Other than that, all facilities are top notch."
Niche User,5,"Grove City College boasts a central emphasis on the Christian life and worldview. The beautiful campus is enough to make any lover of beautiful historical architecture stand in awe and admiration.  The professors are engaging, intelligent, and extremely accommodating. The food is superb! The students are thoughtful, responsible, and mature in most cases. In addition, the students for the most part prefer to engage one another in conversation rather than absorb themselves in their devices. Overall this College is the perfect place for someone who wants superb education, good friends, good food, and more, all for a very reasonable price."
Niche User,5,Small community and personal teaching make Grove City an optimal college choice. In addition friendly openminded learning environment Grove City's philosophy to spread light pervades throughout the alumni in the future.
Freshman,5,"I appreciate the excellent courses and professors at Grove City College, as well as the welcoming atmosphere. Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with my experience at the college, and would suggest it to friends."
Niche User,5,"Grove City College is a fantastic school with a Christ-centered education which prepares young students to face a secular world with a strong faith. Personally, I love the student life on campus, there is always something fun to do or see. I hope you all go out to see the play The Music Man on November 10th!"
Niche User,5,"I am on the process of applying to this college. I had an interview with the Administration Department Director/PDSO, it was a pleasant interview, she was very delightful, very kind and friendly. I had a whole bunch of problems about the application, the financial aid and the scholarships. The staffs answered all my questions very patiently. Grove City College has a very strong academic program as well as their faith in Christ. This school is the 1st on my college choices list. It is a great school!"
Sophomore,5,Love this school! I would recommend it to anyone! I can't wait to spend the rest of my college career there!
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Grove City College. GCC provides a safe, beautiful campus where learning is encouraged by both the professors and peers. The professors and staff care about your academic, personal, and spiritual growth and provide an environment of learning-not only for tests but for life beyond the classroom. The campus is small enough that you will see someone you know when you leave your dorm but large enough that there is always someone new to meet."
Freshman,5,"I am the third of my siblings to attend GCC, the campus is beautiful, the food isn't great but the education is worth it. My decision was made mostly by the schools great track record with law schools."
Junior,5,"Grove City is the perfect college for a young Christian who is looking for a community to help them grow in their faith. The professors are very kind, and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Great people who you can talk to whenever you want! All of the professors want to help you when you need it (and if they even get the chance). It is a tough school to get into so be sure to have a decent GPA above 3.0 and around 3.5. Not as big of a campus as most and is a private, non-denominational Christian college (that is loosely affiliated with the Presbyterian Church). They are very affordable but do not receive financial aid from the state. It is also one of the most beautiful campuses in America (especially during the spring and fall seasons). One of the best parts about Grove City is that most students have a 97% chance of getting a job within the first 6 months of graduation, and all of the internship fairs in the area come to them! The men and women at this college care about your success in the future!"
Sophomore,5,"Grove City College has changed my life. My professors care about me and my career path. They want to do everything they can to help me succeed. Teh academcis are challenging, but in a good way. Grove City College stretches and pulls you so that you have to do your best. My peers are encouraging and help me to do my best as well. Overall, Grove City College has a thoroughly Christian environment. Another key part of culture at Grove City is our Career Services Office, which is consistently ranked in teh top 20 in the nation! They teach you the skills you need to get a job!"
Junior,5,"I love GCC's size, academics, and Christian atmosphere. It has been a remarkable place of learning and growing physically, mentally, socially and spiritually!"
Freshman,5,Grove City College is a Christian private college that combines a care for people with academics. The student and faculty are friendly and welcoming.
Junior,5,"Great academics and learning environment.  Also a great culture, close and Christian.  There are a lot of organizations and activities to be involved in on campus."
Junior,5,"Grove City College is a beautiful campus. I have enjoyed the small-campus experience, the focus on Christianity, and the quality academics.  A majority of the professors are very caring people and are willing to help you succeed.One aspect I have especially disliked has been the hours of operation for dinning locations."
Sophomore,5,I love Grove City College because they make me feel like part of the Grove City family. The professors really care about students. They make you think about topics that are meaningful to them. Class discussions are thought provoking. There is always a student or professor to talk things through with. The campus is beautiful and offers a wide variety of activities. Some of my best friends have come through playing IM sports and trying new activities. I have cherished my time at Grove City College. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to work hard and above all learn a lot.
Alum,5,"A great place for Christian students! Grove City College is a special place where many students are involved in campus life and get a great education. Most students say they've grown significantly in their relationship with God during their time on campus. Engineering, education, sciences, Biblical studies, and music are some of the college's strongest majors. They don't offer nursing as a bachelor's degree, so some students have gone to other schools who want to pursue that. There are over 50 student clubs and organizations for students to join, and most students are involved in multiple groups! It's a pretty active campus with numerous activities offered every day on campus. IM sports are a big hit, especially for high school athletes who love their sport but decide not to play that sport on Varsity in college."
Freshman,5,I have loved my experience at Grove City College so far. There is no end to the on- and off-campus activities to get involved in and the students and faculty are all extremely friendly and eager to help you out.
College Freshman,5,"There is a stereotype that Grove City doesn't party. However, this is false. If your looking for parties at Grove City, getting involved in Greek life is really the only way to find them. If going Greek life isn't your thing, Slippery Rock University is a 9 minute drive down the road, and there are parties every weekend there."
College Junior,5,Dedicated is a word to describe the college and the students.  Grove City College students pursue an education here to make this world a better place
Alum,4,Grove City College provides a quality education for an affordable price. The school community is welcoming and engaging.
Sophomore,4,"The COVID situation was very much a trial and error for online learning, but Grove handled things very well."
Junior,4,I have loved my first two years at Grove City College. The people here are amazing and the professors are so helpful and kind.
Junior,4,Most professors worked hard to make sure that everything was switched to online smoothly in a very short amount of time.
Sophomore,4,"Grove City College is a warm, welcoming community that encourages engagement, learning and personal growth."
Freshman,4,"Grove city college so far has been a wonderful place to live and learn every day. The people there from professors, to students, to other staff are very personable and dedicated to helping each other grow as people. The academics ate difficult, but are worth the work because they are truly meant to teach and prepare students for the real world and their major. The Christian aspect of the school is also nice in the way that the school is very accepting of all kinds of people, and most people are very friendly."
Sophomore,4,"Grove City College is a wonderful college to attend for various reasons. Being a double major is difficult academically, yet exponentially rewarding. Almost all of the professors in the social work and psychology department take time for each student to meet outside of office hours if necessary, desire for the students to succeed in their college courses and are able to teach in an effective way. 

Here the academics are rigorous, which encourages students to strive to learn all they can and set high goals for themselves. These students are taught to persevere, strive for perfection, engage in conversations that are counter to their personal beliefs and balance academics, on and off campus involvement, and social relationships. 

Although the food provided here may not be the best for a vegetarian and those who have food allergies, Grove City College is a wonderful college that anyone would be blessed to study at."
Freshman,4,"Classes are enjoyable. Professors are generally easy to reach and willing to help students, especially since open office hours are required. Campus environment is safe and friendly. The food isn't amazing, but there are always waffles at breakfast, and pizza at lunch and dinner, so you always have a back up option."
Freshman,4,"I personally really liked Grove City College. The campus is beautiful, the people are generally nice, and the staff are amazing and always willing to help."
Freshman,4,"Grove City is an excellent school academically; the environment, students, and professors all push you to be your best. The people are wonderful. It can be stressful, truthfully, but those who enjoy academics will thrive at Grove City."
Alum,4,"Grove City College is a small private school with a tight-knit community of students and staff. It can feel a little too small at times, but if you value personal connections with your classmates and professors, this may be the perfect fit for you."
Junior,4,"Very good academic school. Defiantly the best choice. There isn't that much of a social scene. No diversity at all. The college is mainly white, christian, conservatives. But, defiantly a very good college that helps be academically and further my faith."
Freshman,4,"I really appreciate the supportive atmosphere and the investment of the professors. However, the food plan is lacking."
Freshman,4,The school is very challenging. Professors are difficult but are very open to helping students. The Christian centered worldview creates an atmosphere of community and makes students feel that they are welcome and accepted.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely adore the humanities at Grove. The liberal arts are my favorite part about this school. Almost every professor you encounter is warm and joyful. You are invited over for dinner at professors' houses, see the president of the college around town, and learn a wealth of information that stays with you way past your finals into grad school, your career, and your whole life."
Freshman,4,"I love it at Grove City. The welcoming atmosphere of the private Christian college is out of this world. Immediately you are greeted with welcoming arms and automatically have new friends. If you are struggling with different academics, the professors are more than happy to help you with what you are struggling with. Overall I would really recommend this college to anyone who is looking for a return on their investment in college and to acquire an outstanding education."
Junior,4,I love the fact that walking to class you could say hi to at least 5 people that you know. Other schools you’re lucky if you see one person you genuinely know on your commute to class. Everybody is so friendly and no matter who you are or what background you come from you will always fit in.
Junior,4,"As a Junior at Grove City College, I have been presented with many opportunities to succeed as a student and as a future professional. Independent research and a stellar placement program have aided me through real world experiences and the knowledge of how to impress future employers with hard work and an impressive resume."
Niche User,4,"The people are amazing. The campus is beautiful. However, some teachers are unhelpful or unwilling to aid students in their pursuit of a better understanding of a subject or material."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far has been extremely eye opening!! College is MUCH harder than high school. GCC is Ivy League compatible so the first part of my first semester I struggled very badly! They are high quality and expect much from their students. The professors are wonderful and are encouraging and helpful. The campus is beautiful and very easy to maneuver. I play football and the coach is interested  in my spiritual life and academics  above football, however, he focuses on doing one's best in everything you put your hand to do! Building your life ""Brick by brick"". I would recommend GCC to everyone, However, be prepared to study, IT IS NOT EASY!"
Alum,4,Grove City is a historically Presbyterian college that is open to Catholics and Anglicans as well.  It is a religiously inclusive college and provides a small community that is comfortable.
Sophomore,4,"Grove City is a beautiful little private Christian college. The professors truly care and invest in their students and President McNulty is a wonderful, encouraging presence. The school is proud of its rigorous academics and firm faith, and although largely conservative, provides outlets and opportunities for all individuals in an environment that promotes love and dedication."
Sophomore,4,I like how the school emphasizes rigorous academics. The school has many clubs and organizations to get involved in.
Sophomore,4,"Grove City , while being rather strict, has great programs with professors who really care about you and a sense of fellowship among students that I never anticipated."
Freshman,4,Grove City College is a welcoming environment with strong Christian aspects. Lovely campus and hard academics.
College Freshman,4,Professors care a lot and the classes are generally interesting.
College Freshman,4,A degree from Grove City College is really valuable and employers will never overlook you
College Freshman,4,"The school, and entire town for that matter is really safe."
College Freshman,4,"Depending on what organization you join, you will end up having different experiences. Learn the stereotypes each of them have because they're pretty accurate, and choose the one that fits your personality the best."
College Junior,4,"Our football team is one of the worst I have ever seen but most of our other teams are good to amazing. Our men's soccer team won the PAC championship last year, our women's lacrosse won regionals, and our other teams do well too."
College Senior,4,I love my classes and the professors in my department. I have had a few negative experiences with other professors but iIlove my department!!
College Senior,4,Getting a degree from this school and just being here is definitely a big plus. The name definitely carries a lot of weight.
College Senior,4,Its pretty good! Sometimes a little too much of it to be honest. there are some rules that are a little on the stupid side.
College Senior,4,"I love the athletics here, but some of the facilities could definitely be updated or changed."
College Sophomore,4,"My largest class size was about 90 for Physics 101.  That is abnormal however as class size is usually about 30.  There are no TA's for lectures and I've only had them for a lab and the professor was there too, so they were really just assisting the professor.  The classes are perfect for me personally as I love the small class size and very limited TAs.  As a Mech. Engineering major I can't really describe many of the courses on campus as most of my classes are required so I'll have 1 elective in 4 years :/ ."
College Sophomore,4,"All housing is on campus and the furthest walk I had to class was <5 minutes.  I was in the newest dorm, Memorial, and it had the best housing on campus (besides the apartments which are technically on campus but at the edge and an additional cost).  Not too much to say about housing except it is pretty straightforward, and as long as you don't room in Ketler, it'll be nice."
College Sophomore,4,"As a football player, it is pretty difficult to rate other sports during the fall semester as nearly all my time is taken up by watching film, lifting, practicing, playing games,... oh yeah and a college workload on top of it.  That being said, in my spring semester I noticed that while the varsity sports are attended moderately, club sports are very big.  Always a basketball game being played between two teams.  Frats, sororities, housing groups, and just people who get together to make a team.  While I may have ranked this as only ""it's ok"", the club sports definitely help the athletics.  Also there are plans for a new lifting center to be built on campus, and if it is open to all students and not just athletes, will be a great addition."
College Sophomore,4,Campus Safety is present for the most part and I feel safer on campus than I would anywhere else.
College Sophomore,4,Being with hall mates is the best part of living on campus. I also had awesome RAs who took amazing care of all the girls on my hall.
College Junior,4,"On campus you never hear of people being assaulted or getting hurt. It is such a friendly environment, so it is a very safe campus."
College Junior,4,"I am in a Greek group on campus. There are definitely stereotypes associated with each group, but it is a big community. If you aren't Greek, it isn't a big deal. I am still friends with plenty of people who are independent."
College Sophomore,4,"Very pretty campus, lots of scenery, and pretty buildings."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not yet gone through the process of scheduling and everything, but everyone is very nice and helpful so far."
College Sophomore,4,professors are great and curriculum is also great. but it is hard get a good grade unless you really work hard
College Sophomore,4,"safety and security on campus is great. the police officers check the dorm every late night. although we do not have a curfew, students are coming back to room at least before 2 am"
College Sophomore,4,"it is easy to get a job if you graduate here, the career center is the best and professors and other faculties help you get a job and intership"
College Sophomore,4,"professors are awesome, they are smart, helpful, and do care about students like parents do."
College Sophomore,4,"I chose to go to my college because of the cheap tuition, but overall experience at my school is great so far"
College Freshman,4,"Intervis is a big issue right now, but will be worked out"
College Freshman,4,greek life is definitely for some people & not others
College Freshman,4,"Grove City is a dry campus, that isn't to say that there isn't alcohol on campus, but it makes the campus a lot safer, and minimizes sexual assaults hugely.  Campus safety is very reliable and are good about keeping the campus as safe as can be."
College Freshman,4,"Grove City has a good amount of variety when it comes to academics.  All the professors that I have had have been very good and passionate about what they are teaching.  The size of the classrooms are probably considered small, but there is a very good professor student ratio."
College Freshman,4,I really like campus housing.  No building is too far away from academic or athletic buildings.  The atmosphere is very friendly and many people keep their doors open most of the time.
College Freshman,4,"Grove City college is very dedicated to it's students and it's academics.  The Professors at the college really have a passion for the subjects that they teach, but they also have a passion for education in general.  They want their students to learn as much as they can and they want their students to not just focus on their grades and GPA. Instead they want students to think about how much they have learned over the course of the semester in their classroom."
College Sophomore,4,"In the job recruiting world, it is said that a student possessing a Grove City College diploma holds much value. This is because of the rigorous academics at the institution and the level of what is expected. There are a few recruiters that are present every now and then, but are usually specific; having to do with accounting and finance or education."
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors here are very passionate about the subject that is being taught, but there is also a handful of professors that should really rethink what they are doing with their time. For example, the few bad professors here are condescending, self-centered, and expect you as a Grover to know and understand everything already. Though office hours are flexible and usually every day of the week, there is definitely tension between the student and the professor. A question will be asked, and the student may be expected to figure the problem out on their own or just keep searching for the answer. For the rest of the professors, however, I have a very high opinion of- They are always there to help, are very humble when helping students with an issue, and always ask if there is  ""anything else that there was a question on."" Overall, I am satisfied with the professors at Grove City College."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the quality of courses and professors is excellent.  There is a pretty decent variety of classes offered for such a small school, but it could be better in some departments.  Almost all classes are small (average of maybe 25 students), allowing professors to personally interact with students.  Professors provide as little or as much discussion and help as a student desires, and are extremely available."
College Sophomore,4,"The location of all of the dorms is excellent.  The apartments, which sacrifice distance for amenities, are still easily in walking distance from the rest of campus.  The rooms range in size; some of them can be a little small.  All of the dorms have some sort of common area for socializing, and in general the social atmosphere and hall camaraderie is excellent.  All of the buildings have laundry, but there is sometimes a high demand for the machines.  The housing process can be a pain, but housing is guaranteed.  However, residence life has a very good system for matching people with potential roommates online where incoming freshman can find another student who matches their habits, likes and dislikes, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is very different from Greek life at other schools.  First of all, fraternities and sororities are not affiliated with any national Greek organizations whatsoever.  Grove City has its own organizations in order to promote service, campus-wide events, and a welcoming and wholesome environment.  There is definitely brotherhood and sisterhood among Greeks.  All Greeks, along with the rest of the student body, are required to live on campus to promote community, and have their own halls in the regular dorms.  Some students opt to join a housing group instead, which allows for a community without quite the same level of commitment."
College Sophomore,4,"Employers love to see a Grove City College degree, because it is associated with hard work, dedication, and motivated individuals."
Alum,2,"I personally only took one class online at the college, and it was one of my easiest courses. It was asynchronous."
Junior,2,"I transferred into GCC giving it the benefit of the doubt because I had heard mostly good things about the school. While I made some great friends that I will never forget, the student-body seems to put a precedent of politics over faith or conflate the two together. As a result it creates this sense of monolithic thinking that's narrow minded unfortunately. I will warn the school is definitely a bubble so be prepared for narrow minded thinking and lack of social awareness. The professors I had were great and very helpful and I learned a lot from them. Long term, the school's value is going down based on the increasing tuition along with job prospects out there after you graduate. It's a great school if you're looking to work in a conservative think-tank in DC but besides that, it is not known at all outside of the Greater Pittsburgh area. After considering all those factors, I have just transferred out to a state school."
Sophomore,2,"Honestly, Grove City College is a great place. The people are extremely nice and overall genuine people. However, for me, I am looking for something different in a college which is why Grove City is not the right fit personally."
Junior,2,"Grove City is a life-sucking institution. The academics are “rigorous” in the sense that they require an obscene amount of work. If you think you can come here and have a social life outside of your classes and maybe one activity/group then you are wrong. Mental health and morale are very low here. The terribly cold and dark weather may be a factor in this though. The dining hall food gets worse by the year. The people are all white, conservative, and judgmental. Good luck if you don’t think Reagan was the greatest President in history.

Positives: the campus is pretty and the professors are generally helpful. Safest campus in all of PA probably because there is no drinking/drugs and there are limited visitation hours between genders. 

Bottom line: the college will depress you and stress you out. But if you’re into Christianity you’ll probably find something interesting here. Campus is pretty, but that doesn’t stop you from wanting to run away 24/7 and never return."
College Freshman,2,Everyone is white and conservative
College Freshman,2,You'll never find drugs on campus unless you really look for them.
College Sophomore,2,"Grove city College is a D3 school, and no one really cares about the sports except those who participate. Students are not involved in supporting the teams, and every sports team here is pretty bad. The athletic facilities are mediocre for athlete and student use though they get the job done."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few parties on Grove City's campus.  All large scale parties hosted by a campus organization have to be approved by college administration.  If students desire to party hard in college, they do not typically pick GCC.  Students who occasionally wish to attend a large scale party may travel to the next town over and go to a party at Slippery Rock University."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few options for financial aid from the college itself if you are not the child of a college professor somewhere or are not an international student.  However, the lack of financial aid from the college is significantly offset by the fact that they do not inflate their prices to the same degree as most other schools with good academics.  Thus, with the price of tuition already low, they do not need to provide financial aid to the same degree as other institutions."
College Freshman,2,"No one really goes to Grove City to party, so there aren't really any options."
College Freshman,2,"There are not parties, but if you want to find drinking you can find it if you look. It does exist but I do not think I would classify it as parties. More like people hanging out drinking."
College Junior,2,"There's not much diversity here. Everyone is pretty much Christian, white, and conservative."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you know the right people, you go to Slippery Rock."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to party you have to go to Slippery Rock University - about a 15 minute drive. Students don't interact much except at parties, but it's hard to find Grovers who actually like to drink. Even after they're 21."
College Sophomore,2,"Your choices include: BoBo's rice bowl, Sheetz, or Coffaro's Pizza."
College Senior,2,"Freshman male dorms tend to be nice. Everything is cleaned and maintained well. In any of the older buildings, too many people are placed in rooms, for girls, known as ""forced triples."" Some days, specially in winter, you won't have hot water or you just won't have water at all. Rules are not equally enforced across halls, so pick wisely."
College Junior,2,"Grove City is a tiny town with very limited activities. Nothing seems to be open late, or on the weekends. GCC is only about an hour from Pittsburgh, however which is nice. Students also go to Slippery Rock University a lot, since GCC prohibits alcohol on campus."
College Junior,2,GCC doesn't accept government aid. The financial aid it provides is very limited and there are very few merit scholarships available. Even the need based scholarships are often not enough and many students are forced to take out a lot of loans.
College Junior,2,"There are very few places within walking distance. There are several decent restaurants near the outlets, but if you don't have a car, you can usually forget about getting food off-campus. There is a popular pizza place that delivers, but very few places do, which doesn't make much sense seeing that the college is such a big part of the community."
College Junior,2,"If you're not part of the Greek life, you're generally looked down upon. The groups vary from typical sorority/fraternity groups to the opposite: strange and random groups of people in a Greek group. I guess this means anyone can find a Greek group to join. Girls are not allowed to have housing groups while boys can, which seems a little unfair."
College Senior,2,Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of courting.
College Senior,2,Food is salty and dry most of the time.  Meat is always overcooked.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is virtually nothing to do in Grove City, though Pittsburgh is just an hour away."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is not that great. Bon Appetit (the company that provides the dining options) has its good days, but mostly not that great and occasionally borderline horrific. I have heard that the food has been better in past years and is just declining in quality. Bon Appetit loves to post signs and talk about how wonderful, organic, local, and ""cage free/free range"" their food is, but quite frankly, it just isn't all that great as a whole. Sherry runs a great omelet station for breakfast in MAP that is hugely popular (get there early to get in line!) and the crepe station is also a big hit. The pork is usually good as well. The Geedunk (in the student union) has a nice dining option that can be used with a meal credit (you can bag up the food and take it anywhere with you) but the options are limited and get old after awhile. If you want really good food, go to the Food Feedback Forums that are every other week. They are put on by Bon Appetit and the Student Government Association and there is always really good food, proving that Bon Appetit CAN make really good food when they want to!"
College Student,2,"There is no ""downtown.""  Only as few bars, and nowhere for those underage to go at night."
College Freshman,2,"I just went to one party, GANZA. Hearing from people, the parties in Grove City are all good"
College Sophomore,2,No clubs. Campus events are the best though!
College Sophomore,2,"I'm all for racial diversity, but the Christian campus is not exactly accepting of sexual diversity."
College Freshman,2,"Very strict policies, but well worth it for the great education."
College Freshman,2,It's cold and windy from November to April. When it's not raining during the fall and spring everyone stops what they are doing to enjoy the weather. 
College Freshman,2,Off campus housing is virtually non-existent. Freshmen are required to live on campus unless they are living with a parent or grand parent. Exceptions are not made. 
College Freshman,2,The track is always full and causes many students to run around and off campus. I'm pretty sure that my high school gym was better equipped than the one at Grove City.
College Freshman,2,"Ring by Spring!! The school itself is a marriage mill. More girls go to get their MRS degree than to learn anything. First day of orientation they say ""Look to your left, look to your right, your future mate might be insight."" Any friends of the opposite gender are seen by others as ""potentials"" rather than just friends. It is beyond ridiculous and if you are in a relationship the pressure put on by your peers to get engaged is awful."
College Freshman,2,Financial aid at Grove City if you're lucky consists of a couple hundred dollars and no more. It's better than nothing but so is that penny on the sidewalk.
College Sophomore,2,There is no off-campus housing for full-time students.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no nightlife at the campus. Much is left to having friends over in the dorm, but girls and guys are only allowed to be in the same dorms during certain hours."
College Junior,2,"It's always gray and raining, but when it's not it snows."
College Junior,2,"The workload is crazy, and everyone's GPA goes down."
College Junior,2,"What parties? But I'm not a party person, so it wasn't too bad for me."
College Junior,2,"Intramurals are huge on campus, while varsity sports are not even an afterthought."
College Sophomore,2,Diversity at Grove City College is kind of like a liberal at a gun show.
College Senior,2,just typical western PA weather. the falls are BEAUTIFUL
College Senior,2,There is night life. a lot of it. people get creative here. However..it does not involve anything illegal. 
College Senior,2,"It is a small little town. There is not a lot to do, but the outlets and Pittsburgh is nearby. "
College Freshman,2,"Most professors are good, classes are crazy difficult"
College Senior,2,"It's a pretty bipolar campus. In the fall and the spring it was warm and fairly sunny. Winters can be long and cold. It snows frequently, but it rarely piles up. It does rain a fair amount. At least during finals in the spring the weather is gorgeous."
College Student,2,"It always rains or snows! The weather in the summer is pretty good, however, but that is usually the case for most colleges."
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks and non-Greeks coexist at Grove City. There are great friendships , solid memories, and special moments that mark each group of students."
College Junior,2,"I applied for financial aid and I did receive some, but it was not as much as I would have liked.  The scholarships I received were based on my grades."
College Freshman,2,"people here call the student parking lots ""Siberia"" or ""Timbuktu"" because of the distance from the buildings.  in reality the parking lots are in a good place and are just across the street from the main building for classes and the girls' dorms.  Its a small school, so the comparisons of distances gets skewed.  we are used to having short distances to walk everywhere so compared to that the parking lots are a bit farther.  at a regular or bigger school the walk to classes alone would be way longer than our walk to the parking lots."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no public transportation systems. This being said, a lot within the town is in walking distance and there are often people who are going to further places who are happy to give rides."
College Sophomore,2,"As a Division III school, there is not a large emphasis placed upon sports. This is in keeping with the academic focus of the school. That being said, there are a large number of Varsity sports provided as well as lots of club and IM teams. You will be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't participate in a sport of some kind. But few people attend any games. It is frequently joked about that the only people who go to football games are the band and they just do homework when they aren't playing."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is available for those who are interested, however since Grove City won't allow chapters of real fraternities and sororities on campus, all of the Greek groups only exist on Grove City's campus and won't provide networking for you in the future."
College Freshman,2,Nothing on weekends. if you join a sorority or  fraternity have a little better social life.
College Freshman,2,"Classes never get cancelled at this college due to weather, unless it is a very severe storm.  Because it is located so close to Pittsburgh, the sky is usually overcast and we have almost constant rain.  Winter is often unpredictable with it varying each year on how much snow is received.  This year, for example, we experienced little to to snow all season, but still had plenty of rain."
College Freshman,2,"The majority of us are Caucasian, there aren't many African Americans, virtually no Hispanics, and a decent number of Asians. Despite this though, students and faculty are by no means racist or prejudice."
College Senior,2,Not much to do in a rural rust-belt town like Grove City. 
College Sophomore,2,"The only transportation offered is to and from Pitt International Airport.  It costs $30 each way and is only offered at specific times for breaks.  Otherwise, you live right on campus, so there is no need to have a vehicle to get to class (it's about a 5 minute walk to any building)."
College Sophomore,2,We are a Christian School so that sets us apart from many schools and many activities are centered on that principle.
College Sophomore,2,"There are apartments on lower campus that is a good alternative for upper classmen but there is no off campus housing unless you live with your parents and you commute.  The apartments are awesome and the cost is the same for the most part but there is no meal plan included. The apartments each have a kitchen, 2-4 bedrooms, and bathrooms accordingly."
Alum,1,"Don't go here. This place shattered my mental health. They are openly homophobic (Matt Walsh is coming there to speak about how gay people are ruining America or whatever soon). They're not as openly sexist and racist, but oh, they are. It's all a facade. It's not about Christ, it's about extending the Republican machine. This place destroyed me and I hope this prevents someone else from going there! Save yourself the heartache."
Alum,1,"GCC is not a place that will prepare you for the real world or the real workforce (the placement rates are skewed by Grovers staying within their own network). There is a lot of legalism on campus and shameful practices such as token diversity photos in various buildings (it's about 94% white in the student body). I never drank before I started attending here and ended up doing so because I was so miserable with the culture. I also found the schoolwork as easy as my high school's, despite GCC's claims to be academically prestigious. If you are looking to grow and make an impact on the world, do not go here."
College Sophomore,1,"I think Greek life is pretty annoying, especially during pledge week, but I know people who are involved and they're still really nice individuals."
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no night life because most students are studying and trying to pass classes.
College Sophomore,1,"There are little to no good parties, there are dances but they aren't that good usually."
College Sophomore,1,"There is little to no diversity on this campus, while there are some minority students it is predominantly white conservative christains."
College Freshman,1,"There are off-campus housing options.  However, off-campus living is discouraged by the college administration which makes it not worth the effort of pursuing."
College Freshman,1,"No off-campus housing available whatsoever. There are apartments which feel a bit more ""off-campus"" but are in fact still on the college campus. Not a bad thing at all though--the community it promotes here is amazing."
College Freshman,1,"No party scene whatsoever, and you get some people complaining about that, but for the most part it's a positive thing for the campus community. If you want to find it, it can be found."
College Freshman,1,There is no off campus housing available. Unless you are a commuter or you are married.
College Sophomore,1,"You're not allowed to live off campus for the first four years of your education unless you live within 40 miles of the campus or have a ""close family member (Aunt, Uncle, grandparents)"" who live within 40 miles. 

Yes that's a real thing."
College Sophomore,1,"Inter-visitation hours (where boys can go into girls dorms and vice versa) include: Wednesdays from 7-10 PM, Fridays from 7PM-12 AM, Saturdays from 1PM-12AM, and Sundays from 1-10PM. While a boy/girl is your room the door must be open 4 inches and a light other than the TV has to be on. You may think that those are just rules and people probably don't follow them. You would be wrong. Everyone follows them. If you have a boy in your room you have to sign him in with your RA and then they go around during their shift to check to make sure your door is open and they can see a light. If they don't they knock and come in to tell you to keep the door open or to turn the light on. Time limits are strict too, you gotta have them out right on time or the RA will kick them out. I'm not joking. This really happens. I've heard of people sneaking in on other days, but I've never seen it myself. There's no alcohol on campus and even if there is it's hidden away in someone's room who probably isn't going to share. Even if they would share, most of the time it's a guy and if you're a girl (like myself) you really can't drink in their room with them because the door has to be open. The only thing they aren't super strict about is noise, but to be honest the dorms are pretty quite anyway so there isn't a real need for them to be super strict. I did get told be be quieter one time outside my room... I was having a conversation with a friend at a normal speaking voice level during quiet hours (after 11 on weeknights, 12 on weekends) and the RA told us we had to either go into someone's room or end the conversation."
College Senior,1,"NO ONE outside of Pittsburgh knows of this school. The career services office is supposed to be one of the best in the country, but when they laud the fact that Enterprise is coming to recruit at the school, it makes you skeptical. Alumni are either fully engaged or have completely moved on."
College Junior,1,NO parties whatsoever. Everyone goes off campus to party.
College Junior,1,There is absolutely no off campus housing which is extremely frustrating because it would be much much easier and cheaper to live off campus.
College Freshman,1,Almost non-existent because it is not allowed
College Freshman,1,The college's mission is that each child pays for his/her education on their own  and no one pays more than their share for other students. It's a fine mission except that it doesn't leave the paper. If everyone is paying for their education solely then why are 95% of the girls dorms forced triples. Is that forcing a person onto what two other people have agreed is their share of the room.
College Freshman,1,There is no such thing as Nightlife at Grove City. I'm pretty sure fun of any type is banned.
College Freshman,1,"Grove City was without a doubt the WORST experience of my life. I was a religious kid, I was so excited to go to a christian school. I regret it completely!! The religion there was used at a bragging right and an excuse to be mean. I have NEVER met people who were more judgmental and mean spirited. I was bullied by my roommates (I was also in a forced triple). I tried standing up to her things got worse and the college refused to help. They said the christian thing to do is to work it out. I tried and it the WORST time of my life. There are safe places to go. I had to sleep in the luggage room several times. I went on college prowler before and there was one other person that said they hated it. I wish I had believed him. I would never choose to go here. If i had a do over and they put me in a new room with out the bully. I would still say no because they short answer is that they care more about looking religious than demonstrating kindness. "
College Freshman,1,"Hours are awful. Forced 21 meal, meal plan but can use 3 a day at most and they must be one at breakfast, one at lunch and one at dinner. Very regimented and poor quality. Invest in a Microwave. "
College Freshman,1,"I was majoring as an Elementary Education major and I was severely dissapointed in the lack of knowledge of current happenings in the Education world. While the teachers know a lot, questions about the Common Core were answered with I don't know. This happened in a class as we talked about the pros and cons of different forms of assessment. "
College Freshman,1,Grove City was recently ranked 2nd in the Worst Manageable Course load. You are expected to work at least 90 hours a week. That being said if you put the time in you do get results it's just a heck of a lot of time. The atmosphere is that a stressed student is a good student. The stress and tension at Grove City is palpable.  
College Freshman,1,There are certain Inter-visitation hours that are strictly enforced. The door has to be open a shoe and there has to be a light on and both parties must have feet on the floor at all times. Drinking is unheard of and so are drugs. 
College Freshman,1,"Bullying is a HUGE unspoken problem at Grove City. Part of it is that the victims are told to talk out the problems if they want to switch rooms making the bullying worse and then if they seek out help, everyone is too busy working to notice others  are struggling. Personal safety is hard especially in the cases when your bully is your roommate and the college refuses to move you out. "
College Freshman,1,Short answer is that Grove City College will NOT let you live off campus. 
College Freshman,1,"A parking spot cost $350 a semester. It is the only way off campus. There are several antique shops within walking distance and a subway but if you need something like a prescription at Walmart, you're looking at a 2 mile hike there and another one on the way back. Not to mention that it usually rains and the sidewalks fad out after like a mile and a half. Most people just tell you to beg a ride making the people who do have cars reluctant to say yes due to the constant need and it's a terrible way to feel. Also Pittsburgh is a little over an hour a way and there is no transportation there either. "
College Freshman,1,Unless you enjoy studying and or prayer groups then there is no fun. Students work at least 90 hours a week and are severely judgmental if you take a break at all. The atmosphere is like a morgue. 
College Freshman,1,All of the girls are forced into forced triples and it's near impossible to switch out if there are any issues. There only solution is to talk out the problem and if that doesn't work... Then they'll talk about it more. There is no transportation anywhere and you are literally stranded in the middle of no where. It's a 2 mile walk to the nearest Walmart and not many students have cars. They have two cafeterias that have variable hours and one is entirely closed on the weekends proving that most students flee when and if they can.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This was probably my biggest complaint during my four years at Grove City.  The student body is almost entirely made up of very conservative (politically, spiritually, and socially), upper middle class, white kids.  Those who don't agree with the views held by the majority of the student body usually end up in one of two categories...they either completely shut up and pretend they agree with everyone or they become extremely outspoken and known as ""the democrat"", ""the liberal"", or ""the crazy Pentecostal"", etc..."
College Senior,1,It is a small farming town. Not a city. you need your own car 
College Freshman,1,"No free time, study for hours, get sub par grades"
College Freshman,1,Everyone here has the same views
College Freshman,1,Grove City: Where your best isn't good enough
Recent Alumnus,1,Want to get out of that God forsaken town and you don't have your own car? Good luck with that.
Recent Alumnus,1,Mine broke the first week my freshman year and they made ME pay for the damages that I didn't even do!
Recent Alumnus,1,What a joke. I went to better football games in Middle School than I ever went to at GCC>
College Sophomore,1,"Grove City would be nothing without the college, so the local scene is pretty lame. There's not much to do locally except for a trip to the outlets, and that costs money."
College Senior,1,No nightlife other than driving an hour away to Pittsburgh. You make your own parties.
College Sophomore,1,The weather at Grove City is nothing to envy. The worst time of the year is winter. Especially because classes are rarely cancelled when we get a lot of snow.
College Freshman,1,"The college is trying very hard to attract a more diverse student body. I honestly believe that they will succeed, but for now we're a bit low on different opinions. "
College Sophomore,1,"Classes are hard. I may not be the smartest person in the room, but most of the classes are simply ridiculous. What would make this level of difficulty acceptable is if classes were actually challenging. Few, if any, are. Cram for the test is the mantra of every student. Comprehension is optional at Grove City. Also, questioning of the material in class is highly discouraged, not from professors, but from the students themselves. A raising of a hand will earn the owner scorching glares from every eye in the class. Thankfully, most professors are very helpful during office hours, so try not to get too lost in class and they will help put you back on course. So, in my near two years here, I can honestly say that I have yet to learn anything."
College Sophomore,1,"In keeping with the theme of uniqueness, Grove City likes to make sure its student body is distinct from any other college. It keeps itself homogeneous. Like I first did, some may think this is a good thing; like minded people with similar backgrounds coming together to discuss ideas and problems. You knew the perspectives of other students. However, this doesn’t challenge you perception of the world at all. What Grove City has become is an amalgamation of moderately wealthy, white, home schooled, Presbyterian kids. Anything else is simply not tolerated. To test this, walk up to any Biblical and Religious studies major and tell them you are Pentecostal and you will be lucky to walk away without having others question your very salvation. And God forbid you went to public school. If it gets out that you have, people will begin to question your basic ability to reason correctly."
College Sophomore,1,It is virtually nonexistent. Only married couples are allowed to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not very much diversity on campus, but when there is students are very accepting of them."
College Freshman,1,"Awful food, unhelpful campus security, people wander in off the street to come into campus"
College Freshman,1,"No bars, no parties, no clubs, no transportation to the nearest entertainment which is 15 minutes away. Opposite sex can only be in your dorm buildings for a certain number of hours each weekend. Segregated campus. No alcohol, entertainment, or fun to be found anywhere"
College Freshman,1,Just don't go here. Look at slippery rock if you are a normal person. it's only 10 minutes away. I pity those who go here. Look at my other posts to see why. I am so glad I am out of this hellhole of a school. 
College Freshman,1,"Very few frats and they don't do anything. Little to no community service, no service projects, and of course no drinking allowed here. Second driest campus in the nation. They aren't frats as much as they are bible studies. It is shameful to even be placed in the category of Greek life. Thankfully these frats are not very popular across the country and they only have themselves to dissapoint"
College Freshman,1,"No partying, no trips off campus, no entertainment. Inter- visitation with members of the opposite sex only occurs a few hours each weekend. If you like to have a little bit of fun or even party occasionally, don't go here.You will rot in boredom. "
College Freshman,1,"Incredibly conservative. That is all I have to say about the people I encountered my one semester I stayed. Their biggest talking points are church and school. The guys are very stuck up and intolerant of others. Cursing on this campus easily offends everyone.  The girls on this campus are even more conservative. The relationships made there are purely for marriage. There are no short flings and one night stands are unheard of. The guys and girls in particular will only be in relationships where a marriage will ensue. The girls are very prude, and are the stereotypical goodie christian girls. It is the closet thing you can get to a Mormon society than going to BYU. Everyone is thoroughly obsessed with religion. I am religious, and it was absolutely overkill to me. Unless you are this way, and most normal people aren't, DO NOT GO HERE."
College Freshman,1,"The only minorities that can be found are a handful of African Americans and a handful of Asian Americans. Many of the African American students I talked to were there for sports. I was told that at one point the lack of diversity was so bad that a few years ago, a gay student was bullied so much that he committed suicide. Since then, Grove City has hired a diversity counselor who has effectively sat and done nothing. The school says they are very diverse, but this year (2013) they did not even have school off for MLK Jr. Day. Instead, this was the day that their classes resume. The population is white Christians. No diversity. In my building, I had a grand total of two African American students. In the entire building."
College Freshman,1,"While GCC gives you fairly nice computers of your own, they do this so that your activities are under their jurisdiction. The internet servers block just about everything. I've been told that the IT department even monitors your keystrokes. No video games, no file sharing of any kind, and random websites that are not inappropriate at all are banned. Finding sites to use is almost impossible, as the fire walls are set so tightly that even the smallest offence will prevent access. Wifi is awful and anywhere you go you need to bring a Ethernet cable with you, although this won't do much. More than 5 people connected to the internet in one area is enough to crash the system. The wifi is not even available to other devices. The computers are automatically connected to the internet, but any attempt to connect other devices is prevented due to password protection. You need to take your devices to someone who knows the password in order to be connected. The wifi service is abysmal. Not to mention their paranoia about texting in class has caused them to install jammers in each of the academic buildings. This not only renders your phone useless, but the constant switching from wifi to 4g to blocked service disrupts your phone. After about a year of use from these computers, they start to malfunction. I transferred after one semester, and many of the acquaintances I made are already complaining about their faulty computers half way trough their second semesters. Classic HP technology. Good for one year and then they fall apart. The IT department specializes in repairs, but they are often unable to fix your problem. Grove City's policy is to give you the computer after you have finished graduation. Unfortunately, you are doing Grove City a favor by disposing of their garbage. "
College Freshman,1,"Grove City prides themselves in their prestigious physics and engineering programs, but every other subject is sub-par. I am a history major, and the teachers I had my first semester were awful and were entirely unapproachable.  I thought that a small school would mean hands on teaching and a community feel, but this is the polar opposite of the academic environment at GCC. Despite numerous attempts at to talk to my professors for help, they refused to see me more often than not. Most professors had office hours for maybe one hour per day, and were very irritable if you came in and took up their time. My professors couldn't care less about their students, and they follow a ""sink or swim"" policy. If you're doing great in their class, good for you. If you are not, then you're on your own. Atrocious method for a small school where many classes contain fewer than 25 students. Decided to transfer halfway through the fall semester of 2012; best decision I have ever made.  DO NOT GO HERE."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing to do on this campus but study and pray. If you enjoy having even a small amount of fun, DO NOT GO HERE. No local places to go unless you have a car, which isn't allowed freshman year. They put on a great act and make the campus seem fun during tours and orientation, but the entertainment is dull and virtually nonexistent. If you are a hardcore christian you will be entertained by the mandatory chapel visits and 20 churches located within 10 miles of campus. But if you are not, don't think of going to Grove City. I made the same mistake. Transferred after one semester. Biggest mistake of my life."
College Freshman,1,"Grove City is a small prive Christian school in Pennsylvania. There are very few students who do not come from a Christian background and therefore, Grove City is a very conservative Campus. Also, the student population is almost entirely caucasian with very little diversity."
College Senior,1,"Rain, rain, and more rain. Grove City is just below the NW Pennsylvania snow belt, so we often see the 35-40 degree rain while everyone else gets snow.  Furthermore, the College only experiences nice weather for the first couple weeks of the year and the last few days of finals."
College Senior,1,"The college is so legalistic! Campus Safety is made up of mall cops acting like the NYPD and Residence Life agents are always looking for an excuse to get someone in trouble.  It could be worse, but four years of ""shoe in the door,"" no alcohol, and excessively judgmental fundamentalists make one crave the freedom of graduation."
College Senior,1,"If you love miserable weather from October to April, come to Grove City.  35 degree rain is the rule, not the exception. As far north as GCC is, there is surprisingly little snow to boot. "
Recent Alumnus,1,There are no parties. I believe some bars have popped up since I graduated? It was a dry town when I was there. Basically don't plan on Nightlife. I studied both Friday & Saturday night until 9pm and got Bs. I was my high school's salutatorian. Hope that helps.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Old, Married, or Townie – If you are not one of the previously mentioned things as found in my heading, you will have a terrible time living off campus."

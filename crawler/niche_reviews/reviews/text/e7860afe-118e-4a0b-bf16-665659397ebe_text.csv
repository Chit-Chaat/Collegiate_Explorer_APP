Junior,5,I have never felt more motivated and supported at an institution before! Everyone is pretty amazing here!
Junior,5,"I love the flexibility of the online classes. They offer 5,10, and 15 week courses, which help me complete my education around my busy work schedule"
Junior,5,"The 3 year BSN is phenomenal. Well organized, amazing professors, and so many opportunities. This school as a whole cares about their students. They work hard to accommodate all types of students and meet the needs of each individual. The campus is beautiful. The clinical setting on campus is state of the art. The best part is on acceptance all students are guaranteed clinical placement!! If you're interested in health sciences especially nursing, this is the place to be. I am able to work while pursing an accelerated degree, get it paid for, and do well. Love, love, love PA College of Health Sciences."
Freshman,5,"First I like that building is secure. They have lots of resources and tutors. Also, they have a gym for exercise. The teachers are well educated on the topic being discussed. You get your money worth out of the amount of educated being taught  in such a short time period.  Overall, I love my experience with Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences."
Freshman,5,"I just began my first semester here at the college and I have been blown away with the maturity and focus on education that these professors have. Having attended other colleges previously, my experience at those are nothing compared to what I have experienced in my first few weeks of classes."
Senior,5,PA College of Health Sciences provides an excellent curriculum in a multitude of health majors. The clinical simulation lab is an excellent resource and their affiliation with Penn Medicine provides an unrivaled learning experience.
Freshman,5,PA College is there to help you succeed in everything you do! At PA College you come out prepared to be an experienced nurse!
Freshman,5,My experience with all of the people I have encountered at this college has been amazing! Everyone has been very helpful. The campus is beautiful.
Junior,5,"My experience with Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences has been great so far. I am currently in the 3 year BSN program, which is new and still has some kinks that need working out, which is expected. All my nursing instructors have been wonderful and so helpful. I wish there were more options for living arrangements, or at least school facilitated ways to find roommates."
Sophomore,5,"The nursing program here for RNs is amazing. There are a few hitches with professors seemingly not caring for students but they prepare you for a no excuse/ no nonsense careers. I wish they were a little bit more forgiving with life circumstances but you just have to push through. From my experience, academic help is available all around and the students help each other study to get through."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. I'm currently going into my second year here, and I love everything about it. The professors and teachers are always happy to help and the resources for students are top-notch. The process to apply and register for courses is very easy and the advisors are always available to help with any questions you have."
Sophomore,5,This is a great school!! Education is the best I got out of any nursing school! It is well worth the 45 min drive and the amount paid to go here!
Niche User,5,PA College is an amazing school with a beautiful facility and many important people always willing to give out a helping hand.
Freshman,5,It is a small college with one on one student/instructor interaction; the instructors are available and willing to work with you when you need assistance with studies/clinicals
Graduate Student,5,Participated in the LPN to RN bridge program and evening/weekend program to achieve my RN. Really enjoyed it and learned a lot.
Junior,5,This school is amazing. The campus is spectacular and is dedicated to the students in health careers.  The campus offers a hands on experience which is beneficial and real life clinical program to help you prepare for the future.
Sophomore,5,The college is very updated and the surgical tech program is great! The staff is also very excellent. Everything is clean and the SIM labs are amazing.
Sophomore,5,I really like the college it is a great school. During my time there I've really meet some very supportive teachers and then there are some who are not so supportive. The only things I'd like to see change are some policies regarding hospitalized students missing exams and the automatic 10% deduction off of your exam.
Junior,5,"The new renovation of the school is exactly what it needed. I still wish they would have been better with providing living for the students, hopefully that is something that will be available in the future. The new facility is a great learning environment, with many places to study and practice nursing skills. The program is rigorous, but they have many ways students can seek help if they are struggling. This school pushed me academically and I feel it was well worth it. "
College Freshman,5,"For nursing, it is a very difficult major. The school specializes in nursing but the program should be difficult and the work load is a lot. Sometimes I question myself if I can handle this school"
Sophomore,4,"I like pa college because it's convenient for me, the instructors are good and their college is well organized."
Niche User,4,"Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences is very different than most colleges. There seems to be a lack of diversity however everyone seems to be openly accepting and quite happy. Tuition seems to be reasonable with such new and up to day renovations and technology. The school itself has a very modern look and gives the overall hospital feeling in a transparent way. Most of all the staff has gone to Lancaster General College, worked for their hospital, and has returned to teach and have been beyond successful doing so. This college has a very, very high rate of occupational placement within six months of graduating. Overall I was very pleased with the camaraderie and experience I got from visiting Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences."
Freshman,4,"Pennsylvania College of health sciences does very well on focusing on the student. While several students complain of the curriculum being unnecessarily hard and overbearing, PA College of health sciences is dedicated to producing the best and most prepared nursing students they can. With over a 97% nclex passing rate for graduated students the college is doing well with such a goal. Also this college is one of the few colleges that offer a three year BSN degree to undergraduate students."
Sophomore,4,Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences is a great college because it has the sole purpose of getting you experience into the health care setting and making what you learn in a textbook come to life. The professors and clinical instructors are very competent and require their students to meet their expectations of competency as well. One thing I would like to see change is an expansion of our options for getting experience in different hospitals that we form relationships with.
Sophomore,4,PA College of Health Sciences is overall a very great school. The professors have high expectations of their students and they are very approachable for help when needed. The nursing instructors have high expectations for their students as well and they truly make sure us students are 100% prepared for the clinical setting with sim lab time and prep work.
Alum,4,"I went to EMT school a PA College. My teachers were great and it was a very hands on class. The school partnered with a local EMS agency Lancaster EMS (LEMSA) to teach the class and LEMSA recruits new EMTs fresh out school making it very easy to get a paid position fresh out of school.

When I was in school I was in the old building but during a brief visit to the new building  the little I saw absolutely beautiful."
Sophomore,4,"Great school. Very difficult content and a lot of work, but they make you feel more prepared for the clinical aspect of nursing. The testing is difficult, but reasonable and most of the instructors are very helpful."
College Junior,4,I like the student/professor ratio.  All the professors I have had so far have been extremely helpful and available.  The course load is hefty but appropriate.
College Junior,4,I was able to transfer several applicable general education courses from my previous degree into my program at PA College.  They also used a course from my previous degree as the required elective for my program.  I am glad my previous degree didn't go to waste!
College Junior,4,I'm just starting my actual ultrasound courses but so far so good.  The course load seems pretty intense but I know it will prepare me for my career after graduation.  I feel encouraged by the program instructors and department head that I will have the support that I need to succeed in this program.
College Junior,4,I like that the programs only have 15-20 students so that we can have more hands on experience and also get to know the directors of the program/instructors.
College Senior,4,Included in your tuition is a nurse pack and ATI books. They have many resources and help for the students. Their curriculum focuses on NCLEX style testing. This helps you prepare for the NCLEX throughout your courses. This school wants to make sure you can pass the NCLEX after graduating from the RN program.
College Freshman,4,It's a great school and an awesome nursing program.
College Senior,4,The school is very focused on healthcare and is great at providing excellent preparation for my career as a nurse. The instructors and staff are great and extremely helpful. However the tuition is high and hard for an independent student to pay without family assistance or private loans as an option.
College Junior,4,Everyone is very helpful and the quality and range of jobs available after graduation are wide open.
College Junior,4,The workload and curriculum is very intense but you learn a great deal.
College Junior,4,Professors are very helpful and tutoring and review sessions are available before tests. Registration is an easy process and I have never had any difficulty with it.
College Junior,4,Everyone is very helpful and able to answer any questions you may have. All the nursing instructors are very helpful.
College Junior,4,Professors at PCHS are laid back regarding addressing them. Several are willing to provide additional help to a student if needed. Classroom workload for gen-eds are average. Class registration depends upon the amount of credits a student has. More credits allows the student to register for classes earlier than the remaining student population.
College Junior,4,It's a lot of hard work but its worth it all.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of different ethnicitys and a wide age range.
College Junior,4,It been a good experience.
College Junior,4,"I like my sonography program I'm enrolled in, but I'm not sure id have the same experience in another program."
College Junior,4,The work load is hard but manageable. Professors are generally helpful. Physics professor is not.
College Junior,4,"It's hard, but will definitely be worth it. Looking forward to graduation!"
College Junior,4,They have a fairly high placement rate right out of school.
College Junior,4,Their computer labs are fairly new and quiet. The network is fairly reliable.
College Junior,4,The teachers are very good and relaying information that the students need to know. The classes are small which allow a better teacher to student ratio. My program is one of the largest and we still get time with our teachers.
College Student,4,Most of the work can be done on your own time.
College Student,4,People are from different backgrounds that go to Lancaster.
College Student,4,I love that Lancaster focuses solely on health care carreers.
College Senior,4,The study areas and availability for the college are great. The workload is stress but is appropriate for the program. 
College Senior,4,The course offerings are appropriate for the program. I did have to change my whole schedule to attend classes but the operating room has daytime hours unless they have an emergency. 
College Senior,4,This online class compares to my other online classes that I have taken. This particular class may have been a step higher because it requires me to do a skills test and be aligned off on it as well. 
College Senior,4,The. student body is diverse. Many different ages and races. There are some students right out of high school and some that are married with children. It is goodand age environment. 
College Senior,4,"There is a medical library at the hospital next store. We also have a small resource room with books as well as a computer system that has many data bases. 
The college offers athletics and organizations as well. They are advertised also. "
College Senior,4,There are different clubs and organizations available. The labs are a good simulation of real life. I like that the program is hands on riight away. 
College Junior,4,The computer network at school is very easy and have many computers available to use when needed. The wireless access is good but need to have the school id to be able to use it. The need for a personal computer and printer is helpful but not needed because of the access available at school. 
College Junior,4,When I first started school I had some credits that I transferred in and was a very easy process. The classes/curriculum were straightforward on what I needed to take to graduate. My adviser would help with registering for the next semester and help with questions I had about the process. 
College Junior,4,"The unique qualities about the school is how all students commute but some will come all over the states just to come to school here. Age is very spread out at the school among the students, from just graduated high school to a mom who has a 3 children at home. The most unique area at our school is the sim lab where the dummies can breath and react to certain thing when controlled by a computer. This gives the students a unique way to learn certain situations and not worry about the outcome of the patient if it goes south. "
College Junior,4,The nursing program is challenging and gives lots of experiences to grow. There is a lab in the school called Sim lab where there are dummies that mimic as our patients. The dummies can breath and have certain things be done to them depending on the need of that lab. Internships/job opportunities are pretty low but the faculty are ready to help with resumes and tips for job searching. 
College Junior,4,The professors/instructors at the institute are very well educated and has had lots of experience in the field they are teaching. They all challenge their students with classwork and outside work to push us to succeed. There are also certain people at school to help study the subjects and give extra help with test taking and tips for whatever a student may need. Although the school is full of different medical professions that a student can choose from the instructors for general studies stay the same. 
College Junior,4,"The diversity at the school is very well mixed and all students appear to be well accepting of all diversities.
"
College Junior,4,My favorite part of the schooling is the clinical experience I get to have each week. The instructors are very encouraging and knowledgeable that they make learning fun and exciting. I like how small the groups are for clinicals because I get more attention from my instructor when I need her help but also time to do my own thing without feeling that I am being watched all the time. 
College Junior,4,Considering the fact that my school is a small college compared to other colleges or universities you really get to know most of the students in your class as well as the instructors and professors.
College Junior,4,The computer network at my school is reliable and fast although at times they to maintenance on are school website they let us know if advance when it will be down and when the expect it to be back up again. The school could use more computers because they are typically always being used by students.
College Junior,4,"There are many resources available at the college in regard to academic achievement; such as libraries, open skill labs, tutors available on the campus as well as a tutoring online site free of charge for at home use. The only down side of this campus is athletic activities. There is a co-ed soccer team that is available but besides that I am unaware of any other campus activities."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a Registered Nursing major, and my classes are great . I am enjoying the school. I really like how the school starts clinicals right away. expected so far.  The workload might be overwhelming for some, but i am not having any problems. However there is alot of work. I am really enjoying my time at Lancaster General College."
College Junior,4,"I like how the hospital is walking distance form the school. It is cnvenient for classes, lunches etc. The classes are a bit longer than I was expecting, but you really do learn a lot, and most classes are just on one day which is nice."
College Junior,4,"There are many different types of people at my school. there are people with families who are going back to school, people like me who are right out of highschool, people who just took some years off, people who served our country. there are many diferent ages and backgrounds. there is an ok mix of males and females, but definately more females."
College Junior,4,This semester has been great. My instructors are passionate about what they teach and that in itself  helps me want to learn and stay engaged. I love that the school has so many resources to pull from. I am very proud to be in my school.
College Junior,4,One of the benefits is the school is small.  However that can make it difficult to have a lot of options when you schedule classes. That isn't necessary a bad thing if you are able but many people have families and jobs to tend to.
College Junior,4,"Tuition is high and the financal aid usually doesn't cover, but the education is well worth it.  When people find out you have a degree from Lancaster General College, it is usually met with a ""you go THERE?"" It's well known and the education makes the tuition worth it."
College Senior,4,"The education I'm paying for is worth it. The experience you gain at this school is unlike any other. Within the first or second semester you start in clinicals for nursing. I received a small amount of finacial aid which helped, however, it would be benefical to receive more. Students who take their time to apply for college and actually go should be awarded more money since we are making a difference. Financial aid forms should be made easier as well, not every student has a parent who is willing to decipher what the form needs and asks for. The financial aid office at my school is a little slow. For example, if mandatory papers are sent one week, two weeks later they send a letter saying they did not receive them and phone calls must be made, ect."
College Junior,4,"After I graduated, I am looking forward to work in the field for a couple of years.  I want to embrace my skills and knowledge, as much as I can. Hopefully, I would be able to work in a hospital in the mental health department. Lancaster General College prepares us and I take pride towards this school. I would definitely recommend LGC to anyone who want to pursue a career in nursing."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Nursng Program Is Fun – Although the administrative section at this school seems to be very disorganized, the classes themselves are super fun, small, and diverse. I have a great time at school!"
College Junior,4,"Student Focus – The school has made a few changes recenlty. The most remarkable change, is how much they have incorporated hands on learing into each program. Most classes have a lecture and a lab portion that applies what we have learned from the text. Also, they have a great learning resource center. They contracted with an outside internet source that offers 24 hour toutoring from actual instructors and professers. You have the option to join a lecture, sumbit a paper for instructors to review, or simply post a question and have a one on one conversation."
College Junior,4,"Helpful Career Center – I have not yet graduated, but they hold a lot of job fairs, and they helped me receive a part-time job to do while I am in school."
College Junior,4,I live about an hour away and this causes a lot of issues in trying to commute to the school.
College Junior,4,"Classes Are Fun – I am going in the major of becoming a registered nurse, and the classses are way more fun and hands on then i thought they were going to be. They give a lot of work for nurses but it is not overwhelming."
Alum,2,"The ASN program needs a lot of work.  I'd suggest students enroll into the 3 year or 4 year BSN program as it is structured differently.  The ASN program is accelerated and majority of the students fail.  These students who are failing are passionate dedicated students which is heart breaking to see that their knowledge excels out on the clinical floor, case studies, and their ability to connect the dots when questioned from instructors but exam averages drop them tremendously.  The ASN program does not provide a pharmacology course but the BSN does.  This is essential knowledge as part of the curriculum and as a nurse, regardless if the program is accelerated, there should be an in-depth pharmacology course or section.  I'd say only attend this school if you're employed by the Lancaster General Health system and make sure you pass. Otherwise, go to a community college and transfer to a different college that is not this school."
Freshman,2,"It was a beautiful school, but severely lacked teacher and student communication. I attended an open house before I started my program and they said I could do my clinical time wherever as long as I have right paperwork filled out. I joined and started and they said no now I have to use LGH and Lancaster EMS only. I can’t make my own schedule, I been trying to contact both teachers for help. If you don’t complete clinical time you fail the program. I work full time and drive an hour away to come here. I’m just disappointed with the lack of help and communication with this place. I’m wasting my time and money here. 🤬"
Junior,2,"I am in the health care administration program there, loved it until my third year. Tomomi horning teaches the most of the end classes, she is the worst teacher I have ever come across. Met with the dean about it several times. They care more about their professors and praising them then to actually listen to complaints. I am transferring. Loved this program until her and her classes!"
College Junior,2,"Does this school even have a library?! I know it does, but I couldn't tell you where it is..."
College Junior,2,The post-grad services at the school are not very helpful or there at all really. They help the students before graduation about what to do for jobs.
College Junior,2,"Many Pros and Cons – I really enjoy the people I go to school with, but I wish I could get to know them better. Since I am commuting, it is harder to meet new people and grow close to them because we are not around each other at all times. The school provides a quality education, but I wish I had more of the true 'college experience' to make many lasting friendships."
Alum,1,"This school is horrible! They ASN program is a complete disaster. Most of the teacher have no idea what they are doing. They don't know how to teach! Their tests don't even make sense based on the course lessons and materials. Their online instruction during COVID has been a mess. Most of the teachers just read off the slides or read definitions out of the books. They raised their tuition during a pandemic while everyone is learning online! Most students fail because of their ""professors"" and administrators lack of teaching and dysfunction. Bad education and overpriced. Stay away if you can!  Go to HACC or some other state school or program."

Junior,1,"The worst, professors did not handle the online experience well at all. You are basically paying thousands of dollars to teach yourself."
Junior,1,"If I could give zero stars I would. Not only did they raise tuition during a PANDEMIC, but financial aid is by far the least helpful department in the school. They refuse to assist you and ignore you for months. Advising is a joke, they can't help you with anything. Whatever you learn in class is the complete opposite of what they do in clinicals. They basically set you up to fail. For such an expensive college you'd think their courses would be better than they are. I recommend going to your community college and saving money, I'm sure you'd get a better education elsewhere. Again, their financial aid department is a joke. The worst run department by far, you receive better customer service from fast food chains. DO NOT GO HERE. RUN FOR THE HILLS."
Graduate Student,1,"Waste of time and money. Students fail more than pass and instructors are horrible. I would advise anyone thinking of going to this college to absolutely NOT! Save your money, time, and emotions. Graduated with my RN and didn’t even receive a graduation. What a disappointment."
Niche User,1,"Want to be severely depressed, lied to and lose all your confidence??? LOOK NO FURTHER!!!! Had a great college experience up until third semester of the ASN 2+2 program. First and second semester were great. The instructors were awesome. All were informative willing to help in every aspect along with challenging students. Clinical was great with numerous hands on oppurtunites. I took the third semester course twice. The first time I felt defeated and was told that this is the hardest semester and that I should try again. Throughout the course of the semester we were given 5 different instructors all with different learning styles and teaching styles. 

Part 1"
Niche User,1,"The 2+2 ASN to BSN program is terrible.  This school use to have a great reputation back when it was known as Lancaster General School of Nursing.  Now, this program is a joke.  The program is not concept based until 3rd semester.  Therefore, if you were to fail out of the program, it is less likely another school will accept/transfer the nursing courses.  

The program is unorganized and needs reviewing! It is just horrible to know that almost half if not all of the 3rd semesters students almost failed two semesters in a row (2 different cohorts).  The first semester around points were given back to boost students up, the second time around with the next cohort, they did not do the same given that they did not change much of their mistakes from the first cohort.  

Go for the 3 year BSN or other programs this school offers but not the ASN program. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE."
Niche User,1,"If this school was a government, millions would die. the likes of which have been studied in places like Mao's china, Pol pot's Cambodia, Stalin's Russian, Mussolini's Italy, or Adolf's Germany. The corruption at the bottom, trickles down from a leadership style that borders neglect and reeks of contempt for the student population. The only good thing about this college, is that if you happen to be an A+ student, you will end with a degree and only several 10's of thousands of dollars in debt. Ok, it's not necessarily THAT bad, but it's tough to find positive words."

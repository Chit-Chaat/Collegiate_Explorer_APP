Freshman,5,The American Academy of Art provides a great learning experience for all who want to major in the arts. Classes are all small enough for all students to get one on one moments with the proffesors. Everything is taught from step one and the proffesors work with everyone to help you get ahead and master the mediums.
College Freshman,5,So far I like all my classes and professors!
College Freshman,5,Students have much convenience here.
College Freshman,5,The career services at my school are amazing. Alumni also utilizes them.
College Freshman,5,I'm looking forward for the several opportunities this college offers it's students.
College Freshman,5,My major fit perfectly with this school.
College Freshman,5,I'm so proud to be a part of this very highly rated school!
College Freshman,5,"The teachers care about the students, they want them to excel. Class size is small so a lot of one on one time is possible, but some of the physical rooms need to be bigger"
College Student,5,"A top notch art school. Computer labs with excellent and high tech computers, lots of student activities in and outside of school, library has lots of resources and many places to study."
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes are extremely reasonable, allowing for personal assistance in every class if needed. Most classes are hands-on. I only find one course to be inapplicable to me, although I understand it is for the teaching of absolute basics, which I feel I have mastered."
College Freshman,5,"Aside from help finding internships while one is in school, our Career Services department is available for resume help, career assistance, and finding employment at any time after one graduates, even to twenty years out of school and beyond."
College Sophomore,5,It's the best due to it being in demand right now and my future looking bright.
College Sophomore,5,"the amazing thing about my school is that career service helps us build our portfolios and and help us prepare our portfolios before we graduate, but  the most amazing part is that after we graduate we get help finding a job even after  years pass we still will have help if 25 years pass!"
College Sophomore,5,"well, i go to an art school so it's slightly different from a traditional college/university. But it can be a bit more stressful because we do draw and also take general ed classes, the studio classes are focus on projects and we have to meet dead lines. the general ed classes also have dead lines and require more of our attention and we have to learn how to focus more.the class' hours are different from each other. the art studio classes are two hours and ten minutes and the general ed classes are one hour and forty five minutes.and usually have 10 to 30 minute break. the classes are from Monday to Thursday,the studio classes are taken all four days of the school's week and the general ed classes are taken two days of the week. we have Fridays off so it gives me time to catch up with my work. i major in oil painting so i do take a lot of painting classes and sometimes the academic work and studio work come or have the same dead lines and it can be frustrating."
College Sophomore,5,The school is very diverse with many types of students. You can get along well with anyone.
College Freshman,5,"Probably the Best in Careers – I definitely love the career services in this school and I highly doubt there is another art school that is the same in this area. They have the specific career office that students can visit at any time. They help you set up a portfolio and help out in other areas like interviews. Another thing that I find helpful is that even though you graduate and no longer attend the academy, the career service is always available in helping you find a job."
College Freshman,5,A Home Away from Home – Freshman year has truly been the most fun I've had in school. Freshman year you spend a lot of time with the same people and you take the same classes. With only 500 students attending the academy becomes a place where everyone becomes very close and familiar with one another. Quite simply the school is the best learning experiences I've had the pleasure to be apart of.
College Freshman,5,Carrer Services – The most recognizable and easily most useful resource at the academy is the career services department. They work hand in hand with the classes you take at the academy so fluidly that by the time you graduate you are ready to go out and work as a professional artist.
College Freshman,5,"Why AAA? For any aspiring artist, this is the school to attend. It's well worth the money and the pay off is astounding. This school actually focuses on art skills, as opposed to just rounding you off in every area, and making your art skills sub par. The American Academy of Art truly forces you to discipline yourself as an artist and it really hones your skills as a professional. I've never enjoyed school until I attended the academy, and I regret none of it."
Niche User,4,"I loved the small size of the school. Given it is primarily an art school. Having that small environment gives you many advantages, such as more 1/1 time with teachers and students to better learn and grow in your work.  Yet given its small size I have a good sense independence from here as well. They are not too close to you, giving you space if need be, but also are not distracted by hundreds of other artists.  As well as the fact that it gives off a very friendly and comfortable feel. Which in art as high stress as it is ,is very needed. The walls are plastered with amazing work from past and current students and graduates, giving me a nice sense of what is actually attainable after school here.  Of all the schools I toured, this one has been the most ¨appealing¨ for lack of a better term. Amazing school, with a very nice and friendly vibe twords it."
Sophomore,4,"The art classes at this school are really great. Most art professors will teach you the basics and push you further into the subject and help you expand ideas and skills. I absolutely love the art classes here. I love being able to have one on one time with those teachers and be able to constantly progress. However, the science and humanities classes are generally easy and not worth paying overly attention. There isn't a lot to offer and the ones that are offered, are too easy in my opinion. Some of the science and humanities professors leave me more confused after explaining assignments by contradicting themselves or leaving out important information. I wish there were more science and math options.
all in all, this school is great. other students are generally great and staff is mostly great. The fact that they focus on career planning makes this school top notch. I recommend."
Senior,4,I’ve attended the academy for 5+ years and I enjoyed it. Very small school which I personally like since I get more one on one time with the professors.
Sophomore,4,It's great being taught by people who are already established in the art community. The teachers are really personable and it's not hard to talk to them at all. While there isn't anything like a meal plan and the dorms are quite expensive - which is kind of expected being downtown and all - the classes and how thoroughly subject matter is covered makes up for it
College Junior,4,So far the career planning and help seems like the only reason I'm happy with this school so far
College Freshman,4,"They do everything they can to help you whether it's with cover letters, résumés, or job searching in general"
College Freshman,4,I wish they served food in the actual school.
College Freshman,4,My school will offer me the best employment options
College Freshman,4,The classes are small and the teachers are friendly
College Freshman,4,The school is extremely diverse and accepting
College Freshman,4,Many commercial internships are offered.
College Freshman,4,As freshmen the curriculum is the same for all.
College Freshman,4,The course is more commercial oriented.
College Freshman,4,Some studios are available to students after hours
College Sophomore,4,The body at my school is much more ethnically diverse than at my highschool. I also enjoy how accepting that are of others. Sometimes they can be a little pretentious though
College Freshman,4,"I feel our student body is incredibly diverse. Despite the fact that we have more female students than male, we have an ethnically diverse community of people from all walks of life. Everyone is very accepting of one another."
College Freshman,4,"The professors all seem very knowledgeable in their respective fields, and are open and willing to assist students in any area they may need help in. They really are at the school to help the student body, and care about us individually and as a whole, and are quite personable if one needs help."
College Freshman,4,"Within my school there are many different people. Just walking down the hall you see different races, different religious beliefs,  different financial backgrounds. Some people are from out of state, and living in the dorms, while others commute an hour to school. In a classroom you'll see Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, African, and many other races. Going to an art school in Chicago you see so many different types of people that there isn't any problems with acceptance, everyone is different and everyone accepts that."
College Freshman,4,"I was nervous about financial aid but right away they helped us by showing us our options and explaining each of them. They went over Grant opportunities and gave me a list of scholarship websites to use. They helped every step of the way, making sure we understood all of our options."
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are experienced artists, there are many clubs and activities to improve your artwork or just socialize. The school has a very friendly atmosphere.  The administration work hard to make the financial aid process go a smoothly as possible. The school constantly has past students come and talk about job opportunities, financial success and real world experiences."
College Freshman,4,Majoring in illustration is the majority of the school. With it you go through a specialized class program the give you the best experience in illustration. There are always job oppertunities and internships available within each different major that the school helps students apply for.
College Sophomore,4,It would be the best if school was more financially attainable.
College Senior,4,The school is small and private which is l personally find great. The students get more individual attention and encouragement.
College Sophomore,4,We are allowed to start our own clubs and the school is very liberal.
College Sophomore,4,"well, the school is very diverse! there are people from all over the city and country and other countries! and bring with them their culture. and there are full time and part time students so everyone has a chance to come and study at the american academy of art."
College Sophomore,4,"the school's staff is great. the school is a small school so there's  rarely any waiting list to go and talk to specific school's administration worker. they have an open door policy,so if they're available they will attend you right there."
College Sophomore,4,"My school has a very unique crowd of students. Each one has interesting talents, topics of interest, etc. Since attending AAA, creating friendships has been easy and fun."
College Sophomore,4,"The size of the school really makes a difference. With little students in a class, you get the assistance you want from the teacher. Which can help a lot with each assignment you have to complete."
College Sophomore,4,"The printing fees at school are very understanding. Not costly at all. Depending on the teachers you have, some will even help you out with printing what you need, if it's necessary for you."
College Sophomore,4,"Very few student lounge areas. Though the tech resources are great. There's always computers open in the library and in the mac lab an they have all the software you might need for art related projects. The photo lab is also open for use and the assistant there is helpful. Also the studio areas and the whole school is open for use on Fridays, even though no classes are held."
College Sophomore,4,"Class schedules are not flexible whatsoever; there are no night and no weekend classes. And your classes are chosen for you for the most part, with only minor adjustments allowed. And attendance is brutal for classes. Though most the instructors I have had are amazing artists and they can help you improve ten fold, though I an only speak for the Fine Arts program. I was also able to get a lot of credits transfered from my pervious college. There is no better fine art school in the area, the courses are amazing. And the small student body makes for very personalized education."
College Senior,4,"Academics provide a general umbrella exposure to general needs for success entering the world of fine arts...from core communications, networking, presentation to varied portfolio(s). Internships assistance is graciously offered."
College Senior,4,"I am a Art major...classes are intensive from start to finish. Instructors will push respective student to consistently do their best. Areas of expertise include traditional art, advertising/promotional skills including film illustration media, and story boarding..."
College Senior,4,There are no online course work...I am graduating this spring and interested in scholarship/Grants for graduate school...?
College Junior,4,Each section of the school is different and unique
College Freshman,4,I try my hardest to maintain an A or a B. Since I am a full time student I concentrate all my time on school work. Since my school is very small and private the teachers interact with us very often. Most of the students all know each other. I also love how it is very diverse with people and there are no cliches. Our teachers are very strict with our grades and want everything detailed and turned on time or you lose a letter grade every day you are late with an assignment. Our financial aid adviser also reminds us to turn in all our paper work and helps out with any problems.
College Freshman,4,"The facilities on campus aren't bad. We're next to many restaurants and coffee shops. Its not a great campus to live in, but its a great way to enjoy with friends and walk around the area and explore new places. Our campus is very small and very comfortable to sit around."
College Junior,4,School Has Great Flexibility – Whether a student is part-time or full-time there is always an option to work around your schedule to choose class times that work best for you. If you are unhappy or unsatisfied with a course or a professor there is always an option to transfer and/or drop a class. At my time being at the school I have not had to transfer or switch any of my classes and hopefully will stay that way.
College Junior,4,Grateful for School – My experience with the school is amazing. I feel that choosing to go to this school was worth-while. I have met very great students and teachers that motivate me to graduate school and that wish the best for me. One of my favorite experiences at the school was the art gallery that the freshman alumni were able to present to other students and school faculty. I would choose to go to this school again because of experience in careers that is has given me.
College Junior,4,People Are Phenomenal – My school consists of a variety of many talented and motivated individuals. Most of the students that I have met are very dedicated to graduating school as early as possible and hope to receive higher degrees in different schools.
College Junior,2,"Some professors are very stubborn and act they are better than you at what they do and don't want to help you learn, afterall this is school and not yet my career so I need to learn all I possibly can in a respectable way."
College Sophomore,2,"The school revolves around inflexibility in the curriculum. As a freshman going 3/4's time, I didn't have any classes I could choose from if I wanted to switch."
College Junior,2,Career Center Is Okay – While in school my chances of getting a job in the field are slim because of the competition that students have against eachother. Students with a higher education level will have better chances of working with the Career Center than students who have just enrolled in classes.
College Junior,2,"There Isn't Much – The actual building is decent. And the library is sufficient. But this is a really small school. Other than the library, other facilities open to students are two small lounges with vending machines, and an art gallery opened some of the times."
Alum,1,"placement.jobs They blocked me off instagram in 5min and i contacted them 4 weeks ago about job placement on no reply. When you finish there your on your own, the job placement they mention during orentation is a joke alot of the alumni past got the run around or a printout of craigalist job, i spent $120,000 i am the customer i can be the biggest dick if i wanted to be they did not have to take my money and take me as a client, most of you graduating have you asked about or went to job placement. Im doing my own thing and glad i didnt send any accomplishment so they can post it. Theres better school for the same money. Im laughing they block my account so quick but never answered my job placement. You could have went to the art institute and have a better rep and contacts for jobs, shows #art #draw #paint #oil #watercolor #advertisement #commercial #fineart #art #institute"
Alum,1,"My first three years were valuable while expensive. I improved my drawing skills, which is essential to a career in art.

There were good teachers, and horrendous teachers. I had a teacher tear down my sculpture in front of the class because she said I started it incorrectly, even though she watched me build it. I also had a new teacher threaten to fail my class during Senior year because he didn't like how we were taught/our portfolios. He tried to get us to change majors our Senior year.

The school lies. The school claimed 80%+ of my graduating class in my major was placed in major-relevant jobs. Since there were only about 15 kids in my major that graduating year, I knew most of them on social media.

The career services is a JOKE. After I graduated, I was contacted by the new career services lady. I told her I was not employed and she told me she had opportunities to send me. I never heard from her again."
Junior,1,"People broke into campus, and when students asked if they were going to do anything to protect us, they said no, because we are in a “good location” (there have been countless robberys outside on our street). We have no security and are very unsafe. They also refuse to fix things that need to be fixed, for example we had a pipe burst and they had a dumpster to catch the water for a few days, and because of this our tiles peeled up (3 months ago) and insead of fixing them, they threw ugly rugs on them instead (still there). We also had broken water fountains for two months, they refuse to turn up the heat in the lounges we have, there are no activitys yet we are charged activity fees, and there is a lot sexual harasment throughout campus. We are all paying upwards of 30,000 dollars a year, yet do not see it put into campus or towards us in any way. Our water in the bathrooms and water fountains, occasionally (10+ times) comes out brown."
College Sophomore,1,They do not offer online courses.
College Sophomore,1,The school robs you of your money. It's a for profit school but the money goes to unnecessary things such as television screens in the hallways while the chairs and tables in the student lounge are broken and hanging on for dear life.
College Sophomore,1,"You don't choose your classes. They are chosen for you. There are a limited amount of teachers, a limited amount of space for the classrooms. I wanted sculpture but it was full I so I got bloat classes that I didn't learn anything in. One teacher doesn't know what he's doing and just gives out grades he wants to give out without looking thoroughly at the student's work. I gave him a late paper and he graded it quickly in my face. He gave me a B. But out of the whole class I got a C. It's ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,The internet is terrible at the school! It's slow and sometimes it doesn't even connect. When I'm in the library there's barely any service. But when going into another area in the building it seems like that part sucks up the internet speed. There's no equal balance around the whole school. Not even for personal computers.
College Freshman,1,"BAD. Stay away from this school its a waste of your money. The students are lazy some teachers are lazy, and the tuition is a rip off. The American Academy of art is like a vacation resort for people who are basically useless. Only a hand full of students are good, as for the rest they only went to art school because its the easy route. I cant work in this environment I have to be taken seriously. AAA is a very limited school, i would strongly suggest to go to a different art school because the students and the faculty are on vacation. GET A REAL EDUCATION."
College Freshman,1,"I'm transferring to a credible school in the spring, BECAUSE the students are uneducated and have the intellectualism of a fish, only because the school accepts anybody who can pick up a pencil and is not legally blind. I cannot associate myself with people who don't take the professionalism seriously and act like high school freshmen. For the campus...its smaller than a children school the library and lunch room are pathetic, and the school runs like a nonfunctional high school. This all took me by surprise because the alumni history is great, SCAM?...the school is pitiful and deceiving."
College Junior,1,"Not Much Help – Although the school is worth my tuition pay, I do believe that I did not receive as much financial help as what I should have. I am struggling with the school loans that I had to take out and am therefore having a financial burden. My experience with the financial aid office was not a great one. The financial aid office tried to help me find options in how to pay for school but their involvement was very limited."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school has gone through 4 career advisors in 6 years.  That's right, there's only one career service advisor for 500+ students.  Makes sense, right?  So of course she helped me locate an internship when I contacted her, right?  NO.  I was completely ignored while I was in school.  Then, I heard from the new advisor after I graduated about some opportunities.  So I sent her my updated information, and never heard back again.  There has since been 1 or 2 more new advisors that I have not cared to talk to. I have since decided to take my future into my own hands and go back to a school that actually accomplishes what it promises. Seriously.  WORST. SCHOOL. EVER."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Unethical Lies. As for the high marks posted on this page...re-read them..yes, the Academy wrote those about itself. How could a 2014 graduate have such a thoroughly glowing review for a school it hasn't attended yet? The school year would start in Fall of 2010. Yes, these people are THAT moronic."
Recent Alumnus,1,"AVOID THIS SCAM. If you'll pay the ridiculous tuition costs, they'll accept you. Doesn't matter if you can draw or not. Most students leave after the first semester or stay and go into debt with a degree that means nothing from this place. It's run by unethical business people and it shows more than they realize. They lie about their job placement rate and are well know for losing whatever accreditation they have/had for long periods of time. I could go on, but you would be INFURIATED to hear all of it. Stay away from here."

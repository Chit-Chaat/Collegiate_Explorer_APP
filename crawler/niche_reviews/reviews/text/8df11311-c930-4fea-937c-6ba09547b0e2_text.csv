Niche User,5,I am a dual enrolled student at Reinhardt. The students are so nice and the professors are very welcoming and work with you to make sure you are maintaining grades and have a great semester. The campus is easy to learn and your classes are small so there is
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman music major at Reinhardt University.  The work is challenging, but I love it. The class size is smaller, so that makes learning more effective and gives a student a more personal experience with professors."
Niche User,5,It's great. The people are all really nice at Reinhardt. The dorms are the only things that need improvement. Otherwise really cool.
Senior,5,"Reinhardt is a smaller university, however, the professors here are outstanding and really want you to succeed. You get more one on one time with your professor than at bigger universities which is extremely beneficial."
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely love Reinhardt. I have had a great time since I started doing there. The teachers are amazing and so helpful. Everyone works to help you not against. I love how small the classes are, it helps me focus on the stuff I’m doing."
Freshman,5,Reinhardt to me in simpler words can be described as an open student environment. It is a welcoming atmosphere and I began to make make friends on my first day with ease.
Junior,5,"Best choice ever! I chose Reinhardt over bigger schools like UGA or Tech because I wanted to graduate with no debt. Even with Zell Miller paying for my tuition at a public school, I would have had to pay for room/board/fees. There are so many scholarship opportunities at Reinhardt that I've been totally fine to just work in the summers- I just wish the academic scholarship increased proportionally. However, I will still be graduating in a year with no debt. I have been challenged here by some amazing profs, but I have also had the best time ever- hikes, camping trips, football games, movie nights, conferences, studying abroad, getting things published, etc. Great place for performing art students, writers, nurses, teachers, and business people. The community and small class sizes are amazing. If you don't plan on spending your college years drunk, want to grow academically, socially, and spiritually, and want a small school with a fun, quirky personality, you will love it here."
Freshman,5,Reinhardt is an amazing school! I enjoy going to my classes each day.  My overall college experience is really great so far.
Senior,5,Reinhardt University provides excellent educational opportunities for professional and adult learners. All of my professors have both the educational and professional background to address current issues and expand the student’s knowledge base.  Reinhardt University offers classroom and online courses which accommodates working professionals in a cohesive and interactive  environment.  I highly recommend Reinhardt.
Freshman,5,"I wanted to chooseva a university that was close to home yet far away enough to give me the freedom to grow independently and I found thatvst RU.  The sports program thys far is great, the professors are amazing and even though  im new and still meeting  new friends,  I feel confortable with the diversity ."
Junior,5,"Reinhardt is an amazing school! I transferred in my sophomore year from Huntingdon. I loved Huntingdon as well but it just worked out better to be back in Georgia! 
The students as well as the staff is just like one big family here at Reinhardt. 
We have some pretty awesome athletes in all sports and doing awesome! The academics here are the best and I enjoy learning and being a part of this beautiful campus!"
Niche User,5,"Overall we had a great visit with Reinhardt. You automatically get a sense of a family oriented environment. Loved the class room setting and student to teacher ratio. Reinhardt received funding recently, and they're in the midst of adding a new building for dorms. I would highly recommend this University."
Freshman,5,I am currently Dual Enrolled at Reinhardt and I absolutely love it. The professors are SO helpful ands they are always willing to take time out of their day to help students if they do not understand something.
Sophomore,5,"Reinhardt has been on of the greatest experiences in my life. I'm comfortable being myself to others, and I'm not afraid of rejection anymore. It may not be the best school to go to if you want to be super successful in life, but if you want a school that will help you grow as a person; that will teach you how to be your best self, then Reinhardt is the place for you. I don't know if I'm going to have the ultra glamorous life I had planned out for myself before I got to Reinhardt, but I know that I will have a fulfilling one, and that this feeling of home will always be with me."
Senior,5,"I have been in the BCJ program for 3 years and when I missed a start date for a class in the 2nd year they emailed, called, and texted me until they reached me to make sure that I was ok.  They take a personal interest in every student whether a campus or online student!"
Freshman,5,"Reinhardt has a very beautiful campus, is very diverse, and is very safe. It gives on you more one on one connection with professors, making students more successful."
Freshman,5,"This school is amazing I love the athletics, the way you feel the spirit of Christ, and just the all around family feel."
Niche User,5,"A very beautiful, quiet, and peaceful campus. They also have some good parties (so I've been told. Since it's a private school, you can get more 1 on 1 time with the professors so they can actually help you learn the material, unlike other larger schools."
Freshman,5,My experience at reinhardt university has been amazing. From when I first stepped onto campus visiting in the winter everyone treated my with kindness and respect. Also the campus is very beautiful. They have a lot of wonderful places to relax and study. This university works with you and does their best to help you with whatever you need.
Freshman,5,Reinhardt is so welcoming! I love that there aren't many students so you get a lot of one on one time with your professor and it makes things so much easier to understand! There is so much to do at such a small campus!
Alum,5,"This school's small classroom size enabled me to build strong relationships with my professors and garner strong letters of recommendation.  Reinhardt, even though being a small school, has a lot to offer, you just have to take advantage of it."
Sophomore,5,"Love Reinhardt University!  Excellent professors!  I was accepted to several colleges, but thankful everyday I chose Reinhardt."
Junior,5,Reinhardt University is a great school! This school has small class sizes which allows you to get more one-on-one time with your professors.

There is nothing bad I can say about Reinhardt.

College Freshman,5,"Because classes are small and intimate, there's a more personal feeling with the professors. I'm more at ease and am likely to talk more."
College Senior,5,Students are safe on Reinhardt campus. Security is close buy on campus. Crime is not bad at Reinhardt Campus.
College Senior,5,The campus is great and the rooms are nice and clean.
College Senior,5,Reinhardt is a great school that help you find a jobs.
College Student,5,The value of a degree at RU is huge our professors want us to succeed in life and live to the fullest so they want us to finish with good degrees.
College Student,5,I don't think teaching styles matter they've always been different some I believe we as a people are used to diverse teaching methods but the relationship you create in our classrooms is amazing.
College Student,5,"We are a safe and smart campus and don't have and serious crimes, there may be some occasional hick-ups but that's it."
College Student,5,"Being in the dorms is awesome, yeah in some aspects of like to have a few more people in my dorm but a two person dorms lets you connect more and get a better feel for your roommate"
College Student,5,The social atmosphere of Greeks and non-Greeks affects nothing. There are no big fueds I've being Greek and non-Greek no hazing we all get along fine.
College Student,5,"I've wrestled for 15 years, and this is one of the nicest facilities I've ever seen."

College Sophomore,5,I am now a Junior at RU and I have loved every single one of my professors. They're amazing!
College Sophomore,5,"If you apply yourself, there's no way you could leave Reinhardt without a job. This school works hard to get you your degree and even harder to help you utilize it."
College Sophomore,5,"My favorite two professors are literally like second mothers two me. One inspired me to get a minor in her field, the other used her personal connections to offer me internships opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,"Very diverse campus and diversity clubs such as African Descendants, DREAMS, and ALAS (Latino group)."
College Sophomore,5,Ms. Peggy that is the career services lady searches out internships on a daily basis and helps the students find what they're looking for. Internship credits are also pretty easy to earn as well.
College Sophomore,5,All but one of the 21 sports programs had winning records in 2014. Just added three more sports as well.
College Sophomore,5,Reinhardt truly makes you feel like you're a part of a family.
College Junior,5,Public Safety stays around campus to make sure the students are safe!!!!
College Junior,5,Our career services on campus is the best!!!!!! They keep us updated on possible internships/jobs.
College Senior,5,You will get to meet amazing people and you make your experience.
College Junior,5,Living on campus builds relationships and gets you involved with campus activities.
College Freshman,5,One can easily find internships or get connected to services.
College Freshman,5,Reinhardt was a good fit for me. I love the small class size and everything about my experience.
College Sophomore,5,"No one parties on campus really, but a 30 minute drive can put you in Downtown Woodstock, which is a great place to go for a good meal and drink. There are a lot of events on our campus which are sponsored by the school,  and a lot of people choose to go to those as well."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a few off campus parties to celebrate events like Halloween, game victories, and Homecoming, but you have to know someone to get into them. The best thing to do at night and on the weekends is to try out local restaurants and bars in places like Canton, Woodstock, and Kennesaw."
College Freshman,5,in my opinion your safer here than at the white house
College Freshman,5,"every single professor is invested in your success, if you reach out to them they will guide you to where you need to be"
College Freshman,5,"intern ships and work study programs are more plentiful than air here, and virtually every one who graduates is garrenteed a job"
College Sophomore,5,"I feel confident and challenged here in my academic progress here at Reinhardt. The classes are engaging and diverse, and the faculty are always willing to help me work towards my goals."
Freshman,4,"Reinhardt is an excellent school. However, I would love to see my school focus more on good leaders in their faculty. There are members in the school that do a decent job but care so little about their students."
Freshman,4,"The college was established by a gentleman of Atlanta as a memorial to his father, and as long as he was able he gave it the support justified by ample means. It was like carrying a gold mine with all its profits to a starving people, only the profits in this case are very much more valuable than gold. To the barefooted boys and girls of that region,"
Graduate Student,4,Reinhardt has a good community of people from all backgrounds. The small school atmosphere is a great vibe and helps create a lot of life long friendships.
Senior,4,I like the way the campus is set up. The dorms are really close to the café and the classrooms and you don't have far walks. I really love how invested our school President is. She supports all students and you are welcome in her home at anytime. She also attends most sporting events and she always shows up in her Reinhardt gear. At Reinhardt you can really tell that the professors really care about you and the class size is small so you are able to connect with your classmates and professors on a personal level. The school reminds me of home and I love that.
Junior,4,"Great University experience, feels like home away home. People that really care about you and want to help you be successful. #RUREADYTOSOAR"
Sophomore,4,"Reinhardt is a great school, there is always something to do in this small town.  Everyone is nice and friendly, they truly care about your success and want to see you pass.  It might be small but it has a big heart."
Sophomore,4,"Just now completing my freshman year, Reinhardt has been a pretty good experience so far. It is a very close-nit and friendly community, but for the large price tag you do not get as many interesting advantages as you should."
Freshman,4,Beautiful campus- constantly growing. New theater on the water and new residential halls. The faculty is very knowledgeable in their fields- I wish more of the professors were permanent fixtures rather than adjunct.
Junior,4,"The insight and one-on-one help from the professors. Also, the small classes sizes made it easier to clarify questions, ask for individual help and take time to clear up any confusion."
Freshman,4,I have had a very positive experience in my first semester at Reinhardt. Counselors and professors are very helpful and supportive.
Senior,4,"Reinhardt University provides an environment for self-discovery. I would not associate that with the leadership at Reinhardt, however. The leadership does not look out for the students, but rather the image that others see Reinhardt as."
Junior,4,"I like Reinhardt overall. It is an expensive school, but they have small class sizes.  The professors are interested in your success, but it is tough academically."
Freshman,4,I like Reinhardt University because of the students to faculty staff ratio.  The small campus allows professors to get to know their students.  Reinhardt University has great athletic programs.
Sophomore,4,"I really like this college. It is a perfect college for someone who doesn't want to go to a big school, but wants to obtain a good education. I will say, there is not much to do in Waleska, but the school provides fun student activities about 3 times a week. The school is also adding greek life next year which will be fun. For my first year at the school, I didn't really run into many rude staff or professors. Everyone seems to be pretty nice, and there is a great apmosphere of peace, religion, and family."
College Freshman,4,I've enjoyed living in campus housing. The experience has been wonderful.
College Senior,4,It's a great school. 10/10 would see again.
College Senior,4,The football team bring in the most money for the school.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall school experience was different then I expected. The first week of school was a blast. The school offered so many activities to do throughout the day. As weeks and days started to go by it became harder to find things to do. My campus doesn't have things to do around it so if you actually wanted to do something you have to drive about 45 minutes. Besides trying to find something to do around campus if you are on campus you meet very friendly people. To me the people that go to Reinhardt are the ones who make the school unique. It's hard going to school and leaving home, but going to Reinhardt you meet wonderful people that genuinely  care about others that they go to school with. If I had to choose schools all over again I would choose to go to Reinhardt. You just can't get this experience anywhere."
College Senior,4,"Reinhardt offers many degrees, along with life lessons which can be applied to life after graduation. The future graduates of Reinhardt are able to apply the lessons that they gain apply it to the career of their choice."
College Sophomore,4,"I myself am not an athlete, but this is a predominantly athletic University. Therefore, they take pride in their athletic facilities."
College Sophomore,4,"It's college, students like to drink regardless of what kind of authority is in place."
College Sophomore,4,"Extremely safe and secure campus, I've had my lost wallet returned to me with all the cash in it. Only complaint is the cost of tickets on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Every now and then there is a professor that's pretty bad, but almost all of them are super helpful and care about your education."
College Sophomore,4,"It really depends on which dorm you end up in. Though, they are planning on building more dorms soon."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is coming to Reinhardt in the Fall of 2016!
College Freshman,4,Reinhardt is really safe and I feel like I am protected here.
College Senior,4,Public Safety do what they need to do to keep the campus safe
College Sophomore,4,There is a huge focus on safety and prevention throughout the campus
College Sophomore,4,One on one learning and caring about the students success is a huge factor with all the professors
College Senior,4,"We have dedicated supporters of athletics and it is growing with the upcoming of two new club sports, bowling and wrestling. We have very competitive sports teams that find their way to conference and national competitions."
College Sophomore,4,New dinning service coming in next year with great reviews and the housing is getting upgraded this summer with a new building in the next year or so
College Freshman,4,Reinhardt is a great school to come to and be successful. I have made many great memories here and great friends.I would highly recommend Reinhardt.
College Sophomore,4,"Some things need improvements but for its size, reinhardt provides its athletes and non athletes with everything they need to succeed"
College Sophomore,4,"We do not have recognized Greek life, but honor societies are a huge part of our scene here!"
College Sophomore,4,"One on one learning, it's the perfect school to attended if you want a personal learning experience. It is an isolated area but the city is 15 minutes away. There is a lot to do, it just requires you to make an effort to get involved."
College Freshman,4,Campus police are always patrolling and their office is always open if a student needed their services.
College Freshman,4,"The area around Reinhardt is well populated, with many job opportunities, making it easier on recent graduates to find a job/internship right out of school."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are wonderful and considerate of past issues. The small class sizes are what drew me to Reinhardt.
College Freshman,4,"They are always having an event or two on the weekend that way students can attend and have fun. It may not be my cup of tea, but other students seem to enjoy it."
College Freshman,4,Many students attend the athletic games and cheer on our Eagles. It is a great way to be involved and rally behind our team. The school does a fantastic job at trying to get students to the games and support our teams.
College Freshman,4,I love being at school. It is such a great environment and the faculty does a wonderful job at making you feel welcome. They are really caring and have taken my concerns into their hands.
College Freshman,4,there ok. there adding more things there going to add.
College Freshman,4,There is a great variety of liberal arts studies but not so much for the science and math route.
College Freshman,4,Public safety makes sure that we are safe and the campus is well lit at night.
College Freshman,4,We get emails almost daily about job opportunities near by. The career services are very accessible
College Freshman,4,I absolutely love the suite style provided at Gordy Hall. The sense of community is great and I love not having to share a bathroom with an entire hall. The convenience of having the bathroom right there is great. Our RA picks great themes for our hall as well.
College Junior,4,"In my opinion, the campus is pretty secure. However, it is not recommended to walk alone at night, for there are usually no guards around. The lights are always on however, but if you don't feel safe, it's best to walk in groups."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy my classes. There are some classes however, where it tends to be cold and it's bit of an issue to me."
College Junior,4,"I think it's pretty decent; then again, it's my first time living on campus so I have nothing to compare."
College Junior,4,The atmosphere is very welcoming. The teachers seem to really care about you; you are not just a number on a roster. Also I believe that the small size of the classes helps a lot in building this close relationship with your teacher and classmates.
College Sophomore,4,there is a lot of equipment
College Senior,4,They have great coaches who are very successful and the teams work hard
College Junior,4,I don't really attend sporting events.... but I they always do great
College Freshman,4,"Well I haven't yet really had the full experience to fully let it sink in but everything seems promising. The students, to faculty, and also the community of Waleska are very nice, friendly and they support one another. Everything you look for in a community where you can call home."
College Freshman,4,The overall experience at my school was awesome.
College Freshman,4,"They take very good care of their campus, their professors are understanding and cool, and it's a cute town with beautiful scenery!"
College Senior,4,"Wish there was a little more to do, that is closer. School gets stressful, and blowing off some steam helps a lot."
College Freshman,4,The campus is vary separate from the off-campus food.
College Freshman,4,The parties are usually from the music students.
College Sophomore,4,Parties don't usually happen on campus because of the dry campus enforcement. Students usually take the parties somewhere else off campus and I find that to be very respectful and smart.
Sophomore,2,"The sports and theatre programs are usually great at Reinhardt. The professors are typically good too, small classes make it easier to succeed. Reslife and housing team is amazing. Besides this, they do not have much to offer. The financial aid office is awful, basically stealing money from students. The dean of students is fully aware of it and allows it to happen. Does he really care about the students? Clearly not. Food is average if not below average. Computers are the slowest thing ever and the wifi connection isn't much better."
Alum,2,"I honestly did have too many online classes. I learned a lot about during my experience. According to some of my friends, online classes were sometimes frustrating. If you are trying to keep a 4.0 through college, don't take an online class at Reinhardt. I have known friends who have had whole letter grades dropped because of a error with the system."
Sophomore,2,If you take an online class you will not be taught you will just get assignments and just figure it out yourselves.
Sophomore,2,The college is not very diverse when it comes to the people so you feel like an outcast if your a minority. The school is way too expensive for the type of education I am getting. I feel as if I am going to be poor because of the extremely high tuition.
College Freshman,2,It's very quiet during non-school hours.
College Freshman,2,It's very quiet during non-school hours
College Freshman,2,"They took away a $4,000 scholarship of mine"
College Freshman,2,food is not healthy options and not plenty portions
College Junior,2,Barely any places near the campus.
College Sophomore,2,Small town so few opportunities to have fun unless you drive 15-30 minutes. Alcohol free campus so the bar scene would also be 15-30 minutes away
College Freshman,2,"Many students use and accept the use of drugs and alcohol on and around campus. There is no limit to how much they may receive. They know the effects of it, and the moral issues, however these things are overlooked. People use these drugs freely, but not around law officials or ideally visibly of course. "
College Senior,2,"Not everyone on campus drinks, but those who get caught have to perform community service. "
College Senior,2,"Waleska is not really a college town. We have one ""bar"" that is in walking distance, but it is not really a hangout place. There is also one bar in town that is really fun for students. "
College Sophomore,2,"The professors here are great. They care a lot about the students and really help you learn. There's not a bad thing to say about the professors or staff here. However, the administration of this college cares very little about academics and offers few academic scholarships. The presidents and VP's of this school are too preoccupied with athletics to care about academic excellence.  "
College Sophomore,2,"This would be a D- but since a pizza place that sells beer just opened up in Waleska, it has gotten a little better. Other than that, you have Subway or limited options in Canton. This is NOT a party school by any means. "
College Sophomore,2,"When my class first got to Reinhardt, Public Safety and the RA's were super strict about everything. They even pulled the fire alarms in the middle of the night in one of the boys dorm, just to check for alcohol and drugs. Over time, they tried to let the college kids be college kids without going overboard, but if you want to do anything that was prohibited, your best bet is to stay in one place until its over with."
College Sophomore,2,There's a subway across the street but if you want food you have to drive ten miles out to canton.
College Senior,2,It is quite a distance away to any dinning facilities. The ones around the school are poor.
College Freshman,2,"Public safety can be pretty nosy sometimes, they are always interrupting us when we are playing HvZ. I think the curfew for the dorms should be extended."
College Freshman,2,this school has good professors but the campus is to small. The school has some good classes but i think most of the classes are to religious for me. Sometimes i feel like its not worth going to class but i got to do what i got to do to make it through. In some classes the work load is to much depending on what classes you take. Im not use to taking required religion classes. The regirstration process is ok and really didnt take long. The tutors are helpful as well. The dinning hall food is not good what so ever.
Sophomore,1,Coming to Reinhardt was the worst decision I ever made. Very boring and not worth what you are paying for. Not much diversity outside of athletics. Don't come if you are black.
College Senior,1,There is no Greek life at the school.
College Freshman,1,we do not have greek life. were working on getting some.
College Freshman,1,we only have subway close to us
College Freshman,1,housing is not offered off campus. renters call it student housing and cause government issues.
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life.
College Junior,1,"No parties, no noise, nothing. Dead silent always."
College Junior,1,"It's in the middle of nowhere. It is very rural, quiet, and boring."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't really think we have public transportation at Reinhardt. Or at least, I've never heard of or seen any around campus. Its a small school, so there's kind of no need for it to get around, unless you're trying to go off campus for food or something (which would be a good help because you have to drive 10 miles into another city just to get to a WalMart)."
College Senior,1,It is a pretty small town.  There is one actual bar outside of the local restaurants.  nothing really stays open late.
College Freshman,1,The town is small and not really anything to do. On campus we have some events every now and then but not to many people perticapate in them but a few do. The safety is great. The only sports thats go on is at Reinhardt. The locals around the school are pretty nice to the students.
College Freshman,1,The off-campus housing is too far from the school. Most people who live off campus live at least an hour away and only come to school two days a week.
College Freshman,1,"The restaurants are too far from the school, there is not that many of them, and none have student discounts. However the options that are available are pretty good."

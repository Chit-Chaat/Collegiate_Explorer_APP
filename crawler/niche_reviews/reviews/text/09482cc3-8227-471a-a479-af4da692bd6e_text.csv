Alum,5,"due to covid-19 closures, all courses are conducted virtually. There are many instructors who have worked hard to create as close to an in-person experience as possible, by offering small group assignments, break-out rooms (zoom), and discussions to interact with other students."
Freshman,5,"This is only my first year at NMSU, however, everyone is very inviting and the facilities are fantastic. I do not like that everything is online but it will get better."
Freshman,5,"Hello My name is Maite Ruiz I am a first year here at New Mexico State my experience at New Mexico State University has been very positive.

I Now have a worthwhile career in Washington DC.

I am thankful for my time here. Always a proud Aggie."
Junior,5,"New Mexico State University is an outstanding college that provides an excellent learning experience for a diverse student body. I first started my college experience at the DACC Branch as a Dual-Credit student, a program from high school, where I take starter college courses for a head start at college. This head start gave me that college experience for meeting the expectations of my professors and advisors.  I work for New Mexico State, as a Tutor at the Dona Ana Community College Branch. In which I plan to be the best mentor for new and upcoming college students. I have no complaints whatsoever with NMSU, my college life so far has been exceptional.

Sophomore,5,The website is very user friendly and if you cant find something or get locked out the IT team is always on top of it.

Sophomore,5,"The pandemic put everyone in a online mode, although it was hard for those students like me who had never had an online class, it wasn’t that hard.

Graduate Student,5,"I had an excellent experience at NMSU. The campus is big enough to have that big university college feel but not big enough to get lost in. There’s a real sense of community and family that NMSU has. I was apart of the Chemical Engineering department and I had an experience I don’t think I would have had anywhere else. Not only are there plenty of clubs and activities to choose from, but tuition is crazy inexpensive."
Graduate Student,5,NMSU was quick and efficient switching to online platforms to accommodate as many students as possible.
Senior,5,"New Mexico State University has given me the greatest college experience I could ask for. With the diverse community, the social life at NMSU was one of a kind and allowed a great experience for learning about other cultures.

Lastly, the events held at NMSU from sports games, to concerts, to club sponsored events have always given a fun and memorable experience."
Senior,5,"Although I prefer in person classes over online classes, NMSU provided a great online experience.

In some cases, I have even had professors who reach out to students regarding class performance, which is encouraging and helpful."
Freshman,5,"NMSU is a wonderful University to attend ! The staff, environment & everything else is great. I have not had one bad experience attending the University. NMSU also provides many helpful resources for students who may be struggling financially. They are very understanding of others, and the things that students may be going through."

Freshman,5,"Great Campus! Lots of diversity! Excellent programs available as well as a wide variety of them! New Mexico State University really impressed me in what they have to offer and what kind of majors and minors are available. I was glad to see that they had a great Pre-Med program! In addition, I was really impressed that they had the Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine for individuals such as myself who want to apply for medical school in the near future! Overall a great school to attend!"
Freshman,5,This University is such a great place to be at. The teachers are really good at their jobs and what they teach. Honestly nothing at New Mexico State University should be changed. It's perfect the way it is.
Freshman,5,This university is full of interesting people and it is surrounded my beautiful scenery. The teachers and staff are super supportive and super helpful.
Junior,5,"When I  started at New Mexico State University i had to live at the dooms and the people there were amazing, very  friendly. They also had many activities for the incoming freshman to start adapting to their new environment. I personally experience the best years at New Mexico State University. Its such an amazing place to start your career. Teachers, professors and advisors are very helpful with their students. I love this place, you will experience such amazing things here. No regrets."

Niche User,5,The people at NMSU are amazing people. They will help with any questions or any doubts you have. They make you feel like you belong there.
Sophomore,5,"The school is very diverse with clubs, different types of people and activities. The academics are challenging but you learn a great deal for what you will need in your future careers. There is always something happening on campus whether its campus events or students throwing their own parties. The dorms and housing are a little pricey but well worth it because it is well kept and class to your classes. Most of the teachers I had were amazing although I did have problems understanding a few. We are not the best in Athletics but that does not stop our school spirit."
Senior,5,I could not have asked for a better college experience than NMSU has provided me. I have enjoyed all my professors and the material which is taught. The campus is very accessible to everyone and has gone through numerous renovations. The only complaint I have is their gym is not open for part time students. In order for a part time student to go to the gym they must pay a fee.
Niche User,5,I have visited the University before and have experienced a few events and have taken a tour of the school and seen a few exciting things here and there. Also when arriving at the university it felt very welcoming.
Niche User,5,"NMSU has a great atmosphere, teachers and staff there go out of there way to make sure students get internships, and jobs during their studies and also when they graduate.  I really don't think that there is any other university that could look after each and every student."
Niche User,5,I came for 2 years to NMSU and i really enjoyed it! people were really nice and professors were helpful when i needed it! its a beautiful campus and pretty safe! i never had a problem with safety!

Niche User,5,The most important thing that I like about the New Mexico State was that it was to close to home. It’s is also very affordable.
Senior,5,"My firsr year in college was in UTEP. So far, NMSU has proven to be a college far more capable and willing to help their students. My CJ professors have invited federal agencies of all types to come and talk about their carrers. Professors are always giving out tips to study better and give us feedback from our assignments. The students are always involved in some organization and activity. NMSU really cares about their students, that's it of course, if they actually want to graduate."
Sophomore,5,"New Mexico State University is a great place to start your future. I am a sophomore in this college and I have been welcomed and accepted since day one. As far as education goes, it is a good system and you will learn how to express yourself.  NMSU is a place that that counts with many resources and great teachers. Some may be difficult, but all in all it is a great experience. Safety is also pretty good, there have been a few incidents but authorities react fast and keep everyone safe."
Freshman,5,So far my experience at New Mexico State University has been fantastic all of the staff I have meet  is very nice and  the school provides lots of activities for the students to be involved. The only thing that I do not like is the parking situation it is sometimes hard for me to find parking close to my buildings but other than that everything is great.
Freshman,5,They make you feel right at home no matter how far away you traveled to attend. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly and the staff within the entire campus definitely shows they care about our education and our wellbeing.
Sophomore,5,Moving into the dorm was made easy by the great organization and planning of the University.  The food at Taos has been great we with a wide selection of food options.  I have had a great experience in my classes so far.
Graduate Student,5,New Mexico State University is a great institution for getting the best value of every dollar spent in tuition. The quality of education I've received is nothing less of outstanding and I've enjoyed my time here. The number one suggestion I have to improve the institution as a whole is the integration of more study tools electronically and in person (i.e. online tutors).
Niche User,5,I liked the overall surrounding of the area. The staff and students are very nice and helpful. I would not like to change anything because there is nothing to change.
Junior,5,I really enjoy the resources available to be able to complete and advance in my education. Different activities available are also interesting and help with our regular day to day lives.
Freshman,5,I was an out of state student at this university and what I liked about it is that the campus is super diverse. It was not hard as a first year student to find people  I could relate to. Everything was an all around great experience for college life and I look forward to many future school years at this university.
Graduate Student,5,Very affordable and amazing professors.  The school really helps you succeed. You can pursue just about any popular major and get great first hand knowledge from the staff.  Not to mention the school does a great job getting companies to come for career fairs or to give students exposure to them.  The school really is a great education for families who can't afford thousands of dollars especially with all the scholarships and work studies they have to offer.
Sophomore,5,"I like the size of the campus and its diverse groups of students that attend the university. Some professors can be hard on you, but they have good intentions for their students to succeed in their future professions. A lot of the professors are very knowledgeable with the lectures they talk about and it's nice to see their enthusiasm. The campus events are enjoyable such as free concerts and sports events."
Niche User,5,"I have been taking online courses with New Mexico State University for a year now. I have had a great experience, and the professors are very understanding. Since I am still in high school, and the school provides the textbooks for us, the professors would understand if I didn't have my book in time. They just need a heads up, with a decent amount of time, before the assignment is due."
Junior,5,"I was very excited to attend NMSU. I went to the orientations and welcome events and had fun. Met some great and not so great people, but such is life, fortunately some of the great people are the teachers. I was accepted in to the CMI program and am working towards a BCM majoring in animation and visual effects. I participate in several clubs: the first one I joined was the Game Development club and I absolutely love it.  I like to check out other clubs and attend school events, to see what they are about. My favorite sporting event I have attended so far has been the woman's soccer games."
Alum,4,"The overall campus experience at NMSU is a positive one. The layout of the buildings is helpful due to the accessibility via vehicle, bicycle or walking. The campus is very clean, not a lot of trash or debris located on the grounds. 

There are many on-campus activities to participate in, extracurricular along with community events. The amenities on campus continue to be upgraded and are state of the art."
Freshman,4,"I think that there are so many people who are willing to help me and show me how things should be going to could happen. There are so many degree options and pathways, that any student could thrive here, no matter what they are looking to do."
Freshman,4,"The professors have been really flexible and seem to be in contact with the administration so that they know whats going on, which is helpful."
Sophomore,4,This school offers a great environment to further your studies. People are very helpful and the campus had many places to study or just have fun.
Freshman,4,I am still new to the campus but am loving the experience so far.  A vert friendly community and college town.
Sophomore,4,The online learning experience is very great and gives very good details and information needed. The teachers make the necessary time for help if needed.
Sophomore,4,"The amount of help for students given is really great. When I first went for an tour of the campus, I was sold with the way they presented myself and wanted to enroll right away. Although sometimes I do find the out of state price a bit high compared to in-state I still do love it."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed how NMSU felt like home. As an incoming freshman, it's nerve racking to move to a new city and have a fresh start. NMSU is a big campus, but gives off a small town feel. The professors are very friendly, there is plenty of resources for tutoring. The professors have office hours and want you to succeed. I enjoyed the food on campus, however I believe there should be more healthier options that are easily accessible for students who live on campus. My advisor was amazing at guiding me on what courses I needed to take to graduate in the time frame I wanted. There are a lot of activities and clubs that NMSU has to offer, there's something for everyone. I enjoyed how many places there were for students to study. The health center at NMSU is amazing, and is a fast process and alternative to the doctors if you're feeling ill. I believe Taos could improve its sanitation when it comes to food. NMSU has a lot of school spirit, and has a good atmosphere all around."
Junior,4,"My experience at University has been an absolute delight. The campus is clean, classes have been eye-opening, and most of the faculty and staff have been very kind to me in my time there. The only thing that I can really criticize is the laundromats. I've lived in Garcia Hall and in Cervantes Village and every time I used one of their respective laundromats my clothes end up smelling kind of funky. It's not a smell that I could describe as repugnant but it definitely doesn't smell like daisies. At first, I thought that the detergent I was using, the cheapo bulk brand, was too weak. So, I decided to reluctantly open my wallet for a more expensive brand and try that but my clothes still smelled kind of weird. Perhaps this is not a universal problem but it's really my only gripe with the school."
Junior,4,A lot of the professors who teach online courses are super helpful. If needing extra help understanding they will talk you through whatever you do not understand and if you still struggle they allow you to meet in person as well.
Freshman,4,"With changing from in class to online through zoom, NMSU did a great transition with the COVID situation is such a short time"
Freshman,4,The overall experience with NMSU so far has been great and look forward to more education with the engineering department.
Sophomore,4,"I did take classes online and all of them were very well structured and easy for me to follow and to have access to all the material I needed. However, when we switched to online learning during the pandemic, some of my professors were not interested in helping out students who had a hard time adjusting."
Freshman,4,"New Mexico State University is a college that was build on a land grant. Which means that before New Mexico was officially  recognized as a state, the college was already established."
Junior,4,My online learning experience has been very good! II was once home schooled so i'm used to the formatting and schedule.
Sophomore,4,New Mexico State is a great university. The student life is a lot of fun. Many of the Professors are willing to work with students so they have the best learning experience.
Sophomore,4,"Learning at NMSU has been great. The professors will work with you to help you when you need it. Besides one or two of the professors, the professors really try to make sure you are learning."
Freshman,4,"New Mexico State University is a good school to attend. I first went in scared and afraid I wouldn't be able to make friends or do good within the academics. As I finish my first year I am proud with my choice to attend NMSU, the school helps with adjusting to college courses and adjusting to the college life."
Alum,4,"I got a really good education here, but I worked very hard for it. I imagine it's the same as in most places, but you will get out what you put in to your education. It's important to surround yourself with people who are serious about their studies or it's pretty easy to get behind and lose momentum. In my department (Chemistry) I had an excellent advisor who was always available for all kinds of help.  I got a lot of opportunities for research and internships. For other majors I notice that networking is not the best, so put yourself out there. I love Las Cruces and NMSU is a great school for the right person. Hold yourself to high standard and you can go anywhere you want from here!"
Sophomore,4,"New Mexico State is better than expected state-funded college situated in College Park, New Mexico in the El Paso Region. It is a moderate size establishment with an enlistment of 9,703 college understudies. Confirmations are to some degree serious as the New Mexico State acknowledgment rate is 64%. Famous majors incorporate Business, Nursing, and Aesthetic Sciences and Humanities. Graduating 46% of understudies, New Mexico State graduated class proceed to win a beginning compensation of $24,800."

Sophomore,4,I love the people. They’re very welcoming and very kind. I’ve meet great people and made new friends!
Senior,4,It is a friendly environment and very helpful. I wish their was more money put into the programs to help them excel.
Freshman,4,I really like campus life at school and how easy it is to get help with tutors for any class. I think they need to improve parking as a freshman living in the dorms parking can really be difficult.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy going to NMSU, it is a place that has given me plenty of opportunity to grow! I would like to see more effort in updating information on the school's website."
Freshman,4,"SO far my experience at New Mexico State University has been very good, the campus is big yet it is easy to get around, the amount of help that is available at NMSU is amazing. Help of any kind is offered, the place where it is located is also somewhere that isn't too big, it is a place where you can find all your needs."
Junior,4,I love the people and feel around the campus. Everyone is super nice and willing to talk with you. There is not a whole lot to do around the city but it is safe and the people make the fun.
Freshman,4,"New Mexico State University has been so nice and welcoming. The people here are just outstanding. At NMSU, diversity is everywhere and it’s just amazing to make new friends from India, Germany, Vietnam, and so many other places. The experience is endless."
Niche User,4,"I went for a experience day and everyone was very welcoming and nice. They showed us around, answered any questions we had, let us know that they were there for anything we needed."
Sophomore,4,"I like attending NMSU, they take care of their campus and students. There is a lot that they offer to keep students involved."
Senior,4,Highlands is a good school if you are planning on becoming a social worker and pursuing your dreams of working in your population.
Niche User,4,Great school. Good staff. Wonderful students and a great student life. Good return on money spent.skldjgtlksdjfglksdjksjdfkljsdlkfjsdlkfjsdlkfjsmdlksfngkljsdfgkljsdjfglksdjlkgjdsklfgjsdklfgjslkdgjlksdgjlksdfjgklsdfjgkl
Freshman,4,"This is my first time out of my country far away from my family living on-campus in New Mexico State University. As long as I´ve been here, everything seems to be  normal, in the academic environment, also with the food and the student life. I would recommend more initial activities for those who are new and feel welcomed. My major is Physics, and I know that this University is highly recognized for being a great research institute and I hope I can achieve my goals starting from now, as a freshman, and as the first female member in my family attending college in the United States."
Junior,4,New Mexico State University is unique and very full of new activities on a daily basis. The students that come here are all diverse and come from many parts of the United States. The School a great campus for learning and has many connections to businesses local and far. NMSU overall is a great campus for students who are looking to receive a great education at an affordable price and a small college town community.
Freshman,4,"Their staff is very quick at processing forms, applications, and other paperwork. They are also very helpful and receptive to the needs of current and future students."
Sophomore,4,I like how the professors I've had always want you to succeed. I wish there was a bit more creativity in the teaching process.
Sophomore,4,The professors actually try to make sure you are doing well in school. They do not just try to weed you out of the program.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with New Mexico State University is a positive one. I feel the experience would be better if they lowered the fee for Aggie experience day. I signed up with the Aggie Pride Band, everyone was friendly, helpful and made me feel welcome. I would like to see more free parking areas and private study areas."
Senior,4,"Perfect place to learn, meet friends, and have fun. I feel safe on this campus and there are plenty of groups to join so you can find out what you like. Your education is valued here and it is possible to graduated with a job you've always wanted."
Sophomore,4,The things that I like about NMSU is the relatively low class sizes and that some of the professors care about you can your education. What I would like to see change is the type of classes offered.
Senior,4,New Mexico State University is a good college. I enjoy walking around campus to my classes. The one thing that can improve would parking! Parking lots are not easily found or available. There are so many students and not enough parking spaces. I do not mind walking to my classes like I said previously. I do enjoy walking around but when it takes 20 minutes to find a parking space it can be difficult to get to class on time and get the full educational experience.
Senior,4,"Even though I'm a transfer student, and didn't started my college education in New Mexico State University, I think I have spent enough time in this college to get to know it.  My experience with this school, until this day, has been very positive and educational. NMSU Las Cruces has the feeling of the big university experience with the warmth and kindness of a closed knitted community. The people is the best part of this college: Staff and professors that really care about your education, and friendly, interesting people become your best friends. Great School."
Freshman,4,"So far I have enjoyed my first year as a freshmen at New Mexico State University. The classes I have taken have been very informative and I believe that they will help me in the future while I am pursuing my degree. Most of the teachers so far have cared about what they are teaching the students and seem to want everyone to pass with the knowledge that they are giving us. Of course some of the professors are different but, the ones that are are usually PhD students and are more focused on their own degrees. So, make sure to check which professors you are signing up for! The campus however is just beautiful and the buildings are a good distance a part from each other which makes it easy to get to your next class. Overall, I love this campus and can't wait to continue the pursuit of my degree here!"
Freshman,4,"New Mexico State University is a really diverse community. There is a lot of different people from different parts. It's a really friendly environment.  You can make a lot of friends. And, the atmosphere is really good."
Freshman,4,"What I like most about NMSU is the people. They're really nice, especially those that are in marching band. They are very welcoming and make you feel at home. The school in general is just a very respectful, nice, and welcoming school."
Freshman,4,"I like NMSU because it is a very nice campus with everything you academically need right there on campus. I also think that they have a very good ACES College, of which I am a part of. The only downsides are that the dining hall closes pretty early which is hard for late nights."
Niche User,4,Being on the campus for state FFA was a good way to experience the energy of campus life. It gave a small town feel to a big city place and it was very welcoming
Junior,4,"NMSU is a calm and peaceful place. There isn’t much going on and people are nice and friendly. It’s is diverse, but mostly Hispanic. Teachers and staff are supportive and you can go for help pretty much anywhere. Lots of parking around the school and prices for things aren’t exaggerated. Additionally there are plenty of resources for students like printing, renting equipment, books, etc. Buildings are nice and clean and there are plenty of study areas around school."
Freshman,4,"Overall I have enjoyed my time at NMSU. The campus is beautiful and the weather in cruces is usually pretty good during the school year. I am a criminal justice major and there are so many resources for me. All of my teachers have been pretty good, and many are very understanding and accommodating if necessary. The only thing I would change is the Taos cafeteria the food served there always makes me sick."
Freshman,4,I think that the experience is amazing especially because you get to met other people and also because you get to see what you true passion is. One thing that I do have a concern is on how high the tuition is for every single semester. All my financial aid went to pay for the tuition and that is why I had to ask for a student loan in order get my books. There is amazing professor in with many of them truly care about you and that they are always making good choices.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very nice. The professors and staff are very kind and are very helpful. The campus is always clean and is easy to navigate. The facilities are always kept clean as well. The school offers many recourcea for students to suceed such as free tutoring at different tutoring centers, advisors etc."
Freshman,4,"I love the friendly environment, outgoing and diverse culture of the students, and the professors that care enough to learn your name and ask you how you're doing. People are outgoing and not afraid to strike up a conversation with you, even if they've never talked to you before. I would like to see more an academically competitive culture here, though, as a lot of students don't take the classes as seriously as they should. Also, the housing offered is less than appealing and the cafeteria could stand for improvement."
Sophomore,4,"Well I like the accessibility of labs around campus! However parking is a bit expensive and it’s also really hard to find during the school semester. It’s nice that they have a gym! I also like the track and trails of the campus, I like the football and basketball games. It’s easy to have a very fun college experience here, and there is so many beneficial clubs here! There are also a couple of crappy teachers around campus but studying and doing your work outside of class is extremely important in succeeding, which is a good thing because it should require some work when going to college. Also our Pan Am center(auditorium) is nicer than the one in El Paso (just saying) sometimes artists come down and do concerts there and it’s really nice! Campus is constantly improving for the better and I personally think we have a really good engineering programs and a good nursing program if you guys are interested in those areas!"
Senior,4,NMSU has given me a great college experience and set me up for future success! I have gained many life lessons as well as great academic skills. Their AG program is amazing with lots of hands on teaching and learning.
Senior,4,"My overall experience at NMSU has been great! Everyone is incredibly friendly and kind, including the majority of the teachers. I would like to see several of the campus buildings be renovated or updated."
Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been good. I like how NMSU has many resources on- and off-campus to help students achieve academic success.
Senior,4,"NMSU is a great university with good graduate programs. The professors are very accessible and eager to help students succeed. There are additional services for students such as a student union, several options for eating, legal aid, mental and health services, post office, tutors, etc. The only issue I have with NMSU is that they do not offer Doctorate degrees."
Sophomore,4,"Set in The City of Crosses, NMSU is a fairly large campus full of people from around the globe. Although I've only seen the Engineering departments thoroughly, the campus is clean, covered with plant life and is always improving. The department folks are knowledgeable and courteous, they will find your answers, they're the kind of people you can just talk to. I've only been here a short while, but this campus was the right choice for me."
Junior,4,"The university has a nice campus, a good student center, useful student services, and most importantly dedicated professors."
Freshman,2,I can not learn online so it makes doing the work not easy. I need the classes to be in class. There needs to be more time for assignments because with working on top of online school makes it hard to keep up on everything.
Sophomore,2,No online experience at the time there was only email and internet access. Some of the professors were outstanding others were somewhat difficult - not in class level but in leniency.
Niche User,2,Would be nice to get informed of how credits transfer over to NMSU. Took so many courses at the Branch now I have to retake some courses.
College Senior,2,"I spent a small fortune to live in a studio with another person. I was close to class, but could find much better housing off-campus."
College Freshman,2,It is a party school with over partied sororities.
College Sophomore,2,"We're told that things like internships and work study positions are available but that's just not the case, unfortunately. The career services webpage is overly complicated and hard to use. Employers recruit every once in a while but not nearly enough to actually help people find work."
College Freshman,2,"The housing is rather cheap. I would recommend getting one of the newer dorms if you want to stay in one. Some of the older ones have mold and horrible low ceilings. They're all CLEARLY designed to cram as many students as possible into a space, but I guess it's fine if all you do is sleep in them. The good part is that it's a 5-10 minute walk to classes."
College Freshman,2,"our sports teams were not the best this year, normally basketball does well but this year it was bad."
College Freshman,2,I would say Greek life is a big deal at our school because at school events and even regular days they have booths. It seems like they are constantly promoting Greeks at our schools and that there is an emphasis on joining a sorority or fraternity. It seems that the Greeks also participate in a lot of different community service events. I am not sure because I have never looked into any of the Greeks and in addition for some odd reason none of the sororities have attempted to speak to me about their group. I find strange that most of them are primarily white and Hispanic so that might have to do with the issue. Since I am an African American women I do not feel welcomed by the vast majority of the sororities on this campus.
College Junior,2,"I'm not into athletics, but the several physical education classes I'm interested in are usually only offered once or twice per semester, making them nearly impossible to get into. The facilities themselves seem a bit dated, but mostly usable."
College Junior,2,I never lived in the dorms themselves but for my first two years I lived in Family housing. There was mold growing all over the moist parts of the apartment. It took really long for the housing repairmen to come fix anything or hook up air conditioning & the heater. And above all the price was higher than getting an apartment off campus which when I did was cleaner and even closer to my classes.
College Freshman,2,This is definitely not a party school or a party town. It is a very small town where I have heard and known that parties get shut down very easily. I think that the party scene has a negative impact on most of the students experiences. Maybe at times it is a positive experience because they realize that schoolwork should be more important than partying.
College Freshman,2,"the rest of campus is great, but Taos is horrible. The work staff is moody, the food is bad, fatty, and sometimes cold, the meal plan is definitely not worth what we are paying. It is more expensive than organic, and none of the food in there is organic."
College Freshman,2,I am thinking about changing my major just because our department is poorly funded.
College Freshman,2,The student involvement is poor. The basketball team is the only good team on campus. The football team is horrible.
College Junior,2,"Like any college, most people are there for the typical ""college experience,"" such as random hookups, partying, and drugs. Most of the guys, especially those in Frats are crude and sexually harassing. Sorority girls date the same guys in the Frats. There are a variety of STDS among students at NMSU."
College Junior,2,"The football team is not good, but the support for them is still there."
Recent Alumnus,2,Nobody really goes to any games except the basketball games. Intramural sports are fairly popular though.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I didn't have the lottery or any scholarships, but did have a loan my first year. It was horrible. I had to go to the financial aid department several times to receive any assistance. I ended up just paying out of pocket my final years."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The English department have some savvy faculty, they all know their stuff, but advising is passed around between them, sometimes you get a good advisor, sometimes you get an advisor who just randomly recommends interesting classes without checking your progress toward the degree.  The faculty are eccentric and full of personality.

Somehow they have attracted some interesting names in creative writing who teach some great classes.  Getting published is still a catch 22.

As mentioned, they still subscribe to the ""read and discuss"" philosophy, so I'd say only 1/3 of the classes give you a good lecture / notes on the history, impact, and critical response for a particular author or work.  It's somewhat ""touchy-feely."""
Recent Alumnus,2,"An English degree costs the same a Mechanical Engineering degree, but you can learn everything that the English degree will teach you in a Library.  Unlike engineering, most of the classes follow the ""read and discuss"" model.  I'm paying thousands in tuition to hear what other students think about Shakespeare.  Milton was a tough class, but it was all heavy reading and lecture over an extremely interesting figure in English history and literature.

Literary Criticism is still lost in the dark ages with such charlatans as Lacan, Foucault, and Gramsci.  Any faculty member could do better, but no one has the character to raise the bar.

There is little to no career planning in the English Department.  They are smaller and somewhat stretched.  If you think going to college will help you with a job, the NMSU English Department will disabuse you of that notion.  They do not even coordinate with the Education Department (or alternative programs) to help graduates transition into teaching.  You really have to do it all yourself."
College Junior,2,No one really has any support for our sports teams unless they are by some chance winning or to go tailgating at the football games.
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office itself is dreadful. No one ever wants to go in there. They take forever, don't tell you the correct paperwork needed and often times lose your paperwork. I wold much rather get financial aid from an outside source."
College Freshman,2,"Its a huge hassle, i kept getting emails requiring me to send the same files repeatedly and i didnt recieve my financisl aid until after the school year started."
College Sophomore,2,"The options for off-campus dining is pretty slim because most places close by 9 p.m, the convenience is there in terms of travel but time, not so much"
College Student,2,Walk with a friend. I recommend taking pepper spray. most people are okay but there is a lot of drinking on campus and drunks do stupid things
College Freshman,2,it's a lot of partying but I don't know to much I don't drink
College Sophomore,2,There really is not much to do outside of campus other than go out and eat. A lot of the things that you can do are 21 and over.
College Sophomore,2,They have messed up my account. I had recieved financial aid were asking for papers that I had previously submitted aout three times. They even awarded me a scholarship and took it away because it was a mistake that they made.
College Student,2,Most teachers require attendance and the faculty strictness is very strict.
College Student,2,Most of the teams suck and the attendance to the events Is weak.
College Freshman,2,There's nothing special about this school but I do t have a choice in going anywhere else.
College Sophomore,2,The school is at the edge of town so there are not many stores or places to eat right by campus. To get anywhere you have to drive or take the bus. I am glad I have a car.
College Sophomore,2,The athletes at school are a disruption in class.
College Sophomore,2,Stay in constant contact with the Fin. Aid office!
College Freshman,2,One day it will be nice then the next it could be windy as hell and ruin your weekend.
College Sophomore,2,Not many bars or clubs.
College Freshman,2,its over priced. it sucks and sometimes the food is gross.
College Freshman,2,i didn't know there was cop here. i feel that i will get kidnap at the parking lot because cars are always driving by and yelling.  Students are always smoke and asking me all kinds of questions about me. i believe they are high.
College Freshman,2,"The difficulties in my first semester of college was math. i strongly dislike math. The most important criteria was either if u wanted to be in the class room or not. The classes are so huge and some students just leave. No, my program does not an abnormal application."
College Sophomore,2,"For las cruces to be a ""college town"" we have one of the worst nightlife scene. The bars suck and the bars that are popular have terrible service!... ""dublins"" everyone who wants to have a decent night travels 30 miles to el paso, texas to enjoy a saturday night. The only reason why i didn't give this a 1 star is because we actually have a few bars to choose from and not only stuck with 1 bar. Transportation if you are a student is 100% free during the weekends/  weekdays from certain times. All  you need is to provide the driver with your student ID. I take full advantage of this service."
College Sophomore,2,"the athletics as a whole is decent but getting down to the wire.. the football team is horrible! when you have to give incentives to students to attend football games, then something isn't going as planned. The volleyball team, basketball team, and baseball team are all wonderful and exciting sports to watch! If you want to see a ""team"" perform then i suggest watching all the sports except football b/c you will be leaving disappointed after watch the football team get creamed."
College Sophomore,2,"The bus company has no idea what they are doing. They are never on time, and the bus drivers are just rude."
College Junior,2,Campus life is great but I have to say the safety is not that well great. It is almost every time I hear on the news or in the papers that a student is killed or raped on or near campus and it because scary even to walk by yourself in the middle of the night.
College Sophomore,2,"I hate the heat and the occasional wind, especially since I walk on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Almost all students smoke weed. Drugs are combined with alcohol at almost every party. Adderall is the most used on campus, especially during finals weeks."
College Sophomore,2,"Permit costs for a semester don't seem that bad. Outside of campus parking is pretty easy to find, but spots fill up quick. Everyone on campus is sure to have a ticket or fine. They are very strict with violations "
College Freshman,2,"Wireless is a big issue, sometimes you get it, most times you don't."
College Freshman,2,"After the Lottery Scholarship got cut, I have had a difficult time trying to coast on financial aid, I still owe approximately $2,400 and might not be able to afford school."
College Sophomore,2,As with any campus. Availability of drugs and alcohol is rampant. Especially at parties. Here in this small city the police do what they can to control the parties but cant prevent underage drinking and drug use.
College Sophomore,2,"Not that many nightlife spots in town. But if your willing to travel, El Paso is only 45 minutes south."
College Freshman,2,"The list of activities to do off of campus is slim to zero. The closest city we're near is El Paso and there's not much to do there either. The only city that has many things to do is Albuquerque, but its almost four hours away. Overall this campus's attractions and activities are awful."
College Senior,2,I hate on campus food. it's disgusting
College Sophomore,2,The permits are expensive and there aren't a lot of parking spots close to class.
College Freshman,2,"In the summer it is too hot and I still have to walk a good distance to my class and afterwards back to my car. Also in the winter, it is too cold and I still have to walk quite a long distance to my class and back to my car. The weather is never perfect and the ""far"" parking doesn't make it any better."
Recent Alumnus,2,There exists a little of everything at times more of one thing than other type of personality however there is a alot of women who think they super models or top of the line because they are students at school
College Senior,2,I only lived on campus for a 2 semesters. They are not the best to live in. The only ones that seem to be really kept up with is Chamisa
College Sophomore,2,We have options for various foods but it would be better if we had a few more choices. 
College Freshman,2,NMSU football team isn't the greatest team. The only team that make any profit is the basketball team. The football team gets criticized most because their funding comes straight out of academics. They also spend around 4 million dollars a year without any income to make up for the spending. The Las Cruces football team provided more fans than the NMSU college team. I came from a high school with poor school spirit and it's very unfortunate that I came to a school that is very similar. A small majority of the student population attend any of the athletic games. 
College Senior,2,not enough options and times
Sophomore,1,"The administrators seem nice enough but so far it has been all but impossible to obtain a medical withdraw after the fact despite medical documents. I will change my review if it ever gets processed, also hazing by fraternities but thats another story altogether"
Niche User,1,I did not have a great experience attending. The rotc program was great but the professors and advisors were not willing to help.
Sophomore,1,New Mexico State is not the best college to attend as a freshman. This college only seems to care about the money rather than student success.
Graduate Student,1,"The university has policies of their own for the international students. These policies are nowhere written on their website but they follow them and punish international students. They do not allow students to go for an internship in the first year and last semester. They force students to register credits after coming back from the internship even if the student has completed all the requirements. I believe this is one way of making money. If you are an international student, then DON'T COME TO NMSU."
Freshman,1,"The classes were good but a lot of the faculty only care about the money. The professors were helpful and were willing to help me keep my grades up. The other faculty members, however, were horrible to deal with. The advisors are no help at all and gave me the wrong classless. The food that was provided with the meal plan was terrible. I had gotten sick multiple times from the Taos restaurant. The housing office faculty members are very greedy and have no flexibility. I am now in debt because of the faculty. I had to deal with racism and I had very little help with this. Overall, NMSU is a terrible place to live but is okay, academically."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Due to the size of this campus we do not have any school sports. All activities are done through other campuses, 78 miles away is the closest one."
College Sophomore,1,They do nothing for the community except throw unsafe parties
College Freshman,1,"The buildings are run down, dirty, and don't have enough attention put into them."
College Freshman,1,The campus housing is the worst. All the dorms are outdated and need to be remodeled.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Honestly, just play the local golf tournaments, buy the guys a beer, and you will find 500% better job networking than you will at any career fair.

Do not think that the English Department at NMSU has any clue about jobs.

The other departments have better career outlook, and planning programs."
College Student,1,"My paper work to get financial aide got lost. My ACT scores were lost and so was my transcript, which would have made me eligible for a lot more financial aide then i actually received. The experience was horrible but i will fix it for next year and hopefully get more much needed aide. One tip I have is to make sure your paper work went through and have someone sign something saying that they received it."
College Freshman,1,its over crowded. it sucks
College Freshman,1,my parents make too much for the financial aid to help me. it sucks.
College Freshman,1,i see underage student still getting drunk. The school is not strict at all. i feel like am telling on all the students now. The polices dont apply in the hall i live in.
College Freshman,1,i dont like it. i would like to move. the dorms are old were i live in now. The cost is crazy. it should Not be that much. are u kidding me??
College Freshman,1,nightlife at my school sucks! i hate it. its too loud. i hate parties when my sweet mates have one and i can not sleep.
College Freshman,1,I wouldn't know. I'm usually at home before and after classes.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office never seems willing to help.
College Sophomore,1,Greeks at NMSU are very anti greek. If you are not one of them then you might as well not talk to them. Although they sell the idea that they do great for the community I have not seen any major impacts by any of the greek organizations on campus. Im not lacking in credentials either. I have interacted plenty with greeks and they can be some great guys/girls one on one but when they are all together their attitude shifts to a gang like mentality.
College Freshman,1,The athletics at this school are very bad. The fan support is there but because the team performance lacks so much it makes the school spirit practically disappear.
College Freshman,1,"The price of the parking permits should be a lot lower since there is usually no parking close by to the buildings. A lot of the times I'm late to class because of no parking. I either had to keep cruising by until one opened up, or drive to the other side of the campus to find one and run my way to class. The parking is horrible!"
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't know much about Greek life considering I am not a Greek in the first place so my opinion is not the best source to determine or evaluate the quality of Greek life
Recent Alumnus,1,I chose to stay away from drug abuse
Recent Alumnus,1,Its not great is all I can say
Recent Alumnus,1,tickets are ridiculous and doesn't help anyone besides the institutions's interests and pockets
College Freshman,1,There needs to be a parking structure.
College Junior,1,"I have tried so hard to get aid, but they didn't work with me."
College Junior,1,The food is horrible! I buy my own groceries to eat. The food is disgusting. 
College Sophomore,1,There's not much student fan support for the football team. It's pretty sad to see an empty stadium when highlights are shown on tv.
College Sophomore,1,Network reliability and speed are pretty weak and can be frustrating at times you need the internet the most.
College Freshman,1,I wouldn't know about off-campus housing because I have not looked into it because I prefer to just live on campus. 
College Junior,1,I live in a 33k population town all there is to do here is go to the movies I've been down here for about 5 months and haven't seen a bar yet.  Everywhere that does is more then 60 miles away.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life is abundant at NMSU.  Chapter houses are, in the vast majority, run down houses or donated old dorms.  I'm surprised that some houses are still standing, to be honest.  Socially, there's no real difference between Greeks and non-greeks.  I've seen no hierarchy.  Our houses do get in a lot of trouble with the law, more so than other colleges.  In my four years of undergrad i remember a chapter being shutdown by the law every year.  Because of all the law run-ins houses are much smaller at NMSU and you may get bad stigmas attached to you."
College Sophomore,1,Parking at NMSU is not that great. It's $50 for a parking pass and if you park in the free parking area your car gets scratched or keyed
College Junior,1,"The athletics is political only, the teams are not good and treat others badly."
College Senior,1,There are  only 4 or 5 bars that college students would frequent around here  and only two are walking distance from campus.  since there are no. buses  after 8 pm  and  only one reliable taxi company people have to drive to bars in town or go to el paso.  That's a lot of people drinking  and driving.
Recent Alumnus,1,"You will get harassed, you will be given a hard time, you will have to answer for everything, and when it really counts, there will be no one there."
College Junior,1,I think there's SOME stuff for the average college student but it's mostly just bars and drinking. This is also a retirement community :( El Paso is about an hour away (1 way)
College Senior,1,"New stuff is popping up lately, but at the cost of more important expenses and space I do not see this as a good thing."
College Sophomore,1,"Our Dorms have improved but they are all mostly old and crappy dorms. I have never personally lived in them, but my friends have and the did not enjoy them."
College Sophomore,1,Very few bars not much of a variety. If you want to go to a bar or club you must drive to El Paso TX.
College Junior,1,"Given how big this campus is the parking is miserable. Funding always go to building things that aren't fully necessary and they are built in lots that already are limited for parking(Usually paid parking pass lots). So it's better to plan ahead and park in the free lots and take the bus that goes around campus, or walk if possible. Don't get me wrong renovations and new buildings are great, but if it cannot be helpful for those wanting to park for those buildings a multi-level parking lot seems like a better choice."
College Sophomore,1,"New Mexico State University is located in a city called Las Cruces. This city is very small, and it is supposed to be a college town. Any kind of fun students try to have off campus is shut down as soon as it starts. The police do not ask questions they just come to the house where the party is and tell everyone to go home. I understand it is to stop underaged drinking, and any drug use, but sometimes people just want to dance and hang out, and that is not allowed in this town."
College Sophomore,1,"There is a limited amount of parking spaces. The money collected for permits, tickets and fines should be used to increase parking availability."
College Sophomore,1,"They don't have any envolment in this type of situations. There is some usage of drugs, but people don't bother with it."
College Junior,1,"I Avoid It – Last time I went to a party with frat boys, they all took off their shirts when me and my friend literally walked in the door (we were the only girls) it was kind of sad"
College Junior,1,They built a barnes and nobles in our biggest parking lot in the center of campus. NMSU is one of the largest land grant universities and it's almost always above 85 degrees outside
Recent Alumnus,1,"The parking at NMSU is the worst, I still don't understand or agree with parking tickets or fines. The parking fines or $ that is generated by excessively strict parking doesn't go to benefit anyone who is in a big need of funds. There is also not much access to parking at times or to far from class room buildings."
College Junior,1,"If You Don't Mind Walking – If you don't mind walking or risk getting tickets, then this school is for you!!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,Bad Bad Bad – it once took me 2 hours to find a parking. As an art student there is no un/loading zone for students with all their materials to not have to lug them across campus.
College Senior,1,Desert or Deserted? I am a transfer student and compared to the other colleges I have been at NMSU falls short. I don't like the campus very much or the on campus housing. I am just looking to get a degree and get out. Though this is not to say that I won't take part in every activity and opportunity that I can along the way.
College Senior,1,No Busses or Shuttles During Summer – There are few options for students who want transportation on campus during the summer. I am a new transfer student so I have yet to see the accessibility of on campus transportation.
Recent Alumnus,1,Choose Wisely – not all campus housing is bad...some are great. but don't be fooled by the outer appearance and make sure you fully look around your new area. also there is a bit of insect problems and many break-ins and crimes throughout the campus area housing so make sure you can protect yourself and LOCK YOUR DOORS!!!
Recent Alumnus,1,they are terrible not to much school spirit for these guys!!
College Senior,1,"No night life here, the only thing to do is drink or party (mostly in someone's home). Some go to El Paso which is 1 hour from Las Cruces."
College Junior,1,"You get ticketed $35 for not having a parking sticker. They put a boot on your car if you have 3 or more unpaid fines. Free parking is almost a quarter mile from my dorm. Than when i actually bought a sticker to park my car closer, there is no parking spaces near my dorm."
College Junior,1,"WAY TOO HOT – There is little variety in the weather in las cruces, except for heat and more heat."
College Sophomore,1,it is hard to find parking space in the campus. they are very few parking space for students and more for fcaculty. I usually go to university  one hour early to find space close to building. It is NIGHTMARE..
College Junior,1,The Food – So far the only thing I don't like about this university is the food. There really isn't a good variety of restaurants in campus. Plus the food here is expensive and often of bad quality. Most go off campus or home to eat. 
College Senior,1,"Applied for graduate assistantship multiple times.  Because the program did not have a lot of money most grad students went to other programs for grad work.  Had the grades and research, but I wasn't the right color to get one."

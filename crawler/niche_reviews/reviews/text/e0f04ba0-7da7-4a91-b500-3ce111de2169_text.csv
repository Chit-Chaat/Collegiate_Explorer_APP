Junior,5,I had an internship there and it was awesome. The amount of time and dedication was absolutely worth it.
Junior,5,The only online things were taking the children safety tests where they identify whether or not you are eligible.
Senior,5,Great school!! The environment is good here and everyone is real nice and friendly. Upgrading buildings and roads.
Freshman,5,I loved university  of Houston as it was so diverse and accommodating. My overall experience was just divine since as for my first time.
Freshman,5,"I loved the online portion as it accommodated my time schedule in my hectic life. As I took Arabic class we ,as a class, quickly adjusted to the new living space and quality of the calls were just amazing."
Niche User,5,I don't have much online experience with University of Houston. I am still a senior in highschool so I am not able to take online classes for the University of Houston yet. I have went on the website of this university to discover more information about it but that is about it. This university is on the top of my list so I would like to be informed more about it by reading about it online or using other resources.
Junior,5,My experience here has been phenomenal! The community here is very diverse and is located in the center of Houston. The professors and staff care for their students greatly and is constructing more housing for students to live on campus.
Junior,5,In the current pandemic of COVID-19 the University of Houston was quick to adapt to these situations and in my opinion was a great adaptation by the university. They setup online classes like a breeze and made the transition really  smooth.
Junior,5,"During this pandemic, having all of my classes online is much more difficult than going in person. It can be more stressful."
Freshman,5,The professors are very understanding with the whole pandemic going on and get the fact that we are short on supplies and money. The classes online should be a bit more cheaper rather than just a $1000 dollars less. The school is great and the students help each other a lot. The professors are nice and teach quick and properly to their students.
Sophomore,5,"Online lectures primarily happened through Zoom, and assignments were given to us through a service called Blackboard. I always felt I was able to learn whatever I needed and turn in my assignments and exams without issue. It didn't feel like anything was lost when every class eventually transitioned into online learning due to the coronavirus. The University of Houston has a great online learning experience."
Sophomore,5,"I had a great first year in the university. The people in the university came from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. The campus itself is very aesthetically pleasing. When I was on-campus, the local area was beautiful and it was always pleasant to walk to my classes. I'm staying home this next semester, but my previous dorm was excellent. I never felt like any necessary commodities were missing. The students I interacted with in my dorm and in class were genuinely nice people to be around. Every class had something to offer, though some professors can take a potentially interesting class and ruin it. Most professors are great, but some get easily distracted or aren't willing to make their teaching interesting. The food on-campus was always delicious; it was a great step-up from the food they served at high school. Lastly, there have been a few instances of people getting robbed at night. But the school has many ways that students can travel safely or signal their discomfort."
Junior,5,"I took several online courses at the University of Houston and I absolutely loved it! Every professor I've had uses effective teaching techniques therefore I am receiving the same knowledge and material as I would if I were to enroll in a face-to-face class. Another thing I love about online learning is that it is self-paced. Therefore if I want to finish my assignments early, I cam do so."
Freshman,5,The University of Houston made it easier to take the courses you need online rather than having to go to the campus. It wasn't hard on figuring out classes and navigating using the online tools which the university provides.
Freshman,5,So far my experience has been amazing. They are quick to respond and even with things being remote the hold time on the phone is a dream.
Freshman,5,They made the enrollment process super easy and everyone has been extremely friendly. I am transferring from community college to university and the process has been super easy!
Alum,5,"The online courses that I took were easy to use and flexible. At the time, there were only a handful of courses available online, but I am sure more have transitioned to hybrid or online courses. The professors always offered great feedback and were attentive."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience at the University of Houston. It is probably one of the best institutions with a diverse set of classes to choose from. CLASS (college of liberal arts and social sciences) had professors that cared about your success, as well as offered classes that were fun and informative. The advisors were also incredibly helpful and looked out for you. The student experience was also great, there was always something going on every day."
Junior,5,"Campus culture may not be as hype as some other schools but it's still good, or if you'd rather glide through quickly, involved in little else besides your courses, that works too. This school has a ""get it done"" vibe. It's more affordable depending on your major. As an Art major, costs will go up for supplies."
Alum,5,Enjoyed the classes and campus life.  It had a lot of activities on campus.medium to large class size.
Freshman,5,The University of Houston is such a loving and wonderful environment. I wouldn't wish to be anywhere else for school.
Freshman,5,The University of Houston is such a loving and wonderful environment. I wouldn't wish to be anywhere else for school.
Works Here,5,"Even though it started out as a commuter university, the changes that are being put in place are making it into a competitive place to learn."
Alum,5,"I liked the online classes I attended at UH. The quality varied depending on the course and area of study. Courses related to one's major will likely be more challenging than the ""core"" or foundational classes offered online to students of all majors."
Freshman,5,"I love how the University of Houston is a beautiful mixture of different ethnicity/races, they all come together as one big family."
Freshman,5,"I have done online orientation for the University of Houston, love how easily it was to get all information and answers for questions I had."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Houston has turned into my second home now. It is the place I learned I needed to fight mental health issues and everyone around me was just absolutely amazing. Despite the very unsafe location, and some terrible faculty members, overall this university has brought back my passion for learning and being educated. I have never in my life looked forward to stepping into a lecture hall or classroom, as much as I have at this institution. I wasn't always sure about my choice in attending this school but now I'm happy to encourage people to come here. Academically, almost every department is amazing and flawless."
Sophomore,5,"I was already enrolled in an online math class before COVID-19 surfaced but as things got worse in the Houston are, all of my classes moved to the online format. Every professor and faculty member I had to speak with was extremely helpful and they put the students' needs first. I figured I would struggle with the transition but everyone made sure it was a smooth change for everyone. i was able to finish the spring semester with a 3.8 GPA and it was a great experience made possible by everyone working relentlessly to make the student experience a great one."
Sophomore,5,The staff members are always one call away and always give you the right direction to make a brighter choice.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are smooth but have a lookout for math classes. They tend to be tricky and a much faster pace than other classes.
Junior,5,"I normally take online classes and at UH they’re very well taught. Professors actually care, and the material isn’t too difficult to learn by yourself."
Junior,5,"Great, diverse school with a lot of resources available to students who are struggling or want more of a challenge."
Freshman,5,"I haven't taken any online classes yet but I have done orientation and other online tasks. So far, I have found the University of Houston's online experience to be excellent. They have an easy-to-use software which helps me get tasks done quickly. Also, all tasks I need to complete are made very clear to me so that it is easy for me to know what I need to accomplish to have a great college experience."
Junior,5,"Well, i've spoken to many people who attend or attended Houston University since I am a transfer and they all had very nice things to say. I even spoken with someone who graduated about twenty years ago. I have taken a tour of the school, simply beautiful, I use this app called rate my professor and it gives me many great teachers to have, overall I would recommend it to anyone and I have even emailed the teachers they are so nice."
Junior,5,"I really like how they care about their students. As an African-American it's really amazing to see how diverse the college really is. There is so many opportunities for both students and staff to learn, so many cultures to explore, and above all, the great intuition this college rewards to it's students."
Senior,5,"I've taken plenty of online courses and actually prefer them! The professors are always in touch and sending reminders about upcoming due dates or any changes happening so you're not out of the loop even if you never see your professor. The classwork is more than manageable because you can do it all at your own pace and tutoring and one on one meetings with your instructor is always available! Furthermore, using one online platform like blackboard makes everything accessible and easy to turn work into. Online lectures can also be used depending on your class and you have the option to watch it anytime!"
Senior,5,I honestly wasn't expecting much from the University of Houston when I heard about it from past relatives but to my surprise it's a really great school! Financial aid in the form of scholarships and grants are plentiful and you're definitely getting the effort you paid for. The professors are more than willing to help and the flexibility of hybrid and online classes is really great! The amount of clubs and sports events are too many to count so you'll definitely enjoy your time there!
Junior,5,The process is fairly easy and the enrollment site is also easy to navigate. Most professors are pretty responsive.
Junior,5,"Born and raised in Houston, UH has always been a dream. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Pretty great campus and people. Don’t walk around alone at night. Probably not the best. Go coogs."
Junior,5,Amazing professor and many to choose from. They care about your success and want the best for you! go coogs!
Junior,5,Amazing university for local.Def tier 1. Love the environment and staff. Love the classes and layout.
Sophomore,5,I didn't really take online classes  but ive heard great  things about the online campus and how it's te sam as on campus
Sophomore,5,The University of Houston is an amazing campus to go to school. it's diverse and it has a huge student union where everyone can make friends and enjoy campus life. the professor there teach amazingly and will give you the help you need in order to succeed. overall great campus
Alum,5,"I've always had a great experience with online courses at the University of Houston. If you run into any issues, the Online & Special Programs department at UH is a great support resource."
Junior,5,"As a high school senior I did not intend to attend the University of Houston. However, life circumstances changes and I came to UH out of necessity. I was not all that excited and started my freshman year halfheartedly. I could not be happier that life circumstances brought me here. I have had the best college experience, better than I could have imagined, at the University go Houston. I joined student government, a sorority, lived on campus, got involved with events and sports, and have had an amazing experience with my professors and courses. I have excelled in my academics and its die to my positive experience with college life. I have made lifelong friends and amazing memories that I will carry with me forever. This University is in the heart of Houston with so much to do. There are fantastic restaurants with every type of food you could imagine, beautiful parks to get fresh air in the city, and countless attractions for a fun weekends with your friends. Choose UH."
Junior,5,"The University of Houston has a variety of colleges and fields to go into and no shortage of great programs and professors. Every semester I am encouraged with great academic counselors and professors and teaching assistants who are their to help you succeed. I also am apart of the University's fantastic UH in 4 plan, which keeps my tuition fixed and helps me finish my degree within four years. With UH in four I have access to priority enrollment, great counseling, and the best courses. I am confident with my academic success and quality and have peace knowing I am ready to take on the real working world post graduation!"
Junior,5,I love that it connects you so well to jobs in the city of Houston and it creates a special pride about the school.
Senior,5,"My teachers were very flexible and helpful. At first I was very anxious and unorganized, but after communicating with my professors, I felt better."
Senior,5,"I love the school very much. It is very hard to get high grades sometimes, but it encourages me more"
Junior,5,My online experience in UH has been great. I believe they have been doing a great job with the online classes. Professor have made a great job staying attentive for the students and trying to do everything as smoothly as possible the students.
Junior,5,"Everything has been great in UH. They have amazing professors, amazing facilities and a great environment! They have controlled the whole remote classes pretty good."
Alum,5,I took many classes online. Most of the classes used Blackboard or Casa. They were both easy to use. Professors would respond fairly quickly if we had any questions.
Alum,5,University of Houston is a great university. The campus life is amazing. The professors want to see you succeed.
Senior,5,The University of Houston is a very diverse and inclusive college. There are many opportunities to do succeed and be able to do well. There are hundreds of organizations to join that can easily be found through AccessUH. You will be able to make friends of all different types of backgrounds to be able to maintain a social life as well.
Junior,5,"Great academic programs, campus, and professional development (student orgs). However, there are some drop offs such as poor location, campus food, and commuter school status. Overall a great school, that could use improvement in some areas."
Junior,5,I have had an amazing experience at University of Houston. This is a great school and I would recommend high school seniors to apply to this school if they plan on staying close to home.
Niche User,5,"This is just the college of my dreams. I've always wanted to go to UH  because I love the area. I also have wanted to run track there, because of the coaching, uniforms, and experience. I think UH would be a great fit for me ."
Alum,5,"My time spent at the University of Houston (4 years) was definitely life changing. I grew up in a small town with a population of ~5,000 people, so making that move to Houston for college was eye opening. One of the best parts of UH is its diversity. I learned about so many different cultures and met so many individuals with diverse backgrounds, it was such a great experience. Not only did I come to appreciate other cultures more, I learned to appreciate my own culture more. As a first generation Latina, attending UH allowed me to work hard towards my goals and succeeded academically. Through its diversity and inclusion, I met great professors (now mentors) that supported me throughout my undergraduate journey. With their supported I was able to apply to graduate school and will be attending and starting my 1st choice graduate program in the Fall of 2020. I highly recommend the University of Houston to others who want to attend an institution that supports their students."
Alum,5,"Attending the University of the Houston was the best decision I have ever made. I came in and took in all the advice that was given to me and took it to heart. I got involved and excelled in my program. The brand that they carry allowed be to start my career early and continue to finish my studies. It is truly a value pick, a power pick, the smart pick when it comes to higher education."
Alum,5,"It's an awesome, diverse school. I was in the Communication and Disorders major and I absolutely love the professors. My advisor was also amazing. Super kinds, helpful, and motivational."
Junior,4,"I very much like UH. It has a very nice campus that is slowing growing and turning into a great institution. I like the dorms, and also the common areas around school are nice to study or just hangout with friends. I am not a huge fan of the large class sizes, because I wasn’t used to it. But it is good to get on a good level with your professors in such a big class."
Senior,4,Definitely improve from the switch in the beginning of the year. Fall 2020 offered three different options on how classes would held. Nest semester there are more options available and each class there are several different options on how they will be held so you can pick which you would prefer.
Freshman,4,I am taking all of my classes remotely this year and so far it has been pretty good. I know some professors aren't so lenient with their students but luckily none of my professors are like that.
Freshman,4,"My overall educational experience has been great so far! My professors are really trying their best to help out every student so that we can do the best we can given the current circumstances. The only problem I have is the school's lack of communication on some important matters, such as how we now have to go to campus to pick up our school IDs since the school is no longer mailing them out."
Niche User,4,I liked how many resources and help I received when I went on a campus tour. I also like how many classes there are to choose from. The campus is so big and there is a lot to discover from which I love. It seemed like such a peaceful campus that it seemed like it was an easy place to relax in. I saw one of the lecture halls before and I would say that it was really big and it amazed me. It was really interesting. Another cool thing I learned from this university was how the University of Houston had a study abroad program which I am really interested in.
Freshman,4,"Even though I am only a freshman, I feel that I am valued as a student here, and the education strikes a fine balance between being enjoyable and being rigorous."
Freshman,4,"My online experience was mostly what I expected. I had already been used to online education, so I felt familiar with the university's approach to it."
Sophomore,4,"University of Houston has been good so far. This is my first semester so I am pretty new to a  lot of things. Staff members   have been very nice and welcoming. As well as the cafeteria, the food is pretty good. SO far, everything has been great at University Of Houston."
Freshman,4,i have had a bit of an issue adjusting to the new online learning environment but im getting there. Professors are really kind about getting us the help we need to keep us on track.
Freshman,4,"it is my second year here and i absolutely love it!!! i cant wait to graduate from this place and consider myself a cougar graduate, and alumni."
Junior,4,I overall enjoy attending the University of Houston. I am very active in two organizations that allowed me to meet new people and network.
Freshman,4,It could be a lot more cheaper than just $1000 and the apps that the professors want us to download are very expensive. Another thing is why use an app which cost more than $100 for just one book.
Junior,4,"UH is a pretty good college, it is very diverse and you can find groups of people you click with anywhere on campus (if you're looking). Up until the pandemic, my professors have all been very attentive. Sports are very popular here and make for a good time with your friends. The only downside I would say to UH would be public safety issues. It's not UH's fault, it's just because of the specific area UH is in the middle of and since it's also the fourth largest city in the country. If you stay aware of your surroundings, it shouldn't really be an issue."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at the University of Houston is pretty amazing! The staff, professors, and volunteers are so welcoming. Being at this school feels like a second home to me. Whenever I am lost or confused with anything, there's always someone willing to help me. I learned so much while attending this school and I am continuing to gain so much knowledge as I progress in my academic career.
One thing I would like for the University of Houston to work on is taking teacher evaluations seriously. Throughout my past three semesters at this school, I have had a handful of professors that, in my opinion, were not the best. At the end of each semester, students are asked to complete a teacher evaluation which rates the overall effectiveness of the teacher. I feel as though our evaluations are not being considered considering the fact that some professors teaching abilities and behavior has not improved."
Sophomore,4,"I have not taken any online classes, but I know the professors are very knowledgeable. The school has some very impressive teachers and I'm sure it's the same online."
Sophomore,4,"It's a pretty big school so eventually you'll find something that speaks to you. They have many opportunities (clubs, scholarships, jobs, events) on campus you just have to find them."
Junior,4,"Fall 2020 will be my first semester at UH, due to COVID 19 I will only be taking online classes so I hope they go well."
Junior,4,"My name is Priyanka Sheemar and I am a transfer to University of Houston. I will be starting my Junior year at UH. After touring the 594 acre university from the diversity to the clubs to all the different foods to the sports I completely fell in love and knew I needed to apply. After getting accepted and going through virtual orientation I was beyond excited to finally enroll in classes. Going from a community college where tuition is no more than $1,000 to a University where tuition is $5,000 per semester blew my mind. I quickly looked into scholarships and different ways to avoid loans. Here I am now, doing research on scholarships so I can afford going to my dream college."
Freshman,4,The University of Houston is a really good college even though others might say otherwise. The student life at University of Houston is amazing because of all the diversity.
Graduate Student,4,Starting my graduate studies here. I am looking forward to it. Love the diversity in people and degrees offered.
Niche User,4,The University of Houston online classes programs help us students who have a hard time self-studying have easy access. The professors try their best to keep up with the class schedules and grades.
Niche User,4,"The University of Houston has a very friendly environment and is highly diverse in unique ethnicities, cultures, and races. Majority professions at the university will go out of their way to educate you, not only book-wise but as well as educate you to better yourself in your future life and career of choice."
Sophomore,4,"I have immensely enjoyed the University of Houston in the year that I have so far attended. The campus is secluded, even in the fourth largest city in the United States. The student population is very diverse and campus life is great. As with any opportunity, your campus life is what you make it. Joining clubs and organizations help with the inclusivity around campus. Whether students commute or live on campus, there is plenty to do. Professors are straight forward and easily reached. There is a multitude of resources on campus for students to utilize. Classes are high quality and the expectations are set from the beginning. By sticking to the syllabus, paying attention in class, and utilizing campus resources every student should be able to succeed. Sports events, especially football, and basketball are a ton of fun. There is a good amount of school pride shown at each and are exhilarating to watch."
Sophomore,4,"At first, it was quite the adjustment. There was a learning curve for students and professors alike. I was able to easily navigate through the rest of the Spring 2020 semester and make good grades. The professors were really understanding given the circumstances and offered a great amount of support. There was a lot of financial assistance given through the spring and summer which eased my stress a lot. I am confident going into the fall semester that this will be smoother."
Sophomore,4,I like it's fair policies and inclusive environment. I also like how the facilities are near each other too.
Sophomore,4,"The professors gave us extra resources to compensate the sudden learning shift, and modified the grading scale to make sure this shift didn't negatively affect anyone."
Junior,4,"Online is hit-ot-miss but usually a hit. If possible, see if the professors have any ratings or reviews online before joining a class, especially online."
Alum,4,"OnLine and face to face classes are great! Class size range from small to large but I was able to get support of professors, no matter the size. Once you are in your third and fourth year, you are just taking classes in your building, which makes it nice to ,set friends that will stay with you until your last year."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the 4 years I attended the University of Houston as an undergraduate student majoring in Psychology, though if I was not a resident of a neighboring county to Houston/Harris County, I may have felt differently because UH is and has been a commuter school for quite some time."
Freshman,4,"I've just been admitted to UH and so far the staff and service representatives for admissions has been very helpful and patient, especially given the current worldwide circumstances."
Freshman,4,"I have been to the University of Houston campus and I enjoyed the campus, clubs, food, and life on campus! There are many areas of the campus which are entertaining and there are nice areas for studying and reading. But, I'm slightly concerned with the safety of the area around the campus since it is known to be less safe there in downtown Houston. Still, I'm very excited to be attending University of Houston."
Sophomore,4,The professors that I have taken haven been very understanding. The most surprising was how quick they were to any questions/issues. Only issue i have is when certain classes may not meet only so you really have to do everything on your own
Sophomore,4,"I no complaints so far on my experience so far, I've had good, bad and interesting professors. The diversity among the students and the facility is plus, overall its a great school, were you will meet great people. Only thing the school needs to change is Parking ...its horrible"
Junior,4,"At first it was quite complicated but if you think about the whole process of moving to online is pretty difficult. My professors did a great job with communication with us. Overall, it was pretty good. I'm even thinking about moving to online if they were to offer more courses."
Junior,4,"Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture is the one I attend. Its pretty decent for the tuition paid considering that it allows students access 24/7 with a student ID. I have had as far as right now pretty great professors that induce you to increase the passion you feel and apply it towards your career. Very inspirational. However, there are others that only want you to drop the course."
Sophomore,4,"Depending on the subject your are taking online, the lectures giving by the professors are good. They make sure you understand the subject by providing the student with different resources and tutoring, if they are having trouble grasping the topics."
Sophomore,4,"So far at University of Houston I have had a very pleasant time. My professor’s have all been pretty good and I definitely feel like I am going to be prepared for the real world. The only thing I would change is how much they push towards one side politically, but I respect their opinions. Other than that I have I had a great time."
Sophomore,4,"When Covid-19 hit, UH made a very smooth and comfortable transition to online courses. For my degree plan in industrial design, it was a little tough because of the projects we do, but the transition was good."
Freshman,4,"They walked us through the process of transitioning to online classes and made sure we knew what we were doing,"
Freshman,4,Its a good school located in a great city. It is academically challenging but also fun to attend. There is lots to do here.
Senior,4,"During Covid especially it was tricky getting professors to realize adjustments student had to make from being remote to online. However, some professors were super understanding of the pandemic and tried to help out as much as possible."
Senior,4,"As a transfer student, I feel like my transition to U of H was pretty smooth. At first I was intimidated by being in a bigger institute but even when I was going through some life changing moments in my personal life, my professors and advisors were there to help me get back on my feet. I appreciate UH for providing a safe and unity environment. My only complain is the parking and how high the cost is."
Alum,4,I loved how diverse UH was! The only con to the University of Houston was safety. Certain parts of campus are deemed dangerous during nighttime.
Senior,4,"I fell in love with the University of Houston within weeks of attending the school.  It's a beautiful campus that truly wants all of its students to succeed. Everyday across campus there are free professional developments, workshops, and events that make for a meaningful experience on campus. Housing on campus is much better than what other universities offer and the food is outstanding. The Campus is not known to be in the safest location, but they go out of their way to ensure that its students are safe by providing a free driving services from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and other services. Perhaps the most beautiful thing about the University of Houston is the diversity. We are located in the most diverse city in America which makes for a campus with students of every color, nationality, age, gender, and sexual identity. Needless to say, the campus is full of life and great experiences."
Sophomore,4,"Very good professors, many places for support financially, academically, physically and even mentally"
Sophomore,4,"It was difficult at first, but BlackBoard Online and Zoom were very efficient tools to use for class and everyone was cooperating, professors were very understanding"
Freshman,4,"I took some classes online and overall, the teachers that I had to fortune of having were very quick to reply back over email and the work was relatively straightforward."
Freshman,4,"The campus, students, and overall classes and professors are very good! The only problem I have with the school is whoever is running admissions/financial aid disbursement/holds on accounts - does a horrible job of doing their job! They are slow to respond and you have to constantly be emailing them (basically spamming them) to get anyone to actually respond to you/help you. This is the reason I almost missed orientation (because they didn't tell me I was accepted until the last minute) and the reason I didn't receive financial aid - because they took forever to take off holds on my account & verify that I was eligible to receive aid."
Sophomore,4,"PROS:
•Strong Academic & Career focus. 
•Large, open campus with lots of green space and fairly nice architecture for the most part
•Clear divisions between departments/colleges. The campus is ""sectioned off"" depending on your field of study
•(Usually) Profesionnal and Passionate staff
•Expansive & modern Rec Center that caters to basketvall, tennis, volleyball, climbing (2nd tallest climbing wall in TX, apparently), full indoor track...
•Varied dining options for students that take up meal plans.
•Multiple ""fast food""-type restaurants as well as various chill little bistros. I recommend the student-run Cougar Grounds.

NEUTRAL:
•Lots of stuff under construction
•Party scene is kinda egh

CONS:
•Low parking spaces available for number of students
•Lack of safety outside campus, specially in parking areas
•Some classrooms have old equipment/seem run down
•Mediocre online courses
•Mediocre science department
•Shared student in-campus housing is fairly bad"
Junior,4,"All my classes got moved to online in the middle of our Spring Break. I thought my professors adapted well to the change, but it was obviously tough on everyone to change everything they were doing so quickly."
Graduate Student,4,"I love the diversity on campus! I think some of the buildings, especially in the Social Sciences could use some updating but overall I like the campus. Another down side is parking... I like that sports events are free to students and there are lots of ways to get involved on campus!"
Alum,4,The University of Houston prides itself on diversity and a wide-range of programs. I studied at the music school and received a wonderful education. I wish I had gotten more involved with campus life.
Junior,4,"I enjoy University of Houston because the culture is rich. It's literally walking legends everywhere I go. Campus life is fun, there is always something to do and something for everyone. You can get coffee at the nook, do homework at the UC, and if you would like to relax then we have a very soothing fountain in the middle of our campus. If you are interested in turning Greek, then UofH of great for you because our Greek presence is very strong. One thing thugh, it's so much going on, so it can be very easy to forget about your schoolwork, so make sure you do your work before going out. We also have good tutors to help you out at launch."
Sophomore,4,"This school is a very good school with many professional professors. The look is very modern and beautiful. The environment is also very inviting, there not many student walking around all the time so its not very crowded. Most students would go home since this school is mostly a commuter school. I love the growth of this school as well, its something you can visibly see. such as the construction of new building for housing and education. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because of the misinformation I always get from staff ad the admissions or advisors. I feel as if some of them have less of an idea of how the system works. Over all this school is one of the most divers and loving people I have ever met. If you're a Cougar then you are family, they are very welcoming in orientation and outside when they promote clubs or candidacy. The campus is also very big to explore and safe at night."
Niche User,4,"My experience at UH was very colorful, vibrant and new. The energy there is very welcoming and seems like I will have a fun experience while getting to my future goals in the process."
Senior,4,"UH is representative of Houston itself in a lot of ways: amazing diversity, large and sprawling, not TOO expensive, and kind of ugly. The education is top-notch and I feel like I get a lot out of it. The amount of diversity and efforts for equality and representation are commendable and make for endless opportunities for exposure to different cultures and viewpoints. It seems expensive, but compared to other universities, it's not too bad. The campus has some amazing art and a few pretty spots, but for the most part it's not incredibly attractive. It is also way too massive and sprawling, and the organization of buildings doesn't make a lot of sense. But I think it is worth what I get out of it."
Freshman,4,"This place is great to meet new people and experience the Houston life. The diversity of this community is astonishing. The people, student and teachers, are all friendly and helpful. The food on and around campus is so diverse and delicious, you'll never run out of things to try."
Niche User,4,"It is better than what I expected it to be. When I first went there, I expected it to be bigger but it was actually a good size considering the number of students that they have. Although the school is diverse there are still more people from one group than others."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the campus is clean, the professors are good at their jobs and it is a quality education. I think they can do better in some departments and could should lower the price of parking, but it seems to be worth the investment."
Sophomore,4,It's been a great experience so far. It's good to see how people help each other all the time and all the support you get from the University
Graduate Student,2,"The way the school is ran is so weird, and it just wasn’t an ideal experience. The school cares more about its reputation than its students/staff."
Freshman,2,"While the school is diverse, you don't feel much of a sense of community. It is hard to be happy and encouraged at such an unambitious school. Coming from a competitive High School environment, this college experience at the University of Houston is lack-luster in many ways. 85% of the school commutes, so it is hard to make friends which you will see often, more over the lack of ambition in the students makes group work almost impossible. The Greek life is almost inexistent and falls very short in comparison to the other large schools in Texas. It is in the middle of third-ward so it isn't the safest place to study. While it is safe ON campus anywhere around it could be very dangerous to walk in."
Junior,2,"Definitely has more of a ""business"" feel versus a ""school"". Difficult subjects are taught by people who don't even speak proper English."
Sophomore,2,Not enough black people  for me. It is a very diverse campus however it is very hard to find where you fit in. In my case i was avoided associating because i had very few things in common with people because we were so different.
Graduate Student,2,"Unfortunately, this online masters in early childhood education program is not deserving of the high scoring received by the US news. It was equal to the level and education I experienced at community college if not worse. The program was created to pump out graduates and not genuinely to teach students best early childhood methods and research. They hook you with outstanding professors semester 1 then water it down semester 2. By semester 3 you can expect the professors to NEVER respond to your emails, NO GRADES and basically NO COMMUNICATION. They lack advanced technology abilities to connect online students with professors: so don’t expect to truly feel like a part of a learning community. On a positive note: it’s EASY to maintain an A+ and receive your certificate."
Junior,2,This school is pretty nice.  its very huge i would advise you get a ride or find someone who has a car.  its sos difficult you have to run or space out your classes.  the work load is ridiculous and i am going to be transferring soon.
College Senior,2,Not very great selections and is definitely more expensive than apartment living.
College Junior,2,"As a premed student, its hard to find internships"
College Sophomore,2,not much to talk about at the university
College Sophomore,2,I would say overall a good experience could have been better as thou in matters of student involvement and smaller classroom sizes.
College Junior,2,"I'm going to be honest I really had no idea what the Greek life at school even does, I've never seen or heard of them."
College Junior,2,Some of the professors are awful . The honors college is a waste of time.
College Junior,2,It's too expensive and inconvinient
College Senior,2,I believe that the campus could be a little safer. There is no reason that we should be getting robbed when going to our cars.
College Junior,2,"I wouldn't say they are welcoming. If you are here, then you could go about your own business and not be a part of it."
College Sophomore,2,Many students drink or smoke in or around the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,campus is located in bad neighborhood
College Senior,2,I have not really seen much of the greeks on campus. I do no hear about anything that they do or participate in.
College Junior,2,"I don't participate in nightlife, but I would hear very loud students outside my dorm most of the time."
College Sophomore,2,"It can be niche and diverse I guess, but still it's about the same as everywhere else. Not my thing but very easy to get into if you're into that"
College Junior,2,There are reports of crime around the campus.
College Junior,2,"Some courses are only offered in one season and grading is sometimes too harsh.

Professors are usually good and fair."
College Junior,2,"Do not go to Moody Towers! It is filthy and and overpriced meal plan is required. This brings the minimum price up to $3500/semester. Shower at the Rec Center and get as much Cougar Cash in your meal plan as you can if you end up here. Avoid the dining halls like the plague.

I've heard the Quadrangle, Cougar Place, and Cougar Village (honors only) are good, but I've never been there. Those options fill up quickly so hurry!

If you didn't hurry, see if you can shell out the cash for the apartment housing. Lofts is high quality but expensive. Cullen is cheaper and decent quality, but a little unsafe. Cambridge is even cheaper, but dangerous."
College Senior,2,the school using a lot of TA's so we do not learn the way we should
College Senior,2,the school only cares about  money and not the education
College Senior,2,"again, the college mainly cares about how they can make money"
College Senior,2,horrible! these apartments need to be redone
College Sophomore,2,Teams are all great ut the student body can't get into it.. Maybe its because of our diversity.
College Junior,2,"If you apply for financial aid and everything goes to your favor, it is a smooth and easy process. But if there is a file missing or an issue with your paperwork, then it becomes a headache. The university does a good job of contacting you about the issue but when you physically go to the financial aid office, it is awkward and the people don't seem very friendly. It is awkward because it is an open office. Everyone getting the same help or waiting to be helped are a few feet from you and can hear everything that is being said. There is no privacy!"
College Freshman,2,It is expensive and there is a high crime rate.
College Freshman,2,It is unhealthy and lacks variety.
College Freshman,2,It is unhealthy and unappetizing.
College Freshman,2,It was overpriced and the crime rate is high on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The distance to campus is a pro, but the safety of the area is the biggest con."
College Freshman,2,Although there are a lot of off-campus housing many are not high quality. The surrounding school area is very poor compared to other universities.
College Freshman,2,"Gang initiation and crimes are committed on a monthly to even a weekly basis. As a commuter, going outside after 6pm is considered dangerous. Many students are afraid from being robbed or injured. Alcohol and tobacco usage is prominent despite the label of ""Tobacco free"" school."
College Student,2,"The campus is not really safe, but the UPD does their best to uphold the security around campus."
College Freshman,2,"Receiving financial aid anywhere isn't easy. However, I do recommend that during your orientation ask to go to the welcome center and actually speak with someone in person instead of over the phone. Being placed on hold is the worst so try to call within reasonable hours if you have to and ask specific questions as well as remembering the name of the person you spoke with."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus food is good, just recently Fresh Foods company has had bugs in it. Plus a lot of the people that work there have a lot of attitude towards you even when you say thank you."
College Freshman,2,"I wouldn't ever want to live there, mostly because I can't afford it and because I think it isn't as safe as the on-campus housing."
College Freshman,2,Almost every one who works at the fast food places and dining halls have a bad attitude.
College Sophomore,2,"This is not the only school I've had financial aid problems with. It's not really their fault, but whenever I go in for help it is very confusing. When I transferred from Texas Tech to U of H there were many papers I had to file and sign and turn in, then the time to process all the paperwork I had done took weeks. There were also times when I had turned in paper work that they somehow did not process and I had to redo multiple times."
College Senior,2,I had to suffer a lot during this process so the best thing to do is to apply as early as possible.
Recent Alumnus,2,The administrative staff are unhelpful and uncooperative and consistency lost vital paperwork that held up scholarship and grant money.
College Junior,2,Not much partying unless you are apart of Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,There is not that much party scene in campus.
College Sophomore,2,There is a lack of nearby food options for students.
College Freshman,2,AVOID DINING HALL. YOU WILL POOP ALL DAY
College Student,2,"The dining halls always have the same options out. Some days, all the menu options are all sandwiches. They also close at the time in which I get out of classes, so I have to order take out from the Satellite. However, they do have their prime time in which food is good. During Lent season, they only serve some non meat items and they seem to go the quickest. Cougar Woods used to offer ice cream with the meal plan, but that is rarely an option now. The food is quite average to cost $8 a meal, when calculated out. On the bright side, it is a buffet. On the other hand, different things such as maggots, bugs, and foil is found in the food here. It is unsanitary to have food exposed to those things. As for Cougar Cash meals, there are a lot of restaurants on campus, even in the center of it like Cougar Cafe that does not except Cougar Cash. The places that do are either repeated, like 2 ChickfilA's. The university is trying to add more food options though. Two new eating stores just opened at the UC. In conclusion, for the price of the dining hall meals, it is not a steal in my opinion. The food does not fit my taste and my hours (some of the time). The places that accept Cougar Cash are scarce, but expanding."
College Junior,2,It takes forever for the financial aid office to reply to you and process your scholarships.
College Freshman,2,There is almost always traffic.
College Freshman,2,"There is very little they inform students on about off campus housing, most of my knowledge came from students themselves"
College Junior,2,"It's common to see safety and security patrolling the campus, yet there are still so many crimes on campus from stealing to assaults. It honestly doesn't make me feel that safe, especially when I'm walking around on campus at night."
College Junior,2,Overpriced for the quality provided
College Junior,2,"When I transferred to University of Houston from community college, I was immediately met with a scholarship for transfer excellence, which was very nice. What wasn't very nice was the financial aid process. My only tip is do your FAFSA early."
College Sophomore,2,Not best value and some of the servers will ripe you off and give you little food from buffet style restaurant like panda and kim son.
College Sophomore,2,Some professors such at teaching/lecturing go off topic
College Sophomore,2,Required to buy meal plan. BAD FOOD and EXPENSIVE
College Freshman,2,"Houston is great, but it is located in Third Ward, which is very poor and has a high criminal rate. I dont feel safe directly off campus, but the city is great if you aren't in Third Ward."
College Student,2,"There are a lot of places to eat on campus. The dining halls are great at first but then get really repetitive because they serve the same meals on a repeat schedule. They do have a great selection most of the time and the food is either really good or subpar. There is pretty much every fast food place you can think of to eat on campus. The worst thing though, is that the dining halls and the fast food places all close extremely early and have awful hours on the weekends."
Freshman,1,"Classes have been hard, counselors/advisors have been inadequate and discouraging, and clubs are hard to find and feel welcomed into. Financial aid has been pretty much non-existant beside government loans and an academic excellence scholarship that has only made a dent in my tuition. I'm in the honors college but it hasn't been beneficial and so far I'm only having to take classes I already have credits for due to honors requirements. ugh..."
Graduate Student,1,"The University of Houston economics department accepted me into its PhD program. I moved cross country to attend the PhD program. After three months in the program, they informed me that they had misread a school's name on my resume, and they were withdrawing my offer of acceptance. I did not misrepresent anything on my resume, and the misreading was their own mistake. I had passed up other graduate school offers of acceptance to go to UH. Yet they did not accept responsibility for their mistake and I paid the price all alone. I would give no stars at all for ""Value,"" ""Professors,"" ""Academics,"" if I could do so."
Senior,1,They give literally no information to new students. I've been here for 3 semesters and i have been unable to visit an adviser.
College Junior,1,Not good. Much violence and robbery
College Junior,1,They are so messy and loud.
College Junior,1,It is the most overpriced sort of housing with very little attention to security.
College Junior,1,"The school is not as student-friendly as it used to be. There are outrageous increases in fees, insurance, parking and everything that you can possibly think of. Assistantships are barely sufficient to sustain you in the present economy. In a few words, they do not really care whether research students are leading a comfortable lifestyle. The research opportunities and facilities are not up to the mark, despite their proudly proclaiming Tier-1 status. If they cannot attract good students (which I highly doubt they are trying to do), the research aspects are doomed. If you ask me, this is not even an average place if you are looking to do good research with proper facilities and sustain yourself."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The classes are not challenging, and the teachers are, for the most part, absolutely uninvolved and uninterested in students' success. Facilities at the Cinco Ranch Campus, such as the vending machines/libraries/computer labs are ridiculous; printers don't work, vending machines aren't stocked, there is minimal food available. Overall, the graduate program I'm enrolled in is overrated and just a waste of my time, money, and effort."
College Senior,1,the employees here are lazy and stupid
College Junior,1,No one non-greek looks at greek life favorably.
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is a joke at the university of houston, they dont even own houses they rent out floors of apartment complexes. If greek life is important, go to tamu."
College Freshman,1,"The staff can be very rude. Also, there are too many out of pocket expenses. The pending financial aid needs to come in on time."
College Junior,1,The financial aid department can be the worst
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid department here on campus is not too helpful and/or understanding! I have financial aid and a few scholarships to pay for my tuition with a little bit left over yet they still asked I pay for the courses from my personal banking account, knowing the aid and scholarships were in my account. It was an absolute headache! My mom had to take money out of her account to cover my first payment! I am now just coping with the ways of the system but I would highly advise incoming students to make sure they have some more money in their personal bank account to hold them over for the first payment. Financial aid is a determinant on your parent's income, filling out the form on the financial aid website and making sure it goes straight to the campus account you have set up with the school is the easy part!"
College Sophomore,1,Our school is surrounded by the greater third ward. It's the worst.
College Sophomore,1,There are not many options or help available for low income students.
College Sophomore,1,It's the worst but there are options outside of campus.
College Freshman,1,Driving in traffic is the absolute worst thing
College Freshman,1,"They take forever to get a hold of, not much help and don't cover my tuition"
College Student,1,"The financial aid process for me took 9 months. The school had my name wrong in the system, four different high school transcripts, when I only attended one high school during the four years, and my graduation date was nonexistent. I came from my hometown all the way to Houston by bus to get my financial aid process done during the summer, but that did not help at all. During the first semester, I had to frequently visit the office only to get the same papers to fill out over and over again. During my second semester of senior year, after I saw all my friends get their financial aid even when I did mine before they did, I called to check up on them to see if mine was done. I was told to keep waiting and waiting. When I came down during the summer, my stuff was not processed yet and they said I was missing a lot of forms and my social security number which were sent and confirmed by phone beforehand. Two months later, I was told that I will not receive any financial aid at all. A nice staff fixed all my problems and got me the full financial aid that I was supposed to receive. In the end I did receive my money, but I was close to losing my tuition amount. If you go here, keep on top of your financial aid and check back at the office. Make sure to ask to see your record there, because it might be all wrong except for your ID number, email, and number."
College Freshman,1,Not enough spots and expensive
College Freshman,1,every morning i come to school expecting to stress out in attempts to find parking
College Sophomore,1,Dining Hall is the worst. Too oily
College Student,1,"There are pretty much no places to eat off-campus, especially at night. If you wanted to go eat somewhere off campus you would have to drive at least ten minutes to a different neighborhood."
College Student,1,"There is a lot of crime around the campus. If you stray off campus at night, there is a high chance you will be robbed. The area is really bad. You can't even walk to the economy parking lots at night because we have had several robberies there too. Walking on the inside of campus though is ok at any time of day, especially because there are several emergency call buttons around campus."
College Freshman,1,The school should see what kind of high school you come from. They barely give out any money in financial aid and they should have more scholarships that students could apply for. The people at the financial aid office are nice and will explain things to you but they can't help you get more aid.
College Junior,1,"I don't live in an apartment near campus, but I've been to them and I've heard they're very dangerous, especially at night."
College Freshman,1,"applying for aid is incredibly stressful. I originally had more grants than loans, but then they took away grants and gave me more loans. I never applied for scholarships because i fell that they are impossible to get for me."
College Freshman,1,Like before I don't know what it is like.
College Freshman,1,We have no school spirit.
College Senior,1,It is a campus norm.
College Junior,1,Getting into the program you desire is really hard because the University of Houston desires the best of the best. For my program you must take a test to be excepted into the program.
College Senior,1,"From personal experience if you don't call them you will not  know whats going on with your financial aid. Trying to call anyone for help is horrible, the wait times on the phone can range from 10 minutes to an hour just to get someone on the phone. And finally when they answer your calls they are student workers who can't answer any of your questions. They transfer you to an adviser who never answers the phone or return any of your messages. Simply said the financial aid process is a nightmare!"
College Junior,1,"Our university has never given me financial aid. The only aid i got was from FAFSA, and it wasnt even enough to pay for parking. And i have 3.8+ gpa..."
College Senior,1,"COMPUTERS NEED UPDATING! Not only Operating System wise, but computers themselves! They run slow and there is not enough areas to go to be able to access them! WIFI needs a lot of improvement!"
College Senior,1,"They claim to be strict and to maintain rules, but overall they really do not care."
College Senior,1,"everyone is usually doing drugs, smoking or drinking. especially in on-campus apartments and dorms, students are always doing drugs and having parties."
College Senior,1,"Because the school is built in the middle of bad neighborhoods, living close to campus is not a really good idea. prices are okay from $500-800, but neighbors are not that great."
College Senior,1,"The rooms are so small that it is like living in a box. No student, roommate has respect for anyone else. The offices are always full of people complaining about something. The rooms do not look that clean when moving in and they also blame any damage that was previously their on you. The office claims they are their to help, but when the time comes to ask for help they do not help. Very uncomfortable, unsafe, definitely not a stable place to live."
College Sophomore,1,"we have the worst off campus housing. because there barely any to choose from, and the ones we have to pick from are trash and expensive plus they are not really close to u of h"
College Sophomore,1,suck the fun out of college. hate it
College Sophomore,1,ive tried my hardest to get scholarship but most of them target freshmans which suck for upper classmen
College Freshman,1,"when it rains, walking to class is awful"
College Freshman,1,"I am stranded, no car on campus"
College Sophomore,1,"School nightlife is nonexistent, lack of students on the weekend and at night due to commuter school."
College Junior,1,"We usually get a lot of emails about crime cases that occur on campus. I also see a lot of suspicious characters while I'm there. I'm always uneasy and I feel like I should carry a baseball bat with me. I try not staying on campus when it's dark, but I have a class that ends late, I have no choice."
College Junior,1,"The weather is terrible. One day it'll be hot and humid, the next it'll be cold and icy, the next it'll be rain, and by that afternoon it'll be sunny."
College Senior,1,"I hate parking at UH main, there is no parking specific to graduate students even though we take evening classes. "
College Senior,1,"The University of Houston is mostly a commuter school so it might be an understatement if I say ""parking is pretty bad"". Permit costs can be up to $500, and on top of that the chances of finding a spot are slim to none. You have to arrive 45 minutes before your classes start just to find parking."
College Senior,1,Financial aid is so hard to complete and actually get aid for school classes and books. It was not a good experience and that's why I am in need of a scholarship. 
College Freshman,1,Houston weather is disgusting 90% of the time and unpredictable. You must carry an umbrella in your backpack and be prepared for sunburn.
College Senior,1,Every lot fills up before 10 AM
College Senior,1,"Finding parking is terrible. Many times students have to park at the Energy Research Park then take a shuttle to campus. The permits cost way too much, and there is no visitor parking for friends and family to park."
College Student,1,there is never a parking spot and the parking enforcement is not understanding
College Freshman,1,lotsa criminals in the 3rd ward
College Sophomore,1,Many months of hot and humid days make traversing campus quite uncomfortable.  
College Senior,1,School sells over 20k permits only has 8k parking spots
College Senior,1,It is by far the worst. With only about 5-6  people available at a time trying to service more than 200 students at a time be prepared to spend your entire day inside the office waiting for your number to be called.
College Junior,1,Absolutely awful to work with and sometimes they legitimately talk circles around you and it is a headache just to try to get the aid moving along. Be prepared for multiple visits and frustration when dealing with this department.
College Junior,1,"The humidity is truly awful, it almost feels as though you live in a sauna. The heat only intensifies how miserable it can get. Come fall/winter time the weather gets beautiful, but we have also experienced an 80 degree Christmas."

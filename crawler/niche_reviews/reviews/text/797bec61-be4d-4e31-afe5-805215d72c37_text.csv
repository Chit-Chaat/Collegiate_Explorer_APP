Freshman,5,I am unable to rate this as of yet.  Picking out courses are easy on their website.  You get to pick different dates and times and even the rooms.   I do not start till the fall of 2020.
Freshman,5,I am just starting the College of Saint Elizabeth.  The visit alone is what made me want to be part of their family.  The help that I am receiving due to me being blind is amazing.  I can not wait to start in the fall.
Sophomore,5,Welcoming community of truly passionate and caring professors and staff. A safe space for academic and personal growth. Beautiful campus... a hidden gem of North Jersey.
Alum,5,"The college campus is very easy to navigate and the professors are friendly, they know your name and face and care deeply about your success. I found the education quality was great and the professors wanted to see you succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"My program is online, so I cannot speak for the physical campus. However, my experience in the online program has been amazingly interactive and I have developed relationships with the staff and students, despite never having met them in person. Classes are engaging and challenging, just because it's online does not mean it's any easier than an on-campus program. It is very pricey, but they have a lot of scholarships and partnership discounts that can help out a lot. Overall, I love it!"
Sophomore,5,"I loved the College of Saint Elizabeth. It is not like other colleges. CSE makes you feel like part of the family. They want you to succeed and find a career in the area you desire. I think the quote ""No man left behind"" represents CSE. I wouldn't change anything about my college."
Niche User,5,"From the moment I saw College Of Saint Elizabeth I knew it was the school I wanted to go to. I want to further my academics and expand my knowledge in the Biology field. I absolutely love this school. I love the atmosphere. The people here are very nice, it feels just like home."
Graduate Student,5,"The new Data Analytics program is very timely. Data Analytics and Data Science is a growing field, and to have academic study dedicated to the science, rather than only to Statistics/Mathematics, is very valuable. The courses for the program include the education of: R, Python, database design, statistics and algorithms, cybersecurity and more - all incredibly relevant to the modern field of Data Science."
Niche User,5,"You get to know everyone and have a great experience. The soccer team made me feel wanted in the team, I went on a official visit and made the team. I hope I end up going to College of Saint Elizabeth, its an amazing opportunity for me and my family."
Sophomore,5,I love the small campus that's the reason you get to know all the people.  I like how people Try to help each other. College of saint elizabeth is a great experience for everyone. There you can meet people from differents places and nacionalities. Also you can learn their culture and you learn a lot of values and how to appreciate the people
Sophomore,5,The dorm rooms need to be renovated because it's so old it makes a lot of noise. Food needs to be less fatty and more healthy .
College Freshman,5,I have never once felt unsafe walking around either campus by myself during the day or even at night. They make sure that everyone here feels safe and even have emergency stations all around campus in case of an emergency.
College Freshman,5,"Everything at this school is absolutely above and beyond what I could've ever imagined. The professors, class sizes and everything about the learning environment is perfect. You get one on one help with your professors and they know you by name. It is very very helpful to have a close relationship with your professors."
College Freshman,5,The alumni network is absolutely amazing and the help from the career center is amazing.
College Freshman,5,The dorms are absolutely amazing on campus! My freshman dorm is very spacious and the closets are huge. I did not have a problem fitting everything in my room and you have plenty of room. Also a fantastic perk we have is we get sinks and mirrors in our room which is very convenient. Some of my best friends are from my hall freshman year and the atmosphere is outstanding.
College Freshman,5,This place is my home away from home! Everyone here is so absolutely amazing and welcoming. The professors are experts at what they are teaching and are also very passionate about it. I think that our school is unique in the way that we are all so accepting and friendly to everyone we meet or come in contact with. We really are a big family here and everyone is here to help you always. I felt at home from the day I stepped foot on this campus.
College Sophomore,5,The school focus on getting you internships and great job
College Sophomore,5,GREAT TEACHERS but you have to wait every other year with some courses.
College Junior,5,"Morristown, NJ is one of New Jersey's nicest towns to be in. I love it here!!!"
College Sophomore,5,One of our Deans is a Title IX training official and so she takes the topic of sexual assault and the campus communities safety very seriously. Every student employee is required to attend Title IX training and every student is required to attend a sexual assault awareness program in order to attend any CSE raths (parties).
Sophomore,4,"Depending on the course you are in, depends on the difficulty you will experience. I have learned a lot throughout all of the courses I've taken. The dorms are older and on the smaller side, but are kept clean. They definitely need an upgrade though. Since there is only one cafe, there is very limited options for food, but what they have is diverse."
Senior,4,Its was great everybody was working together and understanding each others situation. Staff also reached out one by one to check on us students and or mental health and well being. There still was virtual activities and things to take you mind off of the quarantine.
Niche User,4,What I liked about College of Saint Elizabeth was how it was a small campus and very well organized. I knew that I could see myself going here. The fact that I play baseball and was fortunate enough to meet some of the players felt like I was a great fit for them.
Freshman,4,The community here is very welcoming and caring towards its students. Professors are willing to put time and effort into making sure that their students succeed in their studies.
Senior,4,Excellent program for RN's that work for a company that receives 50% off tuition.  They provide differed billing as well. I am participating in a cohort and do not live in college.  Most of my work is done online.
Niche User,4,"When I discovered about The College of Saint Elizabeth (CSE) at my high school's college fair,  the spokesperson immediately drew in my attention. I was invested into learning more about it. After doing my research about the academics, location, benefits and every other aspect about this institution, I was already on the start of my application for the fall semester!"
Alum,4,"As a student, CSE was pretty good. When I attended CSE it was still an all-women's college. I really enjoyed the food when I was on-campus. I was in the dorm rooms, which seemed fine, but I did not live in the dorms. The campus is nice and small - you can walk to all of the buildings in a timely manner; and the campus is VERY safe. There's a beautiful little path just before the campus, that was always really nice to take a walk on. Location is great because it's in between Madison (locally owned small businesses, fun art places and live music events) and Morristown (if into nightlife/bar/party scene) - lots of great surrounding restaurants and things to do. The downside to my rating is that, while I enjoyed my classes, I didn't feel like they prepared me enough for the real-world. As an alumni - they won't hire you, at all, which is crazy."
Sophomore,4,"Campus is small, student teacher ratio is perfect so every student is known by first name. They want you to do your best ."
Freshman,4,I like the classes and the environment.Also the teachers take their time to teach for you to understand. I think we need to work on more fun stuff in the school
College Senior,4,The professors are very helpful because of the smaller classrooms.
College Senior,4,My school helps students find job internships as well as jobs on or off campus.
College Senior,4,We have security who keeps campus life safe.
College Junior,4,This is  a nursing school so its hard to answer this question.
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy this school, i wish it was cheaper and the number of the students to a class was smaller."
College Junior,4,"i really enjoy this school becuase it is specifically for nursing, although it is a little pricey."
College Freshman,4,I think that we are a very accepting community
College Senior,4,"Overall my experience has been positive with registration, access of the classess, communication with fellow students and professors."
College Senior,4,I am not involved in athletics at my school thus I do not know too much information about the subject
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone is accepted and the campus is diverse
Recent Alumnus,4,The workload is manageable and registration for class is simple and easy.
Recent Alumnus,4,The professor will make sure you past the class and help in and out of the classroom
Recent Alumnus,4,The students could easily get an internship with the help of the counselor
Recent Alumnus,4,The student attend every game on campus to support the athletes.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Good thing about the College of Saint Elizabeth is it is a small college. If attention is needed, attention is given and everyone knows everyone. I would not change a thing."
College Sophomore,4,"Great service with finical aid, the office is always willing to help you."
College Junior,4,Administration is very friendly; always try to help their students out with whatever help they need.
College Junior,4,"Cafeteria people are very friendly, and food is good overall!"
College Freshman,4,This is one of the things i can honestly say they spend a lot of time on. I think it is great thing to talk about but it put limitation on other things that the administration can spend more time on building new student activities.
College Freshman,4,"I'm a commuter and the area surrounding campus is great with towns like Morristown, Florham Park, and Madison which offer standard franchises like Panera, McDonald's, or Starbucks but also small shops unique to the town itself like pizzerias and frozen yogurt"
College Sophomore,4,The education program is very well developed.
College Sophomore,4,Getting accepted to the program that coordinates with your major is fairly easy albeit the classes fill up quickly so sometimes you have to add yourself to the wait list however many professors are understanding might just slip you in their class if you ask nicely.
College Senior,4,I got a very generous support. Many people get that too.
College Senior,4,"There is a lot of diversity on campus. I saw many lesbian girls. Also, there are a lot of foreign students and American students who were born abroad. I am an international student myself and can say that we have a great international community on campus. However, there is not much political or economic diversity. I have not seen republicans on campus."
College Junior,4,I know a few students that oartake in drugs or something of that nature but it's not a lot. I wouldn't say there is a lot of pressure put on students to partake in such activities.
College Junior,4,The professors are able to work closely with the students because the ratio is so low. It really sets Saint Elizabeth a part form other schools in that the community is like a big family. If a student or resdient has a problem or issue with anything there is always someone to go to and talk to.
College Junior,4,I love all the opportunities that the college offers. Anyone can get involved and find something they like to do on campus. The events are very central to the diversity and culture on campus.
College Junior,4,"The class sizes at the school make it easy for the students to get in touch with the professors when they need them. CSE is big on internships and job opportunities, they offer programs in which the students can build their networking skills."
College Junior,4,This campus is very persistent on the students getting involved in th different clubs and sports offered at the school.
College Junior,4,"The Financial Aid department is really easy to work with. Even though there were problems with my residency in the state of new jersey and my eligibility for the TAG award, the people in the financial aid office work well with me."
College Senior,4,"Public Transportation is good around the College of Saint Elizabeth. We have a train station and a Shuttle bus that goes through FDU, DREW, Madison, and Morristown. The shuttle is always on time and the driver is friendly."
College Freshman,4,"There are transportation opportunities available, and also there are two other big colleges next door - so it's easy to meet up with other students and share rides."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in the field of psychology, and the professors there are very knowledgeable and supportive of my education.  They are also good at helping me to make other outside connections in the real world."
College Junior,4,With three schools being side by side it makes finding someone you have something in common with a little easier.
College Sophomore,4,"There are always free spots to park but some of the lots are near streets that are one-way and so it can be hard to manoeuvre if you don't know where you're going. Some spots are closer than others but none of them are too far from walking-distance to any place on campus. My only gripe, if any, would be that some of the lots are in need of a good paving since they are either filled with pot-holes or are just gravel."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I've never noticed any discrimination against any nationality in particular. Therefore, Greeks are treated the same way as everyone else"
College Freshman,4,the sports teams have become another family as a soccer player it has allowed me to meet others through this activity and the support from the rest of the cse community is awesome
College Freshman,4,"Right on campus there is the NJtransit train that brings you around town, back home, and to the extent."
College Sophomore,4,Thre are a lot of majors on campus and you can even get help from people to help you choose whats best for you
College Sophomore,4,Since i stay on campus sometimes when its snowing and raining its really hard for me to get up and go to class
College Sophomore,4,The computers are great . It's easy to find wifi and there is a group of people always willing to help with any technical difficultie.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is small , therefore everybody gets to know each other. The faculty is friendly.There are a lot of clubs and activities on campus as well as cultural events such as international night"
College Freshman,4,Comfortable Classes and Interesting Instructors – I didn't expect for my college professors to be so willing to give their time to the students. I love my professors because they are understanding and try their very best to make sure every student understands the subject that they are teaching.
College Freshman,4,"Sports Sports Sports – My school is very involved when it comes to sports. The students love going to games and cheering for our teams, and of course we love it even more when we win!"
College Freshman,4,"My on Campus-Living Experience – What I love about living in the dorms is being able to socialize with my friends and that we don't always waste our time socializing. We help each other study and complete assignments, which I think is great."
College Freshman,4,"Only Girls Allowed – This is an all girls school, but don't be fooled. Guys are still around and Fairleigh Dickinson University is right nextdoor. Girls tend to dress down for class, since there are no guys.  Everyone here is social and you will definitely make tons of friends!"
College Sophomore,4,"English  Major – College of Saint Elizabeth has offered me smaller class size so I can focus more on my studies and now I am on The Station, our college newspaper."
College Sophomore,4,The students here stick to their ethnic group. the blacks with the blacks the spanish with the spanish. etc. they all have similar dressing styles and interests. socializing is usually done within their own group
College Sophomore,4,we are in most of a woodsy area so it gets cold but nothing out of the ordinary.
College Freshman,4,I Doubt Something Like That Can Happen on Compus – It is mission college and I have not seen any thing like that going on so i can't tell.
College Freshman,4,Good Stuff – Everything about food is cool even the prices and the menu.The dinning hall is clean with good arrangement of tables and chair.
College Junior,2,"Health wise it's great , offer great service. And safety wise it sucks need better safety"
College Junior,2,I say it's bad cuz we don't have Greek life
College Freshman,2,if you play one sport you play all of them that's how small the school is.
College Freshman,2,Depends on who helps you in the office.
College Freshman,2,"I'm really disappointed with this school. If you actually care about your school work you're in the minority and if you do you're ridiculed by the other students. Most students are nasty and careless and get away with doing absolutely nothing. They say on your first day of class that attendance is mandatory but that's not the case here; in high school all you had to do was show up to pass, in this school you don't even have to do that."
College Freshman,2,Most people play sports but we don't have varsity as far as I know
College Freshman,2,"I'm not about to promote a strict administration but I feel like most people don't even know we have them, people are allowed to do pretty much whatever they want and in some cases that's just not okay"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is diverse with people from many places, but the biggest percentage of students are African American who come on state grants, scholarship, and federal assistance. They leave in debt and are dissatisfied with their experience due to bias in the programs and unfairness in grading. The professors can be very ignorant and use their status to do whatever they like despite complaints to the dean of school. This is a small school that expensive. Its not worth attending because the support system sucks. It really depends on your ethnic/racial status to do well. Also the school has lots of gay/lesbian women if thats your thing."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid is good in my school. the only issue is, there is never a clear amount that is due. every week, or so they give you a new number that is needed. another issue is that you always have to be on top of them to remind you what is needed or what needs to be done."
College Senior,2,"Campus Life – College of Saint Elizabeth is an all girl school. the girls range for the overly excited people, to the preppy stuck up girls, to the most ignorant people you can meet. As you would gues there are a lot of gay open relationships and some not so open."
College Sophomore,2,"Transportation at school are the train. It is very expensive, so expensive that sometimes I do not go home because it runs my pockets low"
Freshman,1,I hate it here there’s nothing to do on campus the dorms are terrible. The food is down right disgusting. The only good thing about the school is the academics other then that nothing.
College Senior,1,We do not have greeks
College Junior,1,There is no sorority at this school.
College Sophomore,1,barely any people for any parties plus it sucks. Most people would go to another colleges for parties.
College Sophomore,1,No one really wants to deliver here and less than 8 places would deliver.
College Sophomore,1,"If you are gay or lesbian the the school better for you with visitors, if you have male spouse they are very strict and males cant stay over."
College Sophomore,1,"barely nothing to eat, same boring and tasteless food and barely places to eat at."
College Sophomore,1,The school food is terrible and its places to go near by unless you travel.
College Freshman,1,"there are no men, and barely any male visitors."
College Freshman,1,There are NO guys on this campus.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life at CSE. Even though majority of the population is African-American students there would probably only be White sororities IF and only IF we had sororities. but we don't
College Freshman,1,This school has no sororities. In my opinion I think that is horrible because we should be able to pledge because it is apart of the college experience and this school lacks that.
College Freshman,1,"It's either dominos, other italian pizza place or chinese."
College Freshman,1,They want you to be or act like adults but treat you like minors.
College Freshman,1,This campus is very strict when it comes to visitations with boys. You are only allowed to have guys stay over during the week until midnight and the weekend 2:30 a.m. If it is a girl she is allowed to stay over night for up to 2 nights. I think this is ridiculous because half of the school is already gay/lesbian which puts the straight people at a disadvantage. i think if the gay/lesbians are allowed to have their girlfriend/friends stay the night because they are girls then so should the people who wants to have a boyfriend or everyone should cut of visitation for girls and boys at the same time. It is not fair!!
College Freshman,1,2 raths (parties) once a semester. and it is such a hassle getting guests to go if they are men and music sucks.
College Freshman,1,"They have no parties at this school, the night life is horrible"
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life
College Senior,1,"I really like it at CSE. Peaceful campus, convenient location to NYC, supportive classmates."
College Senior,1,"CSE is an all-girls school. The girls on campus are friendly and fun. Some are religious, others are more outgoing."

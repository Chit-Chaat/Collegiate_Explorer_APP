Freshman,5,"I have yet to start at this school, but I already feel that this is the school that I am meant to go to."
Freshman,5,"My son is very comfortable with his classes & tells me that his teachers are very knowledgeable, providing enough support so he can continue learning, improving his artistic talents, & maintaining his relationships with teachers & classmates in the community."
Sophomore,5,"I am soon to be a junior at Montserrat. So far my experience has been quite good. Foundation year is pretty heavy on projects and working as a team with your classmates but towards the end of the year it becomes natural. I think this helps a lot for when you progress with each year as the work is easier to manage despite taking challenging courses. 
 The school is small which means you get to know people quite well and fairly quickly. After two years I seem to know everyone, even people I have never had an interaction with. It creates that sense of a tight-knit community which other schools don't seem to have. Most people are in-the-know about what's going on around campus.
So far my favorite thing is the classes. I have learned and developed my skills so much since I started here. This is probably because of each professor teaching their own techniques and advising us uniquely with each class, so you take away pieces of their skills and apply them to your own."
Junior,5,"Montserrat is a small school, so its much more personal and easier to get involved. I've been able to get opportunities here that I wouldn't have at other schools such as a solo show and a studio space as a junior. The school is in downtown Beverly so it's easy for me to get where I need to be."
Senior,5,"I love the Montserrat Community and the relationships you can make with your peers and the faculty. The fact that Montserrat is a smaller school makes it easier to connect with your professors, benefiting your artistic career and improving your time at college."
Freshman,5,"They are many things that I liked about  Montserrat since the first day I step there, one of them is how everyone respects people personalities, they gender and color. Another thing that I liked were my classes that they gave me, the classes are really interesting and practical. Something that surprised me in my orientation was how the college is not just one, it is divided in many buildings! I’m enjoying a lot and hopefully I will like more things about it."
Freshman,5,"The pre-college summer course for high schoolers is the best way to experience a bit of what college will be like. I stayed in an apartment with other kids, had some great classes, cooked and cleaned on my own, and had tons of fun. If you have the chance to do this and get a feel for the whole college thing, do it."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Montserrat this year as a sophomore. I love the small classroom size and being able to connect easily with professors. I find my major in graphic design to be challenging and interesting. I like the apartment style living and preparing my own meals as I am very independent. I love the Beverly area with easy access to Boston, beaches, shopping, and cultural events. It’s a great match for me, as I didn’t like a traditional college setting of dorms, dining halls, and partying."
Alum,5,"Attending Montserrat was one of the best choices I've ever made. I loved the small student body size, because it let me get to know my fellow students/artists better, not to mention smaller class sizes made it much easier for professors to know me. It's a very welcoming environment and lacks the competitive feeling you get at many other art schools. It's located right next to a park and it's a five minute walk from the beach, not to mention it's right in the middle of downtown so there's lots of businesses and restaurants around."
Alum,5,"Montserrat is unique in its campus size, apartment-style living, & close connection to the surrounding North Shore community, which provides a one-of-a-kind education & customizable culture for its students. The professors are diverse, personable people who are simultaneously working artists, & give authentic, supportive critiques. They actively engage with students in and out of the classroom. Montserrat staff are attentive, insightful, & approachable--from first time freshmen to old time alumni, all are important. Beverly and the surrounding towns are highly supportive & actively participating in the arts scene, through a wide variety of internship opportunities with local businesses, & community art programs and events. Montserrat is a place for all types of creative thinkers, allowing each individual to learn the way they want to learn, sharpen familiar skills or develop new ones, & be their own unique, powerful person."
College Junior,5,"I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to thrive here. My art education means a lot to me and I am sucking the life out of every moment and every class. It's a fun, safe, and wonderful place to live and create!"
College Junior,5,"I love it here at Montserrat! Faculty, staff, and students alike are all kind, unique, and open-minded. It's a wonderful and fun learning environment. Everyone loves what they do and is extremely passionate and hard working."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Every professor that I had have been so helpful, respectful and fun! There is a lot of one on one time with professors since each class has a maximum of about 15 students. The quality of the courses here are very good, every class that I have taken is serious, yet not boring. Since the school is very small, we do not offer a whole lot of classes like other art schools do. But the quality of what we do have is amazing."
College Freshman,5,It's an art school. Everyone is weird and unique and eccentric and awesome. Everyone is extremely accepting and non-judgmental. Popular high school kids beware. Natural colored hair is minority.
College Freshman,5,"We do a variety of all things art the first year. After that, everyone sort of chooses their unique path and concentration."
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of rules for living in the apartments that keep us safe. There's always security available when we need it and they always are rounds to check the locks on our doors to make sure we're safe
College Freshman,5,"Thera are lots of different restaurants around for whatever you're in the mood for. There's a great breakfast restaurant, great coffe shops, bakeries, pizza places, and more high end places for a special occasion."
College Junior,5,"Being an art school, there is definitely a lot of diversity and you meet a lot of interesting people"
College Junior,5,"I like being a print major because I feel that we have great facilities, lots of different classes available, and all of the print teachers are knowledgeable and passionate about their work and subject"
College Junior,5,"Lots of great places to eat, which is very good seeing as our school does not have a dining hall and thus, food is the responsibility of the students"
Freshman,4,"The dorms were closed during Spring 2020 due to the Worldwide Coronavirus Pandemic, so my Spring Semester of Freshman Year 2019-2020 was finished online while living at home with my family."
Sophomore,4,"Montserrat College of Art is a nice school if you're looking for a small school. And That's what I was looking for. This school offers a lot of access and a lot of opportunities, and the location is convenient. Right smack in the middle of a pretty town, a few blocks from the beach."
Freshman,4,"The convenience to downtown stores  and restaurants, and the comfortable living lifestyle of the apartment-style dormitories is an attractive feature. The class size seems to be very appropriate for the learning experience. The school size is attractive for my son, who is not attracted to schools with large campus size."
Junior,4,"My time at Montserrat has been an enjoyable one to say the least, as I have been able to finally begin to expand and develop my artistic sensibilities in an environment that places emphasis on doing so, allowing me to grow as an artist. I do wish I was capable for entering courses more fit into my professional direction earlier, however."
Sophomore,4,"I adore going to this school. However, living conditions and food concerns are a major issue, seeing as you aren't 100% sure you can afford to eat every day. Also, a few of the houses are awful."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are passionate about their subjects and that translates well into the lessons. The classes are small, which in turn means that each student gets more quality time with the teacher to allow them to better understand the subject. The lack of a food program means that students have to learn to fend for themselves as far as meals go, but the dorms all have access to fridges, ovens, stoves, and other cooking requirements, and Beverly has a huge amount of diners and other stores so that students are never short of options."
College Junior,4,"It's very easy to get to know everyone on campus, given that there are only roughly about 500 of us. The opportunity to see shows, meet people, and connect with alumni and professional artists is very much available."
College Junior,4,"Campus Security and the RA staff are always available to support and look out for students in need. Security can escort you home if you're feeling unsafe, and each night there is an RA on Call to talk to and assist you with any issues."
College Junior,4,"We don't have typical ""dorms,"" but living in surrounding apartments/houses rented by the school gives your living environment a very cozy feel. The houses may be old, but we uphold proper maintenance for comfortable, quality living spaces."
Recent Alumnus,4,The career services makes it easier and less stressful to get an internship and job. Alumni are always coming back and showing their work in exhibitions.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I feel safe around campus, security is available all the time and the police station is down the street. However, there can be some suspicious looking people walking around at night but they are easily avoidable."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Living on campus is one of the best experiences about this school, almost everyone is there with you and students have access to the school until the late night. The farther school apartments can be a pain for some student since they have to walk far to get to class, also some apartments have issues with pests."
Recent Alumnus,4,My school is small but is beautiful and has a great sense of community. We all work together as a team for the school and we're all very passionate.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus security is no none scene when it comes to the safety of students, but are incredibly friendly when he comes to socializing and getting to know the student body."
College Freshman,4,There are lots of restaurants around and they're all pretty good.
College Freshman,4,My mom haggled with them and they accommodated.
College Freshman,4,All the restaurants are very good.
College Freshman,4,I received the biggest amount of scholarship money they school gives. It's still going to be a huge financial toll.
College Freshman,4,"The school understands that students are going to drink, smoke, etc. They just ask that we don't do it anywhere on campus and that we don't disturb anyone afterwards coming home."
College Freshman,4,There are lots of good local restaurants as well as chain restaurants within walking distance.
College Freshman,4,"All of the residential buildings are located throughout downtown Beverly, so you really become part of the town.  There are lots of nice cafes and places to walk, but there is no party scene.  The dorms have shoddy heating and plumbing systems, but are otherwise nice.  Having to cook for yourself is way healthier and cheaper."
College Freshman,4,"Classes are challenging and teachers are very intelligent people.  However, critiques tend to be gentle.  If you respond only to tough negative reinforcement, this college is probably not for you."
College Junior,4,"All the faculty are very knowledgeable and helpful, and encourage students to push themselves and be the best they can be"
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is pretty comfortable, some of the houses are older than others and not as clean, some of the housing is more crowded than others, but all-in-all it's good to live on-campus, especially because it's so close to the school."
College Junior,4,Enforcement of school policies makes for a safe environment
College Junior,4,"Great facilities and faculty, just a bit expensive"
College Junior,4,"I love the options and variety of classes at my school. It's flexible, so that just because you're a certain major doesn't mean you can't take the classes for other majors. The teachers are all on a first name basis and for the most part very approachable and hard-working. They truly do want to see you succeed."
College Junior,4,"They're very lenient on drug and alcohol use on campus, which is very important considering not every student is comfortable with those activities. Disruptive campus life can be extremely distracting. But it's very easy to go off campus to partake in those activities, and the guards and police are aware of that. You won't get punished for it if you aren't causing a disruption outside in town and are off campus. They really work hard to make sure townies aren't causing problems as well."
College Junior,4,They really make a wonderful effort to get people involved in a variety of activities and clubs. Not to mention they give the students a lot of control over whether or not they want to attend things or start their own clubs and groups. There's a very good amount of freedom there. Things that could be better are how fast the students can start it up. Sometimes they may have to visit the head of those things several times before someone is there to talk to or email several times before somebody responds. But all in all it's a chill environment and there's always plenty going on.
College Freshman,4,"The foundation year at Montserrat is challenging. I look forward to being able to explore the painting and sculpture classes beyond freshman year. I believe in my artistic abilities and find that Montserrat has helped me grow my skills.
Yes,I would do it again. My goal is to pursue a dual degree in sculpture and painting and work as an artist upon graduation or to go into a masters program. 
I worry about the cost of my education but I think it is invaluable. I realize I may need to take on additional work to pay loans but I will do what it takes to follow this dream."
College Freshman,4,"The computers on campus are constantly kept up to date and are equipped with any software you might need to complete an assignment. There is usually room available to work. I would recommend bringing a personal computer, but depending on your major, it i not completely necessary. The wifi is reliable for the most part."
College Sophomore,4,As a photo major you get exposed to a lot of different techniques including darkroom work and film making. Unfortunately the same teacher teaches all of the upper level photo class so the format of them can become a bit repetitive.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of computers in the different labs, all with up to date software. But sometimes the student accounts have errors loading printers or certain Adobe programs and you have to wait for IT to fix the problem."
College Freshman,4,"Stressful, but only because I get anxious about things like this."
College Freshman,4,"Internships are a required part of graduating with a degree, and while I have not interned yet I will in the future.  There are plenty of local and relatively nearby options as well as apprenticeships and work studies opportunities available at all times, some with pay."
College Freshman,4,"Beverly is such a quaint little town in a pretty tight community where just about everyone is welcoming and inviting.  There are plenty of places around town such as Dane Street Beach and the numerous little cafes on Cabot Street where students can hang out and meet with friends. Boston is just a 30 minute train ride away, and Salem is a 5 minute train ride away, so if Beverly ever gets boring there are plenty of other options! But there's usually plenty to do within the school from dance party to clubs, trips into the city to visiting artist talks and exhibits.  Truly a wonderful school."
College Freshman,4,"The feedback I get from teachers and from the end of semester evaluations have been super useful. I've used the critiques and advice given to improve my work, and as a sophomore i'm already seeing improvement."
College Senior,4,"Great Professors – I'm in Montserrat, and I'm happy with my education here. The cost of education has had a recent spike, but it's still one of the lowest in the country. I'm an animation major. I can't say very much about the animation department here, since it's fairly new. In fact, the student who set the major option in motion graduated here in 2011. The professors, nonetheless, are very knowledgeable and have had experience in the field. They are great references and are happy to share their experience, recommendations, and tips on where/how to land a job in what you want to do. Because Montserrat is a small school, you get personal attention, and you get the most out of what is given directly to you."
College Freshman,4,"Graphic Design – I am currently happy with the courses available for my intended major. The teachers are very helpful, and have previously worked in the field that they're teaching us."
College Student,4,"The restaurants around the school are not fancy, but not college student could afford that anyway.  You can find good pizza at a dollar per slice, a vegan place where you can eat all you want for not much more than a dollar, and lots of other cheap stuff.  Unfortunately, the closest grocery store is a stop n' shop.  It's a bit more expensive than the ones I'm used to, but it's not too bad."
Junior,2,"The professors are very compassionate and love their fields respectively, they are the best part of this college. That being said, there is a lot of things that the college sweeps under the rug, they appear to care about our safety but do not practice this other than to keep up appearances. It is frustrating trying to get anything done if there is an issue, myou on campus house had a gas leak and they ignored it for 2 weeks. 1st time they came to check out our smell complaints they blamed us for spraying fixative in the house..we had no heat for 2 weeks, which isn't covered by the housing contract by the way. To this day they will not take responsibility, and to me this is what represents a college. Montserrat will never take responsibility for any issues you may have, despite the supportive environment of students and faculty. It's a shame because I really liked it here my first 2 years."
College Junior,2,"Parking is difficult because of a lack of a proper school parking lot for students. There is a small parking lot around the school but there's only three visitor spots and the rest are reserved for staff. Students have to park on the street or in a public lot a few streets down, which can make things difficult for commuters or students who have to drive back and forth to and from work."
College Junior,2,"a small city, there really isnt much to do, there are some attractions but without a car your sorta stuck. shopping becomes local thrift stores, needs more shops and events with the community. not too much scenery but a trip to the beach and hanging out, and some few good eats with friends is probably the most youll get out of it"
College Senior,2,"Most of the time RA's don't care because they're doing the same exact things. No one really gets into too much trouble unless they've really done thing really bad. It's pretty laid back, however."
College Senior,2,Not a whole lot to do once you've seen it all. Salem is a short train ride or even walk away if you're really desperate for something to do. Unless you have a car you're pretty much stuck unless you want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for train tickets. At least it's quiet and there's some good places to eat.
College Junior,2,"Average. There are some really good places, but most are either too pricey or not very good. I would say Cityside Diner, What's Brewin', and Kame are my favorites though."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the good restaurants you have to drive to, and the ones around town are cute little restaurants, but can be expensive. This can be very frustrating since the school doesn't offer a dining plan."
College Junior,2,No Sports Team but Excellent School Spirit. Devoted students are eager to support the school but school lacks varsity sports. Attempts to create one has been made but not successful. Student's school spirit is seen through club and special events.
College Junior,2,"Depends on Your Clique – I was surprised sophomore year to find out that Montserrat is a ""dry campus"". Montserrat will be pretty drink and drug friendly if you just keep it out of the dorms! The school seem to be split into people who don't drink or smoke at all, kids who make it a lifestyle, and older students who know how to balance work and play. However if you like to have a good time once in a while but aren't in with the right people, your out of luck. It's a really tiny school."
Alum,1,"Where to even begin? The absolute lies they told me were the biggest problem. They said they would help find internships, they didn't. I had an internship with a horrible game company that wanted me to work 100+ hours a week for no pay. They said they would help us find jobs after college, I have never heard from career services. The animation department is a joke, most of the classes were taught through YouTube tutorials (which are free, I didn't pay $120k to watch YouTube). When I had to have massive surgery they said they would be understanding and were actually horrible to me and did not help me accommodate my disabilities. I will never recommend, overpriced charlatans, if I could sue for my money back I would."
Freshman,1,"not a good school. I was lucky to get out within my first semester there but many of my friends continue to complain about how they are mistreated. the school is a joke and many it is very obviously going under. if you can avoid going, please do."
Freshman,1,"I’ve gone here only one full year and already know it’s absolute garbage. The graduation rate is so low because of transfers, not the fact that no one can do art. Literally our campus is falling apart. I’m on the second of three floors and my ceiling leaks brown sludge and no one will do anything about it. There’s dead mice in the stove and we were given kill traps to solve the problem. On top of that, our carbon monoxide detectors didn’t go off when they most certainly should have and all of our elevators are way over their inspection date. There are even more problems than what I’ve stated but I’m going to leave them out for space sake. Take it from me, don’t put yourself through this. It’s a bad idea."
College Freshman,1,There are never parties and when they are all you do is stand in some guy's kitchen and watch your housemate play beer pong with water.
College Junior,1,"if your over 21 you have more choices for bar scenes, yet it still shys away from real nightlife. the ever so often off campus party happens if you know someone. going to boston is little of an option because the train stops at midnight. the school is really strict and will punish you with partying and what you do and have in the dorms. welcome to a somewhat dry life"
College Sophomore,1,"The school has no sports teams, but enrollment in the school includes a free membership to the local YMCA."
College Freshman,1,"There is only one parking lot in all of Montserrat College of Art and there are only about 7 parking spots. It is only designated for only the students who live in that dorm that the parking lot is next too, unless there are available spots."
College Junior,1,Dead After 5 – Beverly is dead after 5 o'clock. It is like a ghost town. There are a few Irish pubs within 5-15 minutes walking distance of the Hardy building but other than that not much to do. You could go into Boston via the commuter rail but how are you going to get back once the trains stop?

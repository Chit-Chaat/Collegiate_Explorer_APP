Alum,5,"I'm a proud alum from CIA's Illustration department. My time here was a life-changing experience (in the best way!) and I had already had another degree from a big university. The faculty are extremely knowledgeable. They work you hard, which teaches you to work yourself hard, which makes you competitive in your field.  I loved having my own studio space. Also, the staff members really treat everyone like family."
Alum,5,"Class of 1997 here! I majored in Drawing and enjoyed each and every aspect of the curriculum. I remember rigorous art teaching and amazing faculty, as well as committed and diverse students who are supportive of one another. I am in a slightly different field today (art therapy and social work), but my foundation remains rooted at CIA."
Freshman,5,"Cleveland Imstitute of Art is an awesome place to pursue a career in the field of art. It has many majors from which to choose. The staff is very kind and eager to help. My professors take have always taken the time to help me through problems with my work and projects because the teacher to student ratio is excellent. Plenty of resources in the school help you to achieve your artistic vision such as a tool workshop, equipment rental, 3D printing, digital output center and much more. The school is very liberal which can be a little off putting for some. Also, the tuition is high and is intimidating if you are funding your own education. However, CIA is worth it and is an excellent school at which to attain your goals as a working artist."
Sophomore,5,The Cleveland Institute of Art is a community that I'm truly honored to be a part of. Our community lives a healthy balance when it comes to school and real-world experiences. As a student in Design me and my colleagues pushing one another to strive and hold each other to high expectations in the studios. This department is truly a community and a family.
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and opportunity provided by CIA. They partnered with CWRU and truly believe in helping their students excel and achieve beyond their wildest dreams!
Freshman,5,Am currently finishing my first year. Staff do a great job to try to understand and accommodate many students. They encourage everyone to have a voice in this school even if people disagree as long as it doesn't spread hate.
Junior,5,"I just finished my sophomore year as a Graphic Design student at CIA and I love it. It is hard, no doubt, but its worth it. The school just moved into their new building last year and it is great. Parking kinda blows but its also Cleveland. The instructors care about their students and really work with them and their interests and strengths. In all of my life, I have never felt this good about being at school. Being here has changed my life dramatically and I love it. If you are interested in art, come to our school and talk to us. We're weird and crazy and friendly."
Sophomore,5,"CIA is awesome! I just finished my sophomore year in Animation and I'm still loving it. The professors are amazing and I feel like I've learned so much at the end of each semester. I can't speak for any other programs, but the Animation program is awesome. I only wish we could cover more subjects. There's not enough time in a year honestly. I wish we were able to take Illustration classes without having to submit a portfolio and get accepted into a second major. Because, for example, we don't get to take classes like Character Design (since it's technically an Illustration class). Overall though, it's a great program with great people. Heads up for freshmen/prospective freshmen, Animation is one of the most competitive majors to get into at this school. It's definitely worth it, but you should know that going in."
Freshman,5,The Cleveland Institute of Art has such and an amazing understanding of what it takes to make it as an artist.
College Junior,5,"I am so happy that I am attending The Cleveland Institute of Art. Based on what I have experienced and learned right now a lot have doors have opened up for me. I already got a paid internship in my field of study at the LBrand Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. That alone is an learning experience in itself. Based on the classes that I have at CIA I feel that I have chosen the correct major."
College Freshman,5,The professors are extremely passionate about what they do and are always willing to help us push the boundaries and reach our highest potential. Class sizes are small making it a more personal experience and creating a greater bond between students and the professors and students and their fellow classmates. There is a wide variety of classes to take offering students possibilities to learn in many different departments.
College Freshman,5,I have very much enjoyed my experience here so far. The professors are incredibly helpful and help students reach their highest potential. There are so many opportunities to try new things and work in different departments and have experiences across a wide variety of majors.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing and the curriculum is thorough. The workload is extremely intense. Do not bother coming here if you don't want to be doing school work for 5+ hours a night minimum. This is not an exaggeration. This program is really, really hard and after your freshman year you have to have a C or higher in every class or else you have to retake it. That being said, I feel like all the work has made me a much better artist and you definitely get your money's worth. I also truly enjoy all of my classes. You just really have to love art and actually want to do it everyday. You really need to stay on top of your homework and classes. 

The most popular study areas are the atrium, the library, and panera."
College Freshman,5,"Super super accepting atmosphere. There's lot's of different people from different economic situations, religious backgrounds, LGBTQ+, etc. The only thing would be that the vast majority of the students and faculty are liberal. That's kind of why our school has an accepting atmosphere. So anyone who's mega conservative (and non-accepting of other people or ideas because of it) will be talked about in a less flattering light by students."
College Freshman,5,"Wonderful, I love it here. The courses are great, the professors are amazing, there's tons of classes you can take, the class sizes are small so you really get to know your teacher and your class, overall it's great."
College Freshman,5,They help students out a lot when finding jobs and internships. The alumni work is incredible because of how intensive the program is here.
College Freshman,5,"Really great, spacious, and safe but expensive."
College Freshman,5,I've really enjoyed my time here so far. It's a really hard school but you definitely get you money's worth.
College Junior,5,"I have felt very welcome at this school from the first moment I stepped inside.  I had originally applied as a Biomedical Art major, however after taking a Craft Elective course, I felt a strong pull towards the Jewelry and Metals major.  I love that it is a small school.  Most of my friends from home went to large schools like Ohio University, or the Ohio State University, and I hear often that they feel they don't know many people beyond their classmates.  Here, I know people in every major, in every year, and I know much of the faculty personally.  My professors are very professional and timely, and the class sizes are very comfortable.  I feel that there is plenty of personal attention given to each student, and if I were to have an issue I would have no problem talking to my professors about it."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is the best because the buildings are new, clean, and extremely close to my classes. The living space inside to dorm rooms is beautiful and modern."
Senior,4,"My major is a DIGITAL ARTS major and I am grading based on this. My professors really did a great job and made do with our crappy circumstances. The craft majors on the other hand (Ceramics, Painting, Glass) got completely screwed over."
Junior,4,"A really great school. Going to get even better once they take off major applications. Studios are great, and they listen to feedback on teachers. CIA offers a wide range of classes. Doesn't have a cafeteria, and there is only one dorm that's really decent."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at CIA, but I felt that I didn't get everything out of it that I could have. The liberal arts classes by and large were not very challenging, and some intradepartmental drama led my major classes to be lacking somewhat. But I did learn a ton, and my conceptualization process improved drastically over the four years, in no small part to the great communities of students that form there."
Freshman,4,"What I liked about this school was the many different opportunities to perform different art mediums, as well as having trained artist in the working field as professors."
Freshman,4,"The events create fun and stress free experiences for the students. I love that the college itself is inside one, 4 floor building."
Freshman,4,"So far in the academic side of it, the school provides lots of resources and gives you challenging assignments every week. I recommend this school if you have a real drive for your art and love to challenge yourself. Be prepared to go out of your comfort zone and work a lot with others. I really like my school, by the way I'm still a freshmen."
Junior,4,"My experience in the Cleveland Institute of Art has been a wild roller coaster of a journey. The school has taught me reality is tough as it presents harder and harder challenges from me to overcome. I am happy for the friends I have made at the school as they not only helped me survive the rigorous trials given to us,but they made the experience a whole lot smoother, Overall the school is good if you want to pursue a career in artist and if you are willing to open yourself of to a realistic approach on the workforce in the art world.  If also  you  want is more connections to bigger names or just to make friends who all share a common interest in art than this school is for you."
Freshman,4,As of right now I have been accepted into The Cleveland Institute of Art as an incoming freshman. I don’t feel as if anything needs to change at this point if we’re speaking about “educationally”. Everything seems to be just as good as they showed they were. When I go I’m expected to have a really great time and expand my mindset of art. On top of that they are a private institution so that sort of counts as a bonus.
Freshman,4,The Cleveland Institute of Art is an incredible school that promotes creativity and community. In the single academic year I've attended so far I have grown so much in my own abilities and academics.
Sophomore,4,This school is phenomenal. All the professors work with you one on one to make sure you understand the task that is being put in front of you. I have very fun experiences here & learn so much quickly & effectively .
Freshman,4,I love the campus size. The amount of resources available to students and location in city cultural art center.
Freshman,4,"I haven't even been there yet so idk what I'm suppose to say, but from my visits it seems like an awesome place to learn and do what I love."
College Sophomore,4,One year from TheCleveland Insitute of Art is more than enough for a promising future!
College Sophomore,4,"Free visits to the Cleveland Clinic by The Cleveland Insitue of Art, the campus is surrounded by friendly police guards."
College Junior,4,Since I have been At CIA I can't say that any of my professors were unavailable for me when I need help. They are challenging when it comes to the goal  of the courses. I feel like I am being prepared for the real world when I graduate.
College Junior,4,So far CIA has given options for internships that must be applied for. The quality of the employers are great. and are in the field of study that my degree is in.
College Junior,4,I think in general you have be aware of your surrounding no matter where you are. It is always safe to walk around in numbers. and there are campus safety personal that can assist you.
College Junior,4,I find the housing is nice somewhat expensive for what it is though.
College Sophomore,4,"Mostly everyone is very accepting to others background, sexual orientation and political beliefs. There are many different ethnicities however there is some that are rare to find."
College Sophomore,4,Overall is a great environment in campus and there haven't been recently no violent or sexual assaults in the schools. You can leave your materials(even expensive ones) out in the classrooms or work placed in campus and are highly expected to have nothing stolen. I feel comfortable being alone in campus with just the security guards there.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes size are small which gives you more opportunity to know your classmates and professors. Some of the class style are fit for the subject matter you are learning or doing. Other students or classmates are generally helpfully and friendly towards one another. Campus is small enough to get around and get to class very easily. Some courses are very helpfully in improving your artwork or finding your artwork style. Some courses gives you a lot of insight of how create or use different materials, as well create or use different tools for your artwork. Some professors are helpfully on giving you insight but are usually there to give the assignment and just stand around."
College Sophomore,4,The school have a requirement of doing at least one internship.
College Sophomore,4,I would choose my school again because I enjoy the atmosphere is very enjoyable. Though the classes are very work heavy but it is all a good learning experience. I did improve my art skills that I thought I couldn't before. The school helps on developing ideas and researching on how to develop new ideas.
College Freshman,4,Academic services is extremely helpful when it comes to helping students find jobs and internships.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms themselves are great. They are very new, spacious and have great things like private bathrooms, large drawing tables and a small kitchen area. However, maintenance is pretty slow, it takes a while for things to get fixed when you put a report in."
College Freshman,4,"I mean, there are people doing drugs and drinking with a few friends or on their own but it's not a big deal. You don't see it everywhere and it's not a big issue. No one will pressure you into anything. There isn't a real drug problem here so I don't even know what the policy is."
College Freshman,4,"Sexual assault is definitely not a concern at all. This school is very selective so there are hardly any scary people and the people who are sort of weird usually drop out or flunk. The security guards are super nice and always visible around the building. But Cleveland is the crime capital of the country currently and although our school is safe the area around us is iffy. It's not awful and you're totally fine walking alone during the day, but be careful at night. We do get a lot of email alerts about crime in Little Italy and other surrounding areas. But if you feel unsafe, we have a saferide program that will take you anywhere on campus for free at any hour. You can even ask them to take you just down the street or around the block if you're nervous."
College Freshman,4,"The Cleveland Institute of Art is one of the most unique colleges I have ever been to. The technology that is provided to the students is state of the art as well as up to date. In addition to computers and software, there is a huge number of art related majors that range from painting, to sculpture, to glassware among many others. Also, all of the professors are knowledgeable and helpful artists."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is pretty strict but not too strict. Its a comfortable environment, we do not walk in fear."
College Freshman,4,Any tips would be to work hard and keep your grades up so that you are eligible for more scholarships.
College Freshman,4,I love the options of food that surrounds us. The only thing that would make it better would be a real breakfast place.
Recent Alumnus,4,"To begin with, the Cleveland Institute of Art freshman dorms are very astounding. I live in a 2/2 which is a single dorm with 2 people that share the space. The vicinity inside of the dorms are spacious giving each roommate a chance of privacy. The cleanness and maintenance of the dorms is well kept adding a vigorous atmosphere in its ambiance. All utilities such as the sink, draws, cabinets, refrigerator and etc works well, with an addition of drawing tables also adding onto the convince of the dorm. The worst thing I could say about the dorm is its lack of kitchen stoves but I could only understand why considering our safety of flammable things. The social atmosphere is alright, considering that there is allot of introverts as myself, people tend to be more secluded in the dorms rather to be hanging flamboyantly outside like the extroverts would. Outside the dorms is my cup of tea, CIA is in the center of university circle opening a door to social outsiders and extravagant food stores and museums such as MOCA, CMA, and Constantinoe's. Housing can be expensive, with an estimated cost of $7120 a year $3560 a semester this makes it difficult for students who are struggling financially making the housing process difficult."
Recent Alumnus,4,It's a lot better these days.
College Junior,4,I take public transportation everyday. There are plenty of attractions to go to and events that go on every year.
College Junior,4,"There is plenty of dining options around campus, ranging from chipotle to subway to asian cuisine to ice cream. Mostly everything is good although pricing isn't cheap but it's average. There are some places cheaper and more convenient than others."
College Junior,4,"Professors are a great network and guide for my academic journey. Workload wise, it seems that some teachers don't even think or care about the fact you may have 5 other projects your working on in your other studio classes so finding a time to do everything can be the struggle. Sometimes people get together in groups to study in the student lounge and I know they do hold a test taking workshop every semester before exams start. The registration process wasn't too bad."
College Junior,4,My school is an art school so it doesn't have any sports teams but we do have the availability and option to join any sports clubs at a neighboring university.
College Junior,4,I can always find something to do if I really feel like going out.
College Junior,4,"You have a wide array of student from all different walks of life. There are your art students, music students, law, nursing, sciences, etc"
College Junior,4,There's a lot to choose from especially since numerous shops were added to the main stretch on campus
College Sophomore,4,"Love it, its competitive and brings out the best in me"
College Sophomore,4,"culure and art are right on the mark, as far as expense in dining and local activities, a poor student will literally starve. "
College Sophomore,4,"Dining options are variable with many different types of food with different prices. Besides American foods like sandwiches and hamburgers (from Subway and Panera Bread), there are lots of international foods as well (from Indian Flame, Accent, Presti Pizza,...). Especially, the cost can be as low as 3.99, which is perfect for students. More importantly, most restaurants are located in a walking distance. I can enjoy a wonderful meal anytime I want in any weather condition. Also, food trucks visit our campus weekly and it make"
College Sophomore,4,"The drug scene at CIA is not bit at all. Very few students use, but it can be found if you really want it. Drinking is minimal and usually only takes place socially. It's not a big binge drinking school."
College Sophomore,4,"Only freshman live on campus, everyone else has to find a place off campus their sophomore, junior and senior year. The campus police patrol and they can be strict but there really aren't a lot of parties going on around the school."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman, you aren't in a specific major, you are in the Foundation year.  The Foundation year helps you build the skills you will need to then apply to your specific major.  It is nice to in a way begin on the same level as everyone and then build up to what you plan on majoring in for the next three years."
College Freshman,4,"As a student that lives on campus, I am more knowledgeable of campus events, as well as the campus itself.  Being in the art of University Circle, CIA is surrounded by restaurants, museums, and Case Western Reserve University.  Sharing the dining hall with the Case students has allowed many of the CIA students to befriend many of them.  It is nice to make friends with students that are not at CIA.  Sharing the campus with Case allows me as a CIA student to have a diverse group of friends."
College Freshman,4,"The Cleveland Institute of Art offers the diversity that I was looking for when researching colleges.  Students from all over the country gather at CIA for the one common interest that we all share, the love for creating art.  Being in the heart of University Circle, CIA is surrounded by museums, local businesses as well as other colleges.  There is never a boring moment in this community! There are so many opportunities to explore your personal interests with the environment that we spend four years in."
College Freshman,4,"I don't know? If we're talking about relationships, that honestly doesn't interest me much. The way I see it, there's not a whole lot of time for that, between school and work and social life. Anyway, just like any school, you'll see all types of people. Everyone is an artist, of course; some are the ""hipster"" type, some are nerdy, and some are just...I don't know, people? :| Some take the time to dress themselves up, others don't. (There's no shame in that, though. No one honestly cares enough to think badly of you.) Some people are very friendly whereas others are shy, and some are nice and others not so much. It's just a big mix of people. For the most part, though, everyone gets along and supports one another. No one's really considered ""popular,"" as we're all kind of like the outcasts of our high schools. There are tons of different interests and personality types floating around, so it's not hard to make friends."
College Freshman,4,"Great! Teachers are always (usually, I guess) helpful and friendly, and generally very supportive of a student's growth as an artist, as they should be. The workload is not by any means ""easy,"" but it's not impossible, so long as a student works responsibly. Projects vary by teacher and course, and sometimes one might be stuck with the ""pointless projects"" (which is kind of inevitable, but sometimes they do end up having a point in the end), and they can be either fun or...not so fun? Anyway, everything manages to work out in the end, somehow. I'd say the academics, overall, are great."
College Freshman,4,"When you get tired of the two dining halls available, there are a lot of great options! There is chipotle and panera which don't take case cash, a system that lets you use school issued money like a debit card, but other which do, such as the following: Tropical Smoothie, Chopsticks, Qudoba , Rascal House Pizza, Starbucks, Constantinos grocery store, Coffee House, and Falafel House. Also Litle Italy is a five minute walk away!"
College Junior,4,"Students come from all over the country and globe to study at CIA.  That's the thing about artists, they can be anyone with any background.  Everyone has their own style and opinions, diversity in people and ideas are essential to critiques and growing as a creator.  CIA also shares a campus with The Cleveland Institute of Music and Case Western Reserves, giving an even larger impact of diverse cultures.  University circle is steps from neighborhoods like Little Italy, Coventry, and Tower City.  For being in Ohio, Cleveland is the top choice to go to school if you're looking for diversity in a midwest setting."
College Sophomore,4,"Love Going to Class – Classes in college are nothing as they are in High School. You have much more freedom in how you can take notes. However, with more freedom comes more responsibilities. The academic classes at CIA discuss very interesting topics and is much more engaging than simply listening to a teacher lecture mundanely."
College Sophomore,4,"Industrial Design Is Competative – I've been doing Industrial Design since Sophomore year in High School, and as expected, things get more challenging in College. That's not to discourage those who wish to pursue this path; industrial design, as many other design majors, will always have their long nights and tedious projects. You just have to have a passion for it."
College Sophomore,4,"Good Service – If you ever get sick you can always count on getting a check up, but probably not the same day if you don't make an appointment. THe distance to the campus clinic isn't too bad but it's not preferable as it does require one to wait for a campus shuttle to come around, which is usually on time. If you're in a real emergency, you can definitely expect to go the ER or hospital without question."
College Sophomore,4,"Little Italy Brings in Culture – When I first came to Cleveland, I didn't expect to find an Italian-themed Restaurant so close to my campus, nor that I would be living there. It's nice to have that sure feeling of having so many great choices to dine out when you don't have time to cook yourself. It's also not as cheap as I expected it to be. Lot's of places, such as Presti's Bakery, which serves more than just sweets, is one of many 'stop-by' destinations for college students in University Circle. Furthermore, there's always plenty of other options to eat outside campus that are only a less than five minute walk away."
College Junior,4,"Painting, Printmaking, Drawing, Sculpture, Fibers & Material Studies, Illustration, Video art, Ceramics, Glass Blowing, Metal working, Enameling, Industrial Design. The work load can be hard at times. 3 -4 studio glasses which are 9:30am -4:30pm and 2 liberal art classes a semester. This school critiques work professionally therefore refining its students"
College Junior,4,Things to Do – CIA is located right next to the lovely Botanical Gardens. It be be a tranquil place to hang out at times. If you are a lover of the arts then perhaps you wold enjoy heading over to the Cleveland Museum of Art. Also the new MOCA museum of art is being built just a few block from CIA. Little Italy is cool to.
College Freshman,4,On Campus Diner – the prices are reasonable plus there are discounts for students.  It is in walking distance and the variety is like home cooking.
College Sophomore,4,"Classic, but Not Old – the school itself was intriguing.  The buildings were clearly genius modern pieces of art work themselves, while the insides, were like homes to each student.  The students made the spaces they were given their own...it was like floating through space or across country borders...no one was identical to the next.  Just new experiences.  The dorms could use a HUGE makeover, however.  Very small, very hot, and the building itself was something out of a 70s show.  but the campus stays beautiful and well kept, busy and fun."
Alum,2,All the problems that existed in person remained once we went virtual. Courses driven by an out of date and out of touch staff and faculty leads to an institution that lacks true inspiration.
Freshman,2,"Glad to not be returning...the academics were good and I did learn a lot overall but the location is unsafe and getting worse. I attended last year and would have left sooner if I hadn't already paid tuition. Apart from the numerous alerts students receive weekly about shootings in the area and other violent crime, walking around you must always keep an eye behind you. In my own experience I had people on the street grab my arms, follow me, scream and even a man at a bus stop just one block from the school sexually harass myself and another student. To say the least never walk alone. It is also difficult to sleep in the dorms, there are constant sirens up and down the street of the dorms which only increase as it becomes night. There were also social issues with the students  and dorms but those are really everywhere, it just seems more apparent when the environment isolates students, especially ones who are not from the area already knowing people."
Alum,2,Cia has some great professors!  But over all they are cutting every thing to save money. (This includes closing the now one building to have party's to make money) it feels like a rats nest because everyone is in one area that is not big enough. This is really bad when you have 3-4 classes happening at once.  They are taking away computer labs and turning it in to a art zoo were ppl can come look at the artist and take pictures for a fee.
College Sophomore,2,"A wonderful experience, but they have an issue with space and reasoning when it comes to complex situations."
College Sophomore,2,The parties are very crowded and are mostly made up of Case's students instead of our schools.
College Sophomore,2,"Thou there isn't any peer pressure that much on campus or in the dorms, a lot of the students do drugs. Alcohol being  visible is very rare and is only scene in special events or in parties"
College Senior,2,there has been a few bad highs that did not turn out well
College Senior,2,we have too much going on. there are a few party's but not too many
College Senior,2,all of the academics are just gen-eds and everyone treats them in that way
College Senior,2,there are a lot if muggings on campus.. the last week of school a guy got pistol wiped and robed
College Senior,2,we only have housing the first year then its up to you to find housing
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's cheap, but usually pretty disgusting. Most the places are run down, and the decent ones are pretty expensive for a poor college student. A lot of people I know had their places broken into, so be careful where you stay."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Compared to other colleges, it's not that great."
College Sophomore,2,As a commuter I didn't purchase parking since they won't let freshman park at the main building which is also near the dorms. It was too expensive anyways.
College Sophomore,2,"Too expensive, I have lost 30 lbs easy from NOT eating."
College Junior,2,"Rains most days, very windy and bad winters with few classes cancelled"
College Sophomore,2,CIA in particular does not offer Greek life. But the students at case are very close to the art kids and allow them to chime in on their Greek life for those who are interested.
College Junior,2,"University Health Services are very helpful and easy to get in with either school insurance or otherwise.  Safety is iffy, there's plenty of campus police, circle police, and emergency buttons placed every few yards but you're still on the border of East Cleveland.  Campus safety notifications are emailed every time any type of crime has occurred with details.  Usually people getting mugged and the suspect is not apprehended, it's really unsettling but good information to have in a dangerous city.  The dorms are quite safe though, access is only granted with a student id for specific buildings."
College Junior,2,"Our dorm Resident Assistants made clear that drinking and smoking is prohibited at all costs. Also, attending parties with alcohol is very risky, as there have been incidents with the authorities and schools both involved. It would be best to not indulge in any drinking or drugs. It also affects schoolwork, and teachers will notice!"
College Junior,2,It Is Fine. Food fills your stomach when you eat it and it sometimes costs an okay amount of money. But sometimes not.
Alum,1,Every school has pros and cons but at the end of the day CIA does not have their students best interest in mind. This school should be a 2 year program. It falls short on really challenging and pushing students to succeed and puts more money and effort in to appearances than anything else. I just graduated and would not recommend CIA to an individual interested in seriously challenging themselves artistically and intellectually. It is more like an art focused high school than a college.
Junior,1,"Many of the teachers do not know what they are doing, and if you ask a question they tell you to look it up on YouTube. The dormitories are ridiculously priced for very little benefits. While the facilities are great, the faculty over work their students to no end. After 6 hours of class (for only 3 credit hours mind you) you are expected to do atleast 6 hours of homework as many of my professors told me. When working with the heads of disabilities, I got multiple different answers that all ended up being wrong and harming me in the long run. They accept way more students than they can house in their studios, and if you dont get into a major you wanted  you've wasted a year of your life, $57,000 (which by the way is the same price as case western with a 10th of the space, facilities, and faculty), and if you dont chose to drop out at that point, they'll find a random major to put you in. Not worth it."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have any sports in our school, if so its just for fun not really for competition wise."
College Senior,1,we do not have any athletic options at all at our school
Recent Alumnus,1,"Compared to other universities and colleges, I wouldn't say CIA's campus is that great... It claims to provide a lot of shared benefits with CWRU, but it really doesn't. Although they're getting better, it was a pain to deal with not enough lab space, they never cleaned certain bathrooms or any of the computer labs, parking, and many other things."
College Junior,1,"Our school only lets you have a meal plan for your freshmen year. Then you must buy food at the grocery store. alot of us dont have a lot of money to begin with, hence the term ""starving artist"""
College Freshman,1,"Expensive Pass – Parking is limited, $450 yearly fee that doesn't even garuntee you a spot.  However, if dorming, builds are close by"
College Sophomore,1,"If you have a car, exercise caution. Cleveland is booby-trapped with a vast array of traffic cameras (red light, speed, etc.). The roads are poorly maintained. And if you need to park at CIA, be forewarned that space is limited and expensive. A year parking permit will cost you $450. And at one of the buildings, students are forced to park in the back and walk quite a distance to the entrance. Public transit is also terrible. Wait times are atrocious and the vehicles themselves are dirty."
College Sophomore,1,PLEASE Avoid Lake Park Tower – It is a total nightmare. The management are complete snakes. Find somewhere else to live.
College Sophomore,1,"Cleveland Is Truly the Mistake on the Lake – There is nothing being Cleveland's claims to recreation. You will have no time for anything extra if you choose to give your homework any attention at all. And presuming that all college students are on tight budgets, you cannot afford to take part in any of the remotely interesting Cleveland attractions. The area is unsafe-- robberies and break-ins occur frequently. You will also have a hell of a time getting to any art supply stores (the nearest one is about an hour away by bus) and grocery/department stores. CIA DOES NOT HAVE A CAMPUS-- it has two buildings situated on street corners. Really, be sure you know what Cleveland has in store for you before you decide to come here."
College Sophomore,1,"I Hate Every Aspect of This Place. CIA is not upfront about the type of school it is. It favors conceptual artists above anyone else. Your liberal arts classes will feel like total wastes of your time and money. The cost and convenience of parking is totally unacceptable. Its claim to ""community"" is untrue; people keep to themselves. The facilities are ill-maintained, too small, and too few. Dorm living is an utter nightmare (you live in a closet with another person, and eat salt-blocks at the dining hall). Extracurriculars are few and far between. Your studio professors are stretched thin. You will blow an entire year taking foundations classes. Your first-year workload is far too large and will destroy your nerves and any desire in you to sleep. And quite frankly, most of your classmates are jerks. Please be sure you know what you are getting into if you choose to go here."

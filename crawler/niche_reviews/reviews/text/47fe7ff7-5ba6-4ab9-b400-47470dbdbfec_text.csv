Alum,5,What I enjoyed the most was how quickly I was able to earn my Bachelors degree. By not taking extended long breaks and focusing one class at a time I was able to finish sooner than the standard four year process you find with most universities.
Alum,5,Online was extremely flexible and easy to use. We had people of all ages in my class and no one had any issues.
Alum,5,"I decided two years ago to change careers and follow my passion with aviation.  I looked at several universities and found Everglades University right down the road from my home.  The classes were engaging and challenging, but not overwhelming.  All of my instructors were supportive and I was constantly contacted by the university to see if I needed any help.  The cost is a little high per class but the overall experience was great! I liked it so much I'm returning in January for their MBA program with a concentration in aviation.  Great school!"
Alum,5,"The Blackboard platform that Everglades University uses is simple and easy to use.  The classes are short, four weeks for undergraduate classes, and all the instructors I had were knowledgeable and helpful.  I don't think I ever had more than 20 people in a class.  Definitely recommend Everglades University for online classes, especially to those with full time jobs and families."
Senior,5,"My online experience was superb. communication was on point and i was able to reach my instructor at any given time. What i loved about virtual learning the most was having live sessions with the instructors, it felt like i was right there in the classroom."
Senior,5,Everglades University is a wonderful school for any person with a busy schedule. They are very understanding and will work around your schedule. Having one class per month was the biggest perk. You are guaranteed to pass with this school.
Alum,5,"I completed my bachelor's degree fully online, and I enjoyed how easy it was to accommodate it into my full-time schedule as an entrepreneur. I loved taking one class at a time because I could really absorb the information and learn at my own pace. The way EU Online organizes their courses definitely suited me, and was much less stressful than other universities."
Alum,5,Completing the online bachelor's degree in Alternative Medicine has opened my eyes to new forms of natural healing while being flexible for my full-time schedule. The faculty is also very friendly and supportive. I highly recommend EU to anyone looking to complete their educational goals!
Junior,5,The professors are amazing. The interaction between student and professor in the small groups is like no other. They are knowledgeable and learning is interactive.

Freshman,5,I am new to Everglades and since I have started I have had a hard time managing my time and having computer issues as well.

It happens to be one of the first times in my life that attention to detail, submission, and receiving of knowledge all flows so effortlessly and with commonality. I sorely love the enrollment for each new class and have been challenged, held, supported, nurtured, and gifted so much from this academy. I didn't think I would ever go back to school and reached out to a mentor, actually a Guru from the Himalayan mountains, who advised me to attend this program. I am absolutely so pleased to have been a part of this journey! Wonderful teachers, excellent books, and excellent curriculum. This is truly a challenge and yet the greatest most fulfilling challenge of all."
Junior,5,"Online courses have saved my life! I run an online herbal academy for BBIPOC, I am also a doula, an organic farmer, and a traveller, and I have had so much peace knowing that I can study any time and attend classes from the comforts of my own home."
Graduate Student,5,"I earned my B.S. and am currently earning my Masters at Everglades. It is a great school for online learners.

Freshman,5,"I am going into my third semester with everglades University, I have been to a few colleges in my time lol, but E.U. has by far been the best one I look forward to furthering my education here after I finish my B.S. in alternative medicine. they are the best."
Freshman,5,my online experience has been very smooth and easy. the staff make it that way. they are very polite and helpful. thank you E.U.

Junior,5,I love learning online because Im a mom of 4 with a business and I homeschool. Learning online allows me to access my assignments on my time. EU professors are very active on the online platform and easily accessible for any needs or concerns. This is my 10th month and I haven't had any issues or complaints about the professors or the curriculum. I plan to return to EU for my Masters' as well!
Junior,5,"With EU, I LOVE the fact that I can focus on one class at a time and I feel like I'm retaining the information so much better because of it. I appreciate how my professors engage with the class and I know that they want to make sure that I'm succeeding."
Junior,5,"I'm so glad that I found EU and the Alternative Medicine program, which has turned out to be just what I was desperately looking for. Before coming to EU, I took classes through a handful of other online universities but I wasn't enjoying the content and it just didn't feel right. 

I'm a military veteran, a military spouse, and a mom of 2 and I'm thankful that EU is around to help me accomplish my goals!"
Sophomore,5,"Both students and instructors make the best of the learning experience! The online I tera room o. The weekly posts are so insightful and the more you participate, the more meat there is to what you will learn! The instructors have all been very involved in responding to questions as well as responding to the oats that you leave and your classmates. All o atria Roa are polite and observar I’ve if you’re participation! Online learning is great! Pushing me to better myself at my pace!"
Sophomore,5,"I attended to one other Online program with another school in Florida, my experience with them was harsh, and my grade point dropped because they simply wouldn’t help the students with the portal. Here at Everglades the first class that you attend I show to get around in your virtual classroom. I love the way that academic advising as well as all the staff that speaks to you are actually wanting to help you out with whatever problem you may have. Every time I call I can speak to someone, the over all experience has been great!"
Senior,5,"My time with the Everglades University online division has made my degree program an experience I will never forget. As a first time online student, I thought being a full-time Mom, owning my own business & my BS studies would've been easy, but EU helped make it easy to obtain & learn valuable information at my own pace. Not only did EU online provide me with what I needed but the instructors, especially Dr. Thompson, made the courses extra special by sharing their own wealth of knowledge."

Graduate Student,5,"After 3 years, I experienced the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I can honestly say... it’s a wonderful place to get a degree. I have learned SO much. The administration “shows” up when you do have a problem. The professors really seem to care whether we succeed or not. I graduated in May with a BS and did not hesitate to sign up for a Master’s a month later. 
I am so happy to be back! 
The work is challenging. And time flies... but it’s so worth it. How proud I am of my self! Plus, I started a really lucrative business! 
I love my school!"

I have had two teachers that have really taught me to exceed my own expectations of my work and that is Dr. Tortia and Dr. Trujillo-Botana.  I am excited to graduate this winter and move forward in the field of public health.
-Heidi Andersen"
Sophomore,5,"While having to take classes online since March, it has been a new experience and all the professors I have had have done a great job teaching us, using zoom once and Everglades Live for the rest of the classes, which are only a month-long"
Sophomore,5,"Going to Everglades University Orlando has been the best decision I made. I am in the Alternative Medicine program. The classes are small, the most students in a class I have had have been 10, which helps you to learn more.  The professors are all working in the field and are very knowledgeable and they want you to succeed. The rest of the faculty is awesome too and will help you in any way they can."
Junior,5,I've been doing online school since January of this year and has been an amazing experience. I was nervous as first but the professors made it easy to follow along.
Junior,5,Everglades university has been the best decision I have ever made. The professors are caring and knowledgeable. As well as the entire staff!

Freshman,5,"Awesome school love it! Please go and check them out and you will see what I mean. The professors are very good  and also very helpful. The school is small so it is like a family. 

Floreen Ritchie"
Senior,5,I have been an on-campus student until COVID hit. The instructors didn't miss a beat switching to Everglades Live. It only took a couple of minutes and we were all back to learning. The Orlando Campus instructors work with you to make sure you understand what you are learning and will spend the extra time if you ask them. I have enjoyed every one of the instructors that I have personally had.
Sophomore,5,"The Academics Service is fantastic, one of the best places I'd taken courses. The Online Services are also one of the biggest challenges we all have as students but yet we manage very easily to go by curriculum with out anyproblems what so ever, feels almost like if you are dreaming while on track for your goals. Is not easy to achive though, everything you must work very hard to but on the meanwhile everything is very pacetaking and full of good content. So do a good service for you and your peers and get off those pijamas and find something better to do with your life, cause on the long run the rewards that you and your folks can achieve if you ever thing about on doing something at Everglades University will really paid off."

Although it is a plethora of information, my professors have been extremely helpful and usually reach back within the day if I need help. Being an online student requires extreme discipline and focus, however it has connected me to plenty of colleagues and professionals in my field. The online division is perfect for those who like to work at their own pace or have to work from home."
Junior,5,"Everglades University has paved a way for scholars to excel in life, giving them the tools and education they need to be successful. Each faculty member and teacher has been extremely attentive and understanding when it comes to pursuing an education. They make the challenges of earning a degree online easier, bringing support and empathy to each of their students who want to make something of themselves."
Senior,5,Everglades University provides a safe and knowledgeable atmosphere for continued education in a variety of areas. The staff are prepared to help at a moment's notice. I am glad for the opportunity to be a part of this amazing experience.
Senior,5,Everglades University online offers a flexible opportunity to learn and further your own education. The professors are very knowledgeable and are prepared to guide the student.
Freshman,5,"Excellent institute, apex communication, onsite available instructors, a pious staff, and an awesome Dean. When your here it's like enrolling into a professional family. Each class feels like a breeze and living in Florida makes my education fun while in the sun. Online classes are very interactive and options to get books from the bookstore or use the app and access the online library is easily accessible. It's great to be in attendance with my peers who are the bright future of America. Due to the pandemic, I haven't had the courtesy to attend class on a physical Everglades campus due to the time of my enrollment from, yet prior reviews and a fellow combat veteran who attended a year and a half ago gave the campus two thumbs up. My expectations were set very high due to some past experiences with being enrolled in two other online campus schools who will remain nameless in this subject were fraudulent and yet here the values are set different I'm happy to be aboard."

Junior,5,"Everglades is a small university with alot to offer. Weather your into avionics, or medicine, the program and degrees are within reach. The financial.aid department is amazing. They call or email you to remind you of when payments are due, stipends go out, and help with book resources."
Junior,5,The class sizes are very small. The instructors take the necessary time needed to answer any and all questions.
Freshman,5,Great support from the student advisor. Great programs and excellente professors. I would like that we can have a green house.
Freshman,5,"Great awesome with the technical support Everytime I need to reset my password.the professor knows how to explain the way we navigate through the platform using our communication in the inbox , assignments and dropping off work and follow the course sillabus in order for me to obtain the highest grade, they help us to follow-up and go through."
Graduate Student,5,"While the online platform occasionally has issues, I do enjoy the blackboard platform and the easy links to do live classes without having to be in multiple programs."
Graduate Student,5,"The staff really care about you completing your degree. They call, email and text to check in on you! Most schools only call to remind you to pay them. Class sizes for the masters program seem small and I like that everyone moves through the classes together."
Senior,5,My overall experience with Everglades University has been amazing! The professors and staff really have made the academic experience wonderful from start to finish
Senior,5,Incredible experience! Took me 8 years for an AA and Everglades helped me focus! 10/10 would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone
Alum,4,"Before my decision of joining Everglades University, I was a college dropout with many years of management experience in the Service and Hospitality industry.  At first, I thought acquiring a Hospitality Management Degree made sense for me, but with the Dean's help I quickly realized a Business Degree would be more suitable for my aspirations!
Some of the most significant benefits in my time at Everglades University were the small classes with a flexible schedule, and how the coursework translated directly to the real world and everyday life.
Psychology, Speech, Writing, Critical Thinking, Ethics; these are just a few of the classes that made a tremendous impact on my personal life and also helped shape me into the best leader I can be. 
Thanks to Everglades University I now have a much stronger understanding of how Global Business  works [domestically and abroad], and I feel much more prepared to deal with the very difficult task of International Relationship Management."
Alum,4,"I didn't take any online classes, but I often did utilize BlackBoard. This is an incredible tool which I highly recommend all new or existing students to become accustomed to right away!"
Senior,4,"The format that Everglades offers gives working people and older adults returning to school the opportunity to complete their degree in a reasonable amount of time.  The typical small class size allows more direct interaction with your instructor.  This ""real world"" approach makes it easier to achieve our goals.  In my personal case, Everglades gave me a lot of credits from my previous college enrollments, saving me considerable time and money in the pursuit of my degree."
Junior,4,"The staff is great, many programs to choose from, a lot of awesome professors, and fresh new type of environment!  I enjoy being a part of a well put together school  =) Could definitely use more careers like in the Psychology and Criminal Justice fields; more assistance for tech issues and a few more rough edges that could be polished."
Graduate Student,4,"I have taken online courses during the COVID-19 school closure, it took me awhile to get accustomed to the blackboard.  My teacher has been very helpful and attentive to all questions and concerns along with the staff during this time of navigating online classes."
Senior,4,Everglades University - Orlando Campus has a wonderful staff and knowledgeable instructors. The financial aid person at this campus has been amazing by going above and beyond to not only help me with my Everglades aid but also spent the time to help me understand how to fill everything out for grad school...big shout out to Anthony! And the whole staff is available. I've never enjoyed school as much as I have by attending here.
Sophomore,4,"Going to school at Everglades university has been quite the experience. I really appreciate being able to take one class per month. Although the curriculum can be a challenge, being able to focus on one subject is really helpful. I also appreciate the very helpful office staff. If you have any issues they are usually helpful almost immediately (sometimes even without an appointment) :)"

Alum,4,"The B.S. in Aviation Management program was very thorough and thought provoking. The learning programs were great, but support as an alumni has been less than ideal. With all the online technology available, transcript requests are still done only by paper and it's almost impossible to talk to anyone when needing admin support for graduate recommendation letters and such."
Senior,4,The reason I choose Everglades University is for it’s flexible online division.  The program of alternative medicine gave me the opportunity to study different treatments outside of the norm.  The professors were professional and helpful whenever I needed them.  The online database was one resource that made a huge difference in researching topics for my program.
Graduate Student,4,"My experience with Everglades has been a very good one, there are few items that I wish could change, like more activities for the students on campus, better vending machine choices, labs would be excellent for those who need to have lab work done...but overall, the staff is amazing and the faculty is top notch"
Senior,4,"Evergades University, is an overall good school. In general, I liked Everglades University atmosphere.  The professors I had were very knowledgeable and helpful for the most part."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience at Everglades University was a positive one. Dean Yerk (dean during my 2 years completing my BS) was excellent, between her and the instructors/teachers it was a success. With their help and determination I was able to graduate with honors. Dr. Cynthia Orndoff was a other amazing instructor who helped me want to continue my education and move forward with my goals in Land Surveying. Dr. Ordnoff is a true leader. I am proud to say I was one of her students."
Senior,4,The on-line schedule Everglades has that rotates one course at a time on a monthly schedule allows students to focus on one course at a time without confusing material between courses. The staff is always very courteous and helpful. The on line blackboard is very user friendly and the library had an extensive amount of articles to perform research from.
Alum,4,I attended Everglades University Online. The coursework is challenging enough to keep you engaged and the professors and support staff are encouraging enough to keep students driven towards completion of a degree. I would strongly recommend someone to pursue a degree at Everglades University if they are looking for the online college experience and need the flexibility available unlike at traditional universities.
Niche User,4,"The online program allowed me to do the schoolwork after all my other duties, which was ideal for me."
Senior,4,I enjoyed the online program more than any other school experience I have had. The way the program is set up made it easy to manage being a full time student while also working full time. Each course ignited a new passion for learning and for continuing my education in Alternative Medicine. I look forward to being able to use my knowledge to help myself and others in the future.
Senior,4,"As a working Construction Manager, it is extremely convenient to be able to achieve my educational goals while gaining experience in the field.  I never thought the possibility of attaining a B.S. Degree and even the potential of a Master's Degree was attainable, but thanks to Everglades I can take my career to the next level.  Achieving my degree mid-career has been challenging, but with the online program Everglades allows students to be able to achieve goals at their own pace regardless of challenges that life brings. I have recommended Everglades as an option for my colleagues as they try to achieve their goals as well."
Graduate Student,4,Very good school. Graduating with a bachelors degree in construction management. Professors are very nice and educated. I spent half of my time in person and the other half of my degree online. The hours allow you to be very flexible. Classes are not super overwhelming. You have to learn at your own pace due to the classes being a month long.
Graduate Student,4,"If you want to really maximize your money spent, this is a great school to attend.  The classes are small so you are not lost in the crowd and the professors will push you to live up to your potential.  The administration staff is committed to student success and will meet with you after every class to go over how you are doing.  If you need help, there are plenty of resources available and other students are also willing to help.  I have received textbooks from students who completed a class I was getting ready to take and others who offered to study together if I was struggling.   Any issues I have had in the past with the school were immediately addressed and resolved in a professional and positive manner."
Graduate Student,4,"Choosing to go to school at Everglades University for a degree in Alternative Medicine made me find my true passion for what I want to do in life. My professors helped to help me find this passion and gave me the tools needed in order to be successful in my new career. Making the decision to go back to college, later in life, was a decision that I am proud of and glad that I made. Having a Bachelor's of Science in Alternative Medicine is a huge accomplishment, but you do need to have a direction or specialty that you will focus on in this area. This may include additional certifications or schooling needed in a specific area of alternative medicine, which will help you to further your success in your career."
Senior,4,Class pace is excellent for someone who is working full time and completing classes in the evening and on weekends.
Senior,4,"It was very interesting but good experience for a first time online student at everglades university. The staff, both administration and instructors are there to help the student all the time. Although the classes were challenging at times it was exactly what I expected from any college. I was push to limits that allow me to see my potential which allow me to learn and grow. I am now finish! I could not be any happier, I did it! This is all thanks to Everglades University for my success a reality. I'm so thankful that I chose Everglades University."
Junior,4,Great staff support and customer service. By far the best online school experience I have had. Would recommend to my other friends and family.
Senior,4,EU is a great option. I really like the month to month classes. Focusing on one class at a time has been easier for me.
Senior,4,"The ability to study on line and warm my degree has been great! Even though I am an on like student, I feel so connected to my class mattress and my professors. There are have a few incredible professors who made me feellike they were my biggest fans."
Senior,4,It is exactly how you expected an online degree to consist of. Lovely voices on the phone guiding my goals into fruition. Each course challenged my will to live yet gave me a greater sense of accomplishment when it was completed.
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed my experience at Everglades University working on my undergraduate and graduate degree. I think that the staff and faculty cared about me as a student.
Senior,4,"When I first got out of the military I was interested in building a career in alternative medicine. I found out that here in Tampa they have everglades university as well as a school for hypnotherapy so I pursued both school.  The time I spent at everglades was very informative and helpful in understanding the different fields of alternative medicine as well as how I could help myself as well as my family. The professors tend to be physicians in fields of alternative medicine and hold experience as well. Based on what I knew on hypnotherapy the staff allowed me to teach a short class on stress reduction and relaxation and it lead me to teach a class on hypnosis outside of the school. They have an inside herbal garden to grow herbs and many times they have potlucks after class. I felt a lot of support from my peers, the professors, and the administration staff in guiding me towards my career."
Senior,4,"I was extremely pleased with the enrollment process.  Regardless of how many ""bumps in the road"" that I encountered, my admissions counselor very patiently, yet thoroughly worked with me to alleviate every situation.

Considering each area of the enrollment process, I was assisted through each area to achieve satisfactory completion. 

There was nothing relating to the enrollment process that was not fully explained to me to my complete understanding."
Junior,4,"I have had an overall good experience with Everglades University.   The Dean and faculty has been very helpful, and the teachers, most are very knowledgeable.   If they see me getting behind, they do whatever needs to be done to get me back on track.  Classes are well formed, and for the most part, will look out for the students and their grades."
Senior,4,I truly enjoyed having the ability to work online. All the professors are competent and knowledgeable in the course material. The students are engaging and deliver diverse backgrounds and experience.
Junior,4,"What a great school to attend, the teachers are very knowledgeable and concerned with the progress of the student. I would suggest this school to anyone who wanted to find a great online university. I am a Construction Management student and I am glad I am attending this school. The icing on the cake is the accreditation it holds along with the school overall raking. Plus, the honors and ranking the Construction Management department has been given."
Junior,4,"I am extremely grateful for the opportunity this college has provided me with. I go to school completely online and am over the moon happy with my professors and classwork. The platform is very easy to use and your books are shipped right to your door. A few pitfalls they have is the communication with multiple persons throughout the counselors and financial aid divisions. Although it has these few problems, the online division has given me the ability to take care of my chronically ill girlfriend while getting my education at the same time!"
Sophomore,4,The school has great staff and the teachers are great and very helpful and accommodating. My only issue is that school is so expensive.
Recent Alumnus,4,Average amounts of internships and open jobs available through the school.
Recent Alumnus,4,Some professors may be lazy when it comes to grading and teaching but others are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,So far enrolling has been simple. I start my classes on July 25 so hopefully I can give more insight after that.
College Senior,4,"My school is unique due to the programs that are offered.  There aren't that many schools in the US let alone North America that provides a program for Complimentary and Alternative Medicines, even though it is a growing trend.  I like the fact that the professors are definitely experts and they are approachable, however, they are only approachable if you approach them.  A lot of them are not proactive with their students, but those who are deserve recognition.  If it weren't for these professors that actually showed they cared instead of being reserved I wouldn't be able to complete my degree."
College Sophomore,4,My professors interact with us and are their to help with any questions we have.
Recent Alumnus,4,It only made me take one class at a time if I needed help they were there even when I did not know I needed help.
College Sophomore,4,"I have very  much enjoyed Everglades University. They support our every changing world by offering courses that are different like Alternative energy and Alternative Medicine. I take online course which are only presented one at a time so I never have to jumble subjects. The assignments are presented well and I never feel like I have more to do than I can handle which I am amazed by because I have a 2 year old. They really respect that in these days most college students must work and other responsibilities. I am happy with my choice, look forward to my next courses, and would absolutely recommend Everglades University."
Recent Alumnus,4,There were always somewhere to go.
Recent Alumnus,4,It was a house party
Recent Alumnus,4,Surrounded by like-minded individuals in my classes and field. The instructors are practicing in their fields as well as teaching.
Recent Alumnus,4,Even though I have to do a lot of communicating online and over the phone it is a smooth process.
Recent Alumnus,4,Efficient when one is short on time.
College Sophomore,4,I take online courses so this dose not apply to me.
College Sophomore,4,"I take online courses, so I am not at the campus."
College Junior,4,the local atmosphere is great for shopping and dining and the safety is a plus in the are
College Junior,4,the library is small and very quiet at all times to get your assignments done.  the librarian is very helpful
College Junior,4,the computers are readily available to all students at any time.  printing on campus is complementary to students.  network speed can use some improvements. wireless access is great.
College Junior,4,So far everything I have had to do went very well and they where very helpful so as of this point I would say I would use this school again
College Junior,4,I am happy with the program and all the classes that I have
College Junior,4,It is 60 and all the snow is melting away finaly

College Student,4,I am getting a well rounded education.
College Student,4,There are lots of things to do.
College Freshman,4,The computers are great and the network as well. The only problem I have is that at times the internet can be slow but usually extremely well.
College Senior,4,"The classes for the Alternative Medicine program are very well rounded. So far we have covered nutrition, an intro to Chiropractic, Kineseology, anatomy, as well as the basic classes (which, personally, I found redundant from high school, but understand they are necessary). I am excited to experience my future classes."
Graduate Student,2,When I first started going to school I had the option of going to school online and in person. My choice was in person...I like the one on one experience with the teachers but the professors can give you their point of view and their own opinions.  I like the fact that the stuff knew me by name and when I had an issue with something they always handled it for me. When covid-19 hit I had to switch to online class which was a challenge learning online . It was never for me and I had a hard time teaching myself.
Senior,2,"This was an average experience.  Most of my professors had a 3rd grade knowledge of the English language.  Communication was difficult. Most professors were not present in the learning experience.  I basically taught myself everything.  The schedule is so rushed, it is next to impossible to retain any information.  At 600+ dollars a credit hour you would think you are getting a Harvard degree not a community college at best degree.  The turn over is ridiculous.  I have had 3-4 different people I have dealt with in a 2 year period, and no one seems to know what the other did.  Without question, I will not be recommending EU to anyone."
College Sophomore,2,I was horrible to be on campus so I changed my degree so I can take online classes and be home.
College Senior,2,There is no dining facilities
College Student,2,"I have been to other schools, and this one is the worst I have seen."
College Student,2,"Some of the teachers seem to care for their students. The higher-up`s probable not so much. It seems they care about money, not the students. "
College Student,2,i have seen better at other schools.
Niche User,1,"Do not attend this college. Their accreditation aside, Everglades is a complete insult to the many hard-working students out there pursuing a recognizable and worthy degree. Every test was open book with a time allowance that far exceeded that which was necessary to complete said test. You could go through the program never once cracking the book, do the very minimal discussion work, and take their mediocre exam and make straight A's. Let's be honest guys, as difficult as college can be at times... No one wants this. Why not just pay for a degree and call it a day? I eventually wrote a long letter to upper division faculty and was point blank in my accusations. I told them they should be ashamed to put themselves in the same ball park as well respected tenured teaching professionals across the globe."
College Senior,1,it is pain in the ass
College Senior,1,The lynx bus transportation is the worst possible bus ever.
College Student,1,All they have is a snack machine.

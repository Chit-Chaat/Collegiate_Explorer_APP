Sophomore,5,"My experience at college of central Florida was amazing. My first time trying to go to college I didn’t really have my head on tight at all so I gave up . The second time around , the staff at the school helped me so much to make sure that I had what I needed to start classes . Also , they helped me to stay strong through the semester because in order to continue going to school I had to have good grades in order to past the classes and receive the credits . From academics to financial aid to the admissions office helped me to get myself today . I am very appreciative of college of central Florida. There is absolutely nothing I would like to see change right now except us going back to the school instead of doing online because of COVID-19."
Sophomore,5,"Yes , I took two classes online in Fall 2019 .. the professors made the program and learning process a great thing to use because they were they every step of the way . If I didn’t understand something , which happened a lot , they didn’t mind getting on video chat and explaining it . No matter if the whole entire class was on the video chat , if you needed help individually then you got that and that’s what I loved the most . Not only that , but I felt how they had everything set up for us to learn it was the most easiest way to learn the subject we where on . All in all it was amazing"

I graduated with my AS degree in 2016 and I am now in a bachelors program currently. I appreciate everything they have done to help me go back to college after all these years."
Graduate Student,5,"The experience that I had with this college was great. The administration will work with you on any questions you may have on classes you are interested in.

Some instructors may give you their number to get in contact with them other not so good. So if you are trying to further your education College of Central Florida is the place."

."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I had a great experience at CCF. It is a very friendly place, great to work with if you have kids or have a low budget to getting a degree, it is a place that fits for you."
College Junior,5,"Very clean facility and very helpful staff. When me and my mother were lost on the campus a professor went out of his way to help us all the way until we made it to the admissions office. He was very kind and very helpful, and gave us his email for any further questions. The people working in the admissions office were also very kind and very helpful.

My experience with the staff is wonderful and they have all been very helpful to me and my mother."
College Junior,5,"The application process is simple and quite easy to understand. Accessing the application was a tad challenging, but once you are showed how to access it then you don't require much effort to get there yourself.

Sophomore,4,"My online experience was very good, most of the teachers that I had online responded very quickly to my emails. So.me it took a few days but they did reply back to me.

Senior,4,"I have been attending CF for 4 years, I haven’t had any major problems except with financial conflicts but over the years, I learned that CF is really diverse and a welcoming environment to all, and opportunities are always available and the teachers and staff are hard working and kind."

This is a great start if you are looking to transfer from a community college to a university. They offer a variety of majors with most professors willing to teach.
Freshman,4,"Most classes at the College of Central Florida can be easily taken online. The only ones that may be difficult, are the ones not intended to be online. Due to Covid-19 all classes had to be shifted online.  In the summer semester I am currently taking a Biology lab which is different because all of the labs intended to be hands on are in a simulation. It is a good alternative but can be discouraging for some students."
Niche User,4,The online experience was great but I prefer being on the campus. Some of my friends have said that they have really enjoyed their online experience
Alum,4,"In the transition from face-to-face to online, the school was on the ball with what to do in crisis. Teachers were wonderful communicators, and administration was constantly helpful and supportive. The campus was calm and clean, classrooms were small and gave way for interactive learning and close student-teacher relationships."
Sophomore,4,There were several professors that made online classes worthwhile but sadly it took an epidemic for them to update protocols.
Sophomore,4,some professor are really good and I feel like I am more prepare for university. The  environment in the college is nice. I fell like any question I have the college will help me whether is in the material or my plans after I graduate.  Professor are helpful especially when I have question before the exams in their office ours they make me feel welcome to ask them any question.
Sophomore,4,"Nice little community college, was a good transition from high school to small town college to big University. Could use some more diversity and offer more bachelor degrees in future."
Sophomore,4,The online classes were mostly adaptable especially going through these rough times. It's understandable it had a rough start because this was all new and thrown at us. They did a pretty good job the professors. Was hard because I had hard classes that was different from one on one lectures.
Sophomore,4,"I'm pretty happy with the school, I don't have anything I want to change. I'm not a party person, but there are always activities to do on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I've attended this university for my AA (Freshmen and Sophomore year). Overall the teacher and classes were exceptional. Whenever i had a problem, there were resources readily available for me resolve it. My favorite part of the campus was the library. I spent the majority of my time there studying in the private rooms. It provided a quiet and safe environment to work on homework or study for an upcoming test or speech. All the staff and teachers were nice and are caring of you academic pursuits. I would recommend this college to anyone."
Sophomore,4,The College of Central Florida has a great college environment. There are always fun activities happening all around campus.
Alum,4,"A very inexpensive, nice college. The professors are all accommodating, nice, and I learned a lot here."
Sophomore,4,Very good selection of expert professors on hand. Student activities vary so there’s a little something for everyone. Free tutoring and counseling are provided through the school and not many people take advantage of that. Use them!
Junior,4,This college has a lot of great opportunities. The professors are great and are always there to help. Campus is close to a lot of great things in the city such as the mall and the movies. The resources are amazing and available to every student.
Alum,4,"Very diverse, great teachers, there is on hand tutoring available so there is no room for failure. Teachers care about the students and want all students to pass and succeed in their classes. Financial aid is there to help answer any questions that you have about assistance."
Niche User,4,Teachers were generally very nice. Academic advisors super easy to talk to and were very understanding.
Freshman,4,I am recently just starting college here but I like it very much so far. All my teachers have been very helpful and admitting myself into the college was not too difficult. The staff was clear on giving me instructions.
Freshman,4,The college of central Florida is a very nice local campus located in the middle of town close to all amenities. The campus is very clean and easy to navigate. There is something for everyone here. Faculty is very friendly and helpful however sometimes communication is a little below par. all and all this school is very nice and i would recommend anyone to apply and try out this school!
Sophomore,4,"I am in the distance learning program, which I enjoy. This allows you to participate in the college from any state, and since I am a military kid in the process of moving to Florida, it was great to have an option that I could start right away. Since I am off campus, I cannot speak to the facilities, but I will say getting enrolled in the program is difficult. I have run into a lot of little complications throughout the way trying to transfer old classes and schedule new ones, but my adviser and the school staff were very helpful. I think any transfer process is difficult, but make sure you speak up strongly for what you want!"
Sophomore,4,I like most things about this school. The teachers offer help and are very willing to help when needed. Something that I would like to see change is to have more options when it comes to teachers when it comes to higher level classes and offer more classes for pre-reqs for students looking to transfer.
Sophomore,4,Easy Acceptance. Direct link to UCF or USF once you complete your Associates. Small Class size with easy to navigate online classes.
Graduate Student,4,"My overall experience at CF was good. As freshmen it was a little rough trying to find classes but once you learn the campus their not hard to find. Most of the professor is wonderful and willing to help you and give you the tools needed to pass their class. A few negatives are that you have to buy all your test necessities like scantrons, the writing test booklet and so on plus, say you apply for a certain program after graduating there's a waiting list you're put on and a point system that they use to accept students into that program."
Freshman,4,"The professors I have had are amazing. They love to see you succeed, I had Mrs. Floyd and Dr. Colleli they are both amazing professors."
Sophomore,4,"I am a student at West Port High School and also a Dual Enrollment at College of Central Florida. I take classes at the school and I must say that the college is tremendous. I think personally it is one of the best community colleges in Florida, and it the environment is wonderful. It is very peaceful and the surroundings is kept clean. The professors, try their best to teach at the student's learning style and they are always open to give extra help. I am not really a party person but I heard their parties are great. I would say student life is a good 10/10."
Junior,4,"The vast majority of the professors at CF are very knowledgeable in their fields, helpful, and make themselves available.  The College of Central Florida is a small community college in a small city, there are both pros and cons to this. One of the pros is that classes are smaller, which makes them more personal and allows for room to have a closer relationship with both professors and students. One of the cons is that it lacks in the local area, ""party scene"", and student life areas."
Sophomore,4,I loved the small classes and all of the professors are there to help you every step of the way. The only down side is that they don’t offer certain majors and programs.
Freshman,4,College of Central Florida has engaging professors who will always try to help you. The city of Ocala does not offer much to do on your free time but Orlando and Daytona beach is just one hour away. CF was a great experience to start my freshman year.
Sophomore,4,I like that the teachers are really friendly. I would like if more classes of my major would be offer year round. I will not be graduating this May with my associate (like I plan to) because my classes are not offered year round. If I missed it the semester it is offered it is not offered the next semester. It is making it hard for me to graduate on time.
Graduate Student,4,"College of Central Florida was a great college because it was a low cost college, near by home and excellent faculty. I started college in CF because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life after high school and my advisor and some of my professors help me a lot in the process of becoming on something that i really wanted to be. I would recommend CF to anyone that does not know where to start from."
Freshman,4,College of Central Florida offers great programs and have well educated professors. The dual enrollment program helps a lot with kids that want to get a head start on college credits. They have 3 campuses that are located in 3 different counties that allow a variety of students to attend.
Freshman,4,Central Florida community college is nice because the classroom sizes are smaller so you have more one on one time with teachers.
Alum,4,"College of Central Florida offers a feeling of togetherness that could be found at some of your bigger, or more funded, universities! Through the academics, athletics, and variety of clubs, Central Florida provides a really nice atmosphere for people looking to further their education. The school as a whole remains very helpful with any issues, or concerns, regarding different topics that could possibly hinder you academically. I"
Sophomore,4,The classes are smaller which enables a more individualized setting. The professors I've had in the past were not very keen on updating Canvas applications to allow students to stay on top of assignments.
Sophomore,4,Wonderful advisers and professors that are there to help every step of the way. Classes are well organized and integrates technology within assignments and projects. The campus is clean and strives for pleasant environment to study even when not inside a classroom.
Niche User,4,"College of Central Florida has a lot of programs and the staff are friendly. When you walk onto the campus you will notice a tower, like Big Ben. I was astonished when I saw this, it literally felt like I was in a different state, the atmosphere is calming and not stressful at all!"
Sophomore,4,"I love everything about the College of Central Florida. I joined the Student Activities Board. This allowed me to come out of my shell and interact with more students on campus. While interacting with all the students, this allowed me to gain knowledge about what was perceived as ""good"" and ""needs work"" on campus. I would try to change the amount of lighting on campus for night classes. There are alleyways that are really dark and it goes on for a few feet. Students are nervous about taking that route after their night classes."
Sophomore,4,"I like attending CF; I only attended internet classes and all the staff I spoke with our experienced in person were friendly and helpful. I hated trying to reach them by phone though, because the reception staff were however somewhat rude. Financial aid, of course, like all jc's was always packed."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at CF has been well worth the money. I've made a lot of new friends, my professors genuinely care about my well being and progress. They are really interested in seeing you succeed. The only thing I'd like to see change is some of the academic advising strategies. I feel like I don't get clear answers and my current advisor does not help me, he tells me to find the answers on the CF website and blatantly is not interested in my path."
Junior,4,I absolutely love the small classrooms because it allows students to better communicate and spend one on one time with the professors.
Senior,4,They are the most affordable school in Florida yet with very high standards build great professionals!. (Their phone lines are not the most available)
Sophomore,4,"I was a duel enrollment student attending Cf.  Once I actually started going to classes on campus the summer of 2017, i absolutely enjoyed it. The professors are great and explain the material very well. The campus is always clean and always being cleaned. The students there are like no other. Coming from literally all over the world to better their education. They are super friendly and it's easy to make great friends here. Over all i would recommend attending Cf to anyone wating to continue or start working towards their future career."
Junior,4,Nice college with small classes so the teaching is more personal.  Most of the teachers are really approachable and understanding if you need extra help.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see more classes offered at the Citrus Campus, specifically language courses. The Ocala campus is such a long drive, and I would have liked to not waste so much gas.
Also, I would advise that no one take Professor Jaye, my friends and I have taken his classes, and we've learned so little that I don't even know what we were supposed to be learning."
Sophomore,4,"My name is Elizabeth Ocasio and I am a sophomore at the College of Central Florida. I have enjoyed my experiences as a student at the College of Central Florida so fa, However, I feel like there can be improvements. The first improvement should be within our professors, I have had some professors that are very unorganized, this can make it hard to do well in a class that is not structured. The second improvement that I suggest is to have more places to study. Our Library only has 4 study rooms for groups and often times, they are all taken up. Other than those two issues, the school itself has a beautiful campus, the people are friendly. Overall, the school has a good vibe and is a lovely place to attend."
Junior,4,"The professor that this college are great and are always willing to go the extra step in helping their students. The staff that run this college do lack some communication and many documents get lost or misplaced, which causes things to run very slowly and unorderly. But with the advising staff that I have encountered, they are always very kind and really try to help you achieve your goals."
Freshman,4,Admission offices are very helpful and kind with everybody. They take more than the necessary steps to insure that you're choosing the right study/career path for you.
Sophomore,4,It was a pretty great experience! The advisers were easy to talk to and get in touch with. Most of the professors were available during their given office ours. The school uses Canvas which is a great tool to help with organization and getting all your work in on time. The only drawback would be the availability of the courses you want to take. The school is small but is services a pretty large area of students so classes fill quickly.
Alum,4,The faculty is what makes the experience at this college so nice. Students and peers are mostly very friendly and the courses are thorough yet efficient. A very great college to get your AA degree!
Freshman,4,Their credit hours are cheap. They have great teachers. I would like it if they had better communication.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I really like it here. This is a great school to get started at and transfer to a later university. Most of the teachers are kind,welcoming, and flexible with students. However, there is some professors whose teaching tactics are a bit questionable."
Sophomore,4,"So Far so good, I am a month into my classes and I feel like I am learning and retaining information. The Financial Aid dept. helped me with earning a scholarship that has been very helpful to my continuing to attend school. The academic advisor I have isn't my favorite- his name is Chad, he makes me feel uncomfortable and wasn't the most helpful with trying to figure out my schedule- I had to figure out a graduation plan for myself. I am going to look into talking with someone else in the future. They have a lot of great clubs and involvement opportunities, and a great transfer rate into UF."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are very helpful with giving you all the information on their class that is needed such as books, dates that are important ect.  The advisers to their best to help you in every way they can."
Alum,4,"My time at the College of Central Florida was a delightful, eye-opening experience that I feel helped shape who I am as a person. The local life is pretty lively, the campus is always kept clean, and the campus food was decent for the price you paid. "
College Freshman,4,Worldly and alot of subjects
College Freshman,4,College of Central Florida is a pretty laid back school with endless possibilities. Everything is placed in one spot to it's easy to know where everything is at efficiently.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are excellent and very helpful
Sophomore,2,"Overall, staff is neglectful and careless. They communicate very poorly with students, especially new ones who have no idea what they need to do and are looking for guidance."
Sophomore,2,"The College of Central Florida for some reason feels like it is okay to put a severe mark on struggling students credit scores by charging  over 2 grand for failing a class.

 Don't have a way to get the funds? Not only are you no longer able to pursue a higher learning, you now have a credit score slasher keeping you from bettering yourself by robbing you of any possible opportunities. 

There are people who simply can't recover from such a hit. You are single handedly destroying these kids dreams and it breaks my heart to watch..."
Junior,2,"While the school is one of the cheapest in the nation, well that's pretty much all it has going for it. There are a few good teachers, but everyone knows who they are and their classes fill up on the first day of registration. The bookstore is more overpriced than some universities and if it wasn't for things like Amazon Rentals or Chegg, I would have gone bankrupt just buying textbooks."
College Sophomore,2,"You will have several bad experiences and it will not be your fault. You won't fail, but many professors have terrible attitudes and are old."
College Junior,2,I have not found any.
Recent Alumnus,2,"While some of the professors are outstanding, others are unprofessional and realizing that students of the school are still students outside of school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Truly disappointed with this school. The advisors are over worked and therefore can't care for the individual student, this leads to problems at higher levels because students are constantly trying to get help with little to no avail. I also work at a restaurant near the school and was made very uncomfortable when one of the much older professors (someone I'm supposed to trust and feel comfortable/safe around) tried to overstep his bounds. Very disappointed with the people that work here."
College Senior,2,"It's a huge headache, but you do get things done, (eventually)."
College Senior,2,"Some professors care so much and they're everything you want from a teacher, and some seem like they are sent from Hell to destroy you and your GPA. They're mean and don't care about you or your grades. How they teach is SO poor and you don't even follow, and therefore have to spend most of your time in tutoring or in front of a computer for HOURS."
College Senior,2,"Everything is due back to back and it's much harder. The teacher is just a name, you never meet or see them, and they don't really try to help you."
College Senior,2,There are no internships at this school and the employers in Math department seem unwilling to hire non work study students.
College Senior,2,Some students see Asians as outsiders and I don't feel welcomed at all.
College Senior,2,I think that students who are waiting for financial aid are a bit desperate.
College Senior,2,"As a community college, the career center only provides job information in Ocala."
College Freshman,2,they try their best to keep you from graduating
College Freshman,2,it can be a lot better
College Sophomore,2,The internet connection doesn't reach everywhere unless they have recently fixed it. They have pleant of computers available.
College Freshman,2,"We don't have much to our school. We have a pretty good baseball and basketball team, other than that CF is a pretty basic school."
College Senior,2,It's pretty much like other schools. There's really nothing unique about it.
College Sophomore,2,The professors try to teach to much in a class period and expect everyone to understand and to keep up.
College Sophomore,2,The printers are always needing fixing I had to go to a print shop just in order to be able to hand in  my paper
College Sophomore,2,"While the school is close to home, academicly there isn't a lot offered. I would like to be the top and do the best I have ever done in my educational career and I can't do that there so I don't really like the experience I have at this school."
College Sophomore,2,Good looking school yet there is not much to offer. Housing is off campus. There is no on campus housing so there is no control over what the students are doing.
College Sophomore,2,There are mostly certificate and AA degree program if you would like to complete a program like Business you need to transfer to a different school. They tend to lose important documents and some professors are unprofessional. There are no wide range of professors that there would be a large amount of classes would be found making it hard for students who need those classes can't do so.
College Sophomore,2,"Quick pace, lack of internet for students to access in order to complete any assignments needed. The school would like for students to utilizes their e books yet the WiFi there is awful and appalling "
College Sophomore,2,Can't access any past assignments. If a student would like to bring their grades up you can't redo or at least get some extra assignments to do so
College Sophomore,2,There are some scholarships that I applied at the school for that I did not receive.
College Junior,2,The school has been good.
College Junior,2,They are okay the students cannot really use the gym and most of the facilities are small. 
College Sophomore,2,"Being a Biology major at CF is adequate. They have basic required courses, but I want to specialize in Marine Biology, where only Oceanography is offered here at CF, so it can be a little challenging to  complete pre-reqs for other colleges I plan to transfer to."
College Sophomore,2,Hard to reach. Advisors seem to be pestered by you
College Sophomore,2,On par. Most buildings are about 5-10 years old
College Junior,2,The salon looks very impressive when you first walk in
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of computers and internet and printers as well as a library
College Sophomore,2,Its okay not the best the people arent that nice because they can be snobby and the teachers are weird.
College Sophomore,2,Normal classes along with a few nice special ones.
College Sophomore,2,It is average not much to it. Have to take general courses first.
College Sophomore,2,The workers do not help but the teachers are ok.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is where I, and many others, have had a problem. The financial aid and pay services employees haven't been trained properly. They aren't able to answer any questions and don't know anything other than the typical student. One of my classes failed to get dropped and they transferred it over to another class. This wouldn't have been a big deal if advising and financial aid hadn't of told me that I had to pay no matter who's fault."
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of computers for students to use. They have trouble with the network. One time during Exam week the computers were down for five hours. When you are online the network will say that you are not connected  when you have been on for an hour or two.
Sophomore,1,"Terrible email system. Don't expect anyone to respond unless you're paying out of pocket. If you're a grant student, expect to get your financial aid screwed up in the middle of your semester so that you have no choice but to come up with money to pay $2,000 for classes, since it's past the deadline to drop. 
Great professors. Terrible otherwise. 
Better off attending Santa Fe or Rasmussen."
College Freshman,1,they teach you really demotivating subjects like EAP
College Sophomore,1,It is merely impossible to get access to the network because there is a traffic jam. 
College Sophomore,1,No wide range of courses. Difficult to find advisor because there is only one for  AA degrees and a handful of students waiting to be seen. Sometime they don't even see at all until it is almost to late.
College Sophomore,1,Online classes offer little help or communication from the teacher.
College Junior,1,Absolutely none. You have to rearrange my life
College Junior,1,I would never go back.
College Junior,1,I didnt learn the most basic of skills. No help from teachers.
College Junior,1,"Its over-priced and def not worth it. I recieved some financial aid, but when I got a statement, there were hidden ""tuition fees"" that werent in my contract to get more money from fafsa, and I never saw the extra money they got from them."
College Junior,1,"No placement or help, most people I graduated with ended up at Sports Clips and Fantastic Sams. With expectations of top salons."
College Junior,1,"They'll accept anyone who applys with the illusion of being exclusive, Most of them are insecure and quiet"
College Junior,1,"Small student lounge, Too crowded to eat in, Parking lot is always crowded."
College Sophomore,1,There isnt much to it. Nothing really amazing or interesting
College Sophomore,1,My financial aid has still not arrived and its months after school has started
College Sophomore,1,The school collaborates with CTAE to help keep students on the right track with the right technology
College Sophomore,1,Not really that great they can be kind of snobby.  
College Sophomore,1,they would not let metake out a loan only because I have extended hours.  when You have an ex-husband that beat you almost to death i had to quit college in 199? because i could not take it anymore.  most of credits transferred from other colleges but i had to write a request why i have extended hours....it seems i was punished because i had to leave an abusive husband
College Senior,1,"i feel like the teachers dont really care that much about how is in their class their just doing it to collect a check, and a lot of the course work isnt set up in a fashion that is realistic to reguler class schedual"
College Junior,1,"i see no advertisment for academic programs.
i rarely see anyone around but sitting"
College Junior,1,"the computers are very old styled, they need to update.
the printing cards on campus are to expensive i think."

Alum,5,Loved everything about my experience. Education was top-notch and student life was amazing. I came to love the surrounding area.
Alum,5,"Professors were fantastic. Course expectations were very high, and students can be competitive, but overall lends to a robust education."
Alum,5,"I graduated before the era of online classes. Curious how they're doing it now. I have heard good things, but it also isn't my place to say anything about that now is it?"
Alum,5,"In terms of colleges, Whitman really is the true hidden gem of the Pacific Northwest. I think it should be on the list for all prospective students who prioritize a strong undergraduate experience paired with a close knit college community. 

The average student here is not only seriously devoted to their academics, but also unusually well rounded. The location of Walla Walla is a hard sell for anyone who isn't into the idea of a rural college, but many students end up surprised at how much they like the area by the time they graduate. The same sentiment seems to go for those who come into Whitman uncertain if its the right experience for them. Whitman sometimes feel as though it flies notoriously under the radar, but many who make up the school seem okay with, or maybe even enjoy, that aspect of it."
Alum,5,"I transferred into Whitman my junior year and was really happy with my experience. Despite Whitman's recognition, I feel it should be even more recognized and that the school could go toe to toe with any other liberal arts school out there. I found virtually every professor to be great and caring, there to be a really motivated and nice student body, and that I was really challenged in my schoolwork."
Alum,5,I graduated before the coronapocalypse - never took any online courses from Whitman. But this form is making me fill out this answer box to submit so here I am doing so.
Freshman,5,"Such a great school. The students are passionate and care about what they do, but they aren't competitive or pretentious. It's a great social atmosphere with incredible educational opportunities."
Niche User,5,"From what I have experienced from Whitman, the school is passionate about helping its students and provides countless opportunities to do so."
Alum,5,I got a top-notch education that prepared me intellectually and socially for successful and fulfilling adult life.
Freshman,5,"Finding a job on campus is nice, so is all facukty staff, and a lot of decent people here. I like the variety in food and flex is good amount here. Nice small campus with nice understanding Professors."
Freshman,5,"Whitman College has been pretty amazing so far. The place has amazing views and the food is fantastic. A new dining hall just opened in 2019 and it has everything from a sushi bar to grill station. The professors are patient and really nice, almost too nice. They would answer every single question no matter how stupid it is. The student body was is really supportive but it is a college so expect the normal mix of the popular and party people."
Alum,5,"I received an amazing education in a challenging but supportive academic environment.  Professors are accessible and committed to student growth.  As a student from an unprivileged background, Whitman opened many doors for me.  I also met numerous lifelong friends who live all over the world and are successful in their chosen fields.  Whitman has a beautiful campus with numerous outdoor adventures nearby.  But if you seek big city setting, Whitman is probably not for you."
Alum,5,"Great stepping stone to graduate school. Brothers in my fraternity went on to study at UCLA, Yale, UW, Stanford, and Harvard. Top notch professors who challenge and provide individual attention. One of the best liberal arts colleges in the West with the added bonus of a laid back academic environment and very friendly student body."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy all of the programs and have not been dissatisfied with a class thus far. I do think it is important that they begin to emphasize student mental health.
Freshman,5,Whitman College is a great liberal arts college and honestly a hidden gem. Students here are extremely academically motivated and smart but also community driven and not competitive. Feels of a East Coast college but in the beautiful Pacific Northwest!!!!!
Freshman,5,Excellent Campus. Very friendly people. Interesting and Knowledgeable professors.  Whitman has an abundance of clubs and sports to choose from. Dorms are better than most universities and the food is very satisfactory.
Alum,5,"You can do everything at Whitman- academics, leadership, hobbies. The small classroom environment guarantees your learning will be engaged and hands-on alongside your professors- they talk *with* you, not at you."
Freshman,5,Whitman has provided me with a lot of resources in order to further my academic career. The people are extremely friendly and the environment in itself is gorgeous. The professors are very involved and passionate about what they teach and are always there for your needs. Many other resources are available along with countless amounts of extra curriculars which anyone can partake in.
Niche User,5,I just took a recruit trip to Whitman and I loved it. Everyone is unbelievably welcoming and the campus is gorgeous- can't wait to be apart of the community!
Freshman,5,"Whitman College is truly amazing. I am impressed every day with the quality of the professors, the sense of community on campus, and the scenic surroundings. I have made some really great friends that I know will be life-long connections. My first year here has been great, and I am looking forward to my sophomore year. 
There is truly not much I would change, except perhaps increasing number of shuttles to the airport in Pasco."
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience so far at Whitman and it is everything that I hoped it would be.  The friendly vibe of the student body is great and does an awesome job of making Whitman a great tight knit community.
College Freshman,5,Greeks are surprisingly friendly and inviting
College Freshman,5,"Walla walla may suck, but I'm never bored."
College Freshman,5,Sense of community is prevalent in all residence halls.
College Freshman,5,"Greek life advantages (e.g. Great network) without its disadvantages (Frat boy image, irresponsible partying)"
College Freshman,5,"Wonderful small town, beautiful campus, and a great bunch of students, faculty and staff."
College Freshman,5,I love Whitman College. The professors not only care about you but also want to see you succeed. Whitman could work on the variety of courses and majors/minors offered. There is still a lot to choose from to study though. Everyone is accepting of each other and the student body is full of humble and kind students.
College Freshman,5,There is the iEngage program which allows you to apply for jobs post graduation to many companies around the U.S. Whitman makes the transition go smoother. There are several job and internship opportunities on campus that are announced through very frequent emails and bulletin boards all over campus.
College Freshman,5,There are many talks about consent and sexual violence that all freshmen have to go through during orientation. There are several clubs on campus that support the prevention of sexual violence. There is even the green dot initiative and an app created by students where students can request help at anytime they need it. I feel very safe on this campus because everyone cares about each other.
College Freshman,5,"Whitman College is filled with hardworking, humble studnets"
Recent Alumnus,5,Many resources available for career planning
Recent Alumnus,5,Could not have had a better college experience
Recent Alumnus,5,"On campus is very safe, off campus can be sketchy"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Very clean and laid-back, good community"
Recent Alumnus,5,One of the best parts of my college experience!
Recent Alumnus,5,The best community of people and great academics!
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is an escape from the Whitman bubble
College Sophomore,5,Their gym is as nice as a D-1 athletic program
College Sophomore,5,"Very kind people at health center, open at all times."
College Sophomore,5,Fairly easy to get into classes. Professors really care about the students.
College Sophomore,5,They do a really good job of putting you in the right dorm
College Sophomore,5,Tend to be pretty cool people.
College Sophomore,5,The people are extremely friendly!
College Freshman,5,"Campus crime is not very prevalent on Whitman's campus. Generally, most students feel very safe on campus at all times as there are excellent services in place that are ready and willing to help when necessary. Whitman stresses their intolerance for sexual assault very intensely and most students as first years are quickly introduced to the campus's sexual assault awareness policy."
College Freshman,5,"Whitman College is an amazing school. Every student here is incredibly nice and so like-minded to myself. The campus is beautiful and small enough that it's impossible for any student to feel lost or small. Although restricted in areas of study, Whitman College does an excellent job of insuring that their students are generally educated well and a brought up to date on topics that are of extreme global importance."
College Freshman,5,Very white campus but accepting of minorities
College Freshman,5,They teach safety not prohibition
College Freshman,5,Sexual assault prevention is HUGE here
College Freshman,5,Didn't go greek but I still have a ton of fun
College Freshman,5,Whitman students are truly the happiest students
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus and don't know anyone who has had negative experiences regarding safety.
College Sophomore,5,Classes are challenging but not unreasonable. Professors are really interested in their subjects and very knowledgable. They are also very willing to get to know students and help them outside of class.
College Freshman,5,Whitman is very supportive and has a lot of resources for students
College Freshman,5,"It's great place to be, filled with an amazing cohort of people."
College Sophomore,5,My experience has been incredible in my first year. I love the support from faculty I receive on a daily basis and how tight-knit the community is. My school keeps the students the happiest year round which is amazing. I would choose my school again in a heartbeat because it just feels right for me to be there.
College Sophomore,5,"Whitman is a great place for me. I feel very at home here and have met so many smart, interesting, like-minded people. I loved attending it my first year and am so excited to go back in the fall."
College Sophomore,5,an incredibly beautiful campus that is easy to walk with lots of great places to socialize or study
College Sophomore,5,Whitman is a very safe school; and the small number of students and the fact that most students know each other really decreases the chance of sexual assault.
College Freshman,5,"I love the classes at Whitman, they are interesting and often succeed in getting me more interested in the topic than I was before. The professors that I have had classes from are incredible. I had fairly mediocre classes in high school so in comparison these professors are wonderful. I actually didn't know that professors could be so good. They're passionate about what they teach and they can explain their subject in clear and interesting ways. The class sizes are small, usually 12-15 students and questions are always answered. Office hours are available too if there are further questions. I do wish that there was a greater variety of courses offered, and many times there will be courses that I want to take but they've been canceled which is always disappointing."
College Freshman,5,"No matter your major, you're going to be challenged both intellectually and with a heavy workload."
Sophomore,4,I  like going to Whitman College but there's not enough diversity there. I feel as though the school could give a lot more resources and support to the people of color on this campus. The school doesn't handle people of color issues on campus very well and could do a much better job.
Sophomore,4,"For the most part, the academics are solid at Whitman and if the effort is put in, you will come away feeling like you learned plenty. All around the social life is pretty good, and there are different people, but, there is a lack of diversity and you will see mostly white people on campus. Alongside that, there tends to be a lack of political action. Overall Whitman is a great place to be as it is a relaxed community, and the academics are challenging."
Senior,4,Whitman is an academically rigorous institution although it varies between departments. Some professors are really great and some are so-so but I imagine you would find that at any institutions. Residence life/housing is really good and the food is pretty good as well and healthy. You can be very involved with the local community or not involved at all depending on what you choose.
Freshman,4,I have just started my process with them so far so amazing. I enjoy the campus and can't wait to start this fall. They offer many opportunities and put lots of money in for lower middle class students. I wish there was more mainstream things like Walmart closer to campus but it's good.
Freshman,4,"The academic side of the school is pretty solid and prepares the students well for their future. However, the social life lacks because people are not very interesting and diverse. There is an immense lack of diversity and all around the campus you mostly see white people. For those that like diversity, it will be hard to find their place in this school. Also, students are not very politically or socially engaged. Nevertheless, there is a cool vibe in campus and people are quite chill."
College Freshman,4,"I wish we had football, but intramurals are huge"
College Freshman,4,"The social atmosphere is great. As an antisocial person, it was hard making friends at first. But students are so welcoming and always asked if I wanted to come to dinner with them. The dorm rooms are not too spacious but they definitely do the job. There is enough space to keep all your belongings in and then some. At least in jewett hall, there are the couch bed which really help create space when you are no using your bed"
College Freshman,4,All students come out to games and love participating in intramural sports as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,Greek and Indies get along very well.
College Sophomore,4,"For how little it is known, it opens doors"
College Sophomore,4,Great college with moderately great applicants
College Freshman,4,The learning aspect here at Whitman college is great. Professors are incredibly helpful and there are always interesting classes available. The average class size is very manageable with often times no more than twenty people. Lots of the classes are structured as discussion based and therefore allows for an interesting and engaging academic atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,The on-campus housing at Whitman College is great. The halls are all in easy access to classes and most other buildings on campus. The rooms are spacious and the buildings are never in permanent disrepair. Orientation did well to introduce students to those who live in their same residence hall.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life at Whitman College is different from many other schools. Although Greek life is popular, it is still extremely accepted to not be a part of a fraternity or a sorority."
College Freshman,4,It's really only Frat parties. If you know an Indie then you can go to one of those
College Freshman,4,Parties Thursday-Saturday. But the parties stop around midterms and finals
College Freshman,4,"Great classes and profs, can be hard to get in classes however"
College Freshman,4,Academics are hard but I still love all my classes
College Sophomore,4,There are lots of events for networking and career services is very present on campus.
College Sophomore,4,All the dorms are good options depending on what you want from your residence hall. Juniors and Seniors mostly live off campus in the many houses surrounding the school.
College Sophomore,4,"Almost everyone is involved in some type of athletics. There are relatively few varsity teams, but a lot of people are involved in club or intramural sports."
College Sophomore,4,"The small size and the atmosphere of the school make it a great community. There are lots of opportunities to get off campus too, especially if you like outdoor activities. Classes are tough academically but professors are really accessible and willing to help students."
College Sophomore,4,great professors but hard workload and poor registration process (random selection based on year)
College Sophomore,4,The few outrageously good-looking guys know who they are and can be a bit conceited. But there are tons of good-looking guys who are friendly and fun and not that into themselves.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the students, campus, professors and access to the outdoors at Whitman. I chose it over some top 20 schools and I would definitely do it again. My only complaints so far are difficulties in getting into some classes and somewhat limited housing options."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are generally great and accessible to any student who wants help. However, it is difficult or impossible to get some of the most popular profs/classes."
College Sophomore,4,"I've heard its great, but I don't have any experience, since I don't graduate for 2 1/2 more years. I know Whitman offers paid internships to most students who apply."
College Sophomore,4,"Students really get behind the competitive teams, like women's basketball and men's swimming and tennis. Most every one plays spots or participates in an athletic club, like skiing or white water kayaking."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus security is there to help. They may make underage users give up their stuff, but they won't call in the police or report it.  Class attendance for freshman is brutal. They actually take roll and you have to have a legitimate excuse or you can be penalized."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, food is better than most other campuses. It's fresh and generally healthy and most of it is organically grown and local."
College Sophomore,4,"there's a fairly big range in quality of on campus housing. Interest houses are best, with individual rooms, kitchens and living space, but they are also hardest to get in to and they aren't open to freshman. Freshmen have to live in dorms, which are limited and pretty standard with shared rooms and tight living space."
College Freshman,4,"In terms of my major, I haven't actually taken any courses for it yet. That will be next semester, so I can't talk knowledgeably about the anthropology program."
College Freshman,4,Alcohol is always available and themes are interesting. I'm not much of a partier though.
College Freshman,4,"Mostly greek, but indie house parties are great when they happen. They are inclusive and generally well orchestrated. It's easier when you are greek to find parties, however."
College Freshman,4,"Very little weeknight partying, but there's usually something going on Thurs-Sat. Academics come first, though, and parties die out almost completely during midterms/finals."
College Freshman,4,Solid hookup culture but a lot of Whitties do end up marrying each other.
College Junior,4,"Walla Walla is surrounded, for at least 30 miles in every direction, by rolling wheat fields. The Wallowa mountains are roughly 30 miles to the South and East, and is a reservoir on the Eastern edge of Walla Walla that turns into a river that runs directly through the middle of the town. These can afford for some beautiful scenery."
College Junior,4,"Varsity sporting events are usually well attended (depending on the sport, of course). Club sports teams, such as ultimate frisbee, cycling, and skiing, are well-funded by the college and tend to have many active participants. Intramural sports play a very large role on campus; a large percent of the student body participates."
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe. I have never had to worry about anything.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a great athletic scene, but outside varsity sports, it's all in good fun and super low-stress."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone gets along well, and everyone has that easy going Northwest vibe."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are so knowledgeable and challenge you to do your very best.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't declared a major yet, but I'm sure it will be great."
College Sophomore,4,"The food is delicious and healthy, and there is always a variety."
College Sophomore,4,"We don't apply for major programs, we just choose our major."
College Sophomore,4,"I have an internship during the summer, but not during school. I won't do one during school because it would be too much of a time commitment."
College Junior,4,"The safety and security seems well handled, but anything can happen anywhere."
College Junior,4,Guys and girls get along well together. They are part of the college experience.
College Junior,4,Food is very abundant and great quality! Lots of choices at different times of the day.
College Junior,4,"It is a top academic school, so they take extra care to this."
College Junior,4,They do a great variety of courses so that students can become well rounded.
College Junior,4,The buildings are very secure and security guards do a great job.
College Junior,4,Athletics is a big part at the school. It was one of the reasons why I picked Whitman.
College Junior,4,"I am transferring this fall, so I will see how it goes!"
College Junior,4,"Greek life is popular, but people are all treated the same."
College Junior,4,Only the 3rd and 4th year students do the off-campus housing. It is great for people who want more freedom and are more mature.
College Junior,4,"The city is very small, but does not really matter, because all you need is on campus."
College Junior,4,Colleges who care the most do their best to give financial aid.
College Freshman,4,Plenty of computers in multiple locations.
College Freshman,4,"Walla Walla is a tourist town, so some nice businesses here."
Freshman,2,I'm a first year at Whitman college and I'm struggling to fit in because everyone here's from Pacific Northwest and there are very few international students. I spend most time in my dorm room since I feel excluded and I never go eat dinner at the dining hall because I don't have anyone to go with. The dorms are overrated and the town is too small that I've run out of things to do even though I've only been here for 3 weeks. The campus is small and I feel trapped in a small town far from any cities not to mention the tuition for this college is definitely overpriced and is not worth it. The party scenes are terrible and there aren't much around either making it really hard to have fun (especially without many friends). The good part of Whitman is that the professors are really supportive but that's about it.
Niche User,2,"Whitman suffers from the same defects as so many other private US colleges: runaway tuition increases, shrinking enrollment, and a chilling atmosphere that stifles free speech in the name of ""higher"" virtues. What distinguishes Whitman from (say) Reed or Lewis & Clark is its relatively well-adjusted (and well-heeled)  student body."
College Sophomore,2,Totally one-sided justice system (to be expected)
College Freshman,2,"We were recently named as one of the least diverse private schools in the US, and it's obvious when you walk around campus."
College Sophomore,2,"They have you submit FAFSA and another form that's basically the same thing, but they have admitted that they don't really take that into account. The financial aid I am getting from them is much lower than what my FAFSA says I need, so I am having to rely on outside scholarships."
College Freshman,2,"Greek Life is a really large part of campus life, and I find that unpleasant. It's the only thing to do on weekend nights if you're into drinking (there's no party/drinking scene independent of Greek life)."
College Senior,2,"Diversity is a huge problem at Whitman. For the most part, the school attracts white kids from relatively privileged and liberal backgrounds coming from San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, small towns/cities of the Pacific Northwest and Mid-west. Overall the school has very little ethnic/racial, economic, political, religious and sexual diversity. While the school makes strides to improve its diversity with scholarships and program development, Whitman struggles."
College Freshman,2,"There is a diverse range of individuals and everyone is very accepting, but Whitman is primarily made up of upper-middle class white liberals. There isn't a lot of cultural, economic, political, religious, or racial diversity, which is funny because Whitman stresses diversity so much in the application process."
College Sophomore,2,"Really Small Town – Walla Walla isn't much of a college town as other small towns can be. You can't really get too many jobs in the city since you're also competing with the local Walla Walla University. Downtown area is nice, with cute little shops and great restaurants. However, besides that, everything is kinda of ordinary. There aren't really many places to go and if you don't have a car, it gets kind of boring. But if you do, there are nice places to hike, bike, and sled when the snow comes in."
College Senior,2,"The college is really putting an emphasis on improving diversity and they have done a great job bringing in a lot of international students. However, with some exceptions, the international students seem to form cliques really easily and they don't integrate with the rest of the student body very much. Also, the majority of Whitties come from relatively affluent backgrounds and it can be frustrating to explain to people why you have to work 20+ hrs/week in order to pay for college."
College Freshman,2,"I had a very difficult time receiving financial aid for my school.  My dad is a periodontist and generally makes a fare enough of money, however the cost of the school being 50,000 dollars a year is extremely expensive for any person in general.  Because we didn't receive much financial aid, I feel guilty about going to whitman, and I feel like that is not the right emotion to feel about a school."
Niche User,1,This was the worst school experience I've ever had in my life. The people were very mean and judgemental and the school itself was overrated and overpriced. The tuition is about the same you would pay at Harvard or Yale with about as much distinction as you would have from most accredited colleges out there. I went there for two years and left without a degree. It was a total waste of money. I ended up getting a BS from another college with a 68% acceptance rate for a fraction of the money that I spent at Whitman.
College Freshman,1,"The town is small, but if you want to get out of the tiny ""downtown"" area, you need a vehicle. The college doesn't provide any transportation, so the best you can do is hope one of your friends has a car."
College Sophomore,1,"Most of everyone I knew at Whitman during my first year was white, from the Pacific Northwest, and upper middle class. Most students are very pretentious in nature (and they sure know it and show it!). Most Whitties are vegetarians/vegans, faithful to their Birkenstocks, and are hardcore outdoorsmen and boozers. If this doesn't describe you, it will be EXTREMELY difficult to form lasting friendships. I was immediately dismissed as a potential friend to most people here due to the fact that I am from Los Angeles and am not a green, democratic ""treehugger."" If you are different from the majority, you will stick out like a sore thumb and spend many dinners in the dining hall alone."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much Going on. Not much is going on socially or academically at Whitman College.  There are some cool opportunities for those interested in Environmental Studies, but not much happening for everyone else.  Many students study abroad and have great experiences.  Going abroad is probably the only interesting thing Whitman can help you do."

Freshman,5,I love the campus and all the activities they have. Especially them supporting Black Lives Matter. Its diverse and friendly.
Freshman,5,I've learned they are very accepting of different races and backgrounds. The whole university supports and celebrates the cultures.  Its important that every college does that but that's what makes Webster stand out.
Junior,5,Webster is and absolutely well rounded University. Very well involved with athletics and academics. Professors and students are cultural.
Graduate Student,5,So far I have enjoyed online courses through Webster University. It is convenient and all staff that I have worked work have been helpful and welcoming.
Graduate Student,5,Webster University is a great option if you are looking to complete a degree while working full-time!
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Webster University.  Peaceful, engaging environment that highly encourages individuality."
Alum,5,Outstanding experiences. With those experiences I came to fully understand the importance of Theater Education.
Junior,5,"I am finishing my third year at Webster University at the Webster Leiden Campus. One of the best things about Webster University is its diverse student, staff, and faculty population. Webster provides everyone with the opportunity to expand their knowledge on global citizenship through one of their many international campuses. At Webster Leiden Campus, students are more than just a number. Students and faculty can work closely together in the classroom, which creates a safe and comfortable learning environment. The staff at Webster go above and beyond to welcome students and help guide them through their academic college experiences."
Alum,5,"Webster gave me a very useful education. I got an MA in Human Resources Development and I enjoyed it very much. It was tough though, but I got through it and learned a lot. I was an online student so I can’t say anything about the campus."
Graduate Student,5,Professional teachers. I learned a lot in my courses for a social science in Masters of Arts in Teaching.
Senior,5,"An amazing university! There is always someone there to help when you need it. As well as, many immersive hands-on opportunities in all areas of study."
Freshman,5,It is an amazing campus and all of the staff and students are so helpful and kind.The food is amazing and they have options for everyone.  The housing is nice and roomy. The classes are amazing and the professors are very helpful.
Junior,5,"Classes are good and very hands on. The school provides the equipment, tools and software for me to be successful. Professors are very knowledgable and have been able to demonstrate well."
Alum,5,I loved the small classes and being able to talk with the professors one on one. The fact that many of the professors have other jobs outside of teaching allows them to provide real life experience along with the textbook knowledge.
Niche User,5,"Love the small campus, it is very personal and friendly. Safe and cozy. The dorms are great, professors care about you and opportunities are endless.
Everyone makes you feel welcome, other students, professors and administration"
Niche User,5,"The staff at Webster is incredible at answering any questions you might have regarding enrolling. When I scheduled a tour, they made sure I met with everyone: admissions counselor, someone from my major, players from a team I was interested in , the athletic director, the coach and the players. They were awesome!"
Senior,5,Transferring to Webster as an international student  proved to be a good decision for me. The professors are very kind and supportive. The atmosphere is also great here. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved in campus.
Freshman,5,"As a freshmen coming in from South Florida, Webster was definitely the best University to go to get a feeling of a home away from home. Everything was different from what I was used to from the environment, the weather, and the people but Webster made the transition for me smoother than I thought possible from the many activities and programs offered from all directions of the university, the diverse community people around me helping me and others to reach their full potential and without a doubt the help of my advisors, coaches, teammates, and professors. When I voiced my concerns, my concerns were listen to and handled. Even though, I just completed my first year at Webster I truly do look forward to any and everything Webster has to offer me in the next 3 years. I have met great people and have had great experiences all thanks to Webster University. My home away from home."
Sophomore,5,Their is a big diversity of people their and were very small unlike other colleges  in Missouri. We have so much going around campus that each student will fit in and find their passion for any subject.
Graduate Student,5,"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Parking isn't difficult. Class website is easy to navigate and app is as well. I received a Webster folder full of useful information during orientation. Orientation was quick, easy and painless. And they fed us well!"
Alum,5,"As an alumni if Webster University, there were many opportunities to grow in your profession. The people are very interested n helping you to be successful in your studies and in life."
Niche User,5,"I loved the community and the curriculum provided especially for my major.  Eventually when I attend Webster, I definitely intend to refer it to others as well.  There really wasn't anything that I would want to change about it, it seemed like one of those too good to be true scenarios, but the only catch was the tuition.  The arts field is very well supported and is extremely diverse."
Alum,5,Loved everything about Webster! Living on campus and being part of a tight knit community helped me come out of a shell and become more of a leader! I would not have gotten that chance at a larger school.
Niche User,5,"What I like about Webster is the diversity. There students at Webster from many other countries. What I want to see changed is more majors. Even though what I already want to study is already at Webster, there are probably hundreds of students that want to go to Webster, but don't have what they want to major in."
Graduate Student,5,"I had a good experience with this school. I attended a satellite location and did not have to go to campus very often, but it is a nice campus in a better part of the St. Louis area."
Senior,5,Well I love Webster U. and the campus life it is a whole lot of opportunities here. Also the professor are very involved with helping you learn.
Sophomore,5,"Webster has given me so many opportunities to meet and talk to people within my interested professions, develop skills needed for my intended career, provided courses within my interests, and so much more. It has also provided me with the chance to participate in events to help expand my resume and portfolio for future employers to see all that I've done."
Niche User,5,Webster was a school that I visited and it was very delightful. It became one of my top schools in Missouri and Most of my teachers go there and recommended that i go. So far it is really good and I hope to further my studies in Webster.
Graduate Student,5,Very good experience thus far. I am taking classes at a satellite campus. Military friendly. Will work around your schedule if you take online classes. The classrooms at Ft. Sill are very nice everyone has their own computer.
Niche User,5,The campus was very beautiful. This is where I will be hopefully going to college at Webster University in 2019/2020. I hope to study music and I have heard that their music program is excellent!
Sophomore,5,It's a fantastic school with so many resources and a great atmosphere. I love it here. Everyone has been kind and helpful. As a transfer student I was wary of returning to complete my degree but Webster has offered me nothing less than a positive experience so far.
Junior,5,"After attending community college for 2 years, I found Webster to be the perfect four year college for me. It is a small campus, and the teachers are extremely helpful."
Graduate Student,5,This is a well recognized institution both locally and nationally. I enjoy that my professors can be easily reached and that my classes are small enough for me to stand out.
Junior,5,"I am still a current student at Webster. I like that its diverse. I would sure with others when they are choosing what college to go to make sure you choose Webster you will a great, challenging experience.  Webster do alot for the community through the different curriculum activities they have on campus."
Junior,5,"Webster University is a very caring diverse school with great academics, and caring individuals. Going to school here has made me grow into a strong selfless leader, and become a well rounded global citizen."
Freshman,5,"I haven't started attending Webster yet, but I'm already in love with it. The atmosphere of the college is one like no other. It's a smaller school so teachers will be one on one with students. They have a great study abroad program as well."
Freshman,5,I will be moving into Webster University in a few weeks.  I have spent a lot of time at campus getting everything set up for when I start school.  Everyone I have called or emailed has responded immediately and been very friendly and helpful.  Everyone on campus has gone out of their way to not just help with the questions I had but with questions they saw coming up for me.
Freshman,5,So far Webster university has been a wonderful and inviting place . I'd recommend Webster to anyone everyone there is extremely helpful and welcoming I couldn't be happier with my college choice
Junior,5,Webster is an amazing college. I have made many connections and friends here at the university. I would recommend webster to any student that is thinking about transferring here.
Sophomore,5,"All the instructors work hard to help the students progress and generally care about students. The school is diverse and accepting of all races, religions and cultures."
Freshman,5,"Webster University is an excellent school to begin and continue study.  The professors and administrators do a wonderful job of welcoming you to your new life as a college student and helping you adjust to being on your own while juggling academic life.  The school provides not only a very strong academic program, but a firm knowledge of expanding global citizenship.  The school really works to make you not only better at your area of study, but a better person in general."
Sophomore,5,"Webster's college life is exactly the experience I was hoping for. They have small class sizes, approachable and knowledgeable faculty, most of which are still working in their industry so we received current and up to date information from them. Their study abroad options are some of the best I've ever seen. They have Webster campuses around the world, which guarantees that your tuition never changes and all of your financial aid and credits transfer. There are over 100 different nationalities on campus and everyone is very open and accepting of each other. It's the perfect atmosphere and I am so glad I decided to attend this institution."
Alum,5,Webster University is a great college. Great achievements. It is focused on academics and has a very diverse population. Webster has strived on making each individual student succeed and to make sure that it is possible that when they graduate they will enter the work force well prepared and ready to start their careers.
College Junior,5,My professors care about their students inside and outside of the classroom.
College Junior,5,Greek life may be small but has built a great relationship with the rest of the student body and the community.
College Junior,5,"My professors are all teaching and working in their field simultaneously, which allows them to give real world advice."
College Freshman,5,My overall experience at Webster has been great. Everyone is kind and willing to help me with work and anything in general. The professors really care about how you are doing and are always there when you need them. I would definitely recommend this college to any beginning freshman.
College Freshman,5,"While my interaction with my professors has been brief, I have valued that time.  All of my professors seem to love what they do, and that motivates me to put effort into the material.  Class sizes are very small, and I like the level of intimacy in classes.  It is very easy to feel important here."
College Junior,5,"Webster holds internship and career fairs every semester. Between that and the Career Planning and Development Center, I feel so encouraged to look outside the Webster community. Being an out of state student, I was unsure how I was going to make the connections I needed. I have been shown through just two years of school that Webster can bring so many opportunities."
College Junior,5,"With only one sorority on campus, it doesn't have to be a big part of Webster's experience. That being said, I am in Delta Phi Epsilon, and this is making my college experience. While mainly a community service sorority, we are very active on our campus. Holding events like Deepher Dude and Trivia Night's, we are making a difference. The girls I have met through DPhiE have become my best friends and I could not be more thankful to have joined such an incredible bond of sisterhood!"
College Senior,5,I love Webster and what they have to offer. they were very helpful and they also everything is close by and I enjoy my experience here
College Senior,5,"I love campus housing, they accommodate the needs for students and i also am a customer service associate for the housing department, I work really close with the team"
College Freshman,5,Poles are set up around campus for emergencies and every student must take a sexual assult prevention course online.
College Freshman,5,"Wonderful, diverse community at Webster that is accepting and always pushing their students to the best they can be."
College Freshman,5,I love it so much!
College Junior,5,"I love the class size and the professors. If you are looking for a party school, Webster is not for you. I chose the university because of the interest the faculty took in my career and how much they went out of their way to make it possible to pursue the career I wanted. As a double major they have helped me customize classes to accommodate my needs."
College Junior,5,"I am a music student and I absolutely love all of the faculty. Since the class sizes are so small, I have developed genuine relationships with my professors and feel very supported and encouraged by them!"
College Junior,5,I didn't realize it before coming to Webster but the school is incredibly diverse with its students and faculty members. I was really pleased and continue to be pleased by this because it fosters an environment of learning and opens us up to acceptance of other cultures or views.
College Junior,5,This school is everything I expected and more. The classes are unique and I am challenged every day. I absolutely love my school!!
College Sophomore,5,Many many many attractive students
Alum,4,"I did some classes online and only had a problem with one teacher would did not respond to any of my emails or concern. I tried reaching out for help and did not/would not help. Otherwise, everyone else was helpful."
Alum,4,"Overall, I had fun attending Webster. I met some great people there that are great friends. The teachers are truly helpful and like to see you succeed. The classes are smaller, so you can get a more tailored education than a standard lecture. Overall, The school was good."
Junior,4,"With the unexpected shift to online classes after spring break (2020) there was certainly a learning curve for most of my professors. Additional classes on the use of WebEx and Zoom would still be helpful to the professors who have less experience with these platforms, but many of the academic classes I took functionally remained quite similar. Most impressively, acting classes in Webster's Conservatory were able to shift to an online platform as well. While not ideal, Webster University was able to accommodate to the needs of their students."
Junior,4,"My personal experience at Webster University has been great overall! The university is small, which provides unmatched opportunities for one-on-one help from professors (as well as internships, TA jobs, etc). If a vivacious and extensive campus life is important for your college experience, Webster University probably isn't for you. There are quite a few different clubs you can join, but the lack of a big sports team or university-wide events keeps people fairly divided between majors. The Conservatory's program and productions are nationally-rebound-- as they should be. The professors and teaching methods are top notch, and the people who go through the program come out as well-rounded performers, technicians, and individuals. If you are an out of state student, it is important to seek additional outside scholarships as the university is quite expensive and the university scholarships do not cover a significant portion of overall expenses."
Freshman,4,"over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Webster has struggled to be transparent with their students and staff with their ongoing behind closed doors"
Niche User,4,I like how they treat you with so much love and care to new upcoming students. This ois where i will continue my graduate studies
Freshman,4,"I truly enjoy my time at Webster university. As a freshman I feel very satisfied with my choice to go to this great and amazing school. The professors are all very unique and enjoyable and the student body is amazing as well. The programs and opportunities provided to students are endless, and overall satisfactory. Additionally, the study abroad options are very cool and diverse. The one thing I would like to possibly see change is the dinning options. While Webster is an amazing campus, I would like to see some improvements with the food services and overall options provided to the student and staff."
Junior,4,"Webster University is a great school to get a degree in film because students are able to get hands-on experience in productions. Therefore, they have access to work with a variety of equipment by being able to rent it. The teachers are nice and motivate their students. Therefore, they give students constructive criticism, while making the class a fun place to learn."
Sophomore,4,"As a film student, the program consists of many professionals who have been in the field who are giving their time to teach us about how to act and provide on sets in the real world. Very hands on and collaborative."
Sophomore,4,"Webster University has a very intimate and relaxed environment. The classes are small enough where you're able to get more attention from your professors when needed. Also, its a relatively safe environment. This school takes public safety very seriously and that's very commendable. I do feel that more activities should take place that would get students more involved and allow for them to get the full enjoyment of their college experience. As well as financial aid matters could be handled more efficiently, but overall Webster is a pretty decent school."
Freshman,4,"My first year at Webster has been fantastic, many clubs, fun people, professors care and will work with you, my only complaint is that Administration seems to have a lack of organization and communication. If you go to Webster you have to be on top of everything because this college will lose things and be last minute on many things, but if you keep on it things will go smooth. The Professors are top tier especially in your department (big open arms!)"
Freshman,4,"The classes are small, with my most being 13 students. The professors are great as well! They care about the students. However, it is difficult to meet people and feel ""at home."""
Freshman,4,When I first moved into Webster University I was expecting my student life to be very basic. As days progressed I made so many friends. The professors are super helpful and nice and I wouldn't trade any school in the world for Webster University.
Junior,4,"For the most part, I love Webster University. I am currently enrolled in my junior year at the Conservatory of Theatre Arts at Webster and I could not be more happy with the education I am receiving. The professors are reasonable and are always willing to meet with students outside the classroom to create a better learning experience. I feel very close with my classmates and my school at large. However, I wish there were more things going on in Webster Groves. Other than that, I really have no complaints."
Senior,4,Webster is really great in bring everyone from all around the world to a small campus. The class size are small to average so it is easy to get that one on one with the professor to really learn more about the subject. Best of all everyone is really friendly and easy to talk too.
Sophomore,4,"There was a lot of new experiences and different things that Webster university had to offer. I learned a lot about people, business, and just the way things work. The campus life was very lively and everyone on campus is friendly and they look out for you. I made a lot of connections and got to see where I wanted to go with my career."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student coming from a community college in Graden City, Kansas. I thought that Webster University was going to better my college experience because it was in a major city, St. Louis, but there not much to do on campus. Being a transfer student is hard because nobody understand your perspective on certain things. I am also on the volleyball team, I'm originally from Tennessee and most of the girls on the team are from St. Louis or Missouri in general. I just feel like I would be more comfortable if the team was more diversity and not just local girls. The convos that we have as a team wouldn't be just st==things the local girls know about, therfor I could pitch in on the convo."
Freshman,4,I am in the film program here at Webster. Everyone in this program is passionate and driven. It is awesome being in an environment where the teachers are so open to helping students out they give out their personal phone numbers and tell you to call them if you ever have any problems. Webster is a diverse campus with people from many different walks of life.
Junior,4,"Webster university isn't a small college, but it's also definitely not a big one. The people are friendly and it is an extremely accepting environment. While the campus itself is small the rest of St. Louis is at your fingertips."
Sophomore,4,"Webster is a really good school if you're looking for a business, art, or performing arts degree. The students are always nice and the campus is very walkable. Unfortunately, it has some problems with accessibility for those in wheelchairs. The class sizes are small, so it's a great place to meet people and form lasting connections. 
The Professors get to know you on a need-basis, so they'll notice if you're struggling, and most of them will reach out. A lot of them are willing to cut you slack if you're going through a rough time. The online portal is hard to navigate at first, but not bad. Res life is my favorite part about Webster."
Freshman,4,I just attended Webster very good location and academics I would recommend Webster University especially someone who is looking to studying Biology. Webster University is situated in a great neighborhood and quiet area.
Graduate Student,4,"Easy to apply and register without taking dreadful tests. admissions was slow, classes are enjoyable"
Sophomore,4,Webster University is a great school. Webster is diverse and offers many clubs. The Conservatory of Theatre Arts is absolutely amazing and gives the students great opportunities. I am very thankful to attend Webster but I am having a very hard time being able to afford the tuition.
Senior,4,I love the staff in the professionalism of the campus in the adviser's a very helpful in they understand the needs and commitment of parents especially single parents who do work a full time job so that commendations happen support and the learning environment also
Junior,4,There are numerous opportunities for internships and plenty of resources. The professor to student ratio is about 1:18 it just depends on the class. Webster improved their cafeteria this past year and added a science building which is amazing. There is a club or group for everybody to join and be apart of. There are also a lot of campus activities and chances to take advantage of Webster's benefits.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and staff at Webster University are great! In my experience, all of my professors were very friendly and approachable. The advisers truly have your best interest at heart. However, my student life experience was not the best. The campus is very small. There is hardly any Greek life. Clubs and organizations were limited.  I think I was hoping for a more traditional college experience, but Webster could be a great fit for you."
Freshman,4,"Excellent professors, small class sizes, and an inclusive environment. Webster truly has professors who are experts in their field. the campus is located in a safe town, but only 20 minutes from down town St. Louis and about ten minutes away from The Delmar Loop. The campus is dead on weekends though, absolutely nothing going on. The food service could stand to be improved as well; they need to have better hours of operation.  All in all good academics, average campus life."
Junior,4,"I love my classes and professors in the department I am in, but there are a few issues with Webster's diversity mission statement. Webster claims diversity as one of their main values, but the diversity is actually sorely lacking when it comes to cultural opportunities, disability accessibility, linguistic training and understanding in staff and faculty, responses to political actions in the country and city, and whitewashing or westernization in course loads in many instances. I love my experience here, but they could improve in their value set."
Graduate Student,4,"Outstanding experience taking courses at Webster University. The degree program covered areas such as Management, Human Resources Management, Strategic Management, Organizational Development, Managerial Leadership, Organizational Behavior, Finance and a Capstone course in addition to four electives of my choice. I found good networking opportunities with my peers through sharing real-world experiences and best practices as class discussions were focused on applied management and leadership situations. It's a graduate degree and I logged in plenty of time creating presentations, analyzing case studies, writing essays, doing primary and secondary research, and even using spreadsheets in the Finance class to analyze which companies had optimal capital structures and were better investments."
Sophomore,4,"I have been here for almost two years and I love it. There are not many sports and a very small party scene, but I was interested in neither when I chose to live here. Good for a liberal arts school."
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed Webster University because it allowed me to study a field that is uncommon in many larger universities.  I studied International Human Rights and loved the various theories and skills I learned there.  I also enjoyed the small class size because it allowed me to get to know my professors and classmates.
Freshman,4,Amazing film program. The people here are very hard-working and the professors want to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,I like the location of Webster University. It is very easy to locate and is close to everything. I like the classes that they have to offer. I wish they were more commuter friendly because commuters make up 80% of of the students at Webster.  The official commuter lounge has about three spots for people sit. The parking sucks and it is hard to get information about events unless you really start digging.
Graduate Student,4,"Since starting the graduate program at Webster, it has been smooth. There has been no major issues or set backs. The advisers and mentors are truly helpful. And their response to your emails are in great time. 
Professors vary depending on the class. So far, I have encountered professors who wants you to understand the material and pass the class. We all know ""life happens"". They are conscience of this and ensure many pathways for their students to turn in their work. 
I would only which to have in-class lectures as well at a campus site near my location. Other than this detail, Webster University is a great school."
Graduate Student,4,"Great University - especially for an international experience. The professors are diverse and very helpful. Student life could be better- but if you are there for academics, you will love it!"
Sophomore,4,I am currently an online student and I love that I can go to school on my own time. Have a full time job and a family I just didn't see where I would have time to go to school and still spend time with my kids. At Webster I don't have to worry about that because I can do my classwork with my feet up on the couch.
Graduate Student,4,"The primary reason I chose Webster was because of the classes they offered and the convenience of it's location. However, as soon as I stepped in on my first day I was greeted with the nicest most helpful administration staff. The classes I took were small so I was able to get personal instruction and bonded with class mates. I networked with many of them and was around a lot of military folks. The instructors were very good, personable and seemed accessible. They all had their own individual style.  I enjoyed just about each course I took and frankly am not that eager to graduate in December because I'll miss attending Webster!"
Junior,4,"Don't expect classes to be easy here. Professors know how to challenge you. The food was terrible but they're revamping everything for next year, so we'll see. The Conservatory is pretty cliche-y."
Sophomore,4,It's a small and cozy campus. The Conservatory of the Theater Arts is a very strong program that produces talented artists who are ready for the professional world.
Sophomore,4,"The New Student Orientation from the Department of First Year Experience is a great program and greatly helps students to become acclimated to being in college. The advising process needs greatly revamped! While I am on trac with my degree, I do struggle getting accurate help and information on the next step in my plan of study."
Freshman,4,"The school is great. It is located in a quiet, safe, residential area. It has some international students, but not too many. It has a fine clean fitness center, tennis court, pool, and gym, but no football field or athletic ground. Dormitory buildings are fine, but food options are not so excellent."
Graduate Student,4,"This school has been a fantastic experience. It motivates and pushes you to think outside the box, for reasonable prices."
Freshman,4,"My fellow students are welcoming and friendly, creating a safe and exciting community, and my professors are truly passionate about their courses and students. They want to see their students succeed. The only downside I've found is the cost of tuition, which seems absurdly high. Yet I wouldn't trade it for another school."
Graduate Student,4,"I attend Webster University at the Space Coast - Merritt Island, Florida campus.  I enjoy the intimacy of the small campus and small class size.  The advisers are committed to providing the information that the student needs to optimally satisfy all the requirements of their particular degree.  This campus can improve on providing more classes on this campus and not ferrying students to the Melbourne campus."
Junior,4,Webster University may be a small school but it is filled with big-hearted people. I love the small class sizes and intimacy the school provides. You will never walk down the halls and not see a familiar face. My biggest complaint? Webster needs to slow down on the opportunities or else I'll never graduate on time.
Sophomore,4,Great for a liberal Arts and Business.  Great overseas campus and beautiful tiny main campus. Tuition isn't too expensive for a private school and most of the faculty are great. Getting around to the local spots such as the mall can be challenging without transportation.
Niche User,4,"I really loved Webster University. When I visited there, the staff was so kind and welcoming. The college had everything I was looking for. The dorms are very nice and clean. All grade levels can bring a car to campus. The school size is not too big but not too small. It's perfect for those who want that ""home away from home"" feeling."
Freshman,4,Webster is primarily a small school in terms of the amount of people who attend and if that's something you enjoy then you will love being here. Everybody is really nice and respectful and many of the professors are very knowledgeable and the do care about you. They also love for you to be engaged in class more.
College Senior,4,I don't live on campus bud it looks nice
College Senior,4,I have had great experience at Webster and I'm considering them for future degrees.
College Junior,4,Most students don't take advantage of the opportunities set forth by career services but they have plenty of help to offer.
College Junior,4,"I have no complaints about housing. A great roommate, makes for a great experience!"
College Junior,4,"We have a unique mascot, called the Gorlok. Though attendance at athletics may not be a top priority for some students,  everyone loves our mascot."
College Sophomore,4,My floor in the dorm was very interactive.
College Sophomore,4,I am indifferent to Greek life.
College Sophomore,4,My school staff genuinely care for their students. They're very welcoming.
College Freshman,4,"The campus housing at Webster is very nice. The rooms are not small at all, and the bathrooms are above par."
College Freshman,4,The athletics at Webster are a lot of fun to participate because everyone is so friendly.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't applied for internships/jobs yet, but from what I've heard, Webster is a great stepping stone.  I plan on applying to Med school after Webster, and I know that I will have adequate opportunities to build my resume before that time comes."
College Freshman,4,"In my experience, I have had very little negative interactions on campus.  I know that there are several places on campus set up in case of emergency, and the overall atmosphere of campus implies safety."
Niche User,2,"I went to Webster for one year before transferring. Going into it, I knew it would be expensive but there are so many hidden fees they pile on top of tuition. I went into college thinking that the social set up would be much better than high school, but with Webster, that is not true. It was very cliquey, and if you were not in with one of the cliques, good luck with having a good residential life. As far as my actual studies went, I was a film production major. I did not feel as if Webster had the resources or connections to do good by anyone in this program. Really the only good thing I have to say is about the professors. All of the professors I had were fantastic and I got along with them well. The only complaint about teachers I have is that one of my professors even admitted that he didn't want to be teaching that class and he didnt think he was qualified for it but Webster didn't have anyone else to teach it. So, not his fault."
Freshman,2,"Webster is a great school for the Art majors, or a student who wants to get their degree and get out. In my honest opinion I think college is about experience and I would like to experience a big university, with Greek life, and tailgates, and improved sports teams."
Freshman,2,"Would not recommend. The students are extremely cliquey. There is no party scene whatsoever. The food is disgusting and prone to making people sick. The teachers and faculty are the only things here that really stand out but it isn’t enough to make up for how lacking it is in student life. Additionally, all the money goes into the theatre while buildings like English and art are falling apart."
Senior,2,"Webster is diverse in appearance and statistics but in all actuality they do not actually tend to these students, they more so use them for funding. Professors need to be watched closer, many are knowledgeable but do not know how to teach. Lastly higher up housing staff could use some work with being more sensitive to students and not so much worrying about money. Webster can be greedy and as a student I rarely saw back the money I put in going to students or the school."
Graduate Student,2,"This university is great at transferring credits for military, but their administrative department isn't on par.  I had to take a break in my education and when I later applied to pick up courses again they were sporadically responsive.  I was frustrated with the experience, and moved on to a different university--which actually worked in my favor."
Sophomore,2,A lot of things could be better. Professors that have very little teaching experience are the toughest classes that you can take. Very little sympathy for those going through mental health issues. Food is good but too much grease. Atmosphere is good if you want a small town small school kind of vibe. Students and peers are very stuck up on some levels but stuck up in high school in a way.
College Junior,2,Athletics are not a huge priority.
College Freshman,2,Tier 3. My roommate (a cheerleader) informed me that cheerleading was a club as opposed to a sport up until this year. She is currently the only person on the cheer team.
College Sophomore,2,Not many choices and the food is expensive
College Freshman,2,It's pretty nonexistent but acceptable because I don't like sports.
College Freshman,2,"West hall is gross and uninviting. The plumbing smells bad often times, although maybe they'll fix it since they put in new washers and an oven."
College Freshman,2,A lot of people just hot box it in their cars. No one parties
College Freshman,2,Campus Security sees and knows all. It's not worth trying to have fun here; just go off campus.
College Sophomore,2,The cost of parking isn't terrible however they don't make many lots available for all people which is unreasonable considering there are lots for the apartments that dorm residents can't use. Having a parking garage full of cars and people having to park ways away in order to find a spot when there's lots with multiple empty spots is outrageous.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is not an athletics school.  We are focused on communications, arts, sciences, and business."
College Junior,2,"I was misled about some of the majors and what it could provide for me in the career field. The major I wanted wasn't offered but I was under the impression from teachers that the major I decided on would also work for the career I wanted, something I recently find out actually does require more schooling."
College Freshman,2,Some people get freaky in the dorms..I don't suggest that. There are upperclassmen that have apartments that have some smaller parties. There are clubs in St. Louis and lots of bars.  There are some bars around the area and some night life in the University City Loop.
College Freshman,2,The WiFi is barely functional.  The library computer labs are always incredibly crowded.
College Senior,2,"We have one sorority, and they all seem snobby. They really don't do anything..."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am not a fan of constantly changing weather, cold winters and windy areas - all of which Webster University is surrounded by."
College Freshman,2,"Those who are part of sports, are very active. Those who are not, do not pay much attention."
College Freshman,2,"We barely have any Greek life, and what they do goes unnoticed by those who are not in them."
College Freshman,2,"The food is very good in my opinion, but the main dining hall closes pretty early. And there isn't than many options. It seems like it at first but after about two months it gets repetitive.  One more big on campus dining location would be great. And more hours!!!"
College Freshman,2,Have not experienced any horrific weather so I can't complain
College Junior,2,I've watched one volleyball game since I've been in attendance at Webster and I have not attended any other athletic events.  It seems as though the athletic programs are under-supported by the student body.
College Junior,2,Just one week after classes started I received a ticket for parking on the theatre parking lot.  The ticket amount totaled $50 dollars.  I believe that the violation was minor and the ticket cost was extremely high.
College Sophomore,2,"Could use a new athletics room, sports aren't that big here"
College Sophomore,2,"A little bit of a drive but a good variety, okay prices, and overall very fun"
College Sophomore,2,"A little pricey but convenient in terms of parking, closeness to school and shopping, and overall living quality"
College Sophomore,2,"Small building, not many employees, little resources"
College Junior,2,"The housing itself is good.

Though the housing staff is rather impossible to work with"
College Sophomore,2,"Webster has a great academic program and they offer a ton of help if you need it. I wouldn't brag about their campus life though, There isn't really one. I think that Webster needs to expand in order to make it more of a college feel. Webster feels more like a community college to me. However, there are many organizations."
College Sophomore,2,"I know that we have a Volleyball and a baseball team maybe a chess team too, if you consider that a sport. However, since its not a crazy big school with no real commitment to sports it is very sub-par on athletics. Its understandable though because the other programs such as business and the conservatory are a higher priority than athletics anyways. However, I did wish that the gym was at least better."
College Freshman,2,"St. Louis weather can only be described as bi-polar. I've lived in the area my whole life and it's a constant up and down. One week it's lovely outside, warm and sunny, and the very next week it's freezing. Sometimes this can be a day to day experience."
College Freshman,2,"Parking is kind of in the middle. Even if you have a parking sticker that doesn't guarantee you a spot because there really isn't much ""protection"" from someone taking your spot. That and the garage seems to fill up ridiculously fast. I can't really speak for commuter students but I'm sure glad I live on campus."
College Junior,2,"There aren't many off-campus activities near-by.  It's mostly just local restaurants.  There is lots of stuff to do in the city, quite a ways away, but for those who live on campus without a car, there really is no possible way to get there."
College Sophomore,2,"You basically need to own your own vehicle. I am a public transportation rider, but I do think that webster university should provide shuttles on campus to the nearest public transportation depot and to other classrooms on campus for students who do not own a car."
College Junior,2,Very expensive and terrible choices.  Terrible food
College Sophomore,2,"The campus security seems to be out to get the students, not protect them and enforce."
College Junior,2,"Horrible for last minute parking. You're going to have to get there early, or at least plan on walking from one of the neighboring commercial parking lots. Parking lots are full around eleven or twelve, and don't start to empty until about three."
Niche User,1,"We had to take classes online for one term because of the quarantine and everything about it was awful. Webster did not communicate to professors that some accommodations might be necessary for some students and to basically ""go easy"" on us. All of my professors were pretty understanding but I have friends who's experience was not the same. One of my friends did not have wifi and lives in the middle of nowhere so she was not able to make it to every online class and even have explaining her situation to the professor, she was still docked points and ended up failing the class."
Niche User,1,"Not a place I'd choose as a first option. There are a lot of things that I would like to say, but can't because I had a very traumatizing experience here."
Graduate Student,1,"It seems there is a lot of ""office politics"" between the Professors.  After you go in debt to get your degree, either they are so busy trying to oust the Director, or they are so busy gossiping that they aren't there to help the student. One teacher NEVER gets things/approvals done on time, so you're lucky if you can get into class at all. This same Professor unwilling to work with entities outside of the local city, so if you don't live in the city, you're out of luck."
Recent Alumnus,1,"pass on Websters.  had an issue with an instructor and my director, katie irwin, could not have been more stand offish, lazy, and incompetent.  even other websters officials agreed there was an issue but deferred to Katie.  since websters is a diploma mill, all they care about is getting your money, then hope you go away.  katie and her lack of leadership is common place throughout the webster's system.  cmu is a better choice"
College Freshman,1,We don't have any Greek life.
College Junior,1,"There is literally nothing to do at Webster after night. Not a lot of affordable housing off campus for parties, dorms are too small and strict, and there are NO bars or clubs in Webster Groves."
College Junior,1,"Expensive, unhealthy yet still tastes bad, Marletto's has inconvenient hours for students who actually have class, absolutely NO variety, the only good thing is kind employees and most people are nasty to them."
College Freshman,1,Do we even have greek like? I really don't think so.
College Freshman,1,Most people I've become close with live next to me/on my floor. Nothing else really happens here that would give me the chance to meet new people.
College Freshman,1,I couldn't even tell you what sports we have here.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Living on campus has been very lucky, because parking on a daily basis is a nightmare.  When I live off campus but still work at school during the summer, the only way I am able to get a parking space is by using my parking pass in the garage.  Trying to find authorized parking without a pass is terrible."
College Freshman,1,"We are a D-3 school so athletics aren't the best. Athletes support each other and that is really it. Our gym sucks, and I don't use it because of how tiny it is."
College Freshman,1,We don't have muh of a Greek life at all. The community we are in doesn't allow us to have Greek houses so there is an off campus sorority but they don't even have a permanent place. I honestly think that Webster would become more unified if there was a larger Greek system.
College Senior,1,None there. Wish it was easier to get to Webster without getting in my car and driving miles and miles.
College Senior,1,"Living in Arkansas, I experience all four seasons.  The worst time to attend school is during the fall and winter months.  During the fall, there are electrical thunderstorms that either knock out all power to buildings or tornado's that knock down power lines and buildings.  During the winter months, snow and ice with freezing temperatures will cause a frenzy.  In the past 6 years, Little Rock has had 2 shut downs.  This is when the meteorologist and local transportation officials have declared the roads and conditions of main roads to be unsafe for travel.  There are only two departments that will continue to operated during the weather outages.  It's the United States Post Office and the Central Arkansas Transit System(bus terminals).  The school's inclement weather policy is in direct governance with the local school districts.  It the local school districts are closed, then Webster University is closed, as well."
College Senior,1,"The governance of campus dress codes is very problematic during the spring and summer months.  Women or ladies are not reprimanded for wearing revealing or unprofessional attire.  Young men or gentlemen aren't encouraged to dress business casual.  Their demeanor usually is depicted of young elementary lads.  School officials are often ignoring this incident or choosing not to get involved.  The school should utilize a dress code and follow through on the implementation of its policy with academic remediation, if it is not followed.  These individuals are often the product of an undergraduate or higher learning program or that does not police professional attire."
College Sophomore,1,"I am not a fan of us not having housing for frats and sororities, but it doesn't phase me"
College Sophomore,1,Scholarships are hard to find. I a currently having trouble finding some through Webster. They offer a majority of their scholarships to freshman and transfer student (I am neither). This is not fair because I maintain a nice GPA and need help paying for school. They need more scholarships for every group of students.
College Sophomore,1,"I think there is a sorority, but I don't even think they're a real thing."
College Sophomore,1,"For a commuter, it's awful...unless you get on campus before 8:30 in the morning."

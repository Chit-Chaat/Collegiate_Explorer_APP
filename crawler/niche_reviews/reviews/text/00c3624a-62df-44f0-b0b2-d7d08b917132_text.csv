The school helps prepare its students to be Christ-centered through our academics, church, and small group life and career-ready by extending our education from the confines of the campus into the local community where we are giving opportunities to learn, serve and grow. 
The only thing I would change about the school is adding language courses given on campus. Currently, we have to travel a short distance off-campus to take credited a language course."

That combined with caring and involved faculty prepared me with the soft skills needed to navigate multiple careers.  All schools have problems, but I wouldn't trade my time as a CSU student for anything!"
Sophomore,5,This college has been so nice from the moment I applied. I have people contacting me from the school wanting to get to know me and answer questions. My admissions counselor is even paying for my bedding and necessities until I get my stuff shipped to the college from the college I went to last year! This college wants to help you get the best education possible for the lowest cost! This college is amazing!
Senior,5,"I have been attending CSU for 3 years now, 2 of which were on campus. I have had nothing but a great experience whilst being here. The faculty and staff have a great care for the students, and love to create mentor-like relationships with them. The classes offered, are geared towards anyone wanting to focus on Christ in their field. Great Bible University."
College Sophomore,5,There is 24/7 security on campus. They circle the campus all hours of the day or night. There are security locks on all the doors. I feel very safe at all times.

The library is also a great resource and a great and quiet (and beautiful!) place to do your homework."
College Junior,5,Living in the dorms is a great option. You really get opportunities to develop relationships with the people in your dorms and with your dorm parents. There is a very unique set up to the dorms that most colleges do not have. The dorm is designed in three floors and each floor has 2 to 4 suites that are off of a lounge. Each suite has three rooms and one bathroom; two people stay in each room.

They are always available to give advice or help. The students willingly give advice to fellow students on how to make improve their pieces. This music department is not the stereotypical competitive music department, in that all the students want to see each other succeed. One student is not better than another."
College Freshman,5,"The audition process to getting into the music program was relaxing. Most music auditions are stressful and freak students out. Here at BBC, they make them very relaxing and work with the students. They make an audition feel like it is a private lesson. The application process to get into BBC itself is very easy. Almost all students are accepted and the admissions department works with you and wants you to go to the college that God is leading you and will help you discover where that is."
College Freshman,5,Students are Christians who are serious about their lifestyle and have chosen not to drink.

College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the on campus environment. When you're walking by the dorms it feels like a little neighborhood. People will be laying down on blankets in the grass doing homework. You'll see students playing Frisbee and volleyball between the buildings. Inside the buildings, you have three suites on each floor with three rooms and a bathroom in each suite. There's a common room that's almost like a living room that people will hang out and do homework and watch movies. There are also Resident Directors who are families that look over the building. On occasion, there will be children in the lounge and I have had the opportunity to babysit for a family and it was an awesome experience. My favorite part about the school would have to be the on campus living."
College Sophomore,5,"There is virtually no drug use at Baptist Bible College & Seminary. Students at BBC are focused and driven by their passion for the Lord, and with that focus comes moral standards. Students do not participate in drugs or alcohol consumption because by God's moral standard, these things are not right and the highly enforced rules against these sorts of things. There is no peer pressure concerning these things, and I feel totally at peace and secure at my college."

College Freshman,5,the security is very good on campus and i have no question that i am safe.
Junior,4,I have only taken a couple online courses. I think the professors do a good job of teaching through the internet and making use of the technology. It is a good way to interact with students and the professor while learning the content of the class. I still prefer the in class setting though.
Sophomore,4,The school has great personalities and takes pride in their faith. The facilities are lacking (other than the obnoxious rec-center).
Junior,4,"Great college! The community of the students is my favorite part about CSU. It helps to build life-long friendships that are supportive in every way. The professors care about the students more than just ""students"" and are very real people that will meet and talk with you about topics outside of academics."
Senior,4,"I had a great experience in regard to the people, the professors, and the classes. There is no doubt that you can receive a great education here. The downside is that there are a lot of rules, which is to be expected at a Christian college. I don't mind rules, but it is frustrating when those who don't do wrong are punished for the sake of trying to prevent others from doing wrong, even though they will find a way to do it regardless. The food is not terrible, but also not amazing. It is typical college food. I personally feel that the kitchen staff is very friendly and does an amazing job based on what they are given and what they are likely paid. I have made great relationships here and absolutely love all of my professors. This is a great school for Christian people that are seeking a community of strong believers."
Junior,4,"Clarks Summit is a great school. If you like a small environment where you can get to know people well and enjoy small classes with a Christian view, then consider coming to CSU."
Sophomore,4,"I am a current Sophomore at Clarks Summit University. I honestly love it here. The professors are genuinely invested in your life and care about more than simply just getting your money, they want to see you in class every day and ask how you are doing. Even in my courses that have 80-90 students, the professor knows the name of all of the students by the third or fourth class. The dorms are inviting and everyone is friendly, it is easy to fit in and your dorm mates are immediately invested in your life and try to get to know you as much as you allow them to. It is an amazing place to go and grow in the Lord, there are many great spiritual men and women on campus that want to step into your life and help you follow Christ."
Freshman,4,"Its peaceful, no drama. Teacher to student ratio is low. Professors know your name. Get closer with God, a overall calm place to be."

College Sophomore,4,I found it easy to get into my program. The admissions adviser was extremely helpful and introduced us to all of the people we needed to know.

BBC called me within 45 minutes after I sent an email requesting information.
College Sophomore,4,"I only ate there once because I'm an online student but the food was great with plenty of options, including a nice salad bar."
College Junior,4,"There is only one computer lab here, but there are computers in the library as well that are used more often than the ones in the computer lab. Printing on campus is pretty easy and pretty affordable as well. The network tends to always work and is a pretty decent speed. Sometimes the network crashes, but IT is pretty quick at fixing the problems. Bringing your own computer is pretty important, unless you want to have to go to the library anytime you want to use a computer."
College Junior,4,"I feel like there a lot of different types of people on campus. People who come from different backgrounds, different homes, different ethnicity, different trials. We are all able to help each other to grow in different ways because we all come from different ways of life. Granted there are quite a few who are able to cliche and relate, but I feel like every person is different. As far as religion though, most of us are on the same page."
College Sophomore,4,Its very nice and easy to get to places
College Sophomore,4,Normally there are plenty of spots open
College Freshman,4,The school goes out every year to raise money for the students to give them in scholarships. Every student has the ability to apply for the scholarships and the number of scholarships is huge! BBC wants to help its students financially.

College Sophomore,4,The dorms are all close to both classes and dining they are clean and it is easy to get with friends
College Sophomore,4,all the professors know what they are talking about and challenge you to do your best in every class.
College Sophomore,4,"there are many opportunities on campus to use sports ministry throughout the year, especially if you play sports and even during the summer there are chances to use this major."
College Sophomore,4,We recently just opened our new Recreational Center and e have several sports teams that are well supported by students.
College Sophomore,4,The students and the relationships are what make the school why it is worth it to go there. The fellow students are always there when you need something.
College Senior,4,The food is made as well as it can be. They have amazing chefs and staff team. The budget is the only thing that might hold back this kitchen.
College Sophomore,4,My campus is 5 to 10 minutes away from a variety of restaurants. Right down the street from my campus are a could of restaurants and they all offer discounts to students. One restaurant in particular offers a discount just to Baptist Bible College students.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe at Baptist Bible College and Seminary. The security is very tight, friendly, and safe. They all know what they're doing very well. They know how to keep the students happy and secure."

College Freshman,4,This college offers a major that is designed to meet my needs and teach me the life skills I need in order to be effective in this world.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics at BBC are a big deal. But not overemphasized! Fan support is huge for volleyball, soccer, and basketball. The other sports are not as watched.  Our athletic facilities are impressive for such a small school and are kept up very nicely!"
College Freshman,4,"It does not snow a lot in the area, I love the weather in fall season"
College Freshman,4,I faced no difficulties; I had to take education exams and get all of my clearances from the state.
College Freshman,4,Drugs are not tolerated and rules are enforced to the T.
College Freshman,4,Team Bonding – Relationships built that go further than practice and games
Senior,2,"The college seemed good when i first enrolled. But since then it just seems like a place full of closed minded people. I am regularly afraid to be myself and to question authority for fear of being expelled (specifically because of my sexuality - i am in the closet for this reason). However, I do not have enough money to afford anywhere else at the moment and I want to graduate as soon as possible."
College Sophomore,2,its very cold in winter and the wind is awful
College Sophomore,2,Some of the worst food i have ever had
College Sophomore,2,Not much goes on and people leave or stay in room
College Sophomore,2,The people are weird at times but goos people
College Sophomore,2,The campus is very strict when it comes to alcohol and drugs. They are very clear about their policies and what will happen if you disobey them.
College Sophomore,2,"The school provides no transportation, so it is a ""fend for yourself"" situation."
College Sophomore,2,The computer lab is generally available only to the office professional majors.
College Junior,2,"Not Many Options – Same menu every week. Not enough variety within the menu. Quality is below average, but it does the job."
College Sophomore,2,Find Your Own – There is no on campus transportation.  The school is located about a mile from the main part of town.  If you need to get somewhere you either walk or ask a friend for a ride.
College Freshman,2,"Little to None – The majority of students that attend Baptist Bible College are white. Although I do know that the admissions representatives are trying to diversify our campus, at this current time there is not much diversity."
Niche User,1,It is a disgrace of a college.  I would not recommend this school to my worst enemy. It is not only a terrible school but a terrible representation of religion.

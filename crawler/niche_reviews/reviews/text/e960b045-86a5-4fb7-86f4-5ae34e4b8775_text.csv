Junior,5,"While being transitioned to online course format, it was not a big shock for me. I have taken online courses all throughout my high school career, so it was pretty simple. The professors are super engaged with you to make sure you have everything you need to assure that you are learning the content correctly and fluently."
Junior,5,"I love this small school. Every professor is directly involved with you and it really makes you feel at home. Even though it may be a small campus, there is a vast amount of diversity and it makes students feel welcomed. Academics and sports teams are through the roof amazing. The involvement with the coaching staff is surreal--they all seem as if they are professional athletes themselves!"
Alum,5,"Glenville State College (GSC) is nestled in the side of a hill in a small town of West Virginia. GSC has many things to offer to students looking to further their education, especially in education. GSC brought me life long friends and taught me many lessons. There's nothing quite like the people of Gilmer County. The towns people are so supporting and involved with all events and students. If you're looking for D1 facilities with a cheaper price, GSC is the place for you! The Waco center is a sight for sore eyes, absolutely beautiful. Although, it's pretty far from any big city don't count it out before you make a visit. The campus is beautiful and the professors are so helpful!"

Freshman,5,I really appreciate the relationships you have as a student with your professors. They all are very supportive and helpful in and outside of the classroom.
Freshman,5,"This college has such a great community, it makes you feel like you have a family here on campus and in the community."
Freshman,5,I loved the tight net community that encircled Glenville State College and the teachers because of the small number of students the teachers could help out on a more individual level.
Sophomore,5,The professors at Glenville state care about there students well being. They will take extra time to figure out what is wrong and why you missed class. Glenville state also has many activities led by an activity director to get students involved. They have trivia and bingo and more. All around Glenville state is a college that gets you involved.
Sophomore,5,"Even though I am from a town an hour away, being at Glenville State College has really made me for more 'at home'. It's a safe school and quiet town. There are a lot of students from all over the Country, and some out of Country. It's easy to make friends and be comfortable walking around at night."

College Senior,5,"I am a student athlete and what I can say about the fan support is that IT'S THE BEST!!!! There is so much support there, that's it's unbelievable! Especially for the Women's Basketball team because it is the most winning program and also the face of Glenville. :-)"
College Freshman,5,"Professors are always willing to help, there is never a dull moment, workload is manageable, facilities are the best, and the opportunities are endless"
College Junior,5,"Filling out the FAFSA in a timely fashion is the key to receiving any financial aid. The financial aid staff at Glenville State College is very helpful in ensuring that you get the money you need, and also in making sure that students are not taking unnecessary students loans to pay for things they do not need."
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the facilities here and the looks of the overall campus. A lot of it is in brick and the building are older so they have a weathered look. The lawns are taken care of well and there is very little trash left laying around on campus. There are plenty of places to hang out at if you want to.
College Sophomore,5,The school provides internships at the end of your degree for education. The placements tend to be good and are usually suited to each person and their personalities.
College Sophomore,5,I love the program here. I am a music major and the schools faculty could not be better. My main applied teacher was  the house saxophonist for 15 years at the house of blues and has two degrees and is working on a third. The voice department here is growing more and more; their applied teacher is a world famous opera singer who does not put up with second best. We also have an amazing low brass instructor who is always trying to get us more chances to meet very well known people. He was the number two euphonium player in the world and has written a book on the study of the instrument. The trumpet instructor we have here is phenomenal. He was first chair in an orchestra for years and has since retired but is still teaching applied lessons. The percussion instructor we have is absolutely amazing. He teaches our percussionists everything they will ever need to know and more. Then we also have the bluegrass instructor. She is an amazing teacher and is trying to help the program grow and expand while also managing the traveling they do.
College Sophomore,5,Our financial aid process here is nice and every single one of the workers is nice and willing to help. They are always offering more ways for you to see them and do game nights on campus where they ask about the financial aid that we are dealing with. Also they provide FAFSA workshops to help you fill out the correct paperwork and get maximum financial aid.
Sophomore,4,I've loved the community in Glenville and the opportunities I have been afforded by going to school here.
Sophomore,4,The college is small so the staff will be more able to focus on any problems any individual students is facing. This coupled with the small class size makes learning much more one on one
Junior,4,"My experience with online classes have been good. The professors are very lenient when it comes to pass due assignments if you shoot them an email, and it not difficult to pass the online classes."
Junior,4,"Glenville State College is a small D2 school in WV and there isn’t much to do, but I have been at the school for three years and I have throughly enjoyed my experience. I have made many life long friends and have made many memories along the way. With them, being in the middle of nowhere doesn’t really matter. The classes are somewhat easy and the professors are very lenient and attentive. If you can get passed the college being in the middle of nowhere, it would be a great place to go!"
Niche User,4,I was at Glenville State College for the Hidden Promise summer camp in my eighth-grade year. It was a very scenic visit with many places and things to learn about. I really enjoyed the experience and think that Glenville College displays a lot of the natural beauty that West Virginia has to offer.
Senior,4,The college is very small but has a great atmosphere. The Professors are always great and willing to do what  it takes to help the students out in any way they can.
Freshman,4,"Not a bad school. I often felt at home but I wasn't the best me and I lost who I was. Anyway, if oyu want to go to college but are scared I found that with how small Glenville is, its the best for trying college out and seeing if its a good fit."
Senior,4,Smalltown atmosphere. The Department of Science and Mathematics have the most supportive faculty and push their students to succeed.
Niche User,4,"Overall, I would say this is a very nice college. I loved the scenery and the people there. The dorms were lovely and all the staff helps exceedingly well."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the faculty are really good at their jobs and really caring. I enjoy my classes and if I am struggling they help me when possible. The diversity is great here and I have met so many new people. The food isn't to bad either and they always try to have activities going on here at the campus.
Sophomore,4,It is like a family. Everyone is very nice. Occasionlly some of your professor are not understandable.
Freshman,4,"At Glenville State the professors are absolutely amazing they will work with all the way and they get to know who you are, you're not a number. The food at the college is pretty bad at times they have their good and bad days, however the food gets made up with the places to eat around the campus the barbeque joint, pizza hut, and tudor's biscuit world are all great places. Glenville is just a great atmosphere and there is something always going on."
Junior,4,"Glenville State College is a small Public college in a rural West Virginia town. Though it's 15 miles from I-79, Glenville is relatively close to several metro areas. The academics at Glenville are thorough due to the faculty to student ratio; something you won't get at a major university. Glenville also has very nice facilities for academics and athletics. Glenville has plenty of opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities as well. Tuition at Glenville is comparably cheaper than most accredited colleges and universities. The only real negatives about Glenville is parking, dorms and party scene."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Glenville state college. The transition from high school to college was strange but the staff here were very willing to help in any way possible. The academics are great and so are the professors. The campus is beautiful and provides a good workout when walking up the steep hill. I love being here, and I am sure I made the right choice choosing this school."

College Student,4,"I really enjoy the professors they are very helpful, unless you make no effort."
College Student,4,I felt my questions were answered in a timely fashion and if the answer was unknown I was put in contact with someone who could help me. Like most admissions offices timely scheduling is key and I had a very small issue with my schedule but it was resolved will little issue.
College Student,4,"There is definitely pride in our athletics, but being a smaller campus it's not the main focus. Which is nice because I didn't go to school for the athletics."

College Freshman,4,If the rules were Enforced just a little better it would be easier to study
College Freshman,4,All public safety officers are very helpful and nice and everyone is made aware of any sexual assault cases on campus
College Freshman,4,My favorite part of college is not being a number.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a Hidden Promise scholar at Glenville State College, so I've been all over this campus since I was in 8th grade (around 2009). I honestly believe that I wouldn't survive at another school. Sure, this one gets boring at times, but it's really what you make it. I love being somewhere where I'm not a number in the classroom, I'm a name. Your professors here genuinely care about your well-being in and outside of their classrooms. You aren't going to find that in very many places."
College Freshman,4,I love it here. It's a really good environment overall.
College Junior,4,I love it . I like it because its a small college and the professors take time to learn your name and help you the best they can. Very school spirit and interactive with different groups on campus there is something for every one.

"

College Junior,4,"You will not get any help from the school in finding off-campus housing, but there are plenty of places at affordable prices. Apartments continue to be constructed year after year."

"
College Junior,4,"Safety and security at Glenville State College are great. Everyone is relatively laid back and just working toward getting a degree. Students, typically, don't cause any problems."
College Sophomore,4,I am very happy with my program. I tend to be very busy but other than that it is good. My goal is to be a high school band director and I am slightly concerned with the amount of jobs but i know i can find one it will just take some looking.
Freshman,2,"For me, Glenville State College is too small. I also hate how there is ZERO parking for the freshman ON CAMPUS. We live on campus so we should have our parking there. Not 4 miles away."
Alum,2,"Glenville State College is located in Glenville, West Virginia. It is a very small town and there is approximately 1,500 people throughout the city. The college itself has a very small campus and it is easy to get around. There are only about 5-7 buildings throughout the entire campus so you can get around and find what you're looking for fairly easy. The diversity throughout the Glenville State College population is poor. About 95% of the students are caucaisan and the rest are from various ethnicities. A good thing about Glenville is that everyone there is extremely nice. The students and staff are always helpful."
College Freshman,2,Greek life here is nothing like Greek life at other schools.  People in sororities and fraternities do not seem to socialize with others that are not involved in Greek life.
College Freshman,2,There is very little greek life. It is not paid much attention.
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is very limited. One you move your car, you may not get another decent spot for a couple days. Permits for parking are through the roof as well."
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot more guys than girls on campus at Glenville State College. The reason for this is because Glenville recruits too many guys for the upcoming football season and over half of them get red shirted and don't get to play. There aren't very many couples at school mainly because of the guy to girl ratio. There are lots of rude people that come from big cities so you always have to be careful who you socialize with.
College Freshman,2,"Average.  McD's, Pizza Hut and Subway are staples.  Sometimes chinese food is an option but only if you can get a ride there."
College Senior,2,Parking on campus in bad like there limited spacing $100 fine if caught without a permit and you need a car to go everywhere because like most places to eat are 30 min away and malls and etc
College Senior,2,Their are activities on campus but the student fitness center needs an upgrade and everything on campus closes too early
College Senior,2,It is okay but it has the same food over and over also the option are limited on what you can eat
College Sophomore,2,It seems to rain almost every day and if it is not raining it is cold or snowy. It isn't until late spring that it warms up and after that it is about time for school to let out for the summer.
College Sophomore,2,"The town of Glenville is a boring one. There are no ""hang out"" spots. There are a lot of good mom and pop restaurants though. The only food chains it had is a McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut, and a GoMart. The locals are nice and they seem to stay away for the college."
College Freshman,2,"Its alot of white people here and thats not bad, but the school is very boring quiet and alot of boys go here."
College Freshman,2,Sometimes you don't get wireless in your dorm room but you do get it outside of the room in the hall. There are lobbies for you to meet new people and get to know them. So overrall the housing is an okay setting but could be better.
College Sophomore,2,"But there are huge issues with it with the students. On weekends, you can smell the pot in the air. I also happen to know that off campus has huge issues with it, many parties get busted up around there that involve students from Glenville."
College Sophomore,2,"It Could Be Better, It Could Be Worse – I think some items are overly strict and others aren't strict enough. They do well over all though."
College Freshman,2,"Not enough financial aid, campus in on a huge hill, and the staff is less than useful. Good thing the students are amazing and very active people."
College Sophomore,2,"In Glenville, there are not a lot of choices for off campus housing in a college students income range. It's hard, we don't really have tons of apartment complexes. You either live close enough at home to travel back and forth (like Weston or areas) or you live on campus for this reason."
College Junior,2,"If you live on campus you are pretty well set. Either you have the option to take shuttle buses or walk. But on the other hand, if you are a commuter your chances of finding a convenient parking spot are little to none."
Recent Alumnus,2,First Come First Served – Availability is limited and housing fills up quickly because students want the freedom of having their own place.
College Freshman,1,You to go to a different city to really party
College Freshman,1,I can't eat pork and it's the only thing they have all the time
College Freshman,1,"Didn't get any grants, got some scholarships"
College Junior,1,There is pretty much no nightlife at Glenville State College. The only nightlife consists of going to a friend's house and having a few beers or something.
College Freshman,1,Parking here sucks if you get here at the wrong time. Just be sure to keep a good spot once you get it here
College Sophomore,1,to me it seems like most of the students complain about parking every day
College Freshman,1,Well... House parties are really one of the only options here. You're not really supposed to drink in the dorms (at all) but as long as you don't get stupid you probably won't get caught.
College Sophomore,1,"What Night Life? No really, the only thing open past 9 or 10pm is GOmart. There is not a lot happening around Glenville."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to Do – Only a couple bars are open and everything else in town shuts down at 9. The nightlife stinks.
College Freshman,1,Finding a parking spot is very hard.  The lots are very small and narrow. There are also odd and random spots.

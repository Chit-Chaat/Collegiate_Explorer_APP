Senior,5,"Remote learning, as unfun and unmotivating as it was, I still enjoyed reading the textbooks and conversing with my classmates, whether it be over zoom or blackboard. I still have straight A's throughout the COVID season."
Alum,5,Loved every minute I was at Gonzaga. I wouldn't trade my experience for anything. I attended for 4 years and the community at Gonzaga was welcoming and exceptional.
Sophomore,5,"I’ve only been online for a short period of time due to COVID-19, and my peofessors have been extremely helpful and accomodating. They helped us transition into the difficult time and were constantly offering help."
Junior,5,Gonzaga University has been a blessing in my life. It truly provides such an amazing community and education.
Senior,5,"Gonzaga has a wonderful, welcoming community that makes you feel at home. I learned so much here in a very supportive environment."
Freshman,5,Gonzaga feels like home. Everyone there is looking out for you and the opportunities to express yourself on campus are endless!
Sophomore,5,The honors program at Gonzaga is awesome! All of my friends are in it and we are a strong cohort of smart students who have great in class discussions. School spirit is high and the campus is beautiful. I have loved my time so far and look forward to my next two years. Also the study abroad programs are diverse and span many countries. I love being at a Jesuit college because the Jesuit ideals really drive my classes to think bigger than just one subject and inspire students to be service-oriented. If I could pick again I would pick Gonzaga.
Freshman,5,The environment and services provided are able to allow a student grow. They follow their mission statement on Cura Personalis which is care for the whole person. It is evident in how they focus on different ways to make a person feel welcome and at home here in Spokane.
Sophomore,5,"Gonzaga is a great community and although it is expensive and is not the most diverse school, I love it dearly."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely love Gonzaga. Between the beautiful campus, great staff, and great education, there is nothing bad about this school! I highly recommend it!"
Alum,5,"I loved the small community of Gonzaga and Spokane. It had that small town feel, but really wasn't a small town at all. There are of ton of extra curricular activities, and of course, everyone loves basketball. The thing I loved the most was the fact that Gonzaga made it priority to educate the whole person; mind, body, and spirit."
Sophomore,5,The Community at Gonzaga is unlike any other school. The university truly makes it feel like a community and a home.
Niche User,5,"I loved the tour I took; the tour guides were very well versed and helpful. The grounds are beautifully kept, and the school spirit is evident. Spokane is a wonderful city and the perfect distance from home for me."
Niche User,5,"Gonzaga University is a wonderful place to learn and grow. The campus is gorgeous. There is a plethora of greenery as well as beautiful buildings. Aside from the aesthetic  side of campus, the people are lively are very active in the community and among one another."
Alum,5,I felt honored to be a Gonzaga student in that the mission statement was truly lived out. Both faculty and students worked tirelessly to create that environment. I felt as though I had a voice and mattered within the community. Gonzaga can improve by making a conscious effort in reaching out to those less privileged or those who do not have the opportunity to experience Gonzaga's true message.
Graduate Student,5,I have really loved my experiences at Gonzaga. The professor have outside experience that they bring into the classroom. They are very accessible and encouraging. The base value at Gonzaga is servant leadership and it’s not just lip service. Not to mention great school spirit. Go Bulldogs!
Senior,5,Gonzaga is an amazing school with friendly students and caring teachers.    The campus is constantly improving.  Spokane appreciates the students and is a city that is becoming more diverse and cultured by the moment.  Gonzaga is a great value for the tuition and is generous with financial aid.
Senior,5,"I love attending Gonzaga University, its settled within the little big city of Spokane which allows a true college experience without being too overwhelmed. The class sizes are small, allowing you to get to know your professors and build close friendships with other students."
Senior,5,Gonzaga is a great University with a strong sense of community. The only downside is the cost to attend.
Senior,5,"Gonzaga University is an excellent institution centered around community, inclusion and personal fulfillment."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I have had a wonderful experience at Gonzaga University. I love the fact that it is a small school and therefore I feel as though my professors have been able to get to know me. I do not feel like a number to them. In addition, the professors that I have had have all been extremely nice and they seem to care about my progress. In regard to student life, there are many clubs that one can get involved in, and if one does not wish to party, the school puts on events during the weekends for students to enjoy and have fun. In addition, everyone at Gonzaga is very friendly and one could walk up to anyone and be treated as if they were friends. I would like to see an increase in diversity on campus because, in turn, that would increase the amount of differing perspectives and backgrounds of individuals. This would ultimately allow for more rounded and inclusive discussions in the classrooms."
Sophomore,5,"If you have school spirit, are out going, and care about human connection this is the school for you!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about Gonzaga. It is such a supportive environment. The campus is very pretty, it is not too small or large. I love how open everyone is to meet new people."
Freshman,5,"I am currently enrolling Gonzaga University as sophomore year, graduating on 2022. The academics are very excellent here. Professors are super nice and they care about you. Local areas around Gonzaga University, the Gonzaga university is in front of down town area, so local area is very nice."
Alum,5,"I am so happy and proud to be a Zag.  Excellent academics, friendly students, engaged professors and a strong sense of community are what makes Gonzaga a special place."
Freshman,5,"The community at Gonzaga is one of the best parts about being here. There is a sense of great joy that is brought to me when I hear or see someone even across the country say “Go Zags”. The academics are superb and you are given so many opportunities and support through the professors, especially through their office hours."
Senior,5,"Gonzaga a very personal University, it is a school where everyone cares. From the faculty to your classmates. Every student has a common goal at Gonzaga Univerosyt, to grow spiritually, intelectually, and mentally. At Gonzaga I can say I have done all three. From my teammates to my classmates we are all a tight knit group who care about one another and hope for each others sucess. The one thing I truly love about Gonzaga is that no matter whether you are an athlete or a regular student everyone is treated the same. We are all held accountable with no special treatment."
Sophomore,5,"The environment here is so uplifting. Professors want to get to know you on a personal level and do their best to help you succeed. The school pride in the students is outstanding. They are always hyped for game day and everyone is proud to go here. Most of all the dance program is a tight knit community of kind, fun, talented people that all want to grow and learn together. There are so many great opportunities and things to be a part of on campus to make it feel like home."
Freshman,5,"The faculty at Gonzaga truly care about their students and the experiences of the students.  As of my first semester, I have enjoyed my professors and found the classes I'm taking to be valuable to my education as a whole."
Junior,5,I love the community at GU! The small class sizes make it easy to learn and the professors really care about you.
Junior,5,"It's common to hear teachers and professors say that they want you to succeed, but at Gonzaga it feels like that's the truth. I didn't really expect much from myself when i came here, but now i have a passion, a dream and i feel like i'll leave with the tools to follow it."
Junior,5,"Gonzaga is amazing. I thought I wanted parties and football and greek life, but I realized those things don't make me a good person. Gonzaga has so many clubs, organizations, and simply amazing people that have helped me become who I am. The class sizes are amazing, party scene is actually awesome and so fun, and I met my lifelong friends! Would recommend to anyone!"
Junior,5,"Gonzaga has a beautiful campus #1.  If you enjoy 4 distinct seasons of the year, this is the place to be.  It is a Jesuit Catholic University, but all religions are welcome.  The Jesuit culture of tolerance, diversity and social justice give this school a great climate to live and study in.  All of the on campus housing is top notch, and the student union building is a brand new, amazing place to be.  There are so many opportunities around campus for  socializing, working, exercising, playing and establishing friendships.  It has a very safe feel.  I've had many opportunities with teachers, classes and clubs to pursue my double major of dance and English with a Writing concentration.  I"
Sophomore,5,"Love Gonzaga so far! Everything about it is amazing, and they always look to help their students first!"
Senior,5,"Over my 4 years there, Gonzaga became my home. The people on campus are welcoming and they genuinely want to see you succeed. The core philosophy and religion classes really opened up my world view and have helped me to think critically about life. Also if you love to be outside, I honestly think spokane is better than any city its size or larger. 6 ski resorts within a couple of hours and tons of biking, climbing, and hiking"
Sophomore,5,"Honestly the best part about Gonzaga is the people. You get a sense of community that I've only ever felt in one other place. The classes and professors are great, and overall it is a very classic college experience."
Junior,5,"Gonzaga is an outstanding school. Although very expensive it is the hub for every student, and local businesses. Gonzaga takes care of their students and provides multiple resources to help each student succeed."
Junior,5,"I think Gonzaga is a community that shines its light all around the world through its loyal alumni, a good-samaritan"" campus climate, and a welcoming staff. I can not recommend this school higher to anyone!"
Niche User,5,Gonzaga is very well diverse community and that is what a like about it. It's also really close to home. There's nothing I would change because it's very successful the way it is right now
Freshman,5,"Gonzaga has such a welcoming atmosphere. From the moment I stepped on campus, I felt right at home. The students here are very kind, fun-loving, and dedicated to their work. The faculty genuinely cares about our success. I cannot imagine going anywhere other than Gonzaga because my experience here has gone beyond my expectations!"
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed how inclusive it was when I visited there. Everyone had great spirit and were all very welcoming. The overall atmosphere of the school felt very safe.
Niche User,5,I haven't attended Gonzaga University but I visited the school. From what I saw and experienced from the staff was a warm and enriching environment to live and learn in. The student and faculty were extremely kind and welcoming and was able to answer any question I had. I hope to be able to go to this school next fall.
Freshman,5,"There's always something to go do on and around campus. My very first night there was spent playing bubble soccer and laser tag. They also have ""Late Nights"" at the COG, which is for bored night-owls like me, where they have food, different crafts, and sometimes karaoke. The classes have been good so far, and the adjustment period was fairly quick and easy. The campus is easy to get to know, the walks are enjoyable, and the buildings are relatively close together. I highly recommend suite-style dorm living, it's allowed for close bonding between myself, roommate, and suitemates, as well as having our own private common room to hang out in."
Freshman,5,Gonzaga is really great! The facilities are fantastic and everyone is really friendly.  The campus is beautiful and well taken care of!
Sophomore,5,"What I most enjoy about Gonzaga is the on campus atmosphere. I always feel safe when I am on campus. There is also a real connection between the professors and the students. Every class that I have taken so far, my professor and I had an open relationship where I was able to ask them anything, whether is be educational or personal. I don't believe that other universities have this."
Senior,5,"Overall I have greatly enjoyed my time at GU. Spokane is not the best city ever, but in the four years I've been here, there has been tremendous growth. The campus is adding new buildings every year, which is really exciting. I've had several classes that genuinely changed my world view, which you don't always get at bigger schools. My classes have been consistently small, with my largest being 75 students, and my smallest 11 students. 

I am a public relations major, so I am in the College of Arts and Sciences and have absolutely loved all my teachers from the integrated media department. They want you to succeed and will do whatever they can to help you get and stay ahead.

Our campus is gorgeous, and Spokane has the best falls ever. Winter can be rough, but it's nice to actually get all four seasons every year."
Freshman,5,"Sense of Community is very strong ,and easy to meet new friends. I have only been here a month and a half, and I have had the time of my life. The people here are so enriching, and they want to help you. I made friends with in the span of two days. They will most likely be my friends for the rest of my time here and beyond"
Sophomore,5,This is honestly such a terrific school. Everyone is so great and pretty much anyone you meet is willing to help you succeed and be there for support. I can already tell that the relationships I've already made and will continue to make will be for life.
Junior,5,AMAZING COMMUNITY. Small school that feels like a BIG school. School pride is OFF THE CHARTS. Amazing faculty and staff and the facilities are all getting remodeled and are beautiful.
Junior,5,"Gonzaga University is a wonderful school, on a beautiful campus. Many of the professors are very good, although I suggest checking them out on rate my professor (.com) before registration. Also, they have great meal plans! If you are sporty and active this is a great school. Many students participate in sports and sporting events."
Freshman,5,"I love attending Gonzaga. The community of students and professors really make you feel welcome and it is a very close-knit group. The students are all very supportive, friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,"So far I have absolutely loved my time at Gonzaga. Every person I meet is so genuine and kind. There are so many activities for everyone to get involved in. The school spirit is ridiculously high and the energy is always high around campus. It is really easy to meet like-minded yet diverse people. Overall, GU is an excellent environment to go to school in."
Sophomore,5,"I love GU more than anything. It is the absolute best decision I've ever made! The academics are tough, but the profs love to get to know their students. I was a 3.5 student in high school and I have to put in the effort here, but I love every second of it. The basketball team is amazing, the community is so welcoming. I never want to leave! GO ZAGS!"
Freshman,5,"Gonzaga offers a well rounded, personalized education for any kind of student. With smaller class sizes, it's easy to get to know your professor which enhances your learning environment for yourself and your classmates."
Niche User,5,"Great school. Has a great sports program, adn the students are very friendly. Feel at home while being in dorms, and teachers are great as well."
Junior,5,"Wonderful school with a  great community, a very active sports life, classes are challenging but not impossible."
Niche User,5,"Gonzaga has a very large and beautiful campus. The staff and students are extremely kind. Gonzaga has always had a very competitive men's basketball team and they students are known for taking pride in their schools athletic department. Gonzaga, though expensive, provides their students with the best education, environment, and faith that they can possibly provide."
Freshman,5,"Gonzaga is an awesome school if you want a tight knit community, professors that really care. Basketball games are incredible, along with the community support that comes with them. Gonzaga is a very white campus, but is very accepting into other races. The food is as good as you can hope for in college and housing is great in some dorms (Twohy, CM) and just okay in other places (roncalli, crimont). Classes are challenging but very manageable. Girls here are generally cute and athletic and the part scene is good if you are willing to put yourself out there."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere of Gonzaga University. The professors make time to be available to students and are very knowledgable. The small class size makes it easy to be involved in class and with other students. The people are all so nice.
Freshman,5,"Currently a freshman at GU. So far my experience has been amazing. Service opportunities, academics, and social life have made my first semester the best semester of school ive ever had. Can't wait to continue in the spring"
Junior,4,I love the small classes and the fact that you get to know pretty much everyone in your major. It becomes a little community within the larger Gonzaga community. There are also so many ways to become involved because there is such a diversity of clubs and organizations. The basketball prowress of the Bulldogs is a plus.
Freshman,4,"Very white. Academics are strong, if you choose the right classes. Campus is small, aren’t many cool amenities. All sporting events are awesome. Very, very hard to party as a freshman, especially with Judi Biggs, the new VP of student development, whom everybody hates for her notorious rule changes in all departments other than academics. People especially hate her for her recent stricter reprimanding policy on alcohol. Partying gets easier and more fun as you get older because you will most likely be living off campus. I generally have one awful professor a semester, other than that they’re great. Spokane really isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. I live in Dooley residence hall, which was built in 1960 and not supposed to be open for living this year, but they ran out of space because apparently because they didn’t plan for the incoming class 🤔. Dorms are just college dorms though, not great; the newer, the better."
Freshman,4,"Gonzaga is amazing! It truly is a community where everyone is willing to help one another out, no matter the circumstance. It's almost unusual how nice and pleasant the environment is--there is not a time where someone does not hold a door open for you (and then you have to do that light jog because you are actually a lot further from the door than anticipated). The Spokane area is not the best, most activities are done on campus; Spokane is honestly a little crusty. If you're used to culture or seeing people of color in your community back home, Spokane will be a culture shock."
Freshman,4,Gonzaga as a school is absolutely amazing. The city of Spokane doesn't  have much for people under 21 to do especially during the night. The dining hall does not have the greatest food. All of the professors are extremely helpful and the other students really build a warm atmosphere around campus.
Freshman,4,"The community and Jesuit education made the transition into college a smooth experience.  The professors seem to genuinely care about your progress in their classes, and the athletics are great."
Freshman,4,"Gonzaga is an amazing school. The biggest reason I choose Gonzaga was the scholarship and grant money. I had never toured the campus only looked at some pictures and read reviews. Each person emphasized the community that surrounds Gonzaga but you never really understand what that means till you get here. Everyone here is friendly, and you get this feeling that people want to be here. A lot of colleges and universities the drive is what's the easiest path to get out in four years. Gonzaga's different. The hype around basketball, the intramurals, and the countless other activities that connect Gonzaga is remarkable."
Freshman,4,Gonzaga's smaller classes make it easy to approach professors. The classes and the amount of classes makes for a rigorous set of coursework. Many professors are friendly and willing to do whatever they can to help you understand their class' material.
Freshman,4,"Gonzaga University has amazing programs, including an excellent ROTC program. However, if participating in ROTC and studying a STEM major you will have a limited amount of time available to study and to interact with friends."
Alum,4,"The professors are spectacular, everyone is involved in clubs and activities, men's and women's sports were celebrated and exciting, but more than anything the community makes Gonzaga University a wonderful place to attend college. "
Junior,4,"Gonzaga has created a community that is welcoming and supportive. The environment that surrounds the community is warm and friendly. The classes will challenge you to grow as a student and as an individual. The professors and faculty are there to support you and make sure your experience is one you will always be excited about. The people you meet will fill your life with meaning and fun. Fellow students will always be willing to help you succeed and friends that you make will always have your back, even when you leave Gonzaga. The community is one that is unforgettable. "
Freshman,4,Gonzaga University offers a community for students of all different backgrounds to feel welcome. The true spirit of a zag is shown through the daily action of holding the door open for one another. 
College Sophomore,4,"I love Gonzaga because of the school pride, close community atmosphere, class size, great job connections, and how close it is to great outdoor activities. I don't like how so many kids come from the same background, how cold it is in the winter, and the drinking culture."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe on campus because I trust the Gonzaga community. The only real issue is bike theft. However, sexual assault still happens, but mostly at parties off campus. I'm not too familiar with the reporting process, but I know there are resources on campus for issues like this"
College Sophomore,4,"If you live in the right place, you'll love the campus housing experience. If you want something more social, then live in CM your freshmen year. If you want a smaller community feel, live in Alliance or Goller. Room quality varies dorm to dorm. The worst is Dooley (aka a prison), but the best is Coughlin. You make the most out of what you're given and it's fine"
College Sophomore,4,"Gonzaga has such an amazing community. The people who go to Gonzaga care about you and everyone else around you. You feel safe, happy, and loved!"
College Sophomore,4,I feel I will make great connections here to help me in my future.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe in my campus knowing there's always security roaming around.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on your own is a lot of fun & a great growing experience. All the dorms differ, but they do offer a lot."
College Sophomore,4,Many people get involved. Sporting events is a great way to bring us together as a community. It brings current and former students together.
College Senior,4,We have police on campus to address any concers quickly and effectively. they even give you rides home for safety purpose
College Senior,4,"The gym is huge! There are two floors, and i love that weight room and fitness/cardio rooms are split. There is enough space for everyone and there is even a pool and a smoothie bar."
College Senior,4,I love that the class sizes are small. The professor's are very helpful and encourage visiting office hours which are very helpful and perfect for one-on-one learning.
College Senior,4,I'm too old and live off campus but if I were young I'd live the Greek life at Gonzaga....
College Freshman,4,"Most of the school puts their hearts behind the varsity athletics, especially the men's basketball team.  Intramural sports are also high encouraged. They're a great place to build new friendships, exercise, and have fun. The weight area is a little small, but there is an assortment of choices."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is safe for the most part. Because we are an open campus, the community is allowed to come and go as they please but they are not allowed in the buildings after hours. I feel safe walking across campus after hours in the middle of the night and if for some reason I don't, I can always call campus security so they can give me a ride. On the first day on campus, they give us their phone number and tell us that we can call them and they will not ask questions. We also have  ""blue light security"" which are blue lights around campus where you can see them from any part of campus. We are told that they have never been used before but that the response time is of 2-3 minutes. Overall, I consider campus safe."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not very knowledgeable on this topic but from what I have understood, it is relatively easy to find a job upon graduation because there is a large network of alumni. I had a friend who got a job because she knew got in contact with a previous Gonzaga graduate. We have an office whose job is to help student find internships and volunteer and find jobs and network with past and present Zags. This year we had a Gonzga alumnus ""get together"" of sorts where Zags from different fields came to interact with current Zags. There was a lot of networking going on."
College Freshman,4,"I got very lucky in housing because I got my first choice. I live in welch which is an all girls residence hall. The location is very convenient because it is very central to campus and extremely close to the dining facilities. Applying for housing for the upcoming year was very easy for me because I wanted to live in the same building but in a different floor so I got priority in housing than most. For the sophmores going onto Juniors, there were complications because my class was bigger than was expected so they had to accommodate the first and second year students before they got to the juniors and seniors. In most dorms, there is an open door policy which is basically, if you want to talk to someone and be sociable, then you can leave your door open. Our Residence Assistants (RA's) do a very good job of planning events for the entire floor."
College Freshman,4,"The sports on campus are a relatively big part of campus life. Our men's racquetball team is well known across the nation so they get a lot of attention on campus. Basketball in general is a very big part of campus while every other sport is not as important in comparison. We have many sports on campus. If we don't have a sport, then you and a group of friends can easily get together and form a team and compete. It is very easy to be involved in sports if that is what you choose. For every sport there are always fans but for our basketball games, we have an incredibly large fan base. Our varsity sports also have a huge fan turnout. When it comes to school spirit we are well known. Our student section is called the ""kennel club"" and when there is a home game, we show up and we cheer for our team."
College Freshman,4,"Pretty strong academic front by Gonzaga. Sciences are very hard majors and they put all the hard classes at the beginning to weed people out. It's nice that undergrad students don't have to compete with grad students to do research though. You have to take core classes no matter your major (even though some requirements differ slightly between schools) so it helps to do well on AP tests or even do running start. If you come in with credits, you get to register earlier also and actually get the classes you want."
College Freshman,4,"There is a large population of students that drink, also a large population of students that don't. I have never witnessed peer pressure for anyone not wanting to drink. There are strict policies and there are certain consequences for getting written up, but unless you are being too loud or walking around campus with an open container it's pretty easy to get away with drinking. The most common drug is weed but students usually go off campus to smoke."
College Freshman,4,"The most common crime is theft, like most campuses. Our campus security does 24 hour patrols as well."
College Freshman,4,I really like the small class sizes and the environment it creates. Professors actually try to learn names at this school and they are here because they actually want to teach.
College Freshman,4,"We have GAMP (Gonzaga alumni mentoring program), which I have not participated but what I hear is that you are paired with a GU alum who is in the field you want to go into. That and the fact that so many alums are involved on campus gives us a pretty strong alumni network."
College Freshman,4,"There is definitely a mixed bag at GU. There are dorms at pretty much every corner of campus, some closer to the COG/Hemmingson Center and others closer to classes. It's a tradeoff. My freshman year I lived in Madonna, which is very spacious and has sinks in the room. Madonna gets a lot of flack but there is actually a strong bond as a dorm and there are more shenanigans than people think. It might get more exciting next year when it will be freshmen only. CM is the most popular freshman dorm, but don't choose it if you want a quiet place to live or if you want to study in your dorm.  Coughlin is a really nice dorm but you have to apply to be in it. If you don't want to fill out an application, you could also choose Twohy, which is suite style and will be freshmen only."
College Freshman,4,Great school! Small campus with a strong community. You will find a place here if you put in the effort to look!
College Freshman,4,"The professors really enjoy their subject, and the courses are good"
College Freshman,4,I feel like at Gonzaga degree is worth a lot afterwards
College Freshman,4,"We have a great Zag community, and it goes beyond the awesome basketball games. The education is excellent and there is lots to do around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is very enriching.  It provides a place where you can mingle with individuals with similar interest.  The atmosphere is usually very social where everyone is happy to greet and meet you.  The dorms are generally pretty close to campus and a maximum of no more than a 20 minute walk to class.  The cost is fairly expensive, due to the maintenance and quality of the facility.  the housing process is pretty simple as freshmen and sophomores but it can be a little harder trying to get housing on campus as juniors and seniors."
College Sophomore,4,"The Greek life is very influential to the environment, they do plenty of volunteer work and activities that gives back to the community.  However, the fraternities are not recognized or associated with the school.  Our school believes that Greek life is not something necessary in cultivating its vision and values.  Even though this is the case, fraternities still provide much services that benefits the school, such as tutoring and events that makes the school a lively place to be."
Sophomore,2,The online experience is probably very similar to other schools. Mostly lecture and discussion based. The professors here are great and try there hardest to make the transition into online really easy.
Sophomore,2,Great academics!!! Professors are great and there are a wide variety of majors to chose from. Social life is pretty horrible.
Senior,2,"Great experience if you're not a transfer. As a transfer, I've had to jump through too many hoops to make it work and have been treated unfairly, because having junior status should mean I ""know how things work here"". The administration is also unjust in leniency towards their students in times of natural disasters. With windstorms that struck through Spokane and downed thousands of trees, students were still expected to go to class. When icy conditions that shut down all other school districts occurred, we still had class. With the COVID-19, they cut a week out of the semester, but won't issue refunds to students for that missing week (meaning the University pockets $9.5 million from the 7400+ students attending the university for just that one week). 
The administration promotes the idea of treating everyone fairly through caring, but they certainly don't live up to it if you're not in the group of full 4-year students."
Sophomore,2,"You tell anyone that you are going to Gonzaga and they immediately think great things about this school. However, I have felt nothing but let down. 
On an academic scale, most of the teachers do not know how to teach, ESPECIALLY in the science department. I had to retake a class from community college and was shocked at how much of a better teacher I had there. My science classes seemed like my teacher straight reading out of the book. Not only that but since I am in a private school, I expect my teachers to email me back. Many times they do not, even upon emailing several times
On a people scale, this school can come off as very strange. Everyone seems to want to be the same. I guess because it's a catholic private school, but it is hard to find people that embrace being different.  I have had four close friends transfer out of this school due to social reasons."
College Freshman,2,"Its not a bad place, but it is for me. I am very effected by the weather."
College Freshman,2,"Im from California and I came here because I wanted to experience something different and out of my comfort zone and I made me realize how much I shouldve appreciated California and how much spokane and not being by the beach sucks. If you're from california PLEASE REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. If you've never experience cold weather before then i highly recommend not coming here. Also, just be aware people aren't as chill as people back at home, theres a completely different vibe and i found myself hating it and not fitting in."
College Freshman,2,"The college is really expensive. Unfortunately, I, like many others, find myself in the tough situation of being too rich to receive significant financial aid, yet too poor to afford college. Also, it is really hard to find a job on campus as an underclassmen who does not qualify for Federal Work Study."
College Junior,2,"Not much offered to students off campus that is walkable from campus. Also, student discounts are nonexistent here, which they should be!"
College Junior,2,"There aren't too many parties on the weekends and if they are, they are very limited in people, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,The weather. I love the sun and you only get it once a week.
Recent Alumnus,2,"We would joke that the only African American students attending were also on the basketball team. I had quite a few friends that were non-white, but overall the percentage is not that high for diversity."
College Junior,2,"The safety on campus itself is good, but the safety on the outskirts of campus and in Spokane is unsafe and not good at all."
College Junior,2,During the winter it can get very cold which isn't my favorite. However at the beginning of school and during the summers  Gonzaga has beautiful weather.
Recent Alumnus,2,Lack of communication with admission counselors.
College Freshman,2,It was snowing in the morning and blue skies and sunny by 4. Add in the fact that the whole entire time there was 20 mph winds.
College Sophomore,2,There is no Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,There is a lot of drinking!
College Student,2,I only say its bad because as a Freshman I do not have a car and therefore being able to enjoy the activities in the area is very few. But fortunately there is a bus (shuttle) that takes you to downtown during the weekends. Safety always seems to be a problem in the surrounding area as the community is deemed to be in poverty. The people in the community on the other hand seem to really enjoy the students and what they offer to the community in addition to Gonzaga basketball.
College Sophomore,2,"GU doesn't do much to help you find internships. But for nursing its not really necessary. The only thing they recommend is getting your CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) so that you have a better, less shy, bedside presence."
College Sophomore,2,Spokane is a place you go for school- not to enjoy the city. I'm definitely not a fan… But such an awesome school makes dealing with Spokane worth it. There are two malls in Spokane and one in Spokane Valley (15 minute drive). There is a wide variety of people in Spokane and many of them are very sketchy. But you kind of learn living there the better places to be. 
College Sophomore,2,"Spokane isn't huge on public transportation- but when the weather is nice, downtown is easy to walk to. On the weekends, GU offers a shuttle downtown that picks you up at the top of every hour in DeSmet circle and drops you off in front of the AMC theater. I really think that bringing a car is a lifesaver though if you want to do any exploring. I had one my freshmen year and really appreciated it. Just don't advocate to everyone if you bring a car because you will make all kinds of ""fake"" friends who always want to borrow it. "
College Sophomore,2,"The freshmen class was larger this year than ever before and the wireless internet is absolutely terrible. If you want to get anything done, you need ethernet. There are way too many people using one service. I live in apartments kinda off campus, but still on campus, and owned by Gonzaga, and the building still has to use the main campus connection and we don't get full wireless signal."
College Freshman,2,Honors: Paper app and interview. Just be yourself!
College Freshman,2,Better than high school cafeteria food.
College Junior,2,Transportation is offered to downtown by the school on Fridays and Saturdays. There have been times where it hasn't showed up though while I was downtown and the CAMPO here wasn't willing to give us a ride back.
College Sophomore,2,The demographics at the school is heavily white.  Political beliefs are pretty much even and there are people from all economic backgrounds.
College Junior,2,"Winter sucks, cold and s****y"
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a great deal of ethnic diversity at the school. It seems like the university has been working to improve this, and there are a lot of different races represented but unfortunately its in predominately small numbers compared to the white students. However, the student body is very accepting of all types of students."
College Junior,2,Class requirements not well planned. Outrageous work load. Irrelevant assignments.
College Junior,2,Some assignments had absolutely nothing to do with the class. Instructors tend to be AWOL. Workload is unreasonably heavy for people who have to work AND go to school.
College Junior,2,Some assignments have had absolutely nothing to do with the class. Workload is unreasonably heavy and complex for a program that is advertised to supposedly be feasible while working full time. Many of my classmates have been forced to drop out.
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife for 21+ may be average, but for those that are younger there are very limited choices party wise and for any weekend nights. House parties are about it, but you have to know people to get in."
College Sophomore,2,Super expensive because of the new parking garage going in but once that is done I hope the price goes down and there will be more parking for games and students.
College Sophomore,2,The parking is not that great. there are many students that bring their cars but not enough places to park.
College Senior,2,"I left the program early. Faculty treats students better if they are well-known, such as basketball players, and if you're quiet, you're gonna have a bad time. I loved a few of my professors, don't get me wrong. Many of my teachers seemed passionate about their subject which was a huge plus, but I often felt snubbed if I didn't have the highest grade or most popular name."
College Senior,2,"There are many break-ins, thefts, and sexual violence issues. The university fails to punish those who commit such crimes. There are usually emails regarding security reports when there is a theft or physical assault, but rarely if there is a rape/sexual abuse. I think security there is quite sad."
College Sophomore,2,"Overcrowded and Repetitive – One full-service dining hall on a campus with 6,000 undergrads is insane, and yet that's what we deal with. As a result, on most weeknights it is a battle to find a seat, especially if you don't live in Welch or Desmet and want to sit with your group. As for the food, it's occasionally really good but more often than not really mediocre and repetitive."
College Junior,2,"Spokane Not the Hottest Food – Spokane, Washington isn't exactly the hub for awesome dining experiences.  It does the job sufficiently well, but there isn't a whole lot of variety.  Most people eat on campus or at places fairly close to campus, such as Jimmy John's, Pita Pit, Red Robin, Ultimate Bagel, Wolfy's Diner, The Melting Pot if you want to get fancy, etc.  I wish there were more and healthier options in Spokane and at Gonzaga more specifically.  Food is an aspect of Gonzaga that is lacking, and many other students agree."
College Freshman,2,Too Much – We got into wat too much trouble for a attempted comical intramural team.
College Junior,2,"While there certainly are a great number of people from different backgrounds and life histories, this campus will never be confused with a UN assembly.  Gonzaga has increased the diversity on campus the last several years, but it is still generally lacking."
Niche User,1,It terrible and they're not even really Catholics there fake Catholics the church has changed and people have believed that the change is true
Niche User,1,"Don't go here unless you want to be treated like garbage. They lied to me about how much money I got in scholarships, sneak in extra charges, refused to let me make my own schedule and gave me a really annoying schedule full of classes I didn't need. Teachers don't know how to teach, administration takes forever to respond and treats you like garbage and is full of weird kids. I went back to my old community college and let me tell you the classes are better, it's cheaper, campus is better and I don't have to deal with being talked down on by the corrupt administration."
College Freshman,1,Registering for housing is awful. I think that it should have stuck to the rewards based system where students without any write ups and are in good academic standing have priority housing.
College Freshman,1,Off campus dining is terrible. Its all fast food and nasty stuff. I feel like there are absolutely no healthy options anywhere except maybe one place downtown.
College Junior,1,"There really is not any sense of diversity on campus. While it appears that the classes are becoming more diverse, it is still an anomaly. "
College Sophomore,1,It's cold and wet.  BRRRRR
College Freshman,1,"Although wireless is available, which is wonderful, it has severe connection problems."
College Junior,1,I would definitely choose another university's program.
College Junior,1,Have had no help finding scholarships. Was offered only limited Fed Student Loans.
College Senior,1,"The parking is awful.  I spent $100 on a parking pass, and all of the parking lots are under construction so there is nowhere to use the pass."
College Sophomore,1,"Limited, Stock up on Your Favorite Foods at Home – Coming from the Los Angeles Area, I'm a little biased when it comes to the eatery options in Spokane, WA.  Not a lot of culture in this city, so consequently not a lot of food options aside from American.  One good thai place and mexican place, but aside from that, not a whole lot of variety, and nothing insanely delicious you wanna go back for more.  Load up on all your faves like in-n-out and chipotle at home because you won't find them in Spokane."
College Sophomore,1,Extremely Strict – Strict in terms of drug violations say hello to expulsion and if you are caught drinking be prepared to deal with the head of the RA's who are generally up tight and never listen and you have to pay for an alcohol class.
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no social atmosphere. No greek system and the off campus parties are always busted by police. If you drink on-campus the cost of getting caught is high and they tell your parents.
College Freshman,1,"Spokane Is COLD – It is very cold in Spokane. Starts out very warm in August (usually mid-80s), but by November temperature starts dipping below freezing almost every day. Daily highs in January and February can get into the teens or single-digits. And it snows a lot. Class doesn't get cancelled unless the professors can't get to campus. That said, you will have to deal with cold weather on a daily basis, and you will probably get used to it."
College Sophomore,1,"Pro-Alcohol, Anti-Marijuana – Culture tries to be pro-alcohol; conversely very stuck up on marijuana"
College Sophomore,1,"Stuck in a Monkeys Cage, but Thats Everwhere Else Too – How many growing college students can we fit in one dorm room??"
College Freshman,1,"The weather is pretty much a mystery. We had a day where all the elements came down upon us. There wasn't a lot of snow this year but the wind chill is killer.You have to be ready for any type of weather. On the sunny days, it can instantly change to rain. But for most of the sunny days, everyone goes outside"

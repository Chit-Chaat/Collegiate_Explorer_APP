Junior,5,my overall experience with Ave Maria university is good. the athletics are good. the food is average and the dorms are super nice.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Ave Maria University. The campus is strikingly beautiful. It is located in the middle of a beautiful movie-like town, where all the residents know each other. The community is so warm, friendly, and welcoming.  Located in sunny Florida, the city of Naples is just forty minutes away, making fun weekend excursions possible. The professors at AMU are excellent. They are passionate about the subjects they teach which makes it easy to look forward to class. My fellow classmates are like family to me. The dorm buildings are very large and roomy enough to bring a sofa and a TV! The cafeteria food is delicious as well and reminds one of home-cooking.  During this pandemic, the restrictions put in place made it possible to have fun safely. I am so happy I decided to attend Ave Maria University!"
Sophomore,5,"Ave Maria is a small school with excellent character. The sense of community is unmatched.
Professors genuinely care about there students; at Ave, you are never just a number to them. They do their best to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,My experience at Ave Maria University was the best! I loved everything about the campus and people. Itâ€™s the best school .
Freshman,5,"I love Ave because it is an excellent environment for spiritual and intellectual growth. The people really make Ave great, because it feels like a small town (because it is), and it brings a beautiful community to match the beautiful campus. If anything could change, there could maybe be more public activities to participate in, or perhaps better financial aid opportunities."
Freshman,5,I really like the faith community at Ave Maria University. It helps me grow spiritually. I also love the small campus. The education is really nice too. The professors are amicable and they teach very well.
Junior,5,"It is a great school that has a lot to tother academically, spiritually, and athletically. The student life board puts on many great events throughout the semester so the students can have fun on campus and there are also athletic events as there are many sports at the school. You have a fairly even mix of students and student-athletes which makes for a very diverse school."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Ave Maria University. Students enjoy small class sizes, close relationships with professors, guidance counselors, and peers, and an excellent education. The community is authentically and joyfully Catholic, while respectful of all persons of all faith backgrounds."
Senior,5,Ave Maria University has been a great fit for me! Very Catholic school but with a great science program. The classes are small and you actually get to know your professor. The professors care about their students passing and will help you with any questions you have!
Freshman,5,"My experience so far has been great! The people here are so nice and easy to get along with and the academics are taught with excellence and profession. I would recommend Ave Maria to students who want a structure, delightful education that's going to be worth learning. I wouldn't change a thing here at Ave Maria University!"
Sophomore,5,I love Ave Maria University everyone is nice & friendly. I would recommend this University to everyone.
Alum,5,I had an overall good experience at Ave Maria University and would recommend it. I got a finance major. It was nice to have my family live in Naples and have a car so I could leave town on the weekends. The professors were very knowledgeable as well.
Junior,5,Ave Maria university is a good school with great education and academic! I always feel safe in this environment. I will advice those people to go to this university!
Freshman,5,Amazing growth opportunities and a family friendly environment with each student building up and helping each other become better!
Sophomore,5,"Ave Maria University is great academically, and has a rigorous program. As far as student life, there are no parties."
Niche User,5,A tremendous and throughly Catholic university with much to offer students in every aspect of their intellectual and human formation. This university both challenges students with solid academics and provides opportunities for professors to teach at a truly Catholic institution.
Niche User,5,"I really love it. It is a beautiful campus and the professors are very kind and helpful. It is a good cost for the brilliant academic programs. You might think that it's just a boring Catholic university, but it teaches people to live correctly and is a city on the hill, above the evils of the secular world."
Niche User,5,I like how friendly everyone is at campus. Also I am religious and really appreciated that there are mass times for students and also five priests at the church during the week for confessions.
Junior,5,Ave is a great traditionally Catholic college that provides a challenging liberal arts education. The professors are very intelligent and are willing to help the students learn. The students and staff are very friendly.
College Junior,5,I always feel safe at Ave. There is always someone patrolling the campus. There is never any crimes on campus.
College Junior,5,Ave is a very safe area.There are always security guards surveying the area at night. Alcohol and drugs are prohibited on campus grounds. You will be fined if you are caught with alcohol or drugs.
College Sophomore,5,It is a very safe campus. Security is always around.
College Freshman,5,Rigorous academics. I am getting my money's worth from this unparalleled learning experience.
College Freshman,5,"The only major crimes on campus are people stealing each other's bikes. They are usually found soon after they are taken, though, because there are few places to hide a bike on a small campus where everyone knows each other."
College Freshman,5,Dorms are new and large. Perfect environment to form close friendships.
College Freshman,5,"I expected my college experience at a small, Catholic school to boring, but I've never been more wrong! My first semester has been the most fun and most formative few months of my life. I've learned a lot with respect to academics and life lessons, made wonderful friends, cultivated relationships with prominent professors, began working out, managed a budget, and enjoyed clean parties and school-wide weekend festivities. My only complaint about my wonderful school is our horrible mosquito problem."
College Freshman,5,Very safe and secure campus
College Freshman,5,"Amazing campus, people, and teachers!"
College Freshman,5,I love my university so much.
College Freshman,5,"AMU has an amazing environment to live in! The facilities are new and well kept, although it is quite expensive since the school is still small"
College Freshman,5,The classes are tough but the professors are top notch
College Freshman,5,The school is very helpful when it comes to helping students afford the school.  There are a lot of people that donate scholarships to the school and are willing to help a student out who is struggling.
College Freshman,5,"Once again, this school is in the middle of nowhere.  We have campus security on call 24/7, and there are blue boxes all over campus.  Our head of campus was a sharpshooter in the armed forces. You can leave your luggage outside the dorms and not worry that it will be stolen.  Probably the safest campus at least in the States."
College Freshman,5,"Southwest Florida, best weather there is probably."
College Freshman,5,"Very few issues with parking. The dorm lots only fill up around 11pm on weeknights, and rarely is it an issue. There's plenty of spaces all over campus."
College Freshman,5,Weather is amazing year round
College Sophomore,5,Ave is located in a small community.  Most of the professors and their families live in the communities next to the campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Ave Maria University, is a small college campus located just outside of Naples.   I feel very safe here.   There is the campus police who travel around the campus.   They make an effort to get to know the students.  The campus is well lit and there are emergency call poles throughout the campus"
College Sophomore,5,There is never really a drug problem at Ave Maria University. There is a pub but that require ID to be able to drink or smoke. Also there is constant security around campus on the look out for underaged drinking and smoking.
College Freshman,5,"Ave Maria has a great atmosphere. It is built by the looks of Italy. It has great restaurants and shops. Its campus is in the town Ave maria so it has a lot to do. They have many activities and many sports.  They provide gym and pool for the students. There library is open 24 hour so students are able to go use it anytime as they wish. The students attitude is fairly good, everyone respects each other and is very nice."
College Freshman,5,This town is like smallville  the people who live here are great  there is no crime  I came here to get an education not party and get drunk I love it!
College Freshman,5,"You can get just about every type of food its great all food groups and religion
groups are all cater to. I love Ave Maria!!"
College Sophomore,5,"I see it as a structured environment for us to study in. There are some rules that many people wouldn't agree with, but they really aren't a problem if you are there to learn."
College Sophomore,5,"Gorgeous campus, everything is brand new, you really can't go wrong in any of the dorms."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not yet enrolled, but I don't believe that many of the students here could ever do drugs. not because of lack of availability, but it seems a campus averse to such things as a whole."
College Sophomore,5,"Ave Maria is a great place to be in. I can have a faith, and being there helps me to grow deeper on it. Everyone that is looking for a good school with good academics, and growing athletic dept. Ave Maria is the right choice."
College Senior,5,"I feel very safe on campus, minus an occasional gator!"
College Freshman,5,"Classics and Literature â€“ The literature department is cutting edge. In the entire country, we have some of the best. The Classics is similarly amazing."
College Freshman,5,"Ave Is Small but Solid â€“ Come here for the academics, not the night life. The families in town are wonderful. The social life is great. But it's not really made or intended to be for the raucous."
College Senior,5,"Best Academics in the County â€“ Ave has the best Liberal Arts program in the nation, already being compared to Ivy league schools. The Literature program is undoubtedly one of the best in the nation."
College Senior,5,Process Was Smooth and Simple â€“ I received a half scholarship and it has helped greatly.  They truly see students as their priority here in every way and seek to help us as much as possible.
College Senior,5,Good Morals and Values Are Encouraged â€“ The university fosters an inspiring sense of virtue within its students and is firm in its mission.
College Freshman,5,"Very Good â€“ The university offers a weight room, a new gym, and the library. Student government offers a lot of activities for students to do."
College Freshman,5,Don't Really Need Security â€“ Students don't really get into any trouble on campus. There is little crime. I feel very safe walking around alone at night.
College Freshman,5,"There is absolutely no need for a car on campus. The buildings are close together, and the dorms are only a few-minutes walk from the academic area of campus. There is no cost for parking, and there are plenty of parking spots on campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Hands down, one of the safest places I've ever been. We have security and all that, but it's the students and the university town that really make up the community life. I've left my laptop in public for hours and other personal belongings for days, and have never worried nor lost anything save a Pop-Tart, and that surprised me considering the campus. I would never do anything of the sort anywhere else in the world."
College Freshman,5,"Some of the Best â€“ The academics are for sure one of the best things about Ave. The professors are all learned in their respective fields, and most of them demand respect. The academics are challenging but good and definitely worth the effort."
College Senior,5,"The Catholicity of the campus shines through every building and classroom with artwork and images that lift the soul to the God. The facilities are always clean and inviting, giving the feel one is in a place of prestige and comfort. Everything on campus is very convenient."
College Freshman,5,High Tech! This is a wired campus!
College Freshman,5,The Epitome of Rad! I heart this college!
Freshman,4,"The professors are very kind and willing to help, a beautiful campus, and very kind staff.  The cafeteria food is okay but could be better haha."
Junior,4,online school at Ave Maria University is good. The teachers are very kind and they want you to do well in the class
Freshman,4,"Ave Maria University has done a superb job in making it possible for students to attend classes in person during this time. They have a very thorough health and safety plan put in place for the protection of the faculty and students, as well as safety procedures followed in the cafeteria and classroom setting. All students wear masks in public buildings and during class. If it is necessary to go online, we will use Microsoft Teams. All students were trained in using Teams at the beginning of the semester. It is very smooth and easy to understand."
Junior,4,Ave Maria University offers a wonderful education based on Catholic beliefs and provides amazing friendships that will last a lifetime.
Sophomore,4,"Because of COVID-19, Classes became online at the end of the 2019-2020 school year. Despite the shakiness and unpredictability of the time, Ave handled it well. Professors were understanding of the strain that the shift brought and did their best to make online learning a positive experience. Studentsâ€™ and familiesâ€™ voices were heard throughout the experience, and Ave did its best to responsibly cater to the unique needs of everyone"
Freshman,4,Online classes were a breeze. Ave Maria made the transition to online really smooth. This helped as it wasnâ€™t too confusing. With C
Alum,4,"I attended Ave Maria when it was still fairly new and only offered a select number of majors. The studies were tough, the professors were mostly helpful, but sometimes the lessons were rough to get through. You definitely had to work hard for your grades when I was there."
Alum,4,"I did not take online classes at the university that I recall, but they have become great with online resources and tasks."
Freshman,4,"Being familiar with online learning I was able to transition from the classroom to online. Since, we were allowed to stay interactive , it was like being in the classroom yet in the comforts of home."
Freshman,4,Nothing to change. All teachers are willing to help students after students show their willingness to ask for help.
Sophomore,4,Ave Maria University is a great place to grow if you are looking for a safe and small campus. It is super small but the people are caring and will always take care of you no matter what.
Niche User,4,"From the teachers to the sunset views Ave Maria is a perfect dream. However, it comes with a pretty hefty cost. Sadly, the University offers little scholarships especially to student athletes. So while it is a beautiful place filled with uplifting people, it may be out of reach due to cost."
Sophomore,4,"A nurturing, mellow environment for the one who takes things in stride. Strong communal values, expect to say hello to almost every passerby on campus as they will, in all likelihood, be one of many acquaintances. Any path you would like can have its start here with the amount of networking and resources at hand- a good choice for the one who takes the chance to be a step ahead at all times."
Sophomore,4,"The close knit community atmosphere makes Ave stand out above other small liberal arts colleges.  From this atmosphere, it makes it easier to become closer with the professors as well as fellow students. The faith aspect also helps bring the community together; for, everyone knows that they can share one common goal in life - spiritual wellness. Despite being secluded from a bigger city or town, Ave does not lack in local activities. From Student Life to the local Farmerâ€™s Market in the town center, Ave makes sure there is always something to look forward to. Ave may be small, but it has a big heart."
Freshman,4,Very reliable communication and helpful admissions counselours. It has a great campus and a wide variety of sports and activities.
Senior,4,"Ave Maria has a great community and awesome professors. Campus life seems to be improving every year. However Catholic they tell you it is, it's still a college and they are still trying to get as much money from you as they can"
Junior,4,"The community is great and the people are awesome. It is easy to make friends and the environment is good and safe. The academics are wonderful and good quality and the professors are very knowledgeable. However, the food in the cafeteria is not good and the campus is somewhat isolated."
Sophomore,4,"Ave Maria University is a wonderful Catholic school. The education is superb and the school had brilliant professors. The food is terrible though. If you are a vegetarian, good luck trying to eat. The food is mostly poorly cooked meat. However, the location of the school is very nice. I love living in southern Florida."
Freshman,4,"If you are a practicing Christian, specifically Catholic, Ave Maria University is a fantastic choice for you. Extremely unrecognized as one of the top Catholic schools compared to Franciscan University of Steubenville or Benedictine College, Ave Maria has a vibrant and warm welcoming community filled with tons of opportunities to get involved with the community. Many include recreational sports like intramural sand volleyball and soccer, equestrian club and many Christian households. If you are looking for a university to uphold and foster your Christian practices, Ave Maria University is the place for you."
Niche User,4,Ave Maria University is a great school. Whether you are catholic or not you will be able to find a place there. In some aspects the school is too focused on catholicism and I would like to see them put more effort into student life and athletics.
Junior,4,I liked the academics and the professors; the classes are challenging and the professors are always willing to help. The food really needs to change; it's terrible.
Sophomore,4,There is a strong Catholic identity and a close knit community at Ave Maria University. The only downside is there is not much to do around in the town.
College Junior,4,I absolutely loved my experience at Ave Maria University. I met some awesome people and learned a lot about myself. This school also really helped me to grow stronger in my faith.
College Sophomore,4,Academics are very important. Professors are always helpful and the curriculum is up to date and challenging. Registration for them can be difficult. It is best to do it as soon as it opens. Workload is average.
College Sophomore,4,Most students find jobs right after graduation and pass board exams.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small. This offers for more intimate learning experiences.
College Sophomore,4,Our campus is very concerned on safety. We are given numbers and directions every year to help in case of emergency. Only disregard is that campus should be lit better at night.
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is good. Girl's dorms could be a little bigger. More rec space and laundry space is needed.
College Sophomore,4,We do not have Greek life. We refer to them as households. They are tons of fun and are a huge part of the school.
College Sophomore,4,"Due to its small size, Ave feels like a family. From adorations, to football games, to households, this school has created so many memories. I would choose it again."
College Junior,4,"I think the campus is very safe, and I have no problem walking around at night. There is a campus security person on duty at all times, and the students generally don't get into trouble. Crime on campus isn't much of a problem. Other than drugs or the occasional theft there are not many issues."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus there is excellent. There is a great sense of community there, and it has an overall great atmosphere. The dorms themselves are fine with only minor problems here and there. The biggest downside is that living on campus is a little expensive and the school makes it really hard to live off campus."
College Junior,4,"I Love this school because it really focuses on making the student a well-rounded and overall better person. The faculty and teachers care about the students' success in the classroom and outside of it. They want the students to become better people and grow in their faith as well as learn. Also, the students here are amazing. They are extremely friendly and caring, and they really push you to be the best person you can be. Easter there is a great example of this because many of the students still there over brake come together to celebrate this feast together as a community. Many go the the vigil mass and then head over to the Resurrection Part after words to celebrate and spend time with each other. Seeing all of the joy there was a really moving experience."
College Junior,4,The Academics at Ave are very challenging. The professors really push you to do well.
College Junior,4,Ave Maria is Avery devout catholic college. Most of the students are Catholic.  They will accept anyone from any race or religion.
College Junior,4,The dorms are very big and nice. The dorms usually fit four people. It is very expensive to live on campus(around $4000) Room mates are very nice and friendly. They are very easy to get along with.
College Junior,4,"I absolutely loved my experience and Ave Maria University. The courses are very difficult, but you will do fine as long as you study and complete assignments on time. The professors are very helpful. They really care about you and they will be more than willing to help you if you are struggling in a particular subject."
College Sophomore,4,The courses are usually very interesting and the professors are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"The students are smart, the professors are helpful, and the overall motivation to succeed is evident."
College Sophomore,4,Rigorous academics with great professors
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of student participation in sports. More students could go to the games though.
College Sophomore,4,There are very few people who engage in drug/alcohol abuse.
College Sophomore,4,"Very spacious, clean and new"
College Freshman,4,Athletics are an important part of student life
College Freshman,4,"My school is unique due to its religious aspect. I am not sure if I would choose to go here again if I could do it all over, because I feel like I am missing out on a lot of the ""typical"" college experience. On the other hand, I am happy with my decision to go here as I am excelling in classes and am happy with the campus."
College Sophomore,4,Ave Maria is pretty awesome! There are many great teachers and students here.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, Ave is a pretty awesome place. There are amazing people there, and you develops some pretty close friendships. The Academics are pretty tough, but the professors are very helpful and they will go out of their way to help you, if you are having difficulties with a particular subject."
College Freshman,4,"campus security is great, but they need to be more strict about substance abuse"
College Sophomore,4,Our school administrators are constantly trying to maintain an equilibrium between giving each student their freedom as adults and keeping a safe and respectable community.
College Sophomore,4,I received a good academic scholarship from the school which greatly aided my ability to attend there.
College Sophomore,4,"Compared to many other schools the dorm size is great! Each room easily fits two or more students plus their personal things. The buildings are clean and each room has its own bathroom, which is a huge plus!"
College Freshman,4,A few fast food places about 15 miles away. Plenty of food choices in naples though.
College Freshman,4,Cafe has way better food then the actually cafeteria
College Freshman,4,Dorms are brand new and very spacious. Social atmosphere is not the best but you learn how to adjust.
College Sophomore,4,"Because the school is relatively small, everyone knows just about everyone and there is a great sense of community and friendship between everyone. Granted, there are the occasional dumbheads, but otherwise it is awesome."
College Junior,4,"We are required to live on campus all 4 years, unless you are 23 or have family in the area. However the dorms are some of the nicest dorms I have ever seen on a college campus. They are spacious, clean, and there is individual bathrooms in each room. Comparatively it is much better than other campuses."
College Freshman,4,Intramural are awesome at Ave.
College Freshman,4,"The scholarship process went smoothly, but the school is still small and I will have a great amount of debt."
College Freshman,4,"For the girls, the dorms are very spacious, and every dorm room has a shower and toilet.  Four people live in the dorm, two on each side of a wall.  Each side comes with two beds, two dressers, to bookshelves, two desks, and two closets.  I'm not sure what the guys' dorms look like, but I've heard that they are also very nice."
College Freshman,4,You always see security on their bikes patrolling campus every where you go. There are posts where you can push a buttonin case of emergency and help will be with you in 5 min or less. There's hardly any crime that goes on campus.  No cases of sexual assault. One of these reasons is the way the dorms are set up and their rules regarding girls being in them.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't a huge party scene that happens.
College Sophomore,2,Some people do drugs but they don't bother others
College Freshman,2,"The food from the cafateria is good quality, although over priced due to the size of the school. Every student is required to be on the meal plan and the only other place to eat is the cafe which you reeive $50 per semester to spend there"
College Sophomore,2,There have been several days where I put the food in my mouth so that I won't be hungry and that is all. I don't even know what I'm eating sometimes.
College Freshman,2,"There is a diversity of Hispanics, African Americans, and Causcasians.  However, it is a very religious school.  Most of the people here are Republican, Catholic, and identify as straight as far as I know.  There are some exceptions, but not too many."
College Freshman,2,"There is little diversity here.  The girls are mostly Catholic ""angels"" and most of the guys are players.  Sometimes it's the other way around, but that is my experience here."
College Freshman,2,"This school is in the middle of nowhere.  It has its own little town, but there is not much to do here.  The entire atmosphere is very Catholic-oriented.  The college wifi is always going out, and the college has blocked several sites, including Tumblr.  However, it is a very safe campus, and the salad bar is always good.  There is no Greek Life, but they do have Households (I've only heard about religious ones).  Don't trust the food."
College Freshman,2,Hard to find a good party since people are against fun and everything it stands for
College Freshman,2,They helped people in the same situation as I am in way faster and they received big scholarships while they have me crap.
College Freshman,2,There's just houses nearby so if you wanted to live near campus you would pretty much have to but a house or commute 45 minutes from the nearest apartments
College Freshman,2,Someone recently tried to start a frat but wad shut down quickly
College Freshman,2,It's a little too strict
College Freshman,2,"Alright... The Nightlife. Here's your Ave nightlife in a painfully truthful summary, there's the Pub, there's the Gazebos, there's the infrequent single sex dorm room party (or the both which ends by midnight and will have RA's stopping by), then there's a few other locations that will pop up now and then, not as popular but that's for good reason.

I'll describe a typical weekend night here, at least from a party perspective. You'll hang out in a dorm room for a bit, with your friends. Around 10, you'll mosey over to the Pub, hang out there until 2. At 2 when the pub closes, you'll head to the Gazebos, they're in a field between all the dorms, decent size. Someone usually brings out speakers and now you'll hang out here until you decide to go to bed, or security stops by and depending on the person sometimes will give you a hard time. 

Honestly that^ happens more often than not. There's a few exceptions now and then, and different groups of people do different things. It's not a party school. But, if you meet some good people- which is easy to do, you can make your fun."
College Freshman,2,"Very little happens in Ave Town. Few restaurants, a Publix, a gas station, and that about sums it up."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is strict. That's a fact. A lot of obnoxious rules will be enforced. There's a lot to say here but I'll keep it short, the rules are strict, the enforcing varies but is more often then not, strict."
College Freshman,2,"There are only a few restaurants on campus, so in order to get different food, students have to drive elsewhere to find places. The food on campus is god and cheap, however, making it easy for students to find a place."
Niche User,2,There is not much off campus dining being that the town of Ave Maria controls who they let in. The dining that's in the town looks good but I have not had the opportunity yet to try on campus dining.
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics at Ave Maria are just beginning to come into their own. Facilities are not great, but projects are underway as far as a football stadium. The basketball teams (men's and women's) are easily the most fun sporting events to attend at the school."
College Freshman,2,"Words Cannot Express Our Shame â€“ Both Men & Women's basketball and soccer are good. Our football team sucks. Like for real. Men's baseball is adequate, girl's softball is promising. Cross country has suffered the loss of their coach and nationals runner so...not so hot."
College Freshman,2,Middle of Nowhere â€“ It's located in a little town. the only thing around is Publix which closes at 7.
Senior,1,"Very poor university, student life is terrible and the people running it donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing"
Freshman,1,"There is no social life.if you like to take courses that will do you no good this is your place. the school athletics is a joke,they should just recruit and hold tryout with in,they cant do any worse."
Alum,1,"I would not recommend this school to anyone. Unless of course you like the idea of a school that really doesn't have much going for it. Most of the professors are good...but, some classes are taught by only one professor. And Ave is horrible about taking transfer credits for upper division courses. So you could easily have a required class in your major that is only offered by one awful professor. And there is absolutely no way around that professor, because you will not be allowed to take that course anywhere but Ave. Furthermore, the majors Ave offers tend not to be very useful, which to their credit they are pretty open about. With the exception of nursing, healthcare management, and business, the only real options are pre-med and pre-law. (Biochem, history, etc.)  Everything else there just prepares you to stand in the unemployment line."
Freshman,1,"Attending Ave Maria was the worst decision of my life. I would describe myself as ambitious, and hardworking, and the truth is that nobody at Ave is doing anything with their lives. The professors are haughty and unreachable, and classes are boring. The students are generally friendly but lack any passion and excitement for life. The athletics are a joke and most of the athletes are only there for the scholarship. The campus is beautiful and the dorms are nice, but the actual town is VERY isolated. Do bring a car because Naples is 45 minutes away and there is nothing to do on weekends. The cafeteria is awful, no healthy options."
Freshman,1,It is an overwhelmly strict school in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do. No one can ever stay past 2-3 semesters because they begin to go insane from the lack of activity on campus and the distance from anything cool. They try to improve the athletics every year but they donâ€™t have the facilities nor the appeal to retain any success. If youâ€™re looking to have fun while in college or be close to anything remotely interesting this is not the school for you.
Sophomore,1,"Ave Maria University is a very limited place to be. If you don't have a car, you are trapped here, as the nearest city is a 45 minute drive away. In the town, there is absolutely nothing besides a Publix and a gas station. It is also very hard to fit in socially. There are ""aves"" (strictly Catholic, judgmental people) and athletes who only attend here because they got athletic scholarships. The programs aren't very good. Unless you are a theology or education major, you may struggle finding help and resources for your major. "
College Sophomore,1,"Off-Campus housing would be fantastic; however, you have to be 23+ so there are very few people who take advantage of that."
College Freshman,1,5th avenue in Naples (35 min drive) is the best option for a saturday night (21 and older obviously)
College Freshman,1,Lucky day if your food is fully cooked
College Sophomore,1,Ghost Town â€“ The entire town shuts down at 7pm. The school is located 40 miles away from any civilization. Literally nothing to do on campus which leads to lots of drug use and underage drinking.
College Freshman,1,this place sucks. you get fined for every little thing. you can't have tvs in your dorms and no girls allowed in your dorms.
College Senior,1,"Not So Average â€“ I'm not particularly thrilled to be at Ave Maria for my senior year. It doesn't help that I was forced to leave my last school due to it closing. Overall, Ave Maria has good people and they encourage community. However, I feel that some of my professors have no desire to help their students because they think they are so much better than their students. It is their job as a professor to help their students, especially when the student realizes that they are struggling in the class and come for help. 

I also feel that there are not enough areas for guys and girls to hang out together. There are so many couples on campus that the common rooms fill up quickly. Another thing is that the food is pretty much awful a majority of the time. There are plenty of options so I don't ever go hungry, but considering how much I pay for my meal plan, I expect much better quality in the food. I am counting down the days to graduation-that is if my professors actually start to help me so I can graduate."
College Junior,1,"There is no public transportation. The school will run shuttles to the store once in a while, and students often share their cars or offer rides on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Fines Fines Fines â€“ There is a rule about almost everything, and for each broken rule there is a fine. Examples include: opposite sex in dorm, $200; underage drinking, $150; taking the Lord's name in vain, $10; and curse words, $10. There are also many more. Also, the athletes are required to wear nice clothing: collared shirts and khakis for guys, and dress attire for the ladies. The classes keep attendance and, for the most part, fail a student if they are absent five times in a semester."
College Freshman,1,"Very hard â€“ The academics at Ave are extremely difficult. Not only do the professors move at a pace that students cannot keep up with, but most do not know how to relate material to students in a way they will understand. The academic credits are, for the most part, non-transferable either. Aside from biology, calculus, and a few others, the rest would either not transfer or become an elective credit. "

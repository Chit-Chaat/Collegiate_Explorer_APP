Junior,5,My experience with MCA have and will be amazing. The teachers are so passionate about their works and have helped me become the best me i have ever been.
Sophomore,5,"This college has been a great experience, however it is closing soon. I will be the last class to graduate from there sadly."
Sophomore,5,I love this school!Everyone is very helpful and cares about your success at MCA.I attended here last spring and Im ready for what the Fall has to offer me
College Junior,5,The security on campus is 24hr. They are a very helpful and approachable staff. If I'm every working at the school really late at night they will walk you to the car and make sure you're safe. They are also helpful if you need help finding a classroom on your first day.
College Sophomore,5,We have extremely little crime on campus.
College Freshman,5,Knowledgeable instructors that recognize each individual's talents and challenges them to explore fields that they are not familiar with or may be uncomfortable with.
College Sophomore,5,I love the food here. It's delicious! The cooks are awesome!
College Sophomore,5,"The computer labs here are pretty awesome. There are plenty of MAC computers throughout the campus that are filled with awesome design, animation, etc. programs. It takes some getting used to if you've never used MAC computers before, but the staff is there to help. Even though there are occasional problems, everything always gets taken care of."
College Junior,5,"The majors at MCA are what any visual artist could really want. The courses are challenging, the way any real artist would want it. The professors are always willing to assist students in any way they can help, along with being very devoted to their own artistic endeavors outside of school. The school helps all students find and cultivate relationships with companies and individuals that look for what MCA students have to offer professionally."
College Sophomore,5,"I love how many available options there are! Seriously, any kind of food you can imagine, Memphis has probably got it. Indian, Chinese, Korean, great pizza, amazing deserts, famous for BBQ and hamburgers... The list is endless. Cost-wise, you will only find a few places for really cheap.. Most places are either under or way over $10. It really just depends on your budget and how big your appetite is. Everything is in pretty close range to the school, and I have found some places that offer student discount."
College Sophomore,5,"We Dont Care. We don't have a ""greek"" life. its best this way"
Junior,4,The school is a great place and its sad the school is closing. I have learned a lot there and most professors teach really well. The safety of students is a priority because all doors have to have an ID for students to get in. They don't pick up students from the dorms though unless the shuttle is picking up during certain times.
Sophomore,4,MCA is a beautiful school with awesome architecture. It has very advanced technology and is very well kept up. The faculty is always friendly and helpful and so are the other students. Most of the courses are fun and they help magnify your creativity. They open your mind to different interests and possible careers. They taught me different techniques of making art that I would never think I could use. Though a few of these courses are a bit arbitrary they never fail to teach you something possibly useful. This school is pretty safe and I feel comfortable in it as well.
Sophomore,4,"The school pushes you, but with time management it itsn't tough at all. I've improved significantly from when I started... getting your pieces on the wall is a huge achievement, as most classes have room for one or two student works per class to put on the wall so competition is fierce. All the teachers and students agree that Color Theory and 3D design are the worst classes and need some way to make it interesting. 3D design is more challenging than anything, so fair warning to new students... it will make you hate art school. I promise, however, that every class will redeem what you lost through that class. Take IPC during the summer. Its a tough course too. Dorms are wonderful and clean all around, with only roommates themselves causing complaints. You're able to walk to school and to the Square in around 10 minutes or less. Super convenient. Little on the expensive side, but the teachers really care about what their students are putting out. "
College Junior,4,The career service center cares about each student finding a great job/internship in their field of study. The career service center holds classes and powerpoint presentations on how to properly layout and do resume. They talk with us about how to conduct and present ourselves in an interview and the employer is looking for.
College Junior,4,I like that I am in an artistic environment. The teachers are helpful and care about each students success. They let each student express themselves through their work and encourage us to better each project we do.
College Sophomore,4,"There are all types of races on campus. No one gets persecuted for their beliefs, political standing, or orientation."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are small, teachers are great and caring."
College Sophomore,4,Fogelman/Metz are awesome if you can afford it.
College Sophomore,4,The faculty is what makes this school amazing.
College Freshman,4,Professors are easy to talk to. I'd prefer all my classes to be small.
College Junior,4,"Security is always walking around. They are some pretty nice people, they usually speak and make sure you're doing okay if you're alone."
College Sophomore,4,I wish I had a chance to really have time to put my all into projects but I've still learned a lot.
College Sophomore,4,Administration is awesome. They want you to have a positive and productive learning environment
College Sophomore,4,Don't be afraid to talk to anyone about it. They're really great to work with and they want to help as much as they can.
College Sophomore,4,I don't live on campus but my best friends did. I spent a lot of time there and it was great.
College Freshman,4,"Many students seem to have similar interests since most of the students are art enthusiasts. A lot of students also seem to be more into ""alternative"" fashion."
College Freshman,4,"There are many dining options from chain restaurants to nice, higher end dining. Prices vary depending on where you want to go."
College Freshman,4,"Most students get a scholarship upon acceptance to the school. Throughout the school year, more scholarships are made available for us to apply to. There are plenty of opportunities to not have to resort to student loans."
College Senior,4,The school is midtown so there are artsy things to do. Nice restaurants and bars to go to. Cool shopping spots and museums.
College Senior,4,"The campus police is there to assists us. They always walk or drive around the campus to make sure things are okay. If there are any problems going on like robbery or assaults, they will send out emails or notify us ahead of time to stay safe and be cautious of our surroundings."
College Junior,2,"They expect you to graduate and go be a ""Real"" artist. I am trying to work with the career services dept., but I am just getting ignored. There are many unrealistic expectations and there aren't adequate resources in terms of careers after college."
College Student,2,"Honest even back in my middle school year I've never like school lunch, if not most then all school lunch aren't delicious enough to purchase."
College Student,2,"finding financial aid to support my college is a bit tedious, unnecessary, and honestly, ridiculous. Most scholarship involve taking surveys and and raffles and essay and its all a little pointless."
College Junior,2,"There are plenty of places to look at or stay near the school but the only problem would be the amount of activity in the area. By activity I would be referring to the people and their actions in the area. Most of the activity is positive like park events, and neighbor functions. The rest of the activity is certain amounts of violence and crime in the area."
College Junior,2,"The school is in the middle of a park, there is only parking on the street around the school. If you don't know how to parallel park, you better learn fast."
College Junior,1,"There are no athletics! They offer a free membership to a local gym, which is great. They have also started shuttling students to the gym, which is awesome for those who don't have cars or don't want to go alone."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have an athletic program here. There are small clubs that do athletic activities, but there's no official athletic program."
College Freshman,1,"There's aren't any official sports at Memphis College of Art. We have clubs foe running and stuff like that, but that's about it."

Freshman,5,"What I like about Hallmark university is the atmosphere, overall when you are at the campus you feel like you belong there. The friendliness of the instructions and the friends you gain while in the program. I feel like I am encouraged and listened to while I am there."
Junior,5,"I currently attend Hallmark University and am enrolled in their BSN program. What attracted me to Hallmark was their small class sizes. The small classes  make me feel like my education is more personalized. For someone who succeeds better in smaller groups, this was a perfect fit for me. I also knew many people that attended Hallmark University that shared positive experiences with me. They expressed their love for the class sizes and enthusiasm of the professors. I too have experienced this enthusiasm among the faculty. Every faculty member I come in contact with expresses their love for hallmark and their passion for education. At Hallmark I feel like my education is valued and taken seriously."
Sophomore,5,"I like how all of the staff members are very positive and very nice. I have been in school since August, but every time I do not know where something is the lady at the front desk is so helpful and very nice. The one reason I chose to come to Hallmark University was how short my program is, which is really great. The professors have been so helpful and you can really tell they want you to succeed."
Junior,5,"Hallmark University is a great campus! All of the staff members are fantastic because they really care about your education. Hallmark University also has great resources everything is online which is perfect nowadays. We also have a great student life and development department with a lot of services available to students. For example, we have a graduate placement program which helps students with resumes, interviews and job search. Also we have campus ministry so we have prayer meetings, biblical leadership for excellence, and 1347 gathering. Our campus ministry is phenomenal. We also have student organizations and those include: Honor society, student ambassadors, presidents council. I do not think I want anything changed about this school I think it is great!"
Freshman,5,"This is the college for driven, technical, introverts. The campus is cozy and easy to navigate. My classes have students ranging from ages 16 to 47. It is Veteran friendly, and I have my general class schedule mapped out for the next 2 years. I love the structure, the fact that key leaders know who I am, and that they walk you through the basics so everyone can start class with a solid foundation. They build character and knowledge."
College Junior,5,The tuition is worth every class that I am taking at this school. The financial aid was helpful in making sure that all my tuition would be budgeted and organized.

The style is usually the same, classroom setting with some hands on here and there. Classes are roughly twenty people. All the courses are the same, no deviations from course planner. It's an FAA regulated school so it's got rules here and there. Its a professional environment, tucked in shirts, blue jeans, that kinda stuff."
College Senior,5,"The administration works hard to make it as easy of a process to get you into school. I barely had to do anything but Sign papers. Everyone goes through the same program, seeing as how were all going for the same ticket. Some classes are tough, some are shorter then others so you have to study harder not to fall behind."
College Senior,5,"It's a very in depth experience so study, you'll fall behind fast if you don't keep up with it. Everything is offered from books to study partners. The teachers have always been real good about staying after to help you if you need it. The computer labs are open all day."

College Senior,4,"For what hallmark is it's a good school. They're to the point and have a lot of knowledge to offer. All the teachers have their A&P and years of on the job experience to tell stories and connect. We're at the airport so I love the environment and the people that are getting into this field are usually relaxed. For the most part, it's a good school."
College Junior,4,We have a computer lab that is available to us at all times and the printing is free !
Alum,2,"Associate of Applied Science Degree (2015)

My time with Hallmark wasn't that great. The student loans setup took forever and before I had started with Hallmark the recruiters were spamming my phone just to get me to enroll.  For classes some of them require you to attend physically and others are only online. Though all classes should have been online because say I take a computer class physical you'll just end up going through a PowerPoint and then class is over. Rarely will you get hands on experience.

Don't get me started on some of the instructors and staff at that school. Most of them will have that ""fake"" let me help you attitude, but once you graduate and need assistance they will throw you to the curb. Don't get me started on John Lee and Lacey. There are a few instructors that are really passionate about teaching, but the way the school is setup doesn't help you succeed.

Understand that my experience will be different than yours, but through me it wasn't worth it at all."
College Senior,2,"Non Existant – When i first started we had someone that would help you find the job you were looking for. And now after about of a year there they made budget cuts and now really dont focus at all about the career survices, just making sure you take the classes your suppose too."
Alum,1,"Classes are either physical or online. Since I took the computer path you'll still have to take basic subjects like English, Speech, Math, and etc. A lot of the time you'll be writing reports and do discussion the school's online board.

The thing is though computer classes I had that were physical always had lessons from a PowerPoint or videos. Rarely will we actually get any hands-on experience.  So it made no sense in coming in-person to do those classes

Some of the instructors are passionate about teaching while others just go off the PowerPoint and then the class is over, making it no different than doing an online class."
Works Here,1,Horrible! Teachers don’t know what they’re supposed to be teaching financial aid robs you. Harassment lots of harassment! Super sexist! Teachers constantly talking to students about their sex life during classes or showing dumb videos since they have no idea what to teach.
Alum,1,Very bad school. Financial aid never wants to do their job. They can never keep teachers for longer than a single class every teacher will tell you something different. Very sexist school. Females are always being harassed. Overall would NEVER recommend to anyone.

Freshman,5,All the professors have done an excellent job utilizing the internet and other resources to bring a pleasant learning experience to me personally.
Freshman,5,The overall online experience was great! The questions that I did have I was able to email my professor to they email me back quickly and gave me references so that I could remember. I do believe online learning is not for everyone just depends on the individual. My experience was pretty good
Freshman,5,Schoolcraft has a very easy-to-learn network and online classes are incredibly quick to adapt to. Easy to access supplies and the teachers still stay involved with the class.
Freshman,5,Schoolcraft is a very approachable and understanding school that offers plenty of courses to all walks of life.

Sophomore,5,I took the CNA semester long program and thoroughly enjoyed this class and school. The professors were very informative and easy to talk with and get a hold of. The program allowed me to get a job at a local hospital within 1 month after completing the course. I am looking forward to being in the RN program. The technology/simulation labs they use for nursing programs is very advanced and new. I would recommend Schoolcraft for an affordable yet promising degree/education.
Sophomore,5,I like that Schoolcraft college is always there to help with any thing that you need help with. They make everything as easy as possible from applying to the college to talking at advisors about programs and classes to finding out what books are needed for class. Since I started at Schoolcraft college I have not had one bad experiences.

I love the fact that Schoolcraft can accept anyone no matter who they are, their income status, and/or their school status. They give us a chance to have an entry, standard education to either continue to stay in the school or transfer to a university.  I think this college is more advanced than in other universities. I am so grateful that they accepted me right away. It seems like they truly care that they have the responsibility to lift up their students to accomplish their goals in life. I will never forget this moment. I would like to thank Schoolcraft for accepting me right away. I am looking forward to continuing my education there."
Junior,5,My experience at Schoolcraft has been great. I will be leaving Schoolcraft with an Associates in Business Administration. The professors are great and they are willing to work with you. My advisor has helped me find out what I want to do after college and has led me to receiving my associates. I have made new friends and been able to get involved with things going on campus. I like the smaller feeling of the campus and the smaller class sizes. I have been able to have my classes work around my work schedule which has been helpful. Overall I am happy with the choice I made about going to Schoolcraft.
Sophomore,5,I love the flexibility I have with class schedules. Most of the professors are amazing but there's always a handful that simply need to retire or move on. I love the campus set up due to all of my classes being in one building because of my career choice theirs a campus dedicated to just public safety.
Alum,5,I loved the small campus and that it was close to home. They are forever adding new courses/programs and expanding. Most of the teachers there seemed to love teaching and were very good.

Sophomore,5,"My first year of college was at School craft College. Despite how difficult the classes got, the school helped me a lot.

Senior,5,"Overall my experience at Schoolcraft has bee exceptional. I will be starting their nursing program this fall of 2019 and so far the experience has been smooth and easy. From the counselors to the advisers, everyone I have spoken to have shown urgency to help me in any way possible. One thing I would like to see different would be the financial aid office as I feel at time there is a long wait with a slow pace. Other than that I have not had any issues with the school and would highly recommend it to anyone, especially those looking into becoming a nurse."
Freshman,5,they have small classes which is great because it gives you one on one with professors. They have a safe and clean campus as well as amazing food since they're culinary arts program is one of the best in the area. Professors and nice and easy to get a hold of.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy how Schoolcraft  gives you the ability to be able to do what you want, and give you the opportunity to be involved in several activities. The food is great and all the teaches and staff have great attitudes."

Everyone from financial aid off to records processing they’re all friendly and very helpful. I’m thankful and really appreciate the school."
Sophomore,5,I had a hard time getting back in school and getting on the right track. Schoolcraft was great at assisting in my return. The people are great. Lots of great programs.
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed the amount of resources available to me despite the college only being a community college. 
The staff make sure to be there for your mental and academic success.
In no way would a professor ever decline a student the need for extra attention towards their journey in reaching their academic goals.
At the beginning of each lecture, the professors make it clear that they want to see each of their students strive for excellence.
The school makes me feel safe and free to walk around campus without a worry in the world that a thing could go wrong!"
Sophomore,5,"Schoolcraft Community College was the best decision when it came to thinking about my future. Great area, many places to get food in between classes, right by the highway, and there sports teams are great. This was the cheapest route and it gave me lots of opportunities to grow and it made me feel ready to move onto a University after a few years. Not to mention, there food is THEE best and very cheap which is dangerous because I keep going back for more!"
Niche User,5,"I have loved attending Schoolcraft college in the past, and hope to continue in the future. The teachers are very personable and the atmosphere is very positive and welcoming."
Sophomore,5,I have only attended Schoolcraft Community College for one semester so far. Comparing it to my previous University I have realized Schoolcraft Community College is a very comfortable friendly environment where professors seem to truly care what you are preparing for in and outside of class. I plan to take a few more semesters at this college and look forward to each semester that is moderately affordable compared to a university.
Sophomore,5,"Schoolcraft college is a great local community college for especially for the people who live right around Livonia, MI. It is super close to the people who live around it and very easy to get there. It's a great place to start off your college life or if you're returning to college. The campus isn't too small and not too big where you get lost."
Sophomore,5,I am on the soccer team at Schoolcraft. I really love the atmosphere of the college and my team is my family here.
Junior,5,"Schoolcraft college is a wonderful school. I have always felt very safe when I attend night classes, the campus security is always out surveying the parking lots, the professors and faculty are very helpful when it comes to directions and advice. The buildings are always very well kept; clean and organized. There is a very big diversity of students are schoolcraft which offers a lot of different chances for discovering new information about cultures and ethnicities."
Sophomore,5,I choose to go to Schoolcraft as a bridge between high school and a 4 year university. I feel this was the best choice for me.  I have honed my study skills and had time to truly decide what degree I want to pursue.  The advisors are available to help you set up educational plan.  This allows you to know what classes to take to get ready for transfer to a 4 year university. Schoolcraft College  has also allowed me to save money.
Freshman,5,I could not have asked for a better experience at Schoolcraft College. All of my professor's were helpful and took steps beyond their role to make the class engaging and unique. Schoolcraft College also provides free help centers for when I was confused about a topic in a class or wanted someone to proof read my essays before submiting them for a grade. Schoolcraft also offers a veriety of clubs where anyone can find a group to fit in with and build long lasting friendships.
Sophomore,5,I love Schoolcraft College for many reasons. The way the campus is set up makes everything easy to find and it is right across the street from some amazing restaurants. The classes I've taken online have made my life so much easier and all my professors emailed me back quickly when I had any questions.
Junior,5,"When I toured the school, I knew working 15 minutes that I was going to attend. All of the staff and faculty are friendly and extremely helpful. They have all made me feel welcomed and like they want me to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"Really nice campus, especially the Livonia location. And affordable for such an accredited community college."

Freshman,5,"Schoolcraft College is a great start to college! I reccomend any high school graduate or someone trying to go back to school to go here. The staff are beyond friendly and the campus life rocks! There are always events to go to, they have many sports teams and the food is great! Check out Henry’s for some excellent food! It is my first year and college and Schoolcraft is making the experience fantastic!"
Freshman,5,"I love it there. They are all so kind. Haven't had a Professor yet that I didn't absolutely like. The free on campus tutoring is one of my favorite things, and I use it whenever I am feeling confused. The tutors there are also so kind to you. All the offices are so helpful, especially the Testing Center!"
Freshman,5,"I like Schoolcraft College because it is affordable and close to where I live, but it would be nice to have more class options for certain classes. The food is great, especially from Henry's but the staff is kind of rude and acts like they do not want to help you. This is a great college if you want to go somewhere affordable. Also, the LAC is great and so is the staff in the help center. They have really helped me understand certain stuff in my class that my professor did not fully clarify. Along with all of these things, the campus is smaller so the walking to each building is not horrible"
Junior,5,"Attending Schoolcraft Community College directly out of high school was the most practical decision I could have made. Saving money, being able to continue working my jobs, and making life-long friends are all contributing factors as to why I love Schoolcraft as I do."
Freshman,5,I just started at Schoolcraft and found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  The admissions process was very quick and easy.  I met with an advisor and found her to be very nice and helpful.  Finding the classes I needed for my degree and transfer to another college was established quickly and efficiently.  I really enjoyed my first few days and my professors are very nice.
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer student from Henry Ford college and Schoolcraft college seems to be pretty nice thus far.  I have already taken 2 classes and I like the campus.  Its clean and people are respectful and friendly.
Niche User,5,education is great and professors are nice everyone is a democrat meaning if you are actually smart and are a republican you don't belong here
Senior,5,"Schoolcraft is a great place to learn, it is inviting and welcoming and the classes are very helpful and you learn so much from them, anything is possible as long as you always continue your education. Since the class rooms are small its awesome to have one on one time with the professors and maintaining a relationship, they show that they care about your success and want to help you on the right path for a great career and a great future."
Sophomore,5,Schoolcraft College has been great for me. The professors are all good and I feel that I have learned so much. I like Schoolcraft a lot because you really do not feel that it is a community college.
Sophomore,5,Professors are well diversed in their field and truly care about their students academic careers. The classroom atmosphere is very suitable for one on one interaction and keeping focused on the task at hand.
Sophomore,5,"Going to school craft was one of the best decisions I made. It helped me form the good study habits I have now, and show me how much more potential I have than I originally thought. The atmosphere and the professors are great too. I think its  great first step to take towards  successful future."
Alum,5,I enjoyed how welcoming the environment was. the campus always had a welcoming atmosphere and the other students are all very friendly. the professors that work there are helpful if you get stuck and there are programs you can apply for to get additional help. i would recommend this college to anyone!
Sophomore,5,"I love Schoolcraft. It is at least half the price of other schools, sometimes 1/5 of what you pay at other schools. My husband loves it as well because it is the only program in several states that does a welding and metallurgy associates."
Sophomore,5,Nice campus & welcoming atmosphere. The professors were very helpful & really want to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,"Schoolcraft college is an excellent place to get your college career started, or to pick up new skills for gainful employment.  The staff there is terrific and seem to be heavily invested in your future success.  The culinary program is outstanding."
Sophomore,5,"Schoolcraft College is one of the best two-year colleges a student can attend. We have one of the best culinary programs in the world. There only 69 master chefs and 4 of them teach here. They bundle this with a pretty good price. Our other vocational programs are top notch. Our pre-engineering program also gets many students transferring to U of M Ann Arbor. The professors are a mixed bag. Most of the full-time faculty is generally decent to upstanding. There are some bad ones though. If you reach out to faculty or staff, they are in general incredibly supportive and want you to succeed. We also have a strong student life on campus, a very large chapter of the Phi Theta Kappa honor society which is very active and throws tons of events. Other clubs on campus allow students ton of opportunities both professional and personal. Generally, Schoolcraft has a ton of great opportunities and value, you just need to take advantage of it."
Freshman,5,"Being a first time college student this is a great college atmosphere and education system to transition to after graduating from high school. My professors are all very nice and flexible to make sure my grade are as good as they can get. The campus isn't very big so walking to and from classes isn't too bad, especially in the winter. "
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Schoolcraft! The academics are challenging but the professors are fair and support you the whole way through. Advisors are more than helpful in getting students on track for their future career goals. The campus is gorgeous, and the equipment is always up to date. There is a huge variety of classes to accommodate majors of any kind. The students are so friendly and school spirit is high! This college is a dream come true for those seeking a promising future. "
Freshman,4,So far I've had a pleasant experience at Schoolcraft College! I look forward to attending on campus.
Freshman,4,"I was amazed at how organized the college was, as well as, the opportunities you are able to use.  Although it is a community college, it is able to send you into a field with the necessary tools you need in order to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I started taking college classes at 15 and I never felt like I was going to struggle or have a hard time here, its a very good school."
Freshman,4,"I like my experience at Schoolcraft College because it’s a diverse environment, very relatable clubs and activities...The school have very friendly and considerate staff... The only thing I would change is the compassion I would want them to have for families for certain situations. But the professors are terrific and they make themselves available to answer questions as well as answer in a timely fashion so that students concerns are answered and handled efficiently"
Sophomore,4,good school just expensive for out of county residents. Honestly I've been going to Schoolcraft college for about 4 years now and for a community college it is pretty good. Has a nice and safe campus. Overall teachers are good most of the time. Lastly the food on campus is pretty good including restaurants and school  cafe.
Sophomore,4,I have taken online courses and have had a good experience. The professors were easy to get a hold of and the class was convenient.
Junior,4,"Great college to start off with if you are unsure what your future holds for you.  Cheap class, good environment, no real complaints.  Make sure to use Rate my Teacher though, some of the teachers can be real difficult."
Junior,4,"In my three years of being at Schoolcraft, it has been an all-around great experience. I have had a few issues but that comes along with any college that you attend, but one of my issues is that your payment for your classes is due within three days from the day you register. Teachers are very knowledgeable and a lot of them teach at bigger Universities as well. All in all, not a bad school."
Alum,4,"The campus was friendly and quiet, which was very nice. Professors are kinda hit or miss, most of the professors I had were excellent."
Niche User,4,"I like the free parking, and how getting anything is convenient. The professors are always real with you. The campus is small but would recommend because less walking in the snow."
Freshman,4,I like that it is. not as stressful as high school is and faculty is very open to helping you at any time.
Freshman,4,Schoolcraft is a local community college.  The class offerings are plenty for daytime or night time classes.  Small class sizes for a better learning experience.
Freshman,4,I really like Schoolcraft. I am still currently attending there but everything is very clean and the classes are easy to find and the staff in all departments really help you out with anything.
Niche User,4,During my experience at Schoolcraft college as a Dual enroll student it was very interesting and welcoming. Walking in you don't feel like you're just part of a crowed. The classrooms were smaller letting you have a more personal connection with the professors which i like. Getting you to understand what you are learning is what the professors try their best at. Also keeping you interested in the topics .
Sophomore,4,"I appreciate that the transfer from high school into Schoolcraft College was an easy one. Class sizes are reasonable and the campus is not too large. The cost is really the main draw though, and I don't regret it one bit."
Freshman,4,"Very nice campus and faculty, all members were very helpful and welcoming at orientation, can't wait to start school in the fall."
Sophomore,4,"Schoolcraft College is recognized as a two-year community college. It is set apart by other community colleges in the area in it's manageable class sizes, course accommodations, such as online and hybrid course availability, and it's broad age diversity among the students who attend. Schoolcraft College is located in bustling Livonia, MI, but has the small town college feel and security. Not to mention, the affordability of attending Schoolcraft over a 4-year university sold me. Overall, choosing Schoolcraft College was the best decision I made for furthering my higher level education."
Sophomore,4,"My college is awesome! They offer all types of classes, clubs, a fitness area, etc. and so much more. The learning center helps you when your struggling with a subject and our state of the art library provides the most up-to-date accommodations for you to produce exemplary projects, essays and whatever else!  The student advisers treat you like family so you get the best experience possible.  So, needless to say, my school rocks!  You should try it too."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Schoolcraft College has been great . I love that the class sizes are small to give a person the ability to have hands on learning. It's a great campus to learn and take courses to begin a career . Many take general educational courses than transfer into a university. But some are interested in programs they offer. Great college, great choice!"
Sophomore,4,"Schoolcraft College is a great community college! It is great for general credit classes and it also has an great nursing and culinary arts school. Most of the professors are very kind and want their students to learn. Occasionally, there are some professors who do not care about the students and make the class very hard and confusing.  A student has to really make sure that the professor they are taking the class with is really invested in making the learning environment is fun and inclusive. 
I wish that it was easier to get involved in the clubs at Schoolcraft. Most clubs are not advertised which makes it hard to know when they met and what their mission is.
Overall, Schoolcraft is a great school where students go to learn, get a degree, or some general education out of the way."
Alum,4,Schoolcraft College is a great place to get a degree. The staff there is always pleasant and very understanding. The education staff however really go above and beyond to create a good atmosphere.
Freshman,4,"Good college with a good variety of classes. Most professors are highly educated and staff is nice. However, rarely any clubs or social activities. Charges high fees and doesn't use funding wisely."
Alum,4,This is a great place to start out right out of high school. I like the campus. They have a variety of Associates degrees available for lower tuition. They have a culinary program that also runs the cafeteria so the food is always good.
Alum,4,"The school is very good with financial aid, and they are always helpful in the office. I think the school is reasonably priced and for the most part staff is friendly. I have had some horrible professors who are obviously on ten year and should've retired a while ago. Other than this, it's a pretty good school--you just have to be careful with certain professors. They offer free tutoring most days of the week, which can be very helpful--especially during finals week. It's a good commuter school with lots of parking. Campus is small so you don't have to do much walking."
Sophomore,4,It's a small community and it's easy to find your classes. Plus there are plenty of places to eat nearby!!!
Freshman,4,Schoolcraft College is a great place for students to start off their college careers and is a great stepping stone to get them started off for college! Schoolcraft cares about their students and has various resources to help them succeed. Is a good size campus and is a great place to start college.
Alum,4,"Schoolcraft College is a great bang for your buck, the professors are very helpful and the counselors are very good whether its transferring or signing up for classes. Although campus is small, it's super easy to get around and it's in a great location with tons of things to do.  Schoolcraft has made it a very easy transition from high school to the college lifestyle."
Freshman,4,"Schoolcraft provides a solid educations especially is you didn't apply yourself in high school and need a do over.  Don't be fooled, there is academic rigor for the coursework and you must attend classes.  The professors are friendly and available for extra help, if you ask."
Sophomore,4,Schoolcraft offers a lot of classes and almost every one of my professors has been fantastic. I have had a lot of good experiences on campus. All of the other students I have talked to were genuinely nice and open minded people.
Freshman,4,"A well run, established, and affordable school that will get the job done. Professors expressed a level of professionalism and knowledge in all classes. Campus is well maintained and easy to navigate. When it comes to essays however, be prepared to write on a frequent basis."
Freshman,4,"I like that the classes are small in size. You are not just a number in a classroom but an actual student. Most professors like what they teach and it is shown in how they approach subjects. Instead of it being a very dry and boring lecture, it can be quite interesting when the teacher enjoys what they talk about."
Sophomore,4,"Schoolcraft is definitely a great commuter school! Perfect to get the prerequisites out of the way for a cheap price.  I also had the pleasure to attend 5 semesters with Dr. Jackson who is the most amazing psychology professor. She opened my eyes and made me realize that psychology is the path that I am absolutely supposed to follow! Schoolcraft wasn't my first choice because I wanted to live the college experience but honestly, I wouldn't have rather gone elsewhere and the best part is that I'm still debt free as I continue my education for my bachelor's degree!"
Sophomore,4,"I like how small the campus was at Schoolcraft. You were able to get around quickly and this was great for when the weather wasn't very nice out. The gym was a great add on to the school because you were able to go for free as long as you were enrolled in classes. Another bonus were the classroom sizes. The classrooms held about 30 students. This means that you were able to interact with the professors easier than you would at a university of classrooms the size of auditoriums. Overall, Schoolcraft is a great college for new college students to transition into a college setting."
Sophomore,4,"Schoolcraft has really helped bring out my full academic potential. The free tutoring center has helped me immensely to understand specific concepts. The writing center has helped me improve my writing skills and grammar. The group study rooms in the library are great for group projects. Overall, my experience at schoolcraft has been great."
Freshman,4,"Very nice school with a very clean and open campus. The classes are pretty basic, but most people transfer to a university anyways. Teachers are a 50/50.  There is always events going on campus."
Freshman,4,"So far I have only experienced a semester of Schoolcraft College. From what I have seen, despite the negativity of community colleges, this is a nice school with great faculty who are generous and always trying to help. The college offers many opportunities for students to succeed with tutoring and much more help. The campus itself is not too bad either, the parking lots could be larger in some places but other than that I have enjoyed my time at Schoolcraft College."
Alum,4,"The focus on academics was great. Its a small school, but easily connected to others. Great professors. Serves as an excellent transition school to a big university"
Junior,4,"Schoolcraft College is a very good community college. The academics and teachers are average, but the sports and other campus activities are poor compared to other schools. It is a very affortable college. There are no dorms or party scenes."
Sophomore,4,"Schoolcraft College is a wonderful place to start off if you plan on transferring, they transfer all credits, and it’s now a four year college!"
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to Schoolcraft 2 weeks before classes started. The faculty made the switch very easy and were very understanding. The only problem I have is that the school does not offer their own financial aid, but only aid through the FAFSA. In addition, they only offer a 3 payment payment plan. If your tuition is around 3,000 that does not allow for it to be very manageable. I would like to see a better payment plan provided. Overall I love Schoolcraft's faculty and atmosphere. The campus is small and easy to navigate. I would recommend this college to anyone!"
Freshman,4,This is my first year at schoolcraft community college and so far i like it a lot and its avery cool school. the profesors there are good.
Freshman,4,"It is my first semester at Schoolcraft, and so far I am very content with this school. There are so many different ways to ensure success at Schoolcraft. They have free tutoring in the Library which includes the writing fellows that help edit papers and helps you improve your writing skills. Then there is ESL which is English as a second language to help students that do not speak English as their first language improve and become bilingual."
Freshman,4,"I just started attending schoolcraft, I'm in my freshman year and so far I really enjoy it. What's not to love? I'm currently playing basketball for the college and having the connections that you get is just great."
Freshman,4,"I like that I can do a lot of my classes online, however some of the classes I need do not have any professors teaching them."
Alum,4,Schoolcraft college is a very good college. I started there in 2014 and graduated in 2016. The teachers and staff are excellent and helpful and the campus is safe and clean
Alum,4,The professors were nice. I am happy I started there and then transferred out. I did save a lot of money.
Alum,4,"Had a great experience at Schoolcraft College. The teachers were very caring and want you to succeed. There are many clubs and organizations to be apart of. The food is amazing, especially because of their culinary department. The campus is safe and neat. Everyone is super helpful and caring on campus. Great place to start college."
Sophomore,4,"For those looking for a pretty good community college experience, Schoolcraft is a great place to start. I had low expectations going into my time at Schoolcraft, but by getting a little bit involved on campus beyond just going to class, my experience was able to exceed my initial expectations. Great faculty."
Niche User,4,"Schoolcraft is a local community college in Livonia Michigan and houses a bookstore, fitness center, newspaper, as well as 32 student activities and clubs. Clubs such as SAGA (Sexuality and Gender Acceptance), Harry Potter club, and dance club, are are clubs that make this school what is is, a place for all students to come together and be comfortable."
Sophomore,4,The facility is very nice and up to date. All of the teachers I have had are very knowledgeable and willing to help. Also all of the students are friendly and talkative.
College Senior,4,The professors I've had have been wonderful so far. All are very engaged and want their students to succeed.
College Senior,4,"A lot of work, and the curriculum is hard but helpful"
College Senior,4,I really enjoy the small class sizes.
College Sophomore,4,They have a wide selection of classes which allow you to take classes on any given day and day
College Junior,4,"Classes sizes are small which is great, up to date courses and software to learn, flexible courses"
College Junior,4,It has a solid curriculum for my field
College Senior,4,They are great if a student does not have time to go to class on campus.
College Senior,4,"Counselors are very helpful, they make sure to take the right classes without wasting the student's time, effort and money on classes that are not transferable."
College Senior,4,"They offer jobs on campus, which makes it easy for a lot of students to make money without spending too much on commuting. Many universities have transfer guides from Schoolcraft."
College Senior,4,"I am going for software engineering, I have learned a lot of things about programming, workload was not too heavy, we had enough time to finish our projects, curriculum was well distributed over the semester."
Freshman,2,Overall the classes were easy as expected. My personal experience was not great though. The school was not ready for the coronavirus pandemic and lagged behind in the transition.
College Sophomore,2,Job prospects and the career center doesn't offer much.
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many opportunities Schoolcraft provides for students looking to transfer and get into different programs. Its pretty straight forward. They do offer on campus jobs such as tutoring, working in the cafe and library."
College Junior,2,Most classes are too full not allow time for teacher to explain if needed. most courses you do not learn anything valuable
College Junior,2,"I have received a skills certificate from this school and when I went to look for a job they told me they do not honor Schoolcraft's certificates. When I went to the career service to see if they could help me and why I was being told by most they so not care for schoolcraft, they took that as I was personally insulting them not that it was employers telling me this information so they  could use it to figure out what was going on"
College Junior,2,I don't think all the teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are teaching. I feel like most of the time they are short on teachers and will allow anyone to teach a course just to get the money. Trying to make the dean aware of unqualified teacher is pointless and they will not offer out any real solutions.
College Junior,2,"I am very unhappy with a good majority of the professors, if you can even call them that.  Registration is pretty easy because of course they just want your money. The workload in Math classes are crazy. I enjoy Math too but the amount of homework you have makes it impossible to keep up with other classes. Then receive a teacher that is not qualified to teach that course oh boy its the worst roller coaster ride you could ever imagine. Many classes require a $100 plus book that never even gets used which is very frustrating. The FA office is a joke, you will receive a different answer from each person with no accountability what so ever. Then we you go to prove who you have spoken to with date time name and short summary of info received and they will just require more hoops to jump through. I can NOT wait for the day I finally get to transfer and never think about this school again. When you take a look at the retention rate that should say enough about the school. I am guessing many are in the same boat as me; location is close to home, price is reasonable, and the amount of loans we are facing when we do transfer we are just trying to keep cost as low as possible. One thing I am truly getting worried about with the lack of qualified teachers, when we do transfer are we going to have enough knowledge to keep up at the university we chose???"
Recent Alumnus,2,I took a math course online and it was the worst thing I have done. Some people might be able to learn math online but it is definitely my weak suit.
College Freshman,2,The college doesn't have the best programs towards my major but again being a community college it is understandable.
College Junior,2,Online format was confusing and hard to navigate...
College Freshman,2,Athletic facilities should be updated
College Sophomore,2,its okay. good for saving money. easy classes
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was studying business/ accounting at Schoolcraft and some of my teachers were helpful and some others were completely disconnected with the class and did not care much to teach us anything other than the things that we already know. I did receive a small scholarship because of my grades, so there are some scholarship opportunities available."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The wifi it's extremely slow, and the computers are ancient. They are older and much slower and often freeze. There are labs with nicer computers but there aren't  many of them."
College Senior,2,"Just because your parents make a certain amount, doesn't mean you shouldn't get financial aid. My parents may make more money, but that also means they have bigger bills. They cant afford to pay for my whole college tuition like the financial aid department seems to think. It would be nice to have an area explaining what your parents are willing to pay. I shouldn't be punished because of my parents success. I have to pay for school on my own."
College Sophomore,2,"I just found the whole financial aid experience to be a little frustrating overwhelming. I believe that, during such a exciting yet overwhelming time as enrolling and registering, that process could be as stress free as possible. During my experience, I had to submit additional documents to process fasfa application, which resulted in me being on the phone with the IRS for 45 minutes. Then once documents were faxed over to financial aid office, instead of them making copies for me, they insisted that I walk to library to make copies for myself! I don't think I ever had to do as much work enrolling in school, as what is expected a Schoolcraft. This experience alone, actually made me consider not enrolling and going to another school. I hope I'm not further disappointed with the academia of Schoolcraft."
College Senior,2,"The wii is always having problems, you have to constanly sign into when entering different buildings on campus. The nextwork is not reliabe there's no signal at all in certain buildings."
College Freshman,2,"The education I'm getting is worth the money I'm paying. I got some financial aid, which helped, but I would like to see the department to more to help single parent who do now qualify for any more financial aid to further their education to provide for their household."
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't been to many other community schools, but it seems pretty average."
College Freshman,2,"I Guess I'm Considered a Non Resident – Unfortunately, because I dont like in the same school district, i have to pay more, which is unfair i think. Schoolcraft is only a 15 minute drive from home, but unfortunately i have to pay as a non resident, costing me nearly dour what a resident would pay. I wish non resident would only apply if you were an out of state student."
Junior,1,"The weld program is a joke, the so called teacher/professor coley plays favorites not only that there is no real grading scale for the welds on her objective sheet, if she doesn't like you, she can deny your weld and say they are bad. The grading system is what fails students and her attitude saying she doesn't care about the student is what makes this class a joke. School craft, thank you for another wounderful year and a waste of money."
College Sophomore,1,I've only had one online class and it was terrible. The teacher was never helpful. his assignments were unclear. and he would place such short deadlines
College Junior,1,"I would not choose this school again. I would pick one that had qualified teachers for the proper courses, as well as an administrative office that is accountable for what they say."
College Junior,1,"FA office is HORRIBLE. they give inaccurate information and have no accountability. Don't waste your time keeping a call log of who and when you spoke with at the office as that will just create bigger hoops to jump through. Not only that when they send out denial letters they do not even pull up your record to make sure its not something you have already fixed or completed, just making the approval response delayed even longer. I have never had the office speak to me or offer out options for scholarships or other grants available. That is something you need to research yourself. This will be the 1st year  I will approach them in regards to this area because I did not know you could qualify even if you were not an all A student, so i will have to come back and update how they help you through that process, but if its anything like the rest of my experience I am going to have to say it will be poor experience too"
College Freshman,1,"I don't take any online courses because I don't learn well from them.,"
College Freshman,1,"Little to No Help – There was an error on my application for financial aid but it was not caught until after I had been given money for two semesters. I recently got a bill revoking all the money they gave me, I called the office and they couldn't have helped me any less. They said they needed documents but did not tell me where to get them, I had to ask them multiple questions."
College Junior,1,"Not Worth It – There have been more negatives than positives! Financial aid has gone down every semester, and my finances haven't changed! Not to mention I just went to buy books, and their bookstore had none of them, and books for ONE class cost over $200, and it's a class I'm only taking because it's required, so I won't use it in the future, so I would rather rent from somewhere else then buy that book! I left with no books that I'd have to buy out-of-pocket, & classes start in a week. Poor aid, poor service, rude people and a rip off. I'm only taking 2 classes there (the rest at Wayne State U), since I try to avoid the place at all costs! Going there used to at least save me some money, but not anymore! I'd almost rather drop out than deal with this school! Thankfully I'll be transferring after this semester."
College Senior,1,"Not Going to Sugar Coat It – i accept anyone and everyone they way there are, but i have been in some instances where i over hear other students make racist remarks or comments. there is a friend of mine that i've known since high school even back then people made fun of him because he was special ed, but he was qualified enough to be in regular class rooms. he just so happened to start attending schoolcraft the students dont pick on him like the kids back in high school, and they try to avoid contact like they do with the other mentally impaired students; talk about them behind their backs and sometimes to their face and just flat out ignor them when they come by. i on the other hand sit and talk with them and and treat them like people because i know what it's like to be talked about and treated like an outcast. the teachers and other staff members are kind to them and treat them with respect, its just some of the students that have problems."
College Senior,1,"Not  Fair – i have applied for financial aid more than once and still have not received it so i've given up and i'm currently trying to save money with no job. my younger sister is enrolled at schoolcraft and they have given her financial reward letter, but a few weeks into the semester shoolcraft said that she didnt get the money and that she has to pay them back $2,000.00 which we dont have, so she's worried about her grades and the outstanding bill schoolcraft is pressing her about. please if anyone reads this i dont want the money give it to my sister, she was so excited for her fist year of college and loves school, but since schoolcraft had sent her the bill she's been stressing out about it and almost want to quit school completely and that's a shame to see someone just starting out to just want to quit all together. p.s. she wanted to be a dental hygienist and you dont get too many young people saying that."
College Sophomore,1,Don't Attend This School – This school was more expensive than they let on. They have a ton of hidden fees that go along with the culinary program. So when I had to drop the class I made sure to drop it before the refund date so I could get my money back. But because I received financial aid they still said that I had to pay for the class even though I wasn't attending it and had dropped out after the first 2 days. I feel like they are robbing me and I cannot get any help from the financial aid office. They do not care about their students at this school.

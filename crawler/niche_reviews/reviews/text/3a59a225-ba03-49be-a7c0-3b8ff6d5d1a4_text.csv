Junior,5,"UVA-Wise is a small school, so the one-on-one interaction with professors is amazing! The campus is beautiful!"
Niche User,5,"As in incoming freshman, I found that UVA-Wise is the best choice for me. The campus seemed very friendly and spirited. The dorms, gym, and classrooms all very clean and hospitable. Then the baseball team offered me a chance to play and gladly took it. All around a great school."
Niche User,5,I love the campus at The University of Virginia's College at Wise. Everybody on campus is so kind and helping. I like the location of this college and am so thrilled to become a student in the fall.
Freshman,5,"BY far the best choice I have ever made was coming to s\this school! The professors actually care about the success of each individual student, and it feels like a home."
Freshman,5,It's a great place overall! Everyone is friendly and ready to help when you need it. There is a lot of fun clubs to join and the band is spectacular. It's cheap and affordable with many scholarship opportunities to assist with tuition. The campus is a average size and really peaceful.
Junior,5,This is an excellent school with high-caliber learning and opportunities. Being part of the University of Virginia you still graduate with the prestigious degree. The University of Virginia college is a wise is nestled in the mountains surrounded by beautiful scenery. We still have the same lingo is the main campus does and have the same president. More opportunities to do research at the satellite campus the main campus. This college is a very relaxed atmosphere and everyone is very kind as if they were your neighbors.
Freshman,5,The college at Wise is overall awesome. The food is great as well as the students and academic life.
Alum,5,"UVA-WISE ALUMNI! I love Wise! The people are amazing, the college is growing and cares about its students, and the new library is awesome!"
Junior,5,"The University of Virginia's College at Wise is a wonderful place to attend school and to get your degree from. The scenery around the school is very beautiful and it helps you focus as a student. The professors are great teachers and pushes you past your limits. They definitely give you great help and knowledge to help you succeed in the classroom and in life. All of the professors, deans, and staff are very interactive with the student body and each other. One thing I would like to see changed about the college is the diversity. I would like to see more students of different ethnics and races. Besides that, the college is great!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Virginia's College at Wise was the best academic choice I have ever made. I visited and fell in love. Set in the mountains is a beautiful and secluded campus. A university that makes every single student feel special and included. It is truly amazing the effort put in by all of UVA- Wise employees. Despite the college student count being quite small, it gives every young adult or adult to succeed in making their dreams reality. Everyone is so friendly and UVA-Wise is the reason behind it all. Its expected of all students to be the absolute best version of themselves. The university goes out of their way to insure everyone feels comfortable and accepted. They throw events promoting different cultures, religions, races and the LGBTQ community. Thank you UVA-Wise for giving me a reason to wake up and get out of bed! I have found my passion in this crazy world in which we live and I could not be more grateful."
Alum,5,"I loved this college so much! The professors are great, the price is relatively low, and I just graduated with no debt whatsoever!! I think going to UVa-Wise was the best decision I could have ever made ❤️"
Sophomore,5,"UVa-Wise is pretty rural, but there are some big cities not too far away. Many of the professors are super helpful and are always available to the students. I love seeing how the college has been growing since I've been here. The dorms are pretty good, but there are many off campus housing that students use too. Overall, this is a great school!"
Junior,5,"I am from Wise, Virginia; and being at UVA-Wise makes me feel like I'm home but not at the same time. It is diverse and just all around a great school. I just starting nursing school at UVA-Wise and I am learning a lot of information, I fee like my education has been above average, and I am very thankful for the opportunities I have been given. It is difficult to be a college student while trying to work at the same time, that is why I am trying to apply for some scholarships to help pay for nursing school."
Senior,5,"I'm so glad I transferred in to UVA Wise. The school has amazing programs, and everyone is so nice and friendly!"
College Freshman,5,"I love working out, these are some of the best work out facilities in the nation, i love them."
College Freshman,5,They really make everyone feel safe.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe and comfortable in and around campus. Campus police is usually circles around just to keep and eye on things. There are blue buttons around campus that if pressed lead directly to campus police. The Title 9 coordinator is also very helpful.
College Freshman,5,All the professors I have had so far are very reasonable and workable. They want you to come to office hours. They want to help. They actually care about you and your grades.
College Freshman,5,I love this school! The professors are extremely helpful and easy to work with. The people here are extremely nice and welcoming. I couldn't dream of being anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers are amazing, really the best staff between Charlotsville and Wise."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Virginia's College at Wise is a special school. Being a smaller version of The University of Virginia I was hesitant of attending this school, thinking it would more of a cash grab gimmick, but I was completely wrong. The school is a small school in the mountains of Virginia and is a delight to attend. You get a quality education while paying a lot less tuition that you would pay if attending a larger university."
Freshman,4,"The University of Virginia's College at Wise is a small community of close-knit scholars. It's small student population allows for vast opportunity for undergraduate research and student-professor interactions. You really get the sense that the professors care about your academic and personal success. The location of the campus possess a bit of a challenge to find local activities, though it provides insight into the Appalachian culture. If I were to improve one thing about the college experience would be to increase diversity on campus. While there is good focus on the local cultures, I would like to see more inclusion of global cultures beyond the range of Western Virginia."
Sophomore,4,It’s a very small and down to earth community at UVA-Wise. Love the place and the people there dearly :)
Sophomore,4,"My experience, so far, has been fairly positive. They need to upgrade their email to google or something more easily accessible, but overall good"
Sophomore,4,"Everyone is very friendly and makes you feel like home, however, it also offers several opportunities for students to make the best of their college experience. It is the comfort of a small college with the benefits of a big university!"
Freshman,4,"Hi everyone! I love the small campus of UVA-Wise! I can wake up late and still make it to my class on time. In addition, it is a beautiful campus, that is gorgeous in the fall! However, there is not much to do. It is in a small town that does not contain much so you'd have to go to Kingsport or Bristol to find the nice restaurants and shopping. We have some fast food and lots of hiking if you are into outdoor stuff. There are also lots of fun things to do on campus, and many trips that you can take with the student activities board!"
Niche User,4,I'm an upward bound student with UVA wise. I've stayed over the summer and it was an overall great experience. It's lots of walking and the freshman dorms have no air conditioner. Those are the only bad things about it. The cafeteria food is so delicious and worth getting seconds.
Junior,4,A lot of the faculty are willing to work with you and help you out with making the best decisions. Very beautiful area and most buildings on campus are pretty close to each other. Only thing I wish would happen is to see the area around the campus grow.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers know almost everybody in class by name. The campus feels like a home and everybody is nice. The winters can be a little bad because it it located high on top of a mountain. The cafeteria food is edible, but there are three other options of places to eat and there are places to use dining dollars (money loaded on to your ID to be used at concession stands or other places). There is a coffee shop that is open until midnight most nights. The new library offers 24-hour study rooms."
College Freshman,4,My favorite thing about University of Virginia's College at Wise is the community! This school has a beautiful campus in the hills of Appalachia and the people here are absolutely splendid. I would definitely choose this school if I could do it all over again because it has got the quality education I desire.
College Junior,4,"I don't know much as I do not participate in them, but it is very big on campus."
College Junior,4,"The school is pretty quiet, which leaves a lot of time to study, yet all the students and professors are really kind and helpful."
College Freshman,4,the best parties are thrown by frat houses
College Freshman,4,their are parties for those who want to go to them
College Freshman,4,some clubs are very class orientated
College Freshman,4,the staff tries their best but they do know that it is college and students do wanna have fun
College Freshman,4,"I have meet people who have gone here all over, even more than I thought I would."
College Freshman,4,I am falling in love with this school.
College Freshman,4,safety is a big thing for me and why i chose this school
College Freshman,4,I plan on living on campus housing for the first two years.
College Freshman,4,I plan on joining a sorority in a few weeks!!!!
College Freshman,4,just started ill know more as year goes on
College Freshman,4,The buildings are well kept and have great layouts with friendly staff and RAs
College Freshman,4,The gym and pool are all updated and open almost all day. Staff is friendly and the classes they offer are great.
College Freshman,4,The University of Virginia College at Wise is a great school. It's in the quiet mountain of southwest Virginia. The facility and professors take a real hands on approach to their class with a lot of one on one! Small class sizes help with that.
College Sophomore,4,I was lucky to be in the newest dorm on campus.  It was great.
College Sophomore,4,With most of my professors i've had only good experiences and good lectures from them.
College Sophomore,4,My first year was a really good year and i had a lot of fun.  I also have an awesome academic adviser who has helped me greatly.
College Senior,4,"In my department the course options are limited, it is very British Lit heavy. However, the classes that I have taken have been very enjoyable and my college experience has been a blast thus far. Since the courses in the department of my field of study are limited, I am finding it a little difficult to choose classes for the upcoming semester that I know I would enjoy."
College Senior,4,"There are many organizations on campus that promote diversity and acceptance of diversity. There are a hand full of people among the entire student body that have prejudices, however, most of the campus is very accepting of everyone."
College Freshman,4,There is a whole page made to show off internships and jobs available. Sykes comes every now and then to promote working there.
College Freshman,4,I love the hall I live in. We are all close knit and know each other very well.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is pretty big and supported at our school. The process to get in is mildly difficult but well worth it.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of people attend games and events, even the band competition held on campus. Our campus population is very supportive of everyone and their different activities."
College Senior,4,"Student safety is taken very seriously on campus. The campus security patrols during the day as well as appointed hours at night. However it is difficult to reach them when they are not in their office. In order to reach them you must call dispatch and then have them get in touch with the officer, and the officer will call you. But if it is an emergency then you can always call 911. There are also several police call boxes around the outskirts of campus where not many people would be at night. There have been more reports of violence this year than others, but it is always reported and the staff at the college works very hard to keep any more offences from happening."
College Senior,4,"The Greek life impacts the social scene in a very unique way. Of course there will always be the sorority or fraternity that gets the bad reputation because of their behavior both in and out of the party scene. But for the majority the Greek community at UVA Wise creates a very diverse and wonderful atmosphere; it brings people together, and allows many people to feel like they are a part of something that is bigger than themselves. They do philanthropy work as well as community service throughout they year. Personally I have friends that are in sororities and fraternities, and they treat everyone the same, there is no special or preferential treatment of anyone, with the exception of their Big or their Little. While being involved in Greek life costs money, and no small amount, the school makes it very easy to fund raise the money needed for dues. Overall the Greek life at UVA Wise is a memorable and very important thing. I believe that the sororities and fraternities not only provide a sense of belonging, but also provide a very important sense of being part of something that is bigger that oneself."
College Senior,4,"Throughout my three and a half years at The University of Virginia's College at Wise I have had a very memorable experience. Many of my professors have been very helpful and wonderful, while some of them have been absolutely horrid. My favorite class has been my American Poetry and Prose class. This class was taught by my favorite professor and she had become not only an academic mentor, but a life coach, and a friend. This class, not only the material covered but the enthusiasm in which it was taught, instilled a love and appreciation for American Literature. One of the last days of the semester we were discussing a short story that was very moving and sad, so much so that the professor and I had to leave the classroom while another student read because we were crying so much. I would not change one second of my experience with this school. Though it was not my first choice, I am beyond grateful that I ended up here and I would not want to change anything."
College Sophomore,4,The only problem i have is sometimes theres not alot to do.
College Sophomore,4,My first year of college at Wise was great. I met a lot of different people and most became my friends. The campus is beautiful. We did get a lot of snow which out us out of classes but gave us time to bond with new people and hang out. I'm glad I chose UVa-Wise as my four years of my future and wouldn't have chose another college.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is nice and encouraging
College Freshman,4,There are a good number of restaurants to choose from and they are nearly all great places to eat.
College Freshman,4,"The campus does a great job of making sure their students' academic and social lives are fun, yet responsible."
College Freshman,4,"I think there needs to be one more restaurant on campus. Also, I think that meal swipes that students don't use should be refundable."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are in great shape and the office of housing and residence life make living on campus an enjoyable experience.
College Freshman,4,This school is really serious about honor court violations.
College Freshman,4,My experience went smooth and they were willing to help.
College Freshman,4,I think the food overall is pretty good.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is great. We are a small campus but the environment is what I like the most. People are very friendly and willing to help with any problems students may face. The dorms are good also. Living in the dorms helps you make friends with the people on your floor and helps establish relationships with other students by getting to know them during community programs. The only thing I do not like about the dorm I am currently living in is that in the summer the building has no air but it is not too bad. Other than that living on campus is amazing because you get to experience a lot of activities and meet people that you will continue to be friends with throughout your life.
College Sophomore,4,"The only downside to on-campus housing is the cost. The social atmosphere is outstanding, though."
College Freshman,4,The classes are very high quality compared to the outside of class experience.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of diversity here on campus!
College Freshman,4,The campus police and counselors are always there when you need them!
College Junior,4,"While there is not a lot to as far as shopping and activities like bowling, laser tag or skating, there is a lot of gorgeous scenery and great walking trails."
College Sophomore,4,I feel well taken care of here.
College Sophomore,4,"Rules are enforced appropriately. Visitation in certain dorms is monitored, parking tickets are common, good policies overall."
College Sophomore,4,"Not the most wins, but fun and good school representation"
College Sophomore,4,Easy to work with people. Just need to be persistent sometimes
College Sophomore,4,"It's great if you like little places. We have a beautiful environment but it comes at the cost of ""being separated from civilization"" according to most students."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a student center that offers restaurants,a gym to work out in, a game lounge, and a bookstore."
College Sophomore,4,"It's small, so you get personal experiences in the classroom. All the professors know your name once you have had them. Plus, you get the added security of knowing just about every face you see on campus. You most certainly know when there is a new kid in town."
College Sophomore,2,Safety is dependent on your views and opinions.
College Senior,2,"In my entire college career I have only been to one party. It left me uncomfortable and uneasy. I knew that nothing would happen to me, but being around that many stumbling drunk people just made me uncomfortable. Too many people get too drunk and can't control themselves."
College Senior,2,"There have been many instances involving the use of illegal drugs and underage drinking. Very often the campus police, and sometimes county officers, get involved. Marijuana is a commonly used drug among the students at my college and it is no secret, as is alcohol. Multiple students, from every point in their college career, will engage in some type of situation involving drugs. The police do their job very well and keep it handled as much as they can."
College Senior,2,"In my major, English, the course schedule and requirements have been so micro-managed that the department has become one of the worst departments in the school. Three out of the five English professors have over ruled every decision that the other two have wanted to make, and they have made it impossible to substitute a course. The department is so British Literature heavy, and there are very little American Literature options. There needs to be changes within the department, many of the other departments provide many options in their courses, but English is so limited that many of the majors leave and pick another major. The professors that have monopolized the department have made it very hard on the other professors as well as the students that choose to stick it out within the department."
College Junior,2,Even though I agree with our campus being a wet campus it is very hard to enforce the law on minors on campus without limiting those who drink legally.
College Junior,2,Financial Aid is a incredible headache. Being a college student who receives government aid is difficult because our VA rep does not have a clue about anything involving VA applications.
College Junior,2,There is only really one or two bars and they have theme nights some are very strange and some are not worth the cover charge.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you're living on campus, get the full dining plan. Unless you have a lot of extra money for the drive (and a very active life style to work off the fast food), you don't want to eat off campus a whole lot. I found that if you get a dorm with a kitchenette, the best plan is to get like...1 meal on campus a day. The dining commons is okay, but I always went up to the sub bar in the student lounge. The options are more limited but higher quality. I found that as a vegetarian I was typically eating a dish full of sides. Unfortunately (except at breakfast) there aren't a whole lot of options for special diets."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I graduated with a major in sociology in 2011. While the faculty did their best, we were severely limited. We had one full time sociology professor, and one that balanced between administration of justice (her main subject) and sociology. The workload was miniscule and I didn't feel challenged with my sociology classes. The classrooms were comfortable though, and in the rare chance that help was needed I could normally get an office appointment. However, even with the job fair on campus and graduating magna cum laude, I've yet to find a job in my specialty."
College Freshman,2,There are many restrictions that are not necessary for becoming adults.
College Freshman,2,"It is okay, but its not very exciting to eat on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The Library Is NOT a Quiet Area – The Library at UVA Wise is a popular area for students to spend time, but it is a very difficult place to get any studying done.  Rules about noise level are not enforced, especially in the upstairs section, which at times is the only place with available computers.  The noise problem is worse in the evening."
College Junior,2,Off Campus! I encourage anyone to look into off campus housing
College Junior,2,"Not much to do in town. Bristol/Kingsport are close with more variety for food and nightlife. Sadly, Wise doesn't have much"
College Sophomore,1,Everything is fast food and too pricey.
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties that I have seen happen.
College Junior,1,There is only one form of public transportation in wise provided by the mountain empire older citizens but it will only take you to certain places at certain times
College Sophomore,1,Parking spots are awful at Wise. They constantly spend money on things we don't need and refuse to take the advice of the students and build us more parking. Most days I have to park at least a mile away from my dorm room because for 3 buildings on that side they have about maybe 35 spots. Needless to say it's a lucky day if you get one of those!
College Junior,1,The area feels like it's isolated from the rest of the world. So there isn't much that goes on.
College Junior,1,"Nightlife is horrible at my university. There is only one local club, only older men hangout to drink. Too many students want to have ""the party house,"" so students are spread out at different locations, which is bad due to fact that the college has low attendance number."
Recent Alumnus,1,Good luck finding a spot. As a freshman you share parking with the football field. What this means? You have to move your car before a game and pray you can find a place to leave your car in between. If you do get parking you're likely parking in a gravel lot and it's near impossible to find a place. My recommendation? Live on campus or have someone drop you off.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is literally no public transportation in the city of Wise. I couldn't find a single bus, cab, or really anything to get me to the school. The roads can be difficult to navigate in the winter too. Just remember: your life is more important than your grade."
College Freshman,1,"Transportation is horrible in Wise unless you have a car. The only bus that people could use is a greyhound bus and that is closer to Johnson City. If you don't have a car or a ride somewhere, your looking at a long walk to get to where you'd want to go in town."
College Junior,1,"I had great scholarships my first year, my grades stayed high enough to keep the scholarships and my income never changed yet they pulled them. I got a scholarship that was supposed to be just on one semester but they separated them when specifically asked not to."
College Freshman,1,freshmen parking is on the other side of campus  but  upperclassmen have parking lots near their dorms
College Freshman,1,New Menu – The campus dining halls is up to date but not the menus and food that is provided. The foods are packed with a unhealthy punch. The variety is little to none. They fail to address the needs of the vegetarian kind. The food that is there to satisfy those needs are never fresh and are properly prepared. The fruit that is provided is never fresh therefore students are deterred to consume it without adding unhealthy foods in the mix.
College Freshman,1,There isn't much of an option. Weekends are the worst for this and late at night. There is one 24 hour place and then a Taco Bell that stays open until 2.
College Freshman,1,Wise Is Terrible – I am a music student here and Wise is horrid. It is vey understaffed.

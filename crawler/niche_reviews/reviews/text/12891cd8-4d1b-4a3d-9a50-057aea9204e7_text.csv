Sophomore,5,"I am a student at gulf coast state college. the college offers education in various specialties with the lowest tuition in the state of Florida. college also has a brilliant and courteous staff who are always ready to help. Also, it offers good aid to the students in need."
Sophomore,5,The online classes seem like a good use of my time and a great way to get an education around my work schedule
Junior,5,"Overall, a very good little college. Great for dual enrolled students looking to get a head start on their education. There is a large mix of ages in all the classes."
Junior,5,"Switched to online learning due to the virus and the teachers quickly stepped up, responding to students, videoing labs, etc."
Sophomore,5,"My favorite part about Gulf Coast State College would have to be the academic advising!! I would have truly been lost if it wasn’t for my academic advisor helping me along the way. She was very helpful in providing the resources necessary for my college journey and I couldn’t be more thankful. Shoutout to Ms. Jo Newton! With her help, I knew I could make it through anything and I knew that someone, other than my parents and scholarship mentors, was going to be there to support me!"
Sophomore,5,"Most of my professors for my online courses were some of the most understanding people I have encountered! They have great communication with their students and continue to receive feedback from them in order to better their course! My professors have definitely been some of the best and sometimes, not always, they will give extra credit or drop your lowest grade!"
Sophomore,5,"Gulf Coast State College is a highly affordable community college within the panhandle of Florida. When hurricane Michael hit us in October 2018, GCSC offers students the ability to pick up free pantry items and other household goods. This college really cares about their students. I also enjoy being a part of the Student Veterans Affairs club.I feel like I have a lot of support from the GCSC community to finish my education."
Sophomore,5,Gulf Coast State College online learning experience is convenient. Students are given clear instructions to finish discussion forums and assignments on a timely manner. The GCSC online learning is straightforward. I enjoy the free online textbooks because I save money.
Graduate Student,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed the classes and professors. Gulf Coast has an excellent student life program. However, the area has been largely impacted by the hurricane so campus needs a lot of work. Campus safety is pretty good and I have yet to see a problem with any crime or drug activity on campus. There could definitely be more options as far as available classes are concerned. Overall, I would say that my experience at Gulf coast State College has been a positive one."
Freshman,5,Gulf Coast State College is an incredible campus recovering from a category five hurricane. In the middle of the chaos this school has stood by its students and staff offering free lunches and many opportunities to it's students and wanting nothing more than the success of it's students.
Sophomore,5,"I have attended GCSC for 3 semesters now and have yet to have a ""bad"" professor. So far all of my professors have been helpful, enthusiastic, and caring. The campus is also beautiful being right on the water!"
Freshman,5,Haven't started yet but it seems to be a great school. I am excited to be joining on this beautiful campus.
Sophomore,5,I love the fact that I am getting a big college education in my small hometown without the big college price.  The tuition is so fair and my professors always answer me so quickly.
Graduate Student,5,I have been going to GCSC since 2013. I started as a duel enrolled student. I loved it from the start and i have seen the construction fix a lot of parking problems and other things through the years. This college truly care about their students. The student government is very lively as well. I am about to graduate from the culinary program and I also wanted to say this is an excellent facility and program. the chefs are absolutely devoted to the success of their students.
Freshman,5,"Overall this is an amazing college. Gulf Coast State College is always looking for ways to expand both physically and philosophically with an ever-growing campus and an infinitely expanding collective mind on new ideas. This college is filled with resources to make sure YOU have the tools to succeed. That professors and staff are very helpful as long as you show you need it. The students are also helpful. In terms of academics, this college is very diverse offering a wide array of programs. Another benefit is that a lot of these courses are offered online as well as in class. The only downside is, while this rated as a 4-year college, there aren't many Bachelor Degrees. However, this school is an amazing opportunity for someone looking to get prerequisite courses, get their feet wet in the college environment, and do so without breaking the bank being one of the most affordable colleges in the state of Florida."
Niche User,5,"I enjoy gulf coast state college very much. There is nothing I would change, I have been taking dual enrollment online classes and on campus classes as well. I have been satisfied with each class and grateful I have been able to take them."
Freshman,5,I got really sick and couldn't even get out of bed and my professor was so considerate and helpful when it came to turning in my essay. It really took a lot of pressure off of me and helped me continue to get better.
Sophomore,5,"Gulf Coast State College has many staff members that are willing to help you with just about anything. Some professors are more  kind and willing to help than others, but that is like any college or university. The campus is quite small and easy to navigate through which makes getting from one class to the next very simple. Many of the students go to all sporting events to show their support, which is always fun to be apart of. I absolutely love the fact that the campus is right on the water! The only problem was all of the construction that was going on, and continuing to go on, but part of that was due to Hurricane Micheal. With that being said, my first year in college was quite unusual considering we underwent a category 4 or 5 hurricane during the fall. Even though it was a tragedy, all the staff and students did what they could to help one another out, as well as everyone in the community."
Sophomore,5,"I would love to see more added to campus, otherwise it’s a great experience! The professors care about the students and do not mind helping you figure things out. The staff is very accommodating as well and will help you figure everything out. Going back to school seemed overwhelming, but I genuinely have enjoyed being on this campus. SGAvis constantly doing things, and helping students get through the school year. It is a highly recommendable place."
Niche User,5,This college is very caring and they will work with you with whatever you want to do. The admissions department will help you get in and they really care about how you are doing and will help work with you.
Sophomore,5,"As a small college, the teachers are able to help you out and focus more on their students. Thanks to that, more students get the help they need to succeed."
Niche User,5,Gulf Coast is a really big and beautiful college. Not many colleges actually have as many subjects as Gulf Coast State College has. There's not much I would say needs to change about this great college.
Freshman,5,"A few more choices for degree options a newer 4 year school, so that you don't have to transfer out to another state college to complete your major."
Freshman,5,"It is a very good community experience if you don't want to be far from home. Professors care about their students. If you live in the Panhandle, I highly recommend giving this college a chance. Tuition rates are some of the lowest in the state and the best bang for your buck."
Freshman,5,I thoroughly enjoy coming here. The college includes many fantastic areas of study with awesome professors teaching each course!
Senior,5,"Good school to enter.  Has a lot of different programs to choose from. It is located walking distance from the bay, so you can study with the view in between classes. Staff is great as well, very helpful. The GCSC takes good care of it's studense."
Alum,5,"I graduated from the PTA program in 2011. I felt like my teachers, education, and overall experience was excellent."
Freshman,5,Excellent professors and very many sources to use for students. Gulf Coast State College gives you the best opportunity to get your degree.
Sophomore,5,"Gulf Coast State College is filled with friendly students and teachers. Most of the teachers are really good with helping make sure you understand the material. What I would like to see change is the amount of homework. Homework is a great study tool, but too much of it gets overwhelming especially if you don't understand the lectures. Teachers should lower the amount of homework they give students."
Niche User,5,"I feel like I have and will continue to have, a wonderful experience with Gulf Coast State College. The faculty and staff are so friendly and helpful, that it makes the tenure of my stay at Gulf Coast State College a worthwhile endeavor to be embarked on."
Junior,5,I like the teachers and the cost of attendance. The view is great also being near the beach. The degree options are excellent as well.
Sophomore,5,They have a dedicated staff to assist students in choosing career goals. The experience I have had there has been outstanding. The staff is extremely helpful.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy how honest and helpful the teachers and staff are. I really feel like they care if everyone is successful.
Niche User,5,I am a dual-enrolled student at Gulf Coast State College and I have been thrilled with my experience here. The bay-side campus is well located for students from Panama City Beach or even Panama City proper. The staff and faculty are always ready to help with any issues you may have.
Freshman,5,"I love this campus. Everyone is very nice. Academics are good and the vibe is awesome. The bay is right across from the college, which is amazing!"
Freshman,5,I like how everyone gets along and there is a diversity of cultures and ethnicity. The professors i have had so far are awesome and very helpful!
Freshman,5,"I enjoy Gulf Coast State College. It is a beautiful campus, has great, helpful professors, and is in a beautiful location. The only thing that I could say needs improvement is the number of classes offered in the afternoon, for students who work in the morning."
Sophomore,5,"Gulf Coast State College provides a world class education close to home. Most of the professors are professionals in their respective fields, so they are very passionate about the courses they teach."
Niche User,5,It's a wonderful college with awesome staff. The campus is beautiful and I thoroughly enjoy going to this school
Sophomore,5,"I believe Gulf Coast State College is the perfect school for those who are not quite prepared for a big university. The class sizes are just right and students really get one on one time with their professors. With the help of the amazing staff at GCSC, it is easy to transfer to a university."
Sophomore,4,I take all my courses online because I work part-time. The use of the student portal is simple and accessing my coursework is simple as well.
Sophomore,4,I did took the online class for two semester and which is good but I feel like I am more of the face to face learning person than online.
Sophomore,4,I have found the teachers and administration to be caring about my future. Most of them seem to make a genuine effort to create an impact
Freshman,4,"I will say, ""I love GCSC"". There are many resources and opportunities for our very diverse community/campus. GCSC has something that makes students that want to attend here, for example, less expensive tuition."
Niche User,4,"I've had a great experience at GCSC. My first semester was great, I had really good professors that helped me succeed."
Freshman,4,"I have only been at Gulf Coast for a semester but it has been great so far. The teachers are mellow and like the crack jokes, I think its because they know we are fresh out of high school and are still a little afraid of the change. High school teachers make college seem like the end of the world though, it is not as bad as they put it. You have old friends with and you make new friends easily. Gulf Coast could use housing, some students are coming from great distances to go there and it would be easier on them just to live close by. The cafeteria is open all day so night classes have something to eat in between classes, which I appreciate as I take night classes this semester. Over all Gulf Coast is a good school as will help you do great things."
Freshman,4,"I have been a Dual Enrolled student here for about 3 years and am fully enrolling in Gulf Coast within the next couple weeks. The teachers were definitely difficult, but i enjoyed the challenge from time to time. Having a difficult teacher also pushed me to change the way i thought about or looked at a situation."
Sophomore,4,"While being at Gulf Coast, I have felt this faculty is seeking for the success in their students. The teachers I have experience all worked to challenge their students in improving not only their skills but also critically and creatively thinking for themselves. I feel prepared in moving into the next chapter of college and ready to take on what comes next in my Junior year."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are good and there is a lot of diversity among the school body. The only problem that I faced is that the adviser I was supposed to go to for classes, told me that I had to take a class that I don't need for my major. I just found out that I wasn't supposed to take it from my division adviser since I am now going into my major, so I basically wasted two classes."
Niche User,4,"For the rather inconvenient place that it's been built, being right next to an extremely busy bridge and intersection, the school itself makes the best of it's situation. It's a lovely campus right next to the Gulf(as it's title may suggest) and its interior is a lovely exhibition of architecture, competent instructors, a decent cafeteria and a strong plethora of extra-curricular activities."
Junior,4,"I have been attending Gulf Coast for over two years. Gulf Coast is like a grade 13. Since it is a state college, the academics is more relaxed and even easier. I do not like that it has not been challenging. Their career course like the ems degree  and other ones such as surgical technician, radiology and etc provides the opportunity for people to earn a degree in a profession in a short period of time and I enjoy that about the college."
Sophomore,4,Great professors who don't mind helping students. They also have centers that help students with writing & math.
Sophomore,4,"I enrolled at Gulf Coast State College in 2016 since then I have grown to appreciate their services and staff members. When it comes to academics, the help students receive is incredible and very reliable. They offer free tutoring as well as one and one meetings with professors. They also provide non-credit classes that students of all ages can take for fun. Despite all the great resources they offer at Gulf Coast State College, they need funding organizations like students loans or scholarships for international students like my self. It is hard to suffer in your own country trying to get an education only to suffer even more in another man's country."
Sophomore,4,The location is great for someone not looking for a huge college town. I loved the classroom environment with 20-30 people.
Senior,4,"It is a very good clean school. The academic instructors in my program are great. I think some of the departments need to update their equipment for better learning, but overall is a great school"
Freshman,4,"Gulf coast has many great teachers that are there to help you pass the class, but not baby you. As long as you have the desire to pass the class and communicate with your instructor, you will be set."
Freshman,4,"Gulf Coast State College is a small state college with professors willing to help you become as successful as you will allow yourself to be. Located in Panama City, Florida it's right on the water and is a beautiful place to go to school with some of the world's most renown beaches just minutes away. GCSC also has very successful NJCAA athletics known for sending their student-athletes to a wide range of Division 1 schools."
Sophomore,4,"Gulf Coast State college is a great step for preparation for higher learning and job opportunities. Professors are great, some can be rude though."
Alum,4,"Gulf Coast State College is a very diverse campus. The age demographic is very wide. It's not only common to see fresh out of high school students but also thirty or forty-year-old students wanting a career change. 

Also, each school year the college is expanding its programs to offer quality careers in new workforces. For example, unmanned vehicles and 3D printing (not only plastic, their culinary program has a 3D chocolate printer). 

With a student ratio of 18:1, they have smaller classes that allow more time to be available for questions and in-depth conversations in class topics. 

I'm very proud to be a Commodore!"
Alum,4,Gulf Coast State College was a great school to receive me RN degree. The professors and staff take a personal interest in your success.
Senior,4,"Gulf Coast State College is great for those wishing to earn an AA degree and save money before transferring to another college or university. Most of the professors are great, and if you struggle in their class, they all offer office hours and reply to emails in a timely manner. There's also a free math lab and free writing lab.

The campus is small compared to other universities and you can easily walk from one end of the campus to the other. For the size, there's a lot of clubs and student activity, but I haven't gotten very involved myself. Because it used to be a community college, there's no housing or dorms.

Most of the books required for class can be rented off Amazon or sometimes rented from the book store itself so you don't have to spend hundreds on a book you'll use for one semester."
Sophomore,4,"Gulf Coast State College is an overall wonderful school. The professors are friendly and always exchange ""hi's"" on their way to their next class. Most professors here are always willing to help you succeed academically. The campus is also located in a beautiful area too. Sitting right by the bay, it is nice to take a break and go by the water. Overall, if you want a smaller school with beautiful views Gulf Coast State College is the place for you!"
Freshman,4,"Over all my experience at Gulf Coast State College has been filled with mixed feelings. When I first started college, I went to see an advisor to see what classes I needed to take for my degree. They signed me up for a class I didn't need and I had to end up withdrawing. This set me behind in my original goal. On the other hand, I've had other faculty members help me in numerous way. I'd like to see advisor take time to actually take time to listen to what students have to say instead of signing them up for whatever class they see fit."
Senior,4,Gulf Coast State College is the most appropriate school if you want to have small classes and get to know your professors better.
Sophomore,4,h My experience hasn't been so bad. I really like the professors and the classes. I wish they offered more times for different classes and different summer classes though because i do have children and a full time job. also i have been out of school for a long time so when i first enrolled i wish they would have taken the time to explain things to me. I didn't realize that campus existed or that i was supposed to be on it doing assignments so i started out behind.
Freshman,4,Very friendly environment. Truly gives you a taste of southern hospitality. Various ways to be involved in the community through school programs. Students are very social and they include every one in on and off campus events. It’s a very diverse group of students arranging from all ages and ethnic backgrounds. Class sizes are smaller and allows teachers to develop a relationship and better understand their students strengths and weaknesses. Advisors are very helpful and friendly. The only bad thing is the traffic going to and leaving from school.
Alum,4,"This is a pretty small college, which means low costs/fees and small class sizes. I saved a lot of money staying home and earning my AA degree here, and the credits are pretty easy to transfer just about anywhere, especially FSU."
Freshman,4,"In my experience, this college is of great value and good learning. It may be small but, that doesn't take away from its quality. I am just a freshman right now but, I hope I get as much enjoyment out of this college as I can."
Sophomore,4,"Gulf Coast State College is a welcoming school with instructors that are always to go above and beyond to help you reach your dreams.  I am returning to college after being out of school for twenty years.  I was extremely nervous about starting college again. But,  I am so glad that I made the decision to attend Gulf Coast State College.  Not only do I feel accepted by the staff but also the students.  Everyone there has one goal, and that is, to see everyone succeed!"
Sophomore,4,"Gulf Coast State College has been nothing but great since I have been enrolled.  I am currently in their PTA program, and I love every bit of it. The PTA program at GCSC is one of their best programs, with nearly a 100% success rate.  The director and assistant director of the program are very helpful and are great teachers."
Freshman,4,"Gulf Coast State College is a State college located in Panama City, Fl. The administration made the transfer into college from high school very easy. The Professors give their personal office hours allowing students the option to have one on one time. If you find yourself in need of an English, or Math tutor the college offers cost free specific tutor labs. These labs are available 5 days a week; the labs have always 2-5 math tutors. The campus is constantly undergoing construction ensuring the campus is up to date with the appearance and electronics. So, overall Gulf Coast State College is a very pleasant school to be able to attend."
Freshman,4,"The staff at GCSC are very helpful. When I first arrived, someone in the Health Science building took me on a tour of the building and printed a list of local  FREE activities that I might be interested in."
College Senior,4,You can always set classes around your personal schedule. I would advise that you enter classes as soon as possible because the seats go extremely fast.
College Senior,4,"Professors respond in a timely manner which is wonderful. If i don't understand something they don't mind further explaining this to me. Of course, any online proctor exams are taken in school."
College Senior,4,I've attended this school for a few years and so far it's good. getting ready to return this fall into the pharmacy tech program. I'm looking forward to new opprotunities.
College Sophomore,4,The overall application was easy to complete and understand. Whenever a question arised I was able to get in contact with my advisor and get an answer right away.
College Junior,4,Classes are flexible with students can leaving anytime they want.
College Junior,4,Some classes have too little amount of students while other classes are filled with too many. Seems as if some students have specific professors they want to have teach them. Most classroom are too cold.
College Junior,4,Specific fields available have leaders right at the top who love their job and seem to lead with their heart.
College Junior,4,Starr and other students are so friendly! Very laid back and inviting for a first time college student.
College Senior,4,The career center hosts many people who are very well acquainted with the post-grad world. They'll sit down with you and help for hours at the time. It's outstanding.
College Senior,4,"I have taken two semesters of classes now, and I have had only one issue with one professor. Other than that, I feel as if online classes were the best decision for me. They were small in sizes and the professors were almost always online to answer any questions that I had."
College Senior,4,"Right after high school, I sat down with a course and career adviser. She helped both my sister and I pick which classes would be best. She also told us about internships and groups that we might be interested in. She was amazing and answered every question that we had."
College Senior,4,My overall experience has been wonderful. I am taking online classes and I am majoring in Liberal Arts (AA). Every professor has been great and all the staff at the college has been outstanding when it comes to helping me.
College Freshman,4,"So far, I have not had many snags in the online classroom experience."
College Freshman,4,I have enjoyed the experience with the professors.  Most have been very knowledgeable and helpful.
College Freshman,4,There are many career prospects at this school.  I am currently attending to complete my AS degree
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed the online class experience and anytime that I have went to the school to test or take a lab, everyone has been very helpful and courteous."
College Freshman,4,I have had some really wonderful professors.  I have only had one that was unprofessional in her teaching and did not seem to engage well with her students.
College Junior,4,"So far, the school is a great experience. I've gotten a lot of help and my teacher for my degree field has been very patient and understanding of things. He's gone to great extents to make sure things were done and that I was moving along at just the right speed even going so far as to schedule summer classes he doesn't have just for me. The application process was okay as are most processes but the people were friendly and were willing to work to help me when I first applied. It's an all around good school"
College Student,4,"I have not started classes yet, so I cannot rate my academic experience."
College Student,4,"I have yet to start classes, but so far that application process has been easy. I am currently waiting on previous transcripts and test scores to arrive."
College Freshman,4,help i just want scholarship money what even is this
College Freshman,4,I just want scholarship money what is this crap man
College Freshman,4,I don't know anything about it because I am just a dual-enrolled student.
College Freshman,4,I just want scholarship money please and thank you.
College Freshman,4,I am just a dual-enrolled student looking for scholarship money.
College Freshman,4,I am just a dual-enrolled student. I just want scholarship money.
College Freshman,4,"I am a dual-enrolled student, so Gulf Coast is not the same for me as it is for students who actually go to the campus. I am just doing this to try to get scholarship money."
College Sophomore,4,they have excellent teacher like mr phillips
Freshman,2,"Due to the coronavirus, school was transferred to online courses, so everyone had to adjust very quickly, but no one knew what they were doing...it was like rowing a boat without the paddles. Professor that are used to attending to their students in a classroom, had no idea what they were doing with this new online idea."
Sophomore,2,The advising center is absolutely horrible and don't know what they are doing. They simply put the student in classes and fail to look at the big picture and they don't pay attention to course progression or prerequisites/cor-requisites. Most of the teachers are not passionate about the subject that they are teaching and overall moral is very low.
Sophomore,2,The advisors who work at Gulf Coast do not know what they're doing. I saw 3 separate advisors and got 3 completely different answers to questions I had.
College Sophomore,2,GCSC offers a slew of opptions post grad but oftens transfers to a sister campus of FSU in PC right across the street from GCSC
Recent Alumnus,2,"While I know some people who were hired at the college as a student, I was never approached about this, never saw any recruiting, and never knew how to apply for a job as a student on the campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,Online tests do not work correctly
College Junior,2,"The only interaction I had with the schools administration was when registering in 2003, the dean was assisting with registration and advising.  I informed him I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in but I just needed to get the basics out of the way, he informed me to save my daddys money and my time and get into the work force until I was clear on my educational needs.  Needless to say I haven't discussed options with an adviser since."
College Freshman,2,haven't had too much interaction
College Freshman,2,no one has contacted me
College Freshman,2,no one has recommended anything 
College Sophomore,2,"The library in Gulf Coast State College is great. However, the only problem I have is that it takes too much effort to print colored pages. Students here also have to pay in order to print."
College Junior,2,What Gulf Coast State college doesnt inform you (until its too late) that students using Florida Prepaid have to physically tell the financial office that they want to use it otherwise they wont and you get dropped from your classes
College Junior,2,"Gulf Coast has small classes which allow for more one on one time with the teachers, and the teachers themselves are very good. the only thing that Gulf Coast lacks in is their administration office. Ive been enrolled in 5 semesters at this school and only this last semester was i not thrown out of all my classes due to issues with them. Ive had all kinds of excuses like that i had money not paid, they confused me with another girl and since they thought i was her they pulled me out of all my classes to see if i wanted to continue in the classes shes already taken. and every time i was dropped from my classes that i had already set up schedules for i had to get all new classes at different time."
College Sophomore,2,The qualification of Gulf Coast State College didnt meet my expectations.
Recent Alumnus,2,"All of my credits didn't transfer, and I was given ZERO credit for my military experience. (3 years 8 months) Each semester, a class I needed to take, wasn't being offered. The VA Rep was less than helpful. Although when I went to her supervisor (each of the 6 semesters I attended), things were done in a timely fashion. Even though it was late."
College Senior,2,"The way the courses are setup has caused a lot of concern with me and my fellow students. Instead of learning one chapter than taking a test, yu have to learn 3-5 chapters at once. It is too much, since most of us work full time. Teachers are not availible as much in the summer, like they are just there to grade."
College Freshman,2,the school is good overall. but the faulty members  is not willing to help while others are wiling to help. parking is not great at all. you have to walk a mile to class from parking lot . if you a student that doesn't really need help its the school for you. food choices are very limited!!!
College Junior,2,Gulf Coast State College's campus life is non-existent. There are very poor food choices on campus. There is a lack of humanity in the Student Union. Not a very fun place to be.
College Senior,2,A lot of the time I will be in the library trying to print something and it takes a long time to get my material. There is only one color printer available and it very rarely works. There are a lot of computers and computer labs.
College Junior,2,"I am finding it very very difficult to discover financial aid available to me.  I am disabled and still cannot find any type of financial assistance available for the disabled either.  The financial aid staff do not personally assist, they only give me websites to go to."
Sophomore,1,"If GCSC weren't the only state college in this area, then I would have gladly transferred to another school by now. I've received poor advising, where I was told to take certain courses that did not apply towards my chosen degree. That was money out of my pocket, washed down the drain. I have also experienced unprofessional instructors. The school seems to be more concerned with defending their faculty and staff, rather than resolving the issues between the students and professors/staff, while holding them unaccountable for their actions. Luckily, I am transferring over to FSU this Spring and never looking back. My GPA is in the upper 3's, therefore I am student who takes college seriously and during my educational journey, I only wish that the faculty and staff at GCSC would do so as well."
Sophomore,1,"All I can say about Gulf Coast is that I have yet to find a single admissions counselor, or faculty member that cares. No one seems to know what's going on. The faculty will either send you on a wild goose chase where you talk to other faculty who also don't know what to do, or will just give you false information that you won't know is wrong until it's too late. For some reason, they refuse to look at what credits you already have, which means they aren't exactly sure of what you should be taking. I had to change my degree to a general AA from my Software engineering option AA because I had been advised to take the wrong courses, and would have to stay another 3-4 years at Gulf Coast just to get an associates degree. I honestly regret choosing this college and am looking forward to leaving in the Spring."
Freshman,1,I am a current student of GCSC and I wouldn’t recomend the college tonanyone as their students are only money to the staff. If you need any help or advising you are told it is your responsibility and they can’t help. If teachers don’t want to help students they need to retire. I have had professors tell me they won’t answer my one question because another student has asked to many and he was “tired of helping people” if Gulf Coast State College doesn’t care about their students they could at least stop pretending to just to make the school look good. I have had a bad experience with almost every department in the college from financial aid to student affairs where the Vice President chose to stop answering my emails because it my concern was a non issue after she told me I should work harder.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't qualify for grants; however, I am eligible for loans and other aid. I pay for most of my tuition out of pocket and I have to work for it. I would consider myself with financial need because I cannot afford to move out of the house. I work to pay for school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I used the Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for all of my classes at my most recent college. The VA Rep at this school had NO prior experience with VA students. The two previous VA Reps had 10+ years of helping Veterans. When I first enrolled, the VA Rep forgot ONE vital form which resulted in me not getting the housing allowance for over 2 months. My fiancé and I had just moved to the area for me to attend school there, and we had to go through the American Red Cross to get a $2000+ emergency grant to help pay rent and bills. Luckily our apartment complex was very understanding and we weren't evicted. Each semester I enrolled, there was some problem with my VA paperwork, and that resulted in the school not getting paid on time and turning to me, and I didn't get the Post-9/11 housing allowance, so we were charged late fees in excess of $1000 total."
College Senior,1,"Honestly, the financial aid isn't enough to live on by itself. Some cources, for example, require very expensive books or labs. FA doesn't consider this. Also, the housing and food allowing is well below what actual costs are. If you don't work, you won't make it. Some computer related course are so long that is is hard to hold a job at the same time. FA is like this country wide, not just my college."

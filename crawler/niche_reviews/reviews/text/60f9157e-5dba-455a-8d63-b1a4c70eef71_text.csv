Sophomore,5,"I really like it here. The professors are very personable and truly care about you, the class sizes are small, and the community is exceptional. The downfall is a lack of diversity, however, it is improving."
Freshman,5,I like how nice the deans and professors are. They care about you and are considerate. They are kind and willing to listen.
Freshman,5,"I would say overall everything is nice. The deans and professors are amazing and so is the campus. They make sure that if you have any problems, that they are taken care of. They are here to listen and to help you."
Sophomore,5,"Just after midterms, we had to switch to online only schooling, at first for 4 weeks, then for the remainder of the Spring semester.  The professors used our virtual schooling platform as well as Zoom to help the class stay on track. The campus community was as open to assisting their students as possible. All in all, JU stepped up to the plate when we needed them, exactly the way they should have."
Sophomore,5,"Johnson us a great school to help you learn as much as you can about the world from a Biblical perspective. Every professor is on your side, and every teacher, student, RA and friend are excited to celebrate you. You come to a school like this to grow in your Christian faith and prepare to do God's work in whatever career path you choose."
Sophomore,5,"I really like the community feel of the entire school. Everyone does a great job on including new students to the campus. Overall, the love that is shown is truly genuine"
Freshman,5,"This was my first year attending JU, and I loved every minute of it. It is truly and uncommon community, filled with so many exceptional people and professors! If you're looking to get a great Christian education this is the place for you! Everyone here majors in their major of choice, along with Bible and Theology (so you double major), so keep that in mind before applying. You will have to take over 30 hours of Bible courses, so just a heads up is that's not really your thing.  It's also BEAUTIFUL! We're about 25 minutes away from downtown knox and about 35-45 from the Gatlinburg, Sevierville area. Work study jobs are available in just about any department you can think of, and my employer works really well with my school schedule. Not to mention the great dorms. You get your own bathroom, sink, and shower and one roommate. They're super spacious too."
Freshman,5,Such a positive environment. You really get the feeling that you belong and the staff of the university go above and beyond to help you with your college experience.

Freshman,5,"I was impressed by the knowledge, customer service, as well as care I received when I toured Johnson."
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed my 2 years here. The education is top notch. Location is great, there is lots to do on your free time. Campus is small so its easy to feel like a community instead of just another number. It' s been a great experience."
Graduate Student,5,"I am continuing education for my Master's in Education. Johnson University has been the best in providing a program to allow me to work and attend school.  14 month fast program, but very rewarding so far!"

Freshman,5,"I will be attending Johnson in the fall and I am currently sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting for the moment that I get to be there. The environment is filled with a homey feeling and best of all, they are rooted in making sure that the students and growing in their faith."

Junior,5,Amazing campus with incredible professors! I just wish everyone in the entire world would see this college. Man oh man do i love this college. I just really need money. College is so expensive. Like seriously who has money to pay for any of this stuff? This college is amazing but i'm doing this scholarship to stave off crippling debt from my family for at least an hour. No one will read this. So that's my overall experience.
Freshman,5,"So far, as a freshman, the staff and students I have met are excellent. So open in helping me with any questions or concerns I had. When I have been on campus, the student and staff makes you feel like a family. Being away from my family it definitely makes it a easier transition."
Niche User,5,Johnson is a wonderful school where students are equipped with the life skills necessary in order to make an impact on the world around them.

There is also a work-study program to assistance students with paying for their tuition."
College Freshman,5,"Overall experience has been awesome, love being part of the family"

College Sophomore,5,We are presented with many opportunities to consider during our educational experience and Johnson University TN.  The professors are ready and able to point us in the right direction.
College Sophomore,5,I am a non-traditional student with a husband and children on campus with me.  We live in a duplex on campus for non-traditional students.  It is absolutely wonderful.  There is a playground for our children in the culde-sac.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a non-traditional Student.  My husband, three children and I moved to TN so that I could earn my bachelors degree.  I was worried about going to classes with students much younger than me.  The students and professors exceeded my expectations of school.  I felt welcomed and not at all uncomfortable from the very first class.  My favorite experience was the day I was having a horrible morning and was so close to having an anxiety attack that I could feel myself melting down and not able to breathe.  I walked in my classroom to find 3 other students already there.  I wanted to run and hide because I was embarrassed.  Instead I walked up to one of them and simply said pray for me.  They all laid their hands on me and prayed.  Their prayer melted all of my anxiety away instantly.  During the prayer our professor and other students came in.  They didn't know what was going on but stopped walking immediately and bowed their heads.  There was no teasing, no sidelong looks, nothing.  Just pure friendship and love was shown to me.  I would choose this school over and over again and have encouraged kids in my life to attend Johnson University."
College Freshman,5,"There are no drugs on campus, no peer pressure to do drugs"
College Freshman,5,"There is a huge sense of community at Johnson. The professers really care about you and work with you with anything you need.

College Freshman,5,Johnson is more than I ever expected.  I have made so many new friends and I know will be long lasting relationships.  The professors are always there to help you if needed and they truly care about each of their students.
College Freshman,5,"Very connected with students. Close to town but distanced enough to not be disturbed. Community based college. We have residence halls not dorms me and my roommate have a bathroom we share with a shower, we even have a tiny kitchenette. The area is very friendly and feels great to be in. I'm not interested in extracurricular activities but JohnsonU has many opportunities for everyone."
College Freshman,5,The rooms are spacious and the housing is great.
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus. I regularly see security guards, and they are attentive and friendly."

College Sophomore,5,"I feel completely safe on campus.  We have security enforcement, but I have never heard of a case that they were needed.  Any form of crime on campus is very rare.  The school has a nurse that works every week day and I have never waited to visit her in her office.  We also have a personal trainer that comes on Tuesdays to help people that are suffering from sport injuries."
College Sophomore,5,"While the individual scholarships may not seem as great as other schools, every student receives a great deal of scholarships which goes unseen. The prices of the school are kept low and they still offer scholarships beyond that."
College Sophomore,5,I do not feel threatened at all and the campus provides both security officers and a nurse.
College Sophomore,5,"Johnson is a small campus, and there is always plenty of room in front of the dorms and pretty much anywhere. There are some off-limit spaces that will get you fined, and security is pretty strict about that. I got through one year at school without a car, but Johnson isn't 15 minutes away from everything, so if you want to do stuff off-campus you will need a car or a friend with one."
College Freshman,5,"The parking at our dormitories is great. There are plenty of spaces really close to the buildings.  Around campus students are restricted from parking in certain areas, and we may get disciplinary recommendations if we violate this. our campus is fairly small, so you can get by without a car easily. However, if you want to do stuff off campus, you have  problem."
College Freshman,5,"I am Preaching and Youth Ministry major, and I love it.  The program is very well put together, with excellent advisors, professors, and faculty.  They keep us very up-to-date on opportunities for internships and jobs."
College Freshman,5,"I received a great deal of financial aid, and the people who work in the Financial Aid Office are extremely kind and helpful.  I do suggest keeping track of all documents, as you never know when you will need them.  I have not had any trouble with such issues at Johnson; I just prefer to play things on the safe side."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love the Human Service department here! They do a fantastic job!
Sophomore,4,"Due to the unique circumstances most schools were in over the past few months, Johnson moved to an online format. Resulting, in having to take my classes this semester online. Though, classes did not go as planned the students, faculty, and staff did a wonderful job adjusting and made the most out of the situation. My professors did an excellent job with continuing education to the best way for each student. Overall, I was personally happy even with the circumstances. I will have my first official online course this summer."
Sophomore,4,I really like the community of students and professors at Johnson University.  We build really good relationships with our professors because almost everyone lives on campus.  The professors truly care about the students and want us to succeed.
Senior,4,"Amazing community, even as a socially anxious person I had easily found friends. Class size is kept small, with some only having 10 students or as big as 40, but that is generally just for the freshman level courses. Professors are all friendly, flexible and understandable. Great Christian Atmosphere!"
Senior,4,"Johnson University is a fine place to go to college. Relative to other private/Christian Universities, Johnson's academics seem to hold up well within most departments. The mandatory Bible core has unexpectedly turned out to be one of my favorite things about this institution. Also, the dorm rooms are indeed really really nice. All of the professors have been extremely cooperative and approachable. In general, because the campus is so small, all of the faculty and staff seem genuinely invested in each student's well-being, and would do anything for their beneficence."
Junior,4,"The faculty here are absolutely incredible. They are open-minded and supportive in so many ways. For a private university, the price is unbeatable. I definitely wish the higher-ups took more student opinion into account, and let go of a lot of outdated regulations. I also think the financial aid office could be better."
Freshman,4,"It's my first year attending Johnson and I'd have to say my experience has been good overall. If you are looking for a good Christian education, Johnson is the place for you. The professors are very friendly and have a passion for the material. The campus community is very tight-knit. I feel like I've met some of my best friends for life at JU. The only bad side of it all is that being surrounded by a bunch of people who are like-minded can start to feel a little boring. Other than that, Johnson University is a great school!"
Freshman,4,I like the campus. I attend the Florida campus and it may not look as good as other colleges but that does not mean it is bad. Everyone knows each other and treat themselves like family. Besides they always plan fun activities to keep the community of students together. Also they are building the cafeteria now so things are going to get better
Junior,4,"Johnson University is a wonderful college. Johnson offers a multitude of opportunities to make the world a better place. The campus is gorgeous and the student life is full of activity. Its location is pristine, located next to the French Broad River tucked out of the way while just 20 minutes outside of downtown Knoxville. The faculty is like family and work excessively to help invest in your college career. This school is a perfect, small, family community to learn and grow in. "

They encourage coming to office hours, and they even don't mind to make arrangements that will work for you. They also take the time and get to know you. They also attend most events to support their students."
College Freshman,4,I want to serve the Lord and believe that Johnson is going to be able to provide that for me.  I have the opportunity to travel to New York in the Spring with our school newspaper and can't wait for that.
College Freshman,4,"The sense of community is what makes this school unique. The professors are very nice, Christian people. I would choose this school over again if I had to because it is affordable, the classes are great, and the campus is so beautiful!"
College Freshman,4,There is every place you can imagine to eat at off campus. I love how close every restaurant is to campus.
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid process is very easy to get through and the people I had helping me made it a lot easier. However, after my freshman year I lost most of my scholarships and it does not seem like there are many options to gain some of those back."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are amazing and I love the people i am surrounded by each and every day. Every one I am surrounded by at Johnson makes me strive to become a better disciple maker and encourages me to grow closer with the Lord. Johnson provides a safe living space and I cannot wait to be back there enjoying another year of college, as well as furthering my biblical knowledge."

College Student,2,"Pretty Strict School – Being a Christian school, Johnson is pretty strict. You don't get in trouble for missing curfew a few times, but the curfew laws are more strict on girls than on guys. If you live off of campus, you do not have to worry too much about the standards. Punishments can be severe if a students keeps getting in trouble."
College Sophomore,1,The grading at JUFL is annoying and discouraging in all aspects. Students are easily frustrated with the grading as well as the teaching strategies of various professors.

College Sophomore,1,"These on campus apartments are extremely old and have not even been remodeled. Because of this, there is often mold problems in various apartments."
College Sophomore,1,"This ""Christian"" institution has way too much power over students. It is not run with the Christian morals it claims to uphold, but instead faculty members abuse their authority and don't consider the life of the students. There are good faculty members here at Johnson University Florida, but for the most part I would never recommend this school due to the lack of Christian ethics and morals that are exemplified by the staff."

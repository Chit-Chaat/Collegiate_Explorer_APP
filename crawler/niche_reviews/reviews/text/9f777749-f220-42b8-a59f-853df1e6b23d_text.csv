Sophomore,5,"You would think that the transition from in-person education to online learning would present difficult and unforeseen challenges for professors and students alike, but due to the careful planning of Oglethorpe's teaching staff, that outcome was avoided entirely. Not only was the adjustment to online learning seamless, but it also served to enhance my ability and desire to learn."
Sophomore,5,I'm going on my second year as a student at Oglethorpe University and I have always been very pleased with the professionalism of all the faculty members.
Alum,5,"I did my undergrad here, and I loved it. Its a small private school so you get a one-on-one experience in the classroom. The teachers and staff an"
Sophomore,5,"Oglethorpe University is a place where anyone can feel welcome. From your first visit they create a comfortable atmosphere where you can be yourself and find others who you relate to. The professors care about what they teach and are invested in helping their students obtain a through understanding of the material. There are many opportunities to be involved on campus even as a freshman, such as SGA, starting a new club, or bringing a fraternity to campus."
Sophomore,5,"I very much engage enjoyed my experience at Oglethorpe thus far. The academics are rigorous, with an intimate classroom setting that enhances learning. With a small campus of a little over 1,000 students, you feel connected to those around you very quickly. The professors and staff are lovely and will kindly show you in the right direction for any problems."
Senior,5,"The community at Oglethorpe is unmatched. I have made my second family there. I love the professors, and they’re always there for you if you need extra help with anything. They even get to know you outside of an academic standpoint. There are so many opportunities afforded to students, as well as, resources. I love the small school feel in a big city. You can engage as much or as little as you’d like. Oglethorpe will forever be my second home."
Senior,5,When Covid happened and we moved online our professors did everything they could to make the transition as painless as possible.
Senior,5,"I have been treated as an individual, given many opportunities to lead, and challenged academically. I would recommend to any student ready for an enjoyably challenging college experience."
Senior,5,I have only taken a handful of online classes. I have enjoyed them for the most part. They tend to have more work but other than that an enjoyable experience.
Sophomore,5,Professors made a quick turn around due to the covid pandemic. They really cared about the success of their students even at home
Sophomore,5,The clubs and opportunities are amazing. All of the staff members treat students and one another with respect. Small class room sizes help me learn a lot better
Senior,5,Oglethorpe has been very ideal since the beginning. It has given me opportunities I didn’t know were possible until utilizing the community’s resources.
Junior,5,"Attending Oglethorpe was a great decision! The university has truly shaped me into the person I am today- both professionally and personally. The Core Program was one of the qualities that originally attracted me to the school, and the Core courses have been so eye opening."
Junior,5,"Online learning was way easier than expected. My professors were just as engaging as their in-person courses, and I learned all the material."
Freshman,5,"I found Oglethorpe to be very friendly, yet at times my communication with my counselor was interrupted due to system errors."
Freshman,5,"Small campus but so many opportunities and events. Coming here was the best thing I’ve ever done. The professors are genuine and love knowing about each student personally. All faculty are supportive in athletics and academics, as well as future career advising. Greek life is also great here! All sorts of people are welcome at Oglethorpe and we’re all like a big family!"
Niche User,5,Oglethorpe is absolutely amazing! I fell in love with the school the second I found out about their CORE program. One of the amazing attributes this schools has is it’s hands on process with their scholarship weekend. I also like their FLAGship program.
Freshman,5,"So far I would say attending Oglethorpe University is one of the best decisions I have ever made. The campus is beautiful, I feel safe at all times, and the professors are nothing short of amazing. They ignite complex conversations and make even three hour classes feel like a good use of your time. Truly, the faculty and staff at Oglethorpe make it feel like a home away from home."
Freshman,5,"Their campus was so welcoming and open. The people there are very kind and are willing to help you. There are so many opportunities offered there that you can participate in such as, STEM Fest, college essay writing workshop, financial aid workshop. One thing that has really attracted me was the new Cousins Center for Science and Innovation which was the new building that they had built which was a very beautiful and open building."
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year, Oglethorpe quickly became my home. Its ample extracurricular activities, faculty and staff, and a friendly campus environment have all made it easy to stand out here and make long-lasting relationships. The opportunities here have offered me a tremendous amount of experience to add to my resume, and the small class sizes have allowed me to learn more detail about my field of interest than I could ever learn at a big school."
Sophomore,5,"Oglethorpe has so many amazing opportunities, from PRSSA, business school, internships, and jobs. The school does a wonderful job of preparing you for the future and helps get you started on your career early."
Works Here,5,"Oglethorpe is such an amazing and diverse community. Staff and faculty are so supportive and students are inclusive, engaged, and thoughtful. It is really a home!!"
Freshman,5,The staff is always kind and ready to help in whichever way they can. The class sizes are small enough that your teacher knows who you are and they have so many fun events to get students involved on campus.
Alum,5,The campus made me feel like I was at an elite university. The coursework was cool and the surrounding area is the metro-Atlanta's most super luxe area. Plenty of activities off campus within five square miles.
Senior,5,"The small class sizes along with the professor and faculty involvement is the difference  between being a name and a face rather than a number in a lecture hall, and that makes all the difference in the world!"
Junior,5,"I am 100% sure I made the right choice in coming here. People here are all committed to the goal of learning in a relevant and applicable way. I’m getting a great education, and building a great and meaningful life while here."
Senior,5,"I love Oglethorpe! I say that it is in fact best of both worlds, you have a small, supportive community on campus while at the same time you have the option to explore everything Atlanta has to offer. Oglethorpe is located right next to the exciting Buckhead district and downtown Atlanta is also very easy to reach. 
A small school also means small class size, so you also get great professor interaction and personal attention, and that is what makes Oglethorpe so unique!"
Sophomore,5,"The main thing I liked about Oglethorpe is its growth in diversity! With every new group of potential freshman that come, you start to see more and more people from all backgrounds come to visit. The only change I would wish to see is in the food selection and even then, they are doing their best to accommodate everyone."
Niche User,5,"I love the feeling of community that engulfed me as soon as I stepped foot on campus. Everyone was so kind and friendly. I love how beautiful the campus is with its stone buildings and trees and gardens. Overall, my experience at Oglethorpe was fantastic and definitely one of the better college experiences I have had!"
Junior,5,"I love how small the campus is, and I love the faculty so much! The campus grounds are probably the best part, with a new science building being added in the next year, but I wish that they would pay more attention to the arts."
Freshman,5,Oglethorpe University is a small coeducational university located in the Brookhaven community outside of Atlanta. They value student involvement in the community and excel in utilizing courses which will prepare students for the real world.
Freshman,5,"The professors are out of this world. So are the rest of the faculty and staff. Everyone works together to get the student the best help. I've only taken a semester worth of classes, but the professors I've had were all wonderful and relatable. The campus is gorgeous as well. I wish there was better Wifi on campus, though."
Sophomore,5,"Great school transferred from Georgia State after realizing I wanted something more collegiate. Despite the low enrollment people here are extremely focused and close knit. Greek life is fun as well as being able to talk to your professors one on one. 

Without a doubt this school is diverse, and being in Brookhaven is amazing. To live in one of the safest areas is pretty awesome!"
Alum,5,"While there are mixed reviews about Oglethorpe, I loved my time here. Oglethorpe really encouraged me to be a life long learner. Both the Staff and Faulty members showed how much they cared for me and I remain in contact with them after graduation. However, this is not a research university and if you are interested in doing research you should apply to the Honors Program. Oglethorpe also offers very good Financial Aid, so don't let the price tag keep you from applying!"
Niche User,5,I went on a tour and the whole place was amazing! Not too far out of the city and not too inside of the city making it a perfect place for feeling close and comfy without being overcrowded as in the cities! :)
Alum,5,"I graduated as B.S in biology.  I participated in soccer, Greek life and student government.  I have to say that I academics were though and very challenging.  Most of my professor still contact me to see how I'm doing (small school advantage). The core curriculum help me substantially during an interview at Emory for grad school.  You get what you put into this school. I have to say I did take a couple classes at KSU and Oglethorpe is more challenging academically speaking."
Junior,5,Great school with amazing location! Greek life and parties are awesome. The accounting department is very good! I enjoy every part of it.
Junior,5,"Oglethorpe is great! There are small class sizes with professors and faculty that are qualified and who truly care. At Oglethorpe, the students' voices are heard, it's safe, it's easy to make friends, and there's ALWAYS an opportunity for fun or free food. The academic experience is also out of this world, if you love your major you'll be in class with other people that love the same major...And if you don't know what major to pick, there's lots of people to help you figure it out! Networking is a big deal as well, and there are countless opportunities basically just thrown in your face, whether it's an internship or study abroad, or a job after graduation. It's expensive, but when you consider the top-tier resources inside the classroom and out,  the plethora of student activities throughout the semester, and cafeteria food that actually tastes good.. it's worth it. Plus the campus is gorgeous! Many movies were filmed there. That being said, the wi-fi sucks. They're trying though."
College Freshman,5,The campus administrators make it clear that sexual assault is a serious thing and help provide a safe place for the students.
College Freshman,5,There is always about two or three campus officers on site at all times. I have always felt safe here. There is very little to no crime at all that takes place here on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The topic of sports is always prevalent within campus life at my college. There are many sports for the athletic and non-athletic to participate in. A lot of students and people from the community attend many games. For sure, basketball is the most attended sport event. It gets pretty loud in the gym. The sport of quidditch from Harry Potter is played on campus grounds every year. This is because Oglethorpe University has beautiful gothic architecture that resembles the school Harry Potter attended himself. Overall, you will always find athletics to take part in no matter your skill level."
College Senior,5,The courses and professors are amazing and diverse.
College Senior,5,It is a very safe campus.
College Senior,5,Oglethorpe is a great university with a close knit community.
College Freshman,5,The security and students are very cautious about everything going on.
College Freshman,5,The athletics at Oglethorpe is the best that I have experienced. They're very caring and they care a lot about the health and well being of the athletes.
College Freshman,5,It is a very accepting school and they involve everyone in everything.
College Freshman,5,This school is absolutely amazing. There is nothing that I would change about my experience here. Keep on remaining excellent Oglethorpe. Glad to be a Petrel.
College Freshman,5,This school has so many different options and sources that it's hard to imagine not being able to find your calling.
College Freshman,5,This school seems really really safe. I feel like I am out of harms way at the school.
College Freshman,5,This is a school that cares. Teachers don't treat their work like just a job. I appreciate that.
College Freshman,5,The greatest thing about Oglethorpe is the high diversity rate
College Freshman,5,From an academic stand point I would have to say that my school is always on top. My school challenges everyones academic strengths and abilities. Professors generally want students to do well in their classes and are willing to help students do better. The professors at my school assign a pretty nice workload to students in order to push them forward abs challenge them to do better.
College Freshman,5,"There are many student work options that are available. Also,  the student/career center is very helpful with letting students know about internships that are available and what students can do to obtain that internship/job opportunity."
College Freshman,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed my courses at school so far. The fact that my professors are so passionate about what they are teaching is extremely helpful and makes the class fun. There are many different classes offered to all students and with the small class sizes we are able to fit more information into class time. Since the classes are small we are also able to not only focus more on the information but we get to have more of a relationship with our professors in a professional manner.
College Freshman,5,The core pushes you to think critically. It's amazing how much you learn in such a short amount of time. I was impressed with how most professors will go out of their way to help students succeed.
College Junior,5,I instantly fell in love with the Campus and the academics.
College Freshman,5,being in atlanta makes it easy to dine off-campus and relatively cheap
College Freshman,5,the environment is great and doesn't pose a threat to my health and safety
College Freshman,5,There are not really any major problems the school is fairly good about prevention and help for those that need it
Alum,4,Its a small school so you get a one-on-one experience in the classroom. Campus is safe. Professors and staff are really helpful and welcoming. The campus is really safe and there is always things to do around the local area.
Freshman,4,I would say it would be great to go and experience the joys and wonders that hide behind Oglethorpe. You will enjoy your stay.
Freshman,4,I did my best to attend webinars to learn so much about financial aid. I also learned about to always manage your time as well.
Sophomore,4,"After COVID-19 all classes were moved online for the rest of spring semester. The campus took a week for the professors to adjust to this new format, then it was online. Most professors held their class at the same time and day as before but on Zoom, giving the class a way to interact as if they were still in person, while some sent a list of assignments and when they were due. Both methods were successful in covering the material, though the Zoom classes were better in delivering an authentic class experience."
Senior,4,"For those of you saying everyone has trouble learning on online classes, you are wrong. I loved online classes, and which it was incorporated more."
Sophomore,4,"Unfortunately due to COVID-19, classes were held online for most of the spring 2020 semester. While I was still able to learn effectively, a lot of the professors were unprepared for the technology used. Learning is more difficult online for everyone, and this was a challenge. However, I did like the flexibility of schedules and the use of videos and screen sharing."
Senior,4,"My professors were very helpful and understanding; because of this, it made the experience go by smoothly. I was not excited that we went online but at least it went by smoothly."
Freshman,4,"The small community that Oglethorpe has formulated on their campus is unique to the school. As a transfer student, the kindness and comfortable atmosphere helped me adjust here. As a Studio Art major, the professors are always there to guide you throughout your learning experience, as well as advise you on your next steps as you continue your studies."
Junior,4,"The University is very welcoming to new students.  The faculty goes out of their way to help students find their own niche on campus.  Once classes start, most of the professors try their hardest to ensure students succeed not only in classes, but also on their chosen paths in life."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small size and warmth of the campus. The campus is beautiful with a lot of places you can sit and her your thoughts. Everyone including students, professors, facilities and advisors are all there to support you. I would like if the campus had different events."
Sophomore,4,"Oglethorpe is a greatly diverse University with its professors, students, and academics. The professors are super focused on their to students to learn and understand the concepts within their majors. With the academics to be challenging yet easy to learn. The universities food is very poor and use a change. The parking is a complete pain and security does not take is seriously. Overall, the school is a great choice to further one's education."
Sophomore,4,"I have a bit of a love hate relationship with OU. The students and staff are wonderful, and you get to know your teachers. The history department is less than stunning BUT any other department is 100/10. The food has good and bad days. The offerings and advantages for students are top notch and should be considered when thinking about OU as an option."
Alum,4,Beautiful campus & quality education. Oglethorpe has a smaller student body which is great for people who feel comfortable not being in a class with hundreds of students.
Junior,4,"I love how small and close knit of a community Oglethorpe is. I love the small class sizes and caring professors. The food needs significant improvement, and parking. The cost for living and food is overpriced."
Senior,4,I loved the community that I found at Oglethorpe. I've made friends and connections that I don't think  I would have been able to anywhere else. I think the attention that is giving to perspective students gives unrealistic expectations of what they will experience at Oglethorpe. I would change the quality of life provided by the university to current students.
Sophomore,4,"Oglethorpe University has been an absolute dream. Being on a campus were you can go just about anywhere and know someone is comforting. The teachers are dedicated to teaching material and many understand the struggles their students are facing. The understanding of what your students may be going through allows for teachers to not only teach better but, to also help students in need. Aside from the lack of college parties and non school related on campus fun, Oglethorpe is everything I wanted from a college. If the price was lower, it would be perfect."
Freshman,4,"I love Oglethorpe University for the close bonds that students and professors form. Due to their small class environments, professors pay attention to each and every student. If there are any questions to be asked, the professors never hesitate to answer them. However, there are some inconveniences that cannot be avoided due to its small school environment."
Freshman,4,"I've had a great experience. There is a wide array of organizations and programs that you can join to be involved on and off of campus. Also, there are very nice faculty members who can assist you with any personal needs or questions you may have. Additionally, the campus is beautiful, and the student population is very diverse."
Junior,4,"Oglethorpe is a terrific place to learn, both about your chosen field and yourself as a person. The administration is a steaming hot mess; inefficient, habitually unhelpful, and more of an impediment to your learning than a resource."
Sophomore,4,"Oglethorpe is a beautiful campus and the professors are wonderful! Most students would say that their favorite part of Oglethorpe is the faculty. The university could improve upon the selection in the cafeteria. There are not many vegan or gluten-free options, which is unfortunate because students living on campus are forced to pay for a meal plan. I think the university would be better if there were more options or if the meal plan was optional."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school, there are downsides to it as with every school, however, the caring professors and kind people make up for the bad."
Freshman,4,"I loved my time here. Oglethorpe really encouraged me to be a life long learner. However, this is not a research university and if you are interested in doing research you should apply to the Honors Program. Oglethorpe also offers very good Financial Aid, so don't let the price tag keep you from applying! Oglethorpe University is a fantastic 4 year college to attend. It's located in a prime location near midtown and downtown Atlanta. There are also so many great things to see and do on campus. Some examples are the museum located in the Library, shows at the performing arts theater,various clubs, and the endless amounts of events created by the Student Government Association. Oh, can't forget about the sports!"
Senior,4,"Oglethorpe is a wonderful small, private school that offers invaluable opportunities. But it is not limited or closed-off like some private schools can be; Oglethorpe offers a global experience in Atlanta. Plus, if a class or major is not offered, then classes can be taken at other schools through Oglethorpe via the ARCHE program and majors can be independently planned. The instructors are absolutely phenomenal and small class sizes really foster individualized attention and quality feedback.  The students and faculty are very diverse and really make Oglethorpe a school like no other in its class. In addition, some of the buildings are older, but all have beyond what is expected elsewhere. The newer buildings are stellar, especially the main student building which houses the dining hall. Oglethorpe is like an oasis in the business of Atlanta but its proximity allows many opportunities to go out and experience the city as desired."
Senior,4,Oglethorpe is awesome if you love learning in a small school setting. I have enjoyed having one on one time with my professors and I feel that I have learned a lot about my major of study as well as about current events and how they affect various groups of people.
Sophomore,4,"Oglethorpe University is a small private university in the big and wonderful city of Atlanta. It's infrastructure makes you feel like if you are in a Harry Potter movie. Due to its size, you get to know lots of people and have one on one relationships with your professors. The professors have a lot of knowledge and first hand experiences since most have other jobs. I would say their CORE program makes you a well-rounded person."
Junior,4,"I knew as soon as I set foot on Oglethorpe's campus that it would be the place I would be for spend my next four years. They do a wonderful job at including all student's on their campus and because of its small size, the staff is able to communicate effectively and personally with students."
Freshman,4,"So far I've enjoyed my experiences with both teachers and overall university life. The only thing I would have issue with or want to change in the tech service for internet outages and such, as that has been a recurring issue in some buildings."
Sophomore,4,"Oglethorpe University is a fantastic 4 year college to attend. It's located in a prime location near midtown and downtown Atlanta. There are also so many great things to see and do on campus. Some examples are the museum located in the Library, shows at the performing arts theater,various clubs, and the endless amounts of events created by the Student Government Association. Oh, can't forget about the sports! There is so much fun and excitement at every basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, baseball, and just about every other sport game. The professors are amazing, too. Small class sizes allows all students to have more personal interactions with their professor to aid in the best learning experience."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending school at Oglethorpe University. I love the campus, the professors and the programs. However a few things I do not like about the school is the Petrel Points program, parking and the required math course."
Freshman,4,"It's a beautiful small campus, but it definitely feels a bit sheltered. The smaller class sizes are awesome, but my experience has been other students don't participate much in the dialog in class so comes off as too one sided. I have better class interactions at my 300 level (also small class size) state university class. If I've ever had an issue I call the appropriate person and everything has been fixed same day, amazing service! Recommend coming here, but supplementing with some classes from bigger schools to expose yourself to a more metropolitan city."
College Freshman,4,"I can tell that when people graduate from here, they get employment right away due to statistics."
College Freshman,4,The classes that I am in and the professors are all great overall. I enjoy being in class everyday.
College Freshman,4,"From what I have seen, the Greek Life here does a good amount for the community and for the campus."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't really done any of the activities yet, but from what I see, it's great!"
College Freshman,4,The environment of the school is great. The campus is beautiful and it isn't too big or too small. My professors are all fun and easy to understand; they make getting a degree exciting and not as bad as other people say it is. I am looking forward to call this place home for the next few years.
College Junior,4,"It's been a good experience so far. Some things can definitely be improved like technology, resources, and food. But overall a good college."
College Junior,4,I feel comfortable and safe on campus. Campus Security is very responsive with its phone calls.
College Junior,4,People who are in Greek Life love it and people not in Greek Life still enjoy college just the same.
College Junior,4,"It definitely could be better and expanded, but provides the necessities."
College Junior,4,"Professors and students are helpful and friendly. Beautiful campus and located in a great, urban location."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms at Oglethorpe Unversity are great most. A lot of them are being modernized, and new dorms are being built. Social atmosphere at most of the dorms is alway lively, too. It was very easy getting the housing I wanted. So, I wouldn't worry too much about that aspect. There is no fee for housing options. All dorms are near and around the dining hall, library, gym, and classrooms. The cost of these dorms can get very expensive. Any listed price is what you will pay for each semester stay for the year. This is the only downside since prices range from $3,000 to $6,500."
College Freshman,4,"My college is very diverse, and filled with great people to be around. The classroom atmosphere is one of my favorite experiences. Everyone is active in discussions, and allow each other to contribute in some way. My college is also unique, because it is one of few liberal arts colleges here in Georgia. So, there are many interesting perspectives people come up with at my college. These are some of the main reasons why I wouldn't choose any other college to attend."
College Freshman,4,"It's great, but the wifi and the air conditioning is not the best."
College Freshman,4,They're very welcoming and caring to everyone.
College Freshman,4,I love how private yet functional they make the living environments.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are fantastic if you're genuinely interested in learning.
College Freshman,4,"I am biased because I am in a sorority, and I love it! The atmosphere is very friendly to me, but I don't know how it is for non-Greeks. It's a small campus, so Greek life here is not like it is at other campuses. There aren't as many events, and the Greeks are not as exclusive. You aren't missing out if you don't do it, but those who are involved enjoy it"
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a part of the socal life on campus. The fraternities/sororities are very helpful on campus and involved with most of the events that take place.
College Freshman,4,"My experience at Oglethorpe University so far has been just that,  an experience. The fact that my school is small has it's benefits because I get to know my professors better than I would on a larger campus. Also,  my professors are always willing to help me with any problems that may occur. I have been enjoying my time at school and would most definitely choose to attend Oglethorpe University again because the people here are very welcoming, helpful,  and understanding to you."
College Freshman,4,"All the teachers that I have had so far have tried to help me as much as possible. With the small class sizes offered (usually no more than 20 people in a class) it is easier to get one-on-one help and they offer tutoring in the academic success center, but I have not needed to go there yet. My first semester I took 17 credit hours and the work load was not too bad, until finals of course."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite topics were sociology and art.  I enjoyed the unique schedule that allowed me the flexibility to study, socialize, and work.  I would recommend more culturally diverse social activities and ongoing special events on campus.

I would choose the school again due to the quality of education, appropriate environment that allows me to focus on my studies, and the small like campus atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,There are only a few cases and Ou does a great job of addressing and providing support to victims as well as working to enact preventive measures on campus as well.
College Freshman,4,The academic success center and the ALAB works to help students obtain internships and jobs related to their future careers.
College Freshman,4,I love the housing at my school. My residence hall is right in the middle of classes and the cafeteria. The other residence halls are more of a walk but the buildings are absolutely beautiful.
College Freshman,4,"I love my school because of the location, the small class sizes, and professors who truly care about the students. It's small enough to be able to form right bonds with peers but also allows for me to have down time with myself when I want to relax. The academics are challenging and will prepare me well for law school, as the core program pushes students to think critically and analytically. The financial aid is also very generous."
College Senior,4,This campus is very diverse and it is so amazing to see how welcoming the student body is.
College Senior,4,It is a fun experience. There are a lot of great people that you meet while living on campus. There are also many activities to get involved in.
College Senior,4,The academics offered vary in such wide range. The academic advisors are very meticulous to tailor the degree path for each student.
College Senior,4,The alumni network is extremely knowledgable. They are always lending a helping hand.
College Senior,4,"The teachers are very understanding. Most importantly, they are helpful. No matter the circumstances, they go the extra mile for the students well being."
Senior,2,"The only good thing about it is the location and the beautiful campus itself. The professors are okay, a mix of wonderful individuals, and some professors who just seem not to care or prefer to be bias toward a certain race. The same goes for the individuals who attend the campus, it is a toxic society. The only way to escape it is to leave the campus and transfer. It is small so everyone knows you, and if you did something bad, you automatically become shunned. There are a few lovely people on the campus who make you feel welcome, but for the most part it is just a bunch of hypocrites who believe they are open minded when they are really not. The food is absolutely horrible, got sick multiple times, and friends got sick too. The cafeteria staff is not friendly at all, and some of them try to flirt with the students, many of my friends were uncomfortable. Dorms are old, except for Jobe and Bowden, but they are expensive. You will not get your money's worth coming here."
Sophomore,2,it’s an expensive school that doesn’t offer you the full college experience the class selection is limited. It is predominantly white professor who only believe in the old ways
Sophomore,2,"Transferring to this school was one of the worst decisions I've made. I was lied to about the extent of my credit transfers, and ended up having various credits I'd previously taken NOT count because Oglethorpe's CORE. For one credit that did count, they somehow magically decided that it didn't when I finished the class and now I have to take the class prerequisite. Upon getting here, staff was rarely kind about helping me around. Dorms are extremely average and priced high, yet there is a 3 year housing requirement. You'll spend about over 2,000 a month to live in these dorms. People are kind and I enjoyed the classes I took this semester, but I am looking to transfer from this school. CORE is big factor in the reason I currently don't know when I'll graduate and, on top of this, they silence students who have started movements to change it. I've never felt less cared about by my institution & I'm disappointed to have to write this. And the other reviews are right... hardly any food."
Senior,2,"If you come in as a freshman you will have 50k+ in student loans by the time you graduate. If you come in as a transfer student you will have to retake several general education requirements in the form of the CORE program. Statistics and Algebra DO NOT transfer to this school. The CORE program makes it very difficult to stay on track. You may stay longer than you want to because of scheduling difficulties. Do not trust the advisers decision making or advice. Go to the chair of your major's department for a second opinion. Several professors are condescending in their teaching style. My community college had professors that were just as good. You can sometimes take classes at other schools for your major requirements to save money. Oglethorpe is far too expensive ($12k a semester for me - after scholarships). The food plan is forced on you. It is part of the room & board ($7,500 alone). The food is bad. The two positives about this school are that it is small and the location is nice."
Freshman,2,"Oglethorpe is very good at using appearances and scholarship money to recruit students. Their COR program is a trap because your COR credits will transfer as electives at a bigger university. People are always spreading rumors like wildfire and it's really hard to know who you can trust because they all have their own personal agendas and don't mind letting you fall if it will benefit them. For anyone wanting to play on a women's athletic team, I'd be very careful about some of their coaches and ask the players to be brutally honest because reputations on Ogle's campus are pretty well known. Don't recommend the 3-2 program unless you are in-state. When transferring to one of those schools it's the equivalent of attending a community college, applying to an SEC school, and transferring those credits to the SEC school, and then having to apply for scholarships to attend the school. Campus food ISN'T WORTH the meal plan."
Junior,2,"Oglethorpe is not at all what they tell you at face value. I have spent time and time again almost every semester struggling to stay afloat in classes and to survive. Financial Aid is anything but helpful. Food access is laughable and does not exist for vegetarian/vegan and gluten-free folks. I have a couple friends with celiac and almost every dish is sprinkled with wheat flour. Vegetarian/Vegan options (me being vegetarian myself) have DECLINED in the past three years I have been here. Professors for the most part are very good, but they are the only worthwhile faculty. So much money that is meant to go to the bettering of students' and professors' is hidden from public knowledge and there are many shady interactions speculated to occur. I would never recommend this university to someone unless they have money spilling out of their pockets to not worry about."
College Freshman,2,"So, there have been a few incidents with Campus Safety in the past. There have been people who were sexually assaulted, and Campus Safety swept it under the rug. Also, there have been a few break-ins this year that easily could have been prevented, but Campus Safety only ever rides around in their little golf carts giving out tickets. There was an instance in Traer with a student who had a gun, and everyone saw the police show up, but Campus Safety did not communicate what the problem was to any of the students. We are not informed about incidents, which I do not like. The Campus Center does host events, like Green Dot Training, that help inform the students about what to do in an emergency, but it is not enough"
College Freshman,2,"Although this school is beautiful and the administration tries to make prospective students feel at home, the inner workings of Oglethorpe University ultimately fail. I thought I wanted a small school. I bought into the whole ""small community, big city"" sell, and I regret my decision. I read negative review after negative review about Oglethorpe, and I thought ""this doesn't apply to me; I will love it no matter what."" I was wrong about Oglethorpe University, and now I have to go through the painful process of transferring without receiving hardly any credit for the classes I have taken. In fact, there are a lot of people that are transferring after just one year here. It is probably because the nice professors and somewhat insightful classes do not make up for the overall dreadful experience of the campus. Nothing happens here. Even if you join every club, you will spend most of your time stuck in your dorm. If you don't have a car, good luck getting out of the Ogle-bubble. If you do have a car, good luck finding a parking spot. This campus is too small for the amount of residents. The food is also terrible. There is only one cafeteria, and it is not unusual to find dirty plates or cups, and the food is never cooked properly. Vegetarians and vegans have limited options. They serve practically the same thing every day, so it gets old fast. Even the pizza doesn't taste good. The dorms are alright, but there is mold, leaks, etc. The Wifi is nonexistent. Seriously, I had to increase my data plan for my phone because it would never connect to the Wifi, and it ate up all my data. Also, this school is ridiculously expensive. They hand out massive scholarships to encourage people to come, and you assume you will get the benefits of a $45,000+ school, but you just don't. Administration allows television shows to film on campus, even though it inconveniences students. All they care about is money, not the students."
College Freshman,2,"I've heard the parties are fun, but that's about it. There's so few sororities and fraternities, I forget Greek life actually exists here."
College Freshman,2,"It's a liberal arts college, so honestly if you didn't expect there to be heavy usage of pot, you were only fooling yourself. The administration acts like they'll do oh so much about drug and alcohol (underage) use, but almost every person on campus is smoking, drinking, getting Adderall, or a mixture of the three with hardly anyone ever being busted. When they do try to enforce the policy, they hilariously end up going after the students that don't partake in drugs or underage drinking."
College Freshman,2,"The campus safety is hardly ever doing their jobs, and hilariously as a result there was a break-in to a dorm by someone that managed to walk on campus last semester. There was also highly fueled talk of someone that had made violent threats against the freshmen dorm. As a white male, I feel safe on campus, but I couldn't say the same for anyone that was not. While it isn't crawling with crime, there are certainly quite a few rapes, break-ins, and threats that get neatly shoved under the rug by the administration."
College Junior,2,I don't eat at the cafeteria because the food usually sucks.
College Freshman,2,"everyone is expected to live on campus for the first 3 years, and unless you already have a place, the school wont offer any help finding off-campus housing"
College Freshman,2,Campus security is rather slow.
College Freshman,2,Athletics is not too important here.
College Junior,2,we don't actually have a health center on campus.  You must walk or drive to Smart Care next door and it takes ages for a doctor to call you back.  It's easy to commit a crime on campus and even if the crimes are reported it's not guaranteed that anything will be done about it
College Junior,2,There aren't very many options.  The university stopped doing late night a few years ago but they started back up at the end of the 2013-2014 year.  The only good thing is that we got a starbucks last year.
College Sophomore,2,"If you have a spot in Dempsey you dread moving your car. It is horrible finding a good spot, or sometimes a spot at all."
College Sophomore,2,I feel like there is not enough staff to actually help anyone in multiple places. They are not always available on call and take too long to respond to either drug or disruption of peace calls by students.
College Freshman,2,Fan support is pretty low.  Sports are not the focus of the school at all.  Lacrosse is really the only sport anyone gets excited about.
College Junior,2,"Athletics at Oglethorpe is pretty bad. Most people are not even aware of Homecoming because there is little emphasis on it. I attended the Homecoming dance ( not even properly dressed…again its not a big deal at my school) and there were all of 50 people in the ballroom. I had never seen anything like this before. It was such a lack of school spirit. At basketball games, some people show up. I would say roughly 50-100. This number is made up of mainly staff and faculty, but I try to show my support with some friends. There is no football team, and the baseball team has the worst average in the district. Its pretty funny. We have great facilities on campus however that are open the all students and staff members. New renovations have just taken place on school gym which is used fairly regularly. I wish there was more school emphasis on sports but I guess thats a downside of attending a liberal arts school."
College Sophomore,2,Oglethorpe is not very strict. They let most things slide and drug/alcohol enforcement is non-existent.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few guys/girls that top the charts, but the majority of the student body are average, artsy, ""Ogles""."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Security can be easily found on campus, but they don't really do much enforcing.  But when they do enforce things, they tend to bend the truth and change the actual happenings of the event."
Recent Alumnus,2,Oglethorpe's greek life isn't very diverse. It just recently added two African-American sororities.
College Freshman,2,It's been really cold lately so everyone likes staying inside. The walk to classes isn't great but once the weather gets really nice everyone hangs outside together.
College Freshman,2,"Unhealthy options, and very low amount of variety."
College Sophomore,2,"The safety officers can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted!"
College Freshman,2,"It has been said that this school is home to some weird people, and I do agree. Not much eye candy on campus (maybe due to the small size), but something may catch your eye now and again. Everyone usually dresses pretty comfortably. And although there are events on campus from time to time, Oglethorpe is far from a party school."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Options – The dining hall is located in the Emerson Student Center. The meal plan is over-priced to have such low quality. There is a few options when it comes to what to eat. There is a salad bar, do-it-yourself sandwich station, and the main entree of the day usually with fries or potatoes of some sort. You can drive or possibly walk to the plaza right next to campus with several restaurants, but most students just eat at the dining hall because they've already spent so much money on the meal plan."
College Sophomore,2,Student Center – Resources including the nurse and counseling are availabe. The student center is nothing special and old.
College Freshman,2,"Transportation at Oglethorpe University is best provided during excursions to off-campus activities, where buses from the university or outside organizations are available. However, if students are to travel independently from school assistance, the MARTA transportation system, which includes buses and trains, are recommended. The costs are bearable for small number of trips, but a heavy dependence on the system would require an expenditure of a few hundred dollars."
College Senior,2,"Apartments Are Expensive – Apartments are on the expensive side unless you have roommates, and you look for places further out from the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,No discounts and only a little variety. there isnt many fast food places either. it isnt convient to the campus either unless you have a vehicle
College Freshman,2,Strictness? What Strictness? I've had a teacher grab me a beer before and I'm underage.
College Freshman,2,"Frat Parties Are About It – There are clubs around town but I myself don't go to them. I usually go to frat parties instead, and that's when I do go to frat parties. I mostly hang around campus instead. The nighttime transportation is okay, but the Marta shuts down kind of early if you go out later than 1 a.m."
College Freshman,2,"Bike Was Stolen – The nurse is good at Oglethorpe, but my bike was stolen on campus, so that's what the safety is doing on the C-level."
College Freshman,2,"The Norovirus – The food comes with the dorm tuition. After hearing praise during the tour given, I was hopeful about the food amenities. It was a fallacy, the food service repeatedly serves dishes that no one wants, are tasteless, and often carry diseases. It has been three times now that there has been widespread norovirus pandemic."
College Freshman,2,"Interesting class, but it is important to read and understand material before you go to class."
College Freshman,2,Depending on where you live the parking is good/ bad.
Sophomore,1,Oglethorpe University does offer online classes for only certain courses I’m not quite sure what those courses are or how those classes are running online because I’m never taking an online class 1230 University online classes are over the summer classes are extremely expensive and more expensive than regular classes during the regular school year
Sophomore,1,"The transition to online classes because of Covid-19 was all around bad. The worst part was being kicked out of my living space and not refunded. Oglethorpe has an obsession with taking the money of students, but to see no return on any my tuition or fees for the semester was something else. Students had to petition just to get partial housing refunds during this time."
Freshman,1,"I hated it. School sucks and there is nothing to do in the area. They take pride on great academics, but they're no better than any other school. They make the school look so great from the outside, but truly is terrible when you get there. Food and housing are horrendous. Big scam!!"
Alum,1,"Horrible experience. Many professors have some weird agenda and will set students up for failure in order to keep you enrolled at the school longer. Career services is a bad joke. I was told by the office to consider scrubbing toilets because that's all I am qualified to do. Had a professor laugh at me after a car accident and I asked to make up the work. I could go on with stories like this. there are a few genuine decent people who work there but expect to graduate with a ton of debt and very poor career outcomes. I have friends who are still trying to reach that 42,000 average salary the school lies about."
Niche User,1,"DO NOT go to this school. They will lie to you during the admissions process. I was told that as a transfer student with an Associate's of Science degree that I would be transferred in as a Junior and that there is no need to worry about the CORE program.

Instead, the CORE program makes it difficult for my credits to transfer and cover the courses needed for my major. I have taken Algebra and Statistics at my previous college, but Oglethorpe is requiring that I take their MATH-314 course as well as BUS-275 (their version of statistics). It was a struggle to complete my math courses and now I have to do them all over again. It will be difficult to stay on track without course overloads and summer courses.

Oh, and Cecil Rose (the adviser for transfer students,) will probably give you the wrong advice. 

Their food is disgusting, and you are required to be on the meal plan ($2,285.00 a semester). 

The only thing good about this school is the location and the housing."
College Freshman,1,"I was so excited and enamored with Oglethorpe University at the very beginning after going on several tours and hearing so much about it from my parents. I am now, sadly, filling out an application for another college in another tab. This school is one of the biggest regrets and disappointments in my life. First off, the cafeteria looks as if you're going to be eating some of the best food ever, but when you enter it, there's only the hot food line (two meat choices and whatever else is rolled out), the grill (your quality of food changes based on the cook's mood and if they like you or not), stir fry, pizza, the single saddest salad bar I've ever encountered, and make-your-own-sandwiches. I have tried every line and each one, without fail, has made my stomach upset or just generally tasted bad. Now, this would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact I am now having to pay for all my own food to bring in and eat, BUT the meal plan is also MANDATORY if you live on campus. 

Secondly, there's not a lot to say for the actual students. The school is small, so you expect to have a degree of less privacy, but boy does Oglethorpe take that to a new level. You may think you're unnoticeable, but your dirty laundry and business is all over the school. Here at Oglethorpe, the walls have eyes and ears, so you will have a better time just never speaking to anyone. You will encounter people that have personalities based off of the groups they hang around the most and those that just really deep down are actually that hateful inside. It seems to be due to the high acceptance rates that there is a massive collection of people that honestly never left their angst ridden, middle school years in the past where they belong. 

It would all be worth it though if the curriculum was up to par. However, it is sadly no where near a worthwhile education. Not much can be said about this other than that I had more challenging classes in high school."
College Junior,1,There is no off campus housing selection at my school.
College Sophomore,1,"The hall itself is beautiful. Love the campus center. The food is pretty bad. Some days are worse than others. I love that we get $100 for Starbucks, but I would gladly give that up to be able to opt out of the meal plan. All students who live on campus (and you must live on campus for three years if you do not live within a certain radius of the school) must have an all inclusive meal plan. There is one cafeteria so there is not an option of where to eat. It is also all inclusive so there are no price options on what to pay. The workers, in my experience, are rude to the students, inappropriate, and unprofessional (again, this is not all workers just a few). I would much rather pay for a limited amount of meals per week or opt out completely then pay for the food here and pay for groceries that I buy when I can so I don't have to eat here."
College Junior,1,Campus safety does nothing. People have been doing drugs in the dorm and nothing has been done about it. There have been noise complaints and nothing is done. They'll let just about anyone on campus. etc.
College Sophomore,1,"The school does not provide transportation. They promised commuters a shuttle and we never got it. We have to either ride the marta (which cost money), walk (which takes a while if you walk, or catch a ride. Oglethorpe does not think about there students at all."
College Freshman,1,"The food here is awful. I don't know how many times one cafeteria can serve chicken marsala. The options are incredibly limited since there is no student center right now, and I've pretty much resorted to eating cereal and sandwiches everyday. Most of the food is very bland, and it's the same thing all the time. A lot of times, the workers will scoop out a tiny portion on your plate, and when you ask for more, they look at you like you're an alien. "
College Freshman,1,"The first month of school, there were huge trashcans placed right outside some of our rooms in Traer. These trashcans were overflowing with filth and attracted a very large amount of insects, including wasps and bees. Some of them even got into our room. It took several weeks of complaining before these trashcans were moved, but they are still in the courtyard of the dorms, and rarely emptied. The rooms are cleaned once a month, and it isn't uncommon to experience a number of odd smells throughout the dorm. In terms of safety, let's just say I never leave my door unlocked. The light outside my room was burnt out when I first moved in, and I am in a dark corner at the end of the hall. Kids have thrown beer bottles at each other, and recently, someone was taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. There is frequent shouting outside my room in the very early hours of the morning, and I never have any idea what the hell is going on. In short, my dorm is a garbage pit, and I rarely feel safe."
College Freshman,1,"This school is so stupid when it comes to what they are strict about. They  get people in trouble for smoking pot in the woods, which is completely idiotic because those people aren't bothering anyone and they are doing it far away from where everyone else is. Then people DON'T get in trouble for screaming at 3:00 in the morning, kicking soccer balls, against the walls, blasting music, and playing bongo drums (yes, playing bongo drums) while people are trying to sleep. A few weeks ago, people were throwing glass bottles at each other. I also know someone who got busted just for having a toaster in their room. Please tell me how any of this makes sense."
College Student,1,"A joke, I think there is a total of 2 campus security guards and they are usually asleep or on facebook. But there is a gate so i guess random people cant get in."
College Freshman,1,"Considering the high expenses, the value of residence life at Oglethorpe University is not a complete reflection of the student's costly investment. Freshman dormitories are in need of frequent proper maintenance and of stricter laws regarding drug and alcohol usage. The student residence life assistants, however, are executing their responsibilities properly to attend to student freshman concerns and welfare."
College Senior,1,"Punishments Are Not That Severe – You can get away with alot. And if you get caught, they just give you a slap on the wrist."
College Freshman,1,"Internet Is HORRIBLE! The computers still use, with the exception of the one in the 24-hour room, Windows XP. While this may be good for some, it is not for me. Also, the internet is horrendously unreliable. If you have an X-box, don't even think about using X-box live on campus, as playing with other people is nearly impossible and the graphics are very jumpy when playing online."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs, They Be Everywhere – It's ironic that the campus safety brags about its 'strict' enforcement when there are people smoking pot right outside of my room right now. For such a 'strict' campus, it is pretty 'wet.'"
College Senior,1,They try way too hard to be fancy. Most students live on cereal.
College Freshman,1,The strictness here on campus is not very good.  The campus safety team is not good about responding to student requests. Policies are not strictly enforced; they are only enforced when one of them is broken.

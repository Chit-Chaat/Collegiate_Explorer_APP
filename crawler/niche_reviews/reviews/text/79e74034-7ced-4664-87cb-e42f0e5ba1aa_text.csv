Freshman,5,"I really like Sullivan online college, they have been very helpful and thorough. I am new this year and so far it’s been a very pleasant experience."
Freshman,5,"My online college experience has been good so far, this is my first year at Sullivan University and I am doing online classes the teachers do a wonderful job with direction on how to do your work from an online platform.  Also you can reach the teachers almost on a day-to-day basis If you need any extra help with anything,  they are there for you through your experience. I find it very easy to access all the online platforms so far I’ve been getting all A’s. Thanks Sullivan"
Freshman,5,"This school focuses on expediting education, and solidifying your career while learning about it. It removes annoying gen-ed classes, and removes fluff in even majors."
Niche User,5,Sullivan is a wonderful school and I’m extremely excited to attend school there and furthering my pastry education. This school is going to help me see what I need to learn to own my own bakery and to learn new techniques in the kitchen. The chef shadow even was also something I truly enjoyed and hope that they do that again for other students to get the feel on how the school works and runs.
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus and campus life coupled with cutting edge technology ensure a beautiful experience both in and out of the classroom.
Niche User,5,What I like about Sullivan is the welcoming atmosphere and the class sizes were a plus. If I knew what I did then I would have went to Sullivan University.
Niche User,5,"It looks to have good classes,dormroom life, meals, and holiday time. Good teachers , classes, and out of school activities."
Freshman,5,I love Sullivan. They offer a jumpstart program before you start in the fall so you can start working on your degree before you get on campus
Sophomore,5,"I think that Sullivan University is a great school to help you discover what you want to do with the rest of your life. The courses have a good amount of diversity so that you can experience multiple aspects of your career path; for example, as a culinary student I get to experience baking, international food, and even food and beverage management. The only thing I would change is the parking policy, because no one wants to pay to park on campus."
Junior,5,"I am getting a great education at Sullivan. My teachers work in the legal field and know their stuff. The classes are rigorous, interesting and I feel like I am really getting a lot out of it."
Freshman,5,Over all experience is great. They have a good choice in degrees and staff is very personal. Nothing's needed as far as change.
Freshman,5,I love to be a student of the Sullivan University because I feel like profesors and staff really care about their student's education.
Niche User,5,It was an amazing experiance! everyone was so kind and easy to talk to. They care about their students and their education.
Freshman,5,What I like most about Sullivan University is the friendly staff and instructors who are knowledgeable and will do anything to help you succeed with your studies.
Sophomore,5,"The instructors make sure you have very thing you need to get through the semester they give out more help on the weekends they treat us like family and then, the Dean of students make his self known to you very time he sees you in the hall."
Junior,5,The online programs are consistsnt and thourough. The admin has been great and helpful. I'm so close to finishing!
Junior,5,I began my degree in 1991 here.  I took time off to have and raise a son.  I decided in 2016 to come back to school to finish my degree.  It was made so easy for me.  Re-enrolling and beginning my classes was not as scary as I thought it was going to be.  The staff here at Sullivan University strive every day to make it a great experience for each and every student that comes there.
Niche User,5,"Sullivan College Of Technology & Design is by far the best design school i had ever visit, the staff and teachers are so nice and educated the campus is beautiful the dorms are wonderful everything about the college is great for designers. i love the campus because it has small class and if you need extra help then you wouldn't have to wait forever to get that special help. the school and dorms are safely secured with cameras so students will always be safe. Sullivan College of Technology and Design is a private, for-profit post-secondary  school in Louisville, Kentucky that is owned by the Sullivan University System."
Freshman,5,They are very hands on. They try to help you as much as they can. They really try to help you with paying for school.
Freshman,5,"I love my school, I was terrified to try going back to school and to make it worse i was absolutely horrified to try going back online. They talked to me and told me all the ins and outs of going back to school online and about how it all worked and by the end of the conversation I had went from terrified and even horrified to a little nervous."
Niche User,5,I have had an excellent admission experience and look forward to attending the university in the fall
Junior,5,"I transferred from the University of Louisville to Sullivan University, simply because I didn't feel that UofL was a good fit for me, and I have not looked back since. I do not regret my decision to transfer schools at all! The class sizes are smaller which makes it easier to take direction and get help from the professors, the campus is also smaller so it's easier to get to and from where you have to be around campus and the food is great!!"
Freshman,5,Everyone that I have talked to so far has been very helpful. They have informed me of everything that was wrong in a timely fashion so I could fix it and get the most help possible. They have also sent me plenty of scholarship opportunities too give me the best chance possible.
Freshman,5,"So far I am really enjoying my college experience. Everyone is very nice, and quite intelligent. I am learning new things day by day, and they have been very cooperative as well as understanding with me in my attendance and my studies. I definitely would recommend this simply amazing college to anyone!"
Freshman,5,I love going to Spencerian. The faculty here are such great help. They will help you in any way they can to get you in the right direction..
Sophomore,5,Sullivan University has been the best decision I have ever made!  Great culinary program with awesome professional chef instructors.
Freshman,5,"I HAVENT STARTED YET, BUT I ALWAYS HERE ALOT OF GREAT THING ABOUT THE SCHOOL, WHICH PROMPTED ME INTO WANTING TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY. I KNOW ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY ATTEND AND WHO GRADUATED FROM THE SCHOOL AND THEY ALWAYS SAY EXCELLENT THINGS."
Junior,5,Sullivan is great University to progress in a career you would like to develop in or get into. The staff and professors are very adamant when it comes to giving you the tools you need to succeed.
Freshman,5,There teachers are amazing. And they help the best they can. Even there online is really great. There quick to respond when you need a question answered even.
Freshman,5,"The professors are excellent, they make sure you understand the material. Dorms are very up kept, the students that stay in the dorms are always friendly. The campus is a great size for someone who isn’t to fond of big crowds."
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience thus far. My student adviser has been awesome and has totally helped me with the whole process. She even told me how to get scholarships so that I wouldn't have all the expenses coming out of my pocket.
Freshman,5,It was a well balanced school with good teachers that actually get to know you. Everyone there seemed to be as excited to learn and willing to step out if their comfort zone. I am a cullinary student and I can't tell you how well worth it is to be in their program. You learn so much about food and other cultures.
Niche User,5,So far my experience with Sullivan University has been amazing. From day one the advisers were on top of everything and so eager to assist me in calming my fears in the process of transferring to them from another college.  As a adult going to school it can still be a fearful experience and very overwhelming at times so i am grateful that Sullivan has helped me so well through this process and will be forever grateful.
Freshman,5,"what i like about Sullivan University is the diversity and the kitchens for the culinary programs, there are some great chefs that teaches us the values of food"
Freshman,5,I'm in the application process right now but the staff tries to help as much as they can. The tuition is very high but not too expensive as other colleges are.
Freshman,5,I have been with them for a month and I love everything about them the people there are really nice and try to help you in any way they can. I would reconmmened this university to anyone.
Freshman,5,They have helped me get started in my first time entering college since graduating high school 32 years ago!
Freshman,5,"I have had a wonderful experience with the admissions process. I was impressed with the qualifications for enrollment. My admissions adviser is friendly and knowledgeable, and makes me feel like I am the only person he deals with."
Freshman,5,I am taking online clasess pursuing an Associate's degree in Health Information Management and so accessing the classes has been erally convenient and the academic advisors work hard to connect with to make sure you have everything you need to have successful quarters.
Sophomore,5,Great school. Advisors work hard to get students help. Sullivan offers many different degree programs. They have a great student Life department. The workers are friendly. Teachers are dedicated to helping the students get all information they need to succeed.
Freshman,5,I love this school I have searched all over and tried many different avenues and finally found a school tht was just for me as well as something I wanted to go for I am happy where I am at and I would recommend this school to anyone.
Freshman,5,They have been more than helpful & encouraging during the registration process. I'm very thankful to have found this school. I'm ready to start school in a few weeks.
Junior,5,"Overall I have had an excellent experience with Sullivan University, the staff is very helpful and attentive and the professors are down to earth and knowledgeable."
Freshman,5,"I have just recently gone to see the campus of Louisville, Sullivan University. This campus was very beautiful everyone was so welcoming and pleasant to be around. Sullivan actually paid for our room when we stayed for our vist. I couldn't be happier with Sullivan's dedication."
Niche User,5,"A very well organized and friendly environment. The staff is highly involved with their students, and do everything they can to help with whatever they need. They are easy to reach, and always contact back as soon as possible."
Freshman,5,"From my first meeting with my admissions officer I was sold. I toured the school and I quickly found out just how much help is thrown at you. The staff is amazing and class sizes are small. You know you are getting a good deal from talking with your admissions officers. There is always someone there to help and even the other students are respectful. The school itself is in amazing shape and there are many opportunities they can give for even after you graduate. There are job boards posted and numerous scholarships for the school too. They work with you with financial planning and will always give you a vast amount of options. I extremely recommend Sullivan University, you will be proud to say you went here once you graduate."
Freshman,5,"I have not started at Sullivan university yet, I start in June 2017. but as far I can tell so far its an amazing school. the staff is super helpful and the campus is super small and like a little community. I just love it."
College Senior,5,My experience at my college is very confident the professor's make sure that you know what you're learning and then help you Hands-On with getting things right
College Senior,5,I don't have much experience with online classes
College Senior,5,With my school they offer you to take an internship anywhere you want and if you put in hard work and effort and enjoy your job them they will offer you a full time position
College Senior,5,Outstanding because you can learn so much more
College Senior,5,It's the best because you can learn one on one with the professors
College Senior,5,The academic experience helps the students succeeded academically. The classes that the students are placed are what they have qualified for that would be best suited for them to succeed
College Senior,5,The school is great. The professors are involved with the students and try to help out in any way that they can to help them succeeded. The chefs at my school offer to help the students out one on one on Fridays it's also called plus Friday. Plus Friday helps the students improve on their skills in lab and not have to wait for the chef to make it over to them to see if they are doing everything correctly.
College Senior,5,Will help me find a job in my field
College Senior,5,I do not take online courses but I have heard from other students how great and easy they are to completing their career.
College Senior,5,"Someone looked at my degree from ECTC and told me which credits would transfer and I was already pursuing my bachelor's degree by the time I started at Sullivan University. The school is from 5:45 to 9:25 and the classes are one day a week, so students can have a job and family and still go to school."
College Senior,5,There is a lot of discussion boards in on-line classes. The system for on-line classes is different than on-campus classes. The teachers always respond on e-mails.
College Senior,5,I know that there are career services at the school.
College Senior,5,The quality of the courses is great. There is a lot of teamwork involved and I learn a lot each semester. The classes contain a lot of writing. The classes are small except for advanced writing.
Freshman,4,The university has many different other programs that are located across the street. The school officials are there to help you every step of the way. There is also transportation serves available
Freshman,4,The school is located right off the interstate and also has local food and shooing close by. There is also a tarp bus that can be taken to and from school.  The campus also has a campus bakery.
Junior,4,"Sullivan University is such an upstanding school, with staff and facility that are interested in the students success on and off campus. It’s amazing being apart of the Sullivan University family."
Sophomore,4,Love the small class sizes and the personal attention that you get. The professors are very responsive to emails as well. The downside is that you pay a little more than you would at a public university.
Niche User,4,Sullivan University definitely helped me conclude on what I really want to do with my life. The professors really know how to keep the student engaged and want to accomplish more with their studies. They really offer a lot of help to keep you up float on your grades and keep that fun college experience alive.
Freshman,4,Staff is very helpful. The school offers first year students many resources to be successful including frequent check in calls from the student success team and assigned advisers & mentors. Enrollment process is very easy.  The admission team takes extra steps to ensure they are in constant contact with new and prospective students.
Junior,4,Sullivan has been more than accomdating with my schedule and learning needs. Administration really do want you to graduate & do well.
Sophomore,4,Sullivan University is an amazing college. Very diverse and lots of people. Only thing I would like to see is better financial aid.
Junior,4,"Sullivan University offers small class sizes, professors who currently work have worked in the field of study, and the schedules are flexible."
Freshman,4,"The teachers in the academics so far are wonderful! and the chefs are outstanding and obviously know what they are doing and great at teaching the material. There is so much extra the school gives like free transportation and cafes at the dorms and on campus with great food! the only reason for 4 stars is because of the grading system. there is no way for the students to see their full grade online with the assignments and percentages to add up to a letter grade, it is kind of just guessing until the end of the quarter until final grades come out. i hear they were trying to come out with something to fix that for all students, but until then, 4 stars."
Freshman,4,"The class sizes are smaller. The building is brand new, and the labs are filled with a lot of practice simulations."
Freshman,4,"Though I am not to fond of sports, I find this school to be exactly what I needed and wanted. The area, and the campus are in great locations and provide a scene unique to this city. I have traveled around before I started school here, for 15 years, and I have found that no other place is like this.  To add on, I find the professors and academics are great! This also seems to be the school with the best food available, which makes the student life a bit easier, knowing that I can enjoy my food, and in such a safe environment."
Freshman,4,"I am just starting enrollment for Sullivan University, with that being said the process so far has been amazing. I originally wanted to go in to HR and changed it to IT, they did it immediately and was very happy to assist. I believe my experience with Sullivan will be wonderful, as of so far I have had  a great experience."
Niche User,4,It's an overall great experience. Great professors and support. Great library that has everything you need.
Sophomore,4,"Small private college, very active, centrally located & flexible with classes. Professors that I've encountered where great."
Freshman,4,"Sullivan University is welcoming and welling to answer your question about anything you have. They are always checking on how you are doing in your classes. Encouraging you ask question if you need help with anything,"
Freshman,4,I love it and it's a great learning center. Since I have been there the whole staff has made me feel wanted and accepted to be there. I was skeptical at first being a older student and out of school for 16yrs but I'm glad I'm here.
Sophomore,4,"Currently, I am studying Criminal Forensics/Computer Networking at SCTD going into my second year.  My overall experience at Sullivan College of Technology and Design has been a great learning experience.  The classes are small (no more than 6 to 10 students per class) which gives you more of a personal connections with the instructors and your peers.  I feel that having that 1:1 contact which makes the college experience for someone in their 40's or higher less stressful.  In regards to; any questions or clarification on certain subject matters'.  The instructor give you that ""Open Door"" atmosphere.  No question is a stupid question.  Because everyone there no matter what their learning curves are; can do anything they put their mind too.  The campus is small which makes it easier to get to your classes."
Senior,4,"As an online student it would be helpful to have more communication with staff.
I have had communication completely stop without finalizing details."
Sophomore,4,I really like how small the class sizes are and how the professors get to know you as a person. The only thing I would change is the disorganization of financial planning. But altogether it's a great school!
Freshman,4,"I love Sullivan university online classes! The professor's are great and love working with you! It tough cause I been out of school for a while, but  glad they don't mind helping you."
Sophomore,4,My favorite part about Sullivan University has to be how quickly you finish school. At times it gets a little stressful but the end of the quarter comes a lot faster than you think.
Freshman,4,People are very helpful with making sure that you get the best that you can get with the online programs.
Junior,4,This school is one of a kind. They have the best of almost everything. Amazing teachers that love their jobs. The classes are small enough to have one on one time with the teacher for help. Its all year school. no classes on Fridays unless you want to come in for extra help. the only problem i have is that they have a horrible financial office. Weather it be their problems or student problems and that is why I gave a 4 star.
Freshman,4,"My experience with this school is great, you can really learn about what you want to do in life. I would change nothing about the school because its perfect for me."
Junior,4,Sullivan has a well structured curriculum and is very supportive of faculty assisting students.  They offer a staffed tutoring center and regular office hours.  Adjunct professors are usually willing to accommodate students needing assistance outside of class hours.  Another fun point is that student services are very active with weekly student events.  
College Junior,4,Help you find a job even after a few years after graduating
College Junior,4,If you need help the teachers will be there to help and it's really easy to get into connection with a job you wanted
College Junior,4,i would suggest this school to anyone who is ready to jump start their careers.
College Senior,4,They really care about there students and there overall grade and for them to understand everything that they are teaching. They have a great environment.
College Senior,4,They were very helpful in the process of helping me work out my school schedule along with my work schedule. It has helped me tremendously with my busy life.
College Junior,4,"I PLAN ON FINISHING UP MY DEGREE, KEEP MY CURRENT JOB UNTIL I HAVE A JOB IN THE FIELD I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR!"
College Senior,4,"Since I work a full time schedule so online courses were best for me. They're easy to access, the curriculum is clear but sometimes certain links don't work at times. Transferring credits was fairly easy for the most part considering the other school cooperates promptly."
College Senior,4,"Workload can be a bit overwhelming with having to manage discussion posts and all. Registration process was a breeze.  Contacting professors are simple, usually receive a reply via email or ask instructor board. Only student interaction is discussion post which I feel like they could do without."
College Senior,4,There's actually a career day during the week where  students are encouraged to dress in business attire when attending class. The student team is pretty active and call to check up regularly. There's a lot of job openings and employment opportunities
College Senior,4,"I'm taking online classes so there's no physical interactions. The professors are prompt with emails and on the ""ask the instructor page"" Really good school for online classes. There's a variety of quality courses."
College Senior,4,I feel that a degree from Sullivan University will be of much value.
College Senior,4,It's ongoing but I'm please
College Senior,4,Great school very  nice campus. Online classes are pretty fast but enables you to get your degree faster. A bit expensive but great school nonetheless
College Senior,4,"ive never really had too many experiences with the career services , but the one time i did they were very helpful and determined to help me look for a job thats perfect for me ."
College Senior,4,"honestly ive never had a bad experience with any of my professors , they are very caring and understandable. they really love everything they do. the styles of the professor fits the work environment , they dress professionally everyday and not just on wednesdays."
College Senior,4,the overall prospects of the students careers at this school is great. Alumnis are very courageous the encourage us as students to finish and do great in school . the career services are very helpful when looking for a job which best suits my career.
College Senior,4,"My major is not the easiest but it also isn't the hardest. my program is all about management, customer service, and real life situations. It is career that will be in an office environment working with yourself or with others to reach a specific goal in a company or as a whole. there are a multiple of job opportunities for my major around the world"
College Senior,4,"So far I've had a awesome experience with my school including teachers and classmates. The teachers are very helpful and will do whatever it takes to help their students succeed, the classmates are very caring and not judgmental . I like how we work together as a team to get things done. If I could do it all over I would choose this school because I don't think any other school will treat me the way this school will."
College Senior,4,"Most all classes require a book but most don't require regular reading, just as a tool for learning topics in class. The workload can be considered quite a lot considering most includes planning & creating projects, which is very time consuming & it's likely that if you don't have Adobe creative cloud you'll have to spend extra time at school completing projects. If you love designing you'll love it."
College Senior,4,"There are many ways career services helps students after graduating to find jobs. Job postings, career fairs, etc."
College Senior,4,"I don't have much to compare this to, but they have career fairs plus job hosting on the website. There are many ways they help students start their careers after graduation."
College Senior,4,I've enjoyed my experience so far. The classes focus on topics of my interest & I've definitely learned a lot since starting. The school is pricey but nice. My main complaint is a lack of student amenities. The lounge & break rooms could be nicer.
College Senior,4,All online bacholor degree and its for 15 months
College Senior,4,Just as easy to use as blackboard is.
College Senior,4,"The teachers I had so far are great, they went above and beyond what I thought they would. THey have really helped me succeed"
College Freshman,4,The academic experience is pretty good I'm a geeky nerd that loves school and there has not been much frustrations from going to this school so far.
College Freshman,4,It's great could be better but it is definitely the best in this area. You can get careers with many tech business in the field and we also get externships to help push us into the real world.
College Freshman,4,"It's great sometimes can be tedious but that workload for the most part is easy to keep up with, there are many job opportunities for jobs and internships. You just have to be outgoing and apply."
College Freshman,4,Its fun most teachers make the classes really enjoyable while there are a few that are text book teachers that make the class boring for the most part its a great school!
College Junior,4,Everyone is fairly nice and it provides good social communication between all classes.
College Junior,4,The career is very in demand at the moment
College Junior,4,The school focuses on the majors rather than Gen Ed courses.
College Sophomore,4,am new to the University but the experience has been great
College Sophomore,4,"I am not from the area, but, allot of alumni do visit often"
Freshman,2,As a Trans student this was the worst college I’ve ever been to. Confusing and embarrassing staff along with Chefs who only teach by winging everything.
Niche User,2,"I give this only because the one class I was able to attend the instructor was good. The back office is horrible. The first class I attended was canceled and i was never told until I showed for Orientation then they wanted me to attend an online class that was not what I was going for. That was a disaster, The book was an ITT Tech book and did not match the curriculum of the class, The Labs did not match the curriculum the instructor never got back to me until after I withdrew form the class, and my one lone class mate never responded to me. And now after 3 years they want that tuition in full. I found Western Governors University to be a better school that cares more about your education than the money you pay."
Freshman,2,"The social environment isn't good at all for a traditional student. If you are seeking a second degree, and/or you have been out of school for a long while, this may possibly be a good school. I feel as if I should be in a more stable environment instead of here, since there are so many random changes that are extremely difficult to keep up with."
College Junior,2,The computers are really slow
College Junior,2,When I  went into my financial aid office they were rude and I believe it was due to my age and lack on knowledge.
College Sophomore,2,I'm having trouble right now with the financial aid  they have changed employee's and now they don't have all my information correct and I'm having to do things all over again and they sending bill that are due to finish school Im hoping to get this fixed with in the next couple of days
College Senior,2,poor communication from the professors and learn less than you would in a traditional classroom
College Senior,2,I haven't received much information on learning things online as I would have in the classroom maybe they could make it to where the teachers do a broadcast on what all is expected and give better information on what they are looking for in an answer to a specific topic
College Senior,2,the cost of the school is far too high for what you receive
Recent Alumnus,2,Computer labs make up like every other room on the campus.  Printing is free which is great.  Network reliabiity is not the best with speed and wireless access points. The IT department has really dropped the ball.
College Junior,2,"This school is extremely expensive. Because it is a private school, it is hard to get internal scholarships. The people in the financial aid office try to be helpful, but are not always."
College Junior,2,"They have changed the policies for online classes. Now, you have to go into a classroom to do some of your work. Attendance is taken and you cannot miss more than eight days even if you get all of the work done before the quarter is over."
College Junior,2,students do not do a lot of things togeather
College Junior,2,The financial aid department messed up my financial aid so that I am stuck paying out of pocket almost 1500.
College Junior,2,"I have had a hard time getting the classes I need because not all classes are offered each quarter. Also, i wanted to take classroom classes but can't due to the poor availability and am stuck doing all online classes."
College Junior,2,It is very expensive. There are always money problems for students. People are often notified because financial issues that does not make sense.
College Junior,2,They hired a new registirar and it changed my financial aid to where every quarter I have to talk to them about my money for books
College Junior,2,I was left with a big overhead that I had to take out a loan for. Because of my parents financial situation I have to work to pay it off. I was promised a much larger scholarship by the school at the beginning of my financial aid review and they fell through on it. Now I have to pay a lot more money than what I was promised.
College Junior,2,"The school is primarily focused on one thing, cooking."
College Senior,2,"Although not having to go on campus to take a class, I've found that going to class is more beneficial.  My past experiences with online courses have not gone well.  Online courses are targeted for the busy professionals but the work load that is given is more than if you went on campus. Plus you lose that attention and the opportunity to talk to the instructor or see examples to apply the topic."
Freshman,1,"I never took classes online, they never gave me the option to take online classes because most is hands on"
Freshman,1,"Professors were of no help as well as student advisors. My financial aid, what little I got barely covered anything. I wish I would have done more research on schools and chose a different school with a more professional setting and people who are willing to go above and beyond to help it student body."
Graduate Student,1,"Sullivan University is a For Profit institution and it definitely shows. While some of the instructors were good, others have no idea what they are doing."
Sophomore,1,The online program is HORRIBLE. It is an expensive correspondence course in which the instructors have no contact with the students. You have to email them or call the front desk of the school to ask questions and IF they get back with you they do not answer the questions. I was taught by youtube videos and reading books and forums. If any of you want to be thousands of dollars in debt and watch youtube videos I am starting an online class too.
Alum,1,"Waste of time and money!

       An initial error on my administration officer's part of enrolling me in the wrong program(AA HVACR) which btw is ill advised should've warned me, but I was naive and believed college was to help.
        After graduating the HVACR certificate program with a 3.8 GPA I've been refused my transcripts and certificate.  They want me to pay $5,000 directly to the school for ""sitting in class"" on top of all my student loans ($23,000). 
        They've refused to help in the employment process and have in fact made me out as a horrible candidate to numerous employers. 

DO NOT ENROLL IN SULLIVAN COLLEGE!!!

-Kevin Bruce"
Works Here,1,Not the school the Chancellor built!  Administration gets rid of good instructors and retains those no one can understand or learn from. The I Care logo should be changed to I used to care!
Junior,1,Left had doesn't know what the right hand is doing. This is NOT a school that accommodates working adults.
Junior,1,The incompetency in the financial aid office is unreal. I had to leave work early to sign the award letter NINE times. The last time I went in there the joke was made that maybe it wouldn't take 9 attempts at the next renewal date....a joke I did not find funny. After the 9th time when the financial aid office managed to get the award letter right I then had to return to tell the financial aid office that they forgot to remove the hold from account which prevented me from scheduling classes. By the time that the hold was removed from my account I was placed into a forced schedule that did not accommodate my parenting schedule. A forced schedule that enrollment services will not let me change
College Senior,1,it does not do anything or stand for anything. This question is is N/A for my school
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are absolutely no athletic center or student center.  The library is very small but has some good books.  There are no real campus activities, especially none for night students.  Campus aesthetics leaves much to be desired.  There is only one building and it is really geared towards Culinary Arts."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is absolutely no social scene or campus life at this campus.  The Lexington campus is one building and has no real student activities or greek life.  There is no real help for students who aer struggling financially.
College Junior,1,the registration process is very stressful
College Junior,1,"the financial aid office is very rude and they will tell you that they can't find some of your grants and that you will have to start making monthly payments, they never have time for the students and they switch advisors too often"
College Junior,1,They are very flexible with everything
College Senior,1,"Although I am a older woman attending college, when I decided to go to school I still did not understand the process of the cost of college or wise financial planning.  I have ran out of financing due to the lack of information from my financial advisor.  Every few months I would sign a financial planning form turn it in and then schedule my next set of classes.  Little did I know there were times when I did not carry 12 hours due to taking fewer classes or one of my classes were half credit classes  (because they only lasted half the quarter) and I was not given grants/scholarships I was entitled to because I was not considered full time to the government.  I did not realize that I was using just loans and because of that I am at my cap with student loans and my federal grants/scholarships do not cover my full tuition.  If when I had scheduled my classes my financial planner would have explained this to me I would have made better choices with my scheduling and loan borrowing."
College Junior,1,"Sullivan University has a new attendance policy for online students. Even if a student has completed all of his/her assignments for the week they can be counted absent if you do not somehow sign in. It is also not clear what is expected of the student in order to be counted present.This is very inconvenient considering most students taking classes online are doing so because of their hectic schedules. Once a student receives three absences in a row, they are dropped from the class apparently whether they have completed all of their assignments or not. I personally do not recommend attending this college online. The staff is exceptionally nice until classes begin. If you have any problems after that you are out of luck. It really does seem as if this school is more concerned with getting your money than anything else."
College Senior,1,The professors can be hard to reach. They sometimes don't explain what they want from you very well. One online course I took I didn't know my grades on any assignments. I had to look up my overall grade for the course after the quarter ended. I like being on campus much better.
College Junior,1,"I am only 2 quarters away from graduating but just found out that financial aid officers flat out LIED to me when I started and told me that I would have enough funds to obtain my degree.  Now they are telling me that not only have I reached the life time limits of the loans and pell grants, but that I need an additional 12k plus book costs to continue.  I have worked really hard to get my degree and have a 3.5 GPA but that doesn't matter to them since they have already sucked my funding dry with their high tuition and book fees.  So basically at this point, I am deep in debt with the government for student loans and will not have a degree to show for it.  As far as the classes, I have had mostly good experiences with the instructors and the online learning experience is better than I expected.  I would suggest this school to people for the academics but make sure YOU know what funds you have and don't leave it up to the yahoos in financial aid to make sure you have enough money to even complete your degree.  They will tell you do when you don't just to get what ever money they can out of you and then when you come to them and ask them what can be done so you are not totally screwed and they reply ""well you are going to have to get a private loan or get it from a family member"".  Thanks for the compassion you lying bunch of crooks."
College Freshman,1,"They are constantly having issues with their computers, every single time the students needed to print something the teacher would have to call tech support to help connect our computers back to the printer because it wouldn't show up on our devices list, and even then it had problems connecting. This was a daily thing, almost as if it reset every time you would print."
College Freshman,1,"I didn't have a good start because of many things happening in my life, however I never give up and I am working on bringing up my GPA. I don't have any problems with the work as I enjoy the Hospitality classes, but it is a challenge juggling work and school. But as I said before I don't give up!"

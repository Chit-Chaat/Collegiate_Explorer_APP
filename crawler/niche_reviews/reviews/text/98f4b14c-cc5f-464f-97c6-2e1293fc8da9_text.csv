Alum,5,It was a great experience. Met my lifelong friends there. Every homecoming is like a family reunion.
Freshman,5,The campus is very beautiful and there's a lot to do on campus. I've met so many amazing people and friends that'll last a lifetime. The professors there and understanding and helpful. They will help anyone who is willing to put time and effort into what a person needs help within that field of study. Living in the dorms was so fun and had many late-night adventures that I will never forget.
Freshman,5,The professors at the university were very understanding and flexible when it came to schedules. They gave extra time on assignments and allowed to fix homework assignments. The professors gave very clear lectures and directions on what they wanted us to do for assignments.
Freshman,5,They told me exactly what I needed and made it easier for me. They also keep in contact with you throughout the student email. One thing I wish they would change is making the website easier to understand.

Freshman,5,The academic support is awesome! They make sure that you are on point in all of your classes before going out to party. Having someone that keeps you on top of your game in college is brilliant!
Freshman,5,The school tour is great! The administration is on it when it comes to grades and partying. If your grades aren't up to par you go on academic probation and will not be able to attend any of the events on campus.

Junior,5,"I had to take online course due to the COVID-19 pandemic. My school handled online teaching very well. For our class lectures, we utilize the zoom feature and had class at the normal time we would in person. For the test and quizzes, there was a secure lockdown browser. The Norfolk State professors were very patient and understanding when it came to different student's learning styles. It was a great experience through this rough time!"
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful and just the perfect size for me. The classroom sizes are small and the professors really do care about you. The community is very tight-knit and the faculty is great.
Freshman,5,"Love the environment and the people 
All though I feel like there should be more activity and parties on campus because the parties off campus always get shut down or the police shut down the little event we have on campus.
They have really good professors.
They provide a lot of help for the people that need it, such as tutors.
The advisors are always there when you need them. For example, rescheduling classes, just to talk about your mental health.
The people at Norfolk State University makes sure everyone is treated equally, and that your comfortable with your environment. Also everyone is treated like family.
The food here is great!!! But I wish they had more food places."
Niche User,5,"one of my family members goes there and she said the experience is amazing so I decided to apply and hopefully, my college years are great also."
Alum,5,Norfolk State offers an excellent educational experience. The professors there see potential in students on an individual basis and are personally invested in fostering their skills and talent.
Sophomore,5,Norfolk State is an excellent institution. My experience so far has been great. The campus is beautiful and the university is always expanding. The class sizes are conducive for small group learning.
Freshman,5,"I major in Drama/Theatre. What I like about Norfolk State University, for one I'm in great hands when it comes to drama/theatre program. A lot to do on campus I would say. When it comes to housing, we actually have it good compared to other HBCUs. One of these I would change is food choices, more food selections on campus. Like asian food not just fast food."
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity and the fact that the campus isn’t too big of a school makes it more convenient for me to get to my classes on time.
Freshman,5,I honestly love my school. I immediately feel in love with my school the day i started class . The theatre program has helped me in ways you can’t even imagine. It has helped me in my private life and also in furthering my career in acting

Sophomore,5,I really enjoy Norfolk State and I am learning a variety of new information. Norfolk State is preparing you for the future. I am an elementary education major and plan to further my education.
Senior,5,"What I love about my university is the multitude of activities that the school offers for students to be active, involved, and make connections while still being focused on academics. For instance, at the end of each semester usually the Friday before the week of finals, NSU provides an academic event called the ""pre-exam breakfast"". This event provides students the opportunity to be social while still preparing for the finals ahead. At the event, you can eat breakfast for dinner, meet with other people in the same major for group study circles, find mentors and tutors for specific subjects, and then have some fun at either the dj booth or unwind and laugh during the comedy show. Its a great time to loosen up just a little before the hard week of finals all while still preparing for your academic success."
Senior,5,Its my dream college I wanna go there Norfolk has my major and it’s beautiful and good learning good vibes and good it’s good hbcu I think everyone should go to  Norfolk.

Graduate Student,5,"What I like about Norfolk State University is that I have watched it grow over the years.  I entered the university in 2013 and Graduated in 2018 and currently going back for my masters degree in Media Production.  I have made so many connections far as meeting new friends, working with media teams, working for Financial Aid for 3 years and having a few internships while attending.  I had the best experience in college and loved it so much I decided to go back, this university has definitely been well to me and would recommend others to apply to Norfolk State University.  College is what you make it, stay involved and network thats how you build life long relationships and you'll never know who you may need in the future."
Senior,5,"Great university.  The staff and resources are amazing.  The students have so many opportunities.  It's a judge free zone, I was very glad to see that I was not alone being a older adult attending college.  I look forward being able to experience everything NSU has to offer.  I'm very proud to be a Spartan.  Be Hold The Green And Gold."
Freshman,5,"I love the family environment that NSU creates for it's students.

Sophomore,5,"Very student/staff oriented! there’s so much support received within this school, it’s a HBCU community with lots of fun and supportive professors!"
Freshman,5,Norfolk State University was the greatest thing i ever saw the first time i walked on campus. The historical buildings that once held great leaders and other important people are still in great shape. I honestly never thought i would be here.

The best resources for you to become successful.
Have a study abroad program that is beyond amazing.
Wide verity of people you will meet."

Sophomore,5,"I enjoy Norfolk State University, I'm goin going on my second year this August and I couldn't be more excited. The people are very friendly and enjoy engaging, the activities are always fun and the student life is good for any new comer. The games and spirit weeks are mostly my favorite thing about the school because you get to meet a lot of people and network. Only thing is the out of state cost is crazy high, mainly for the dorm and boarding. For what I am paying I would expect more. Also, the staffing needs a little more work on their customer service. Otherwise I absolutely enjoy bring a spartan!"
Sophomore,5,Norfolk State University is an amazing school. Everyone comes together and help one another and we are a big family.
Junior,5,It's a awesome HBCU! I loving every bit of it! You have a lots things to do with a lot of people to meet. The consolers care! From day one I felt at home! I felt safe with everywhere I go! All the faculty I met and am still meeting feels like family!
Freshman,5,"My experience has been nothing but good. Diversity at its finest, excluding race, their mind sets, family, and backgrounds challenge them to be different. Great school, the professor really care about the students well being. Students are involved with the community. Campus is beautiful. The campus also is centrally located around the Hampton roads area. Many places to shop, eat, night life and light rail."
Sophomore,5,"Growing up, I've always been quiet and to myself but when I got to college that all changed. I joined a chess club, book club and along the way I met some really amazing people. Most of the Staff there are pretty easy to talk to, and willing to help if a problem arises."
Sophomore,5,"I love how Norfolk State University has a family feel all throughout the campus. Through professors, advisors, housing and residency, and your peers."
Niche User,5,"I like everything.                                                                                                                                                
                                   I like the many undergraduate programs.
                                                                                                                       I like the diversity.
I like the academics.
                                          I like the sports here
                                                                                     And much more!!!!"
Sophomore,5,"The things that I like about Norfolk State University is the commitment of the professors, the dedication of the advisors, and the sense of family that the campus life offers. There is nothing I would like to see change about my campus."
Junior,5,It is my second year going back to Norfolk State as a recent transfer students. There are a lot of people at Norfolk State and that's what makes it a great place to communicate with other people. The campus is not as huge as many other university so you get to your destination quickly. I wouldn't change anything about it because it's great how it is.
Niche User,5,"I haven't even started going there yet! I'm going to start this year, as I was just accepted, but I've heard from my sister who goes there that it's amazing. I've heard good things about her professors, her classes, the food amenities, and even the housing."
Sophomore,5,It has such a friendly environment. Once you start going to the school and attend all the fun events you won't want to leave.
Freshman,5,"I love Norfolk State. The environment, the people, the campus, everything is gorgeous. The faculty and staff on campus are the sweetest people you would ever get to know. The academics are top notch and the work load is just right. For my first year in college I love it so much."
Freshman,5,"Great school, I love the family feeling you get when you step foot on the campus. The students here a great, teachers are very helpfully and will make time to help you when you need it. The campus food is okay at the cafe but they have added two new restaurants to meal plan and they are great. The campus vibe is good. The greek life is good and the school spirt is also very good. We are 100% behind our school sport teams."
Sophomore,5,"Norfolk State University is amongst the underdogs of the HBCU's. It's a University you would think twice about going to, but it is generally because someone told you about our Unversity when nine times out of ten they've never attended our University. We are growing substantially, and the unity you will receive from here is beyond me. My University is my home. The academics will stick with you forever, and the networking and relationships you receive will last forever. The professors care as long as you do."
Freshman,5,"I love this school for many reasons. The campus is small so it is way more comfortable to live at and have a nice campus experience. It is a good way to have a social life with other peers. The professors are very hands on and make sure that we know the material. Every one here roots for successful graduates, I will never regret coming here."
Freshman,5,For starters theres nothing that should be changed. But what I like about NSU is they have great Professors and The safety at this College is astounding!
Freshman,5,My experience at NSU you has been a bless full one. I get along with all the students and professors. The classes are very professional and organized. The cafe and the restaurants are very clean and the food is beautiful prepared. I am on the baseball team and I'm very blessed to be able to play for Norfolk State University. The dorms are very nice and clean. I recommend kids from my home town to study here.
Freshman,5,Norfolk state is a great school. I love how they have lot of school spirit. They have a great football team and basketball team. the people on campus are very helpful when needed. the food is ok but you got to get used to eating the food because its not food you will get at home.
Junior,5,I love my NSU!! I’m a Hampton roads native and wanted to go to college out of state. But due to my father getting sick i decided to stay in the area. It’s two local HBCU’S and HU was to expensive for me so i went to NSU. And it was the best decision i ever made. BEHOLD 💚💛🔰
Alum,5,"Excellent experience. Financial aid process was an odyssey, but what college isn't? I loved marching in the ""Spartan Legion"", which only heightened the positive experience I had as a student at Norfolk State. I encourage every prospective student to take a serious look at the possibilities of visiting Sparta and becoming a member of Norfolk State University!"
Alum,5,I went to NSU and my experience was excellent.  I was a mass communications major and the only problem i had was geeting use to 8am classes. Campus life was and adjustment but that should be expected at all schools. I would recommend NSU to any prospective student. #Beholdthegreenandgold
Sophomore,5,"I’ve had a great experience thus far! On campus Community is friendly, warm, and welcoming. We’re all a big family! Each department (no matter the major) is dedicated to your success! Financial aid, registrar, student accounts etc. need to be improved badly ! The cafe continuously lets us down but they are showing more effort. But overall the illustrious Norfolk State University is AWESOME. Check out the spartan legion !!!!"
Freshman,5,Great experience meeting new people who know lots about networking and give amazing advice. Lots of events to get people out of their comfort zone as well. Wouldn’t change a thing.
Graduate Student,5,The professors are dedicated and willing to help you. There is a student center on campus where students can receive extra help when needed.
Freshman,5,"Norfolk has a very nice campus and community. This school has good academics. The people here are nice and very welcoming. The college life is fun and They SEE THE FUTURE IN us. They say the builder and the healer, the artist and the activist, the scientist and the entrepreneur. They see your greatest potential and your motivation to achieve. At Norfolk State University, your future starts here. They  have high expectations for us and we help you achieve them."
Alum,5,"I had the BEST 4 years of my life at NSU! I made life long friends and learned valuable lessons along the way. Returning back during homecoming makes me feel like a freshman all over again. I am glad to see all of
the improvements the school has made!  I couldn’t have seen myself at any other school.  I would HIGHLY recommend any motivated young BLACK and GIFTED individual to attend. You get to see black people from ALL walks of life and it’s truly NSU that sticks us together."
Junior,5,Norfolk State University was AMAZING! The professors want to see all of their student succeed. The Students help one another and the faculty and staff os amazing. You feel right at home.
Alum,5,"Great experience at Norfolk State University. Big campus, good food choices, big library, nice gym. Would recommend anyone to attend"
Junior,5,"Norfolk State University has molded me into becoming the women I am today. There are many organizations that welcomes you into their community and help with your studies. Being a student at NSU has made my life, by far, the greatest. I'm able to learn and have a supporting community behind me helping push forward."
Junior,5,"Norfolk is also the school my mom attended, which I didn’t know at the time of my colleg research. My goal was to go away but not too far from family. After attending, although the initial entry process was difficult NSU became the school for me. All things educational, social and development have been great."
Senior,5,"It is a pleasant college               Help with a  good education 
Everybody loves the college it has many  diversity   And good"
Junior,4,I really love my school. I love how we really are a big family here and how everyone here wants to see your success. Something I would like to see change is more food options on campus. We only have Chick-Fil-A and Tropical Smoothie and that can get tiring if you eat it everyday so I would like to see them expand their food options.
Senior,4,"The first time I walked on campus, I absolutely felt a family vibe from being here. I wouldn't change my decision of going here for anything."
Sophomore,4,What I like about the school is that they have good college experience when I first walk into the school. They also have nice places to be in which is the dorms and having good buildings and stuff that people will enjoy.
Sophomore,4,They have good online experience which they will find a way to have online classes for the students to join and teach them. But me I don't like doing online classes which its a problem for me which I want to do in person class so that I won't have any trouble focusing on work.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes dont depend on the school. Online classes require consistency and responsibility all together, so be careful with then in general."
Senior,4,"I've enjoyed my experience and time being at Norfolk State University, I am about to enter my senior year and already 3 years flew past and I have a lot of great memories at this wonderful school."
Sophomore,4,"The transfer server worked very hard to get my documents entered into the stern the last day. Anytime I have a question, sometime is there to help"
Sophomore,4,This school has various programs and opportunities for students who want to further their education.
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Norfolk State University was definitely  something to remember. My classes taught me a lot and easy to comprehend. If I ever needed help, my teachers or tutors were there to help. I really enjoyed meeting different people here and how we all connected in similar ways. If I were to change something it would be the food options and more on campus events."
Sophomore,4,Norfolk State University has been a wonderful option for me as an out of state student. There are opportunities for your major in and out of the classroom and wonderful campus life.
Sophomore,4,"I am a student returning after five years and the changes they've made are quite impressive. There are several new buildings, improved security measures and wonderful educators. I have been most impressed by the improved customer service of several departments, specifically financial aid. Years ago, there were terribly long wait times in person and on the phone. This time around, I have received prompt, same-day responses to assist me or point me in the right direction."
Junior,4,"Majority of the faculty is amazing.  Most of the staff love to see you doing good if not great.  Many of the professors are hands on and help encourage students to strive for better.  Many students struggle financially, I do feel as though they can be stronger in that area of helping being that they probably know more resources and are familiar with the issues."
Sophomore,4,NSU is a great campus/school you are able to interact with other students and even some faculty. I would like to see more food choices on or around campus.
Freshman,4,"Norfolk State tries their best to make incoming students feel safe, comfortable and welcome. There are a lot of organizations to join and lots of resources that students can use if they need help."
Sophomore,4,"Of course, it's not perfect, but it does well. It creates a safe space for all people of any age and race. I love it!"
Freshman,4,"Norfolk State was not my first choice. I wanted to go to New York and go to a performing arts school but, it was too expensive. So, I resort back to my list of other schools I had been accepted to, and I decided Norfolk State because it wasn't too far from home. In addition to that, I heard that it had a great theater program."
Niche User,4,I like that you all this place home and it feels right. You can see a lot of people that look like you around campus.
Senior,4,"What I love about the university is the performing arts program. The theatre program , choral activities , and band activities are outstanding. It was the main attraction to my enrollment at Norfolk State University. I am currently a music media major completing my senior year 2019-2020 this year and I am more than excited to start my last and final journey here."
Senior,4,"More parking spaces. Emailing announcements about scholarship opportunities. Updated commodities for older residences. A bigger gym is a must, there are too many students with few equipment."
Junior,4,"My experience has it's ups and downs but overall the university is great. I made great friends, made new experiences and lived in a great environment by being here."
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first year at Norfolk state university.  Although the campus is small and the buildings are older, the price is very appealing.   I am happy with my overall experience and am looking forward to starting my Sophmore year in a few weeks."
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience was very good. I say this because the school atmosphere was very home style and welcoming. Everyone from staff to students made me feel like I was at home and welcomed me with open arms as if I was family. The institution itself gave us students the opportunity to express ourselves which gave us as well as many other students the free will to be who they really are without being judge and ridiculed. So overall my experience was pretty good, only thing I would want to see done differently is communication skills between the head departments, just would like to receive information from them prior to events."
Freshman,4,"I love my HBCU! Not only do they prepare you for what's coming after you get your degree, they also stand firm on uplifting and supporting african americans which is exactly why i chose NSU."
Sophomore,4,"Very good school with great, committed teachers who truly care about the betterment of their students' educations."
Sophomore,4,"The courses are challenging, but also the quality of living could be improved.
Also, the use of laundry should be included in the tuition that students pay."
Sophomore,4,"I like it. It has a great atmosphere with a diverse crowd of students and professors alike. It gives off the vibe of a family and safe place to be. I enjoy the time I spend there. The school is great and school spirit and pride is shown in each and every student, teacher, and faculty."
Sophomore,4,The administration is very pleasant and the Army ROTC program there is really progressive and creates a family environment and positive training environment for those interested in the military.
Sophomore,4,Norfolk state is a very family oriented school. You meet so many people and learn so much about yourself and the culture .
Sophomore,4,"I do love my university and the opportunities it brings to its students, though I do feel as though the Financial Aid should be more considerate to its students and the situations that they have at hand."
Freshman,4,"My first semester of college at Norfolk State University I was sexually assaulted and bullied by girls in my dormitory and these experiences definitely played a huge role in my performance academically. However my second semester at Norfolk State University I met some genuine people and formed very strong friendships. I completely turned my freshman year around as well as my grades. I went from a 1.9 GPA, the lowest grades I have ever received, to a 3.6 GPA, the highest grades I've ever received. All in all my freshman year at Norfolk State University was a great learning experience and I cannot wait to continue the next 3 years there."
Sophomore,4,"Norfolk State University is a school of opportunity and I’m appreciative that they gave me a chance to further my education. My experiences here have been good so far, I value the amount of work that the admission, finical aid workers do. They get everything done on time and have the answers you need. Something I enjoy is student life throughout campus. There is a plethora of clubs and organization’s on campus to help you network and to get you out of you comfort zone. We are one big family that likes to enjoy our surroundings. Studies and grades come before fun which the campus enforces a lot. They like make sure that we are mentally, physically, emotionally prepared during exams. Norfolk state is a great school academically and it’s also one of the reasons I chose to attend. I am Pre- Nursing student and their program is one of the tops in the Virginia commonwealth area. I wish for excellence once I get into the program due to it being competitive and time consuming."
Junior,4,Norfolk State is a great school. I enjoy all my classes and professors. There lots of things to do and it is never a dull moment there.
Freshman,4,"My experience thus far attending Norfolk State University, it Is bittersweet. I have my days where it can be bad but I always look for a great outcome."
Junior,4,I love Norfolk State! Great school and environment! I think the only problem is the size of the campus but it’s constantly growing so I cannot complain much
Freshman,4,Norfolk State so far has been an amazing thrill ride. The professors enjoy teaching their students and are very good of demonstrating extra help outside of class. Norfolk has a lot of caring people that lives with a mindset “we are all a family.”
Sophomore,4,I like NSU because of the feeling of family that I feel there. We have so many resources that can help us set up our foundation for our future.
Sophomore,4,Norfolk State makes you feel like your apart of something. No matter what it is. We are a big family that got each other’s back!
Alum,4,Had a great experience here. Staff mostly treated you like family and would help you  in times of need.
Junior,4,"Norfolk State is very homey and the people are friendly. In my major's department, advisors seem to be very helpful and they want to see you succeed. Overall, I've had a good and fun experience so far."
Junior,4,"There really is nothing like the HBCU experience. When I transferred from my previous institution, I was welcomed warmly and with open arms. The campus is very friendly and so are most of the professors. They really push you to be the best that you can be in your field."
Alum,4,"I appreciated my experience at Norfolk State University. Norfolk State University provided a platform for me to expand my horizons in philosophy, politics, and literature. I always had interests in these subjects, yet they were always given secondary attention due to my strong STEM background while pursuing my dual Associate's Degrees in Science and Nursing. 

This environment challenged me and groomed me for my current position in the United States Coast Guard. My job requires me to have great analytical skills in light of competing demands, public speaking abilities, and the capacity to engage in active listening. All of these ""soft"" skills were acquired or honed at Norfolk State University in the classroom, the student union, or during off campus community service projects. I will always cherish my time at Norfolk State University."
Freshman,4,As an incoming freshman Norfolk is making the transition from high school to college good.  The people have been nice
Sophomore,4,I would like for the financial aid department to get better organized. Other than that overall good school!
Freshman,4,So far my experience is good. There’s could be better food options in the cafe. The dorms aren’t bad cause use some more updates. But overall my experience has been good.
Junior,4,I like being near the beach and lots of fishing areas. I have meet some good friends and good teachers. I have learned a lot and enjoy my time at Norfolk State. I am near my family. There are some areas that need improving.  The washer and dryer need updating. The food is very good and the people are friendly. I would recommend Norfolk State to future students and friends.
Sophomore,4,I like Norfolk State University. I feel like the downside to it would be me just because they offer you like any other college education to a better future and I didn't take advantage of the situation I neglected and didn't do good luckily they let me come back. If God went to them and let them give me another chance I know I have a way to win.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at NSU overall was a good one. I’ve learned that there are people that come from all different places but here, you wouldn’t even think so because of how welcoming the school is. For the most part, everyone is treated fairly and with care. Norfolk State is a school that will accept you for the person you are. The only things I would change about the school is better professors. Other than that, Norfolk Staye University is the place to be."
Sophomore,4,"It's been very nice so far! It can be a bit difficult to get in touch with my nursing advisers sometimes, but aside from that it's been a good experience so far."
Junior,4,Norfolk State is one of the best HBCU’s in the United States. Not only is it family oriented but i have learned a lot about many things while attending Nsu.
Freshman,4,Overall experience at Norfolk State is ok. The highlight of every week is Soul food Thursday’s. The food is worth waiting for by the end of the week. The chicken is good.
Freshman,4,I’m a freshman coming into the university. I’m hoping to gain a lot of experience and knowledge as well as life advice.
Sophomore,4,Norfolk state is a great place to meet all kinds of people from many different backgrounds. There is always campus activities so you’ll never be bored on campus because it’s always something to do. The people here are very friendly and it’s easy to make friends.
Sophomore,4,I’ve been going  to Norfolk State University for two years now and so far I’ve enjoyed myself. There’s plenty of people and facilities here to help you with you work. The people are pretty nice. My freshman year was the best just the right amount of going out and having time to focus on my studies. Now in my second year it’s pretty calm not too much of a party scene now for me just focusing on my class before I go into my major. With the right people you’ll have a great time here at Norfolk State University.
Freshman,4,I like how Norfolk state is vey diverse . The professors are very good at what they do. I love you be around the campus its so beautiful.
Sophomore,4,"Norfolk State University, the ""Home of the Spartans!"". I have had a pretty good experience here especially since the professors and staff are nothing short of amazing. The food and dorms could be in a little better condition but this University does not get enough credit. The recent changes that have been made educationally have pointed this school in the right direction. I feel safe on campus as well as optimistic about learning even though I am double majoring in a pretty solid majors, Electronics and Electrical Engineering as well as Mathematics. I highly recommend this historical HBCU college."
Niche User,4,I went to Norfolk on a college tour and they were in the process of rebuilding. It seemed like they were making the campus updated. I enjoyed how everyone was very personable and it seemed life thy were very interested in getting to know everyone. They also showed us were the Divine 9 was stationed. I really enjoyed this campus.
Junior,4,"Everyone at Norfolk State treats you like family, it's very warm and loving there. You gain a second family from this university."
Junior,4,"The campus is very nice ,and the student body is a little diverse.The cafe food is sometimes good depending in the day you go get food .But ,some food places on campus are better than others.The work load isn't too bad  and the classes are a base number of like 15-30 students depending on the certain class you take."
Junior,4,This school is a great HBCU. The professor and staff really care about you and try to help you as much as possible.
Niche User,4,"Norfolk state is a great place. It brings so many cultural diverse people to one place in my city. Its also placed very well in the city, it offers students a lot to do outside of school."
Sophomore,2,"i been here almost 2 years i had to file a appeal against one of my professor because of her unachievable grading criteria btw her name is Professor Mamie Johnson and she teaches Speech I am a 3.8 GPA student top 15%  then on top of that they provide no assistance for pre nursing students such as studying for the HESI i even asked the nursing department if they offer resources the lady in there was VERY rude and dismissive like she did not want to help me at all including the head department  so fast forward to me passing my HESI I went to send my application and i got rejected like why? most of the pre nursing students who i was testing with failed twice yes i know that the HESI is a national exam so colleges do not know what will be on there however i know there are plenty of colleges that offer HESI tutoring, they do not not even offer any advice but studying like what?  i will be transferring to ODU to finish my nursing"
Sophomore,2,"Norfolk State is very messy. From what I have experienced, a lot of the faculty are very rude and not willing to help. This is not for all just a lot of them. A parking pass is REQUIRED or you will receive a ticket. The pass is $125 and most of the time there is no parking available. I am just ready to graduate."
College Sophomore,2,"It has its ups and downs. I get annoyed when the siren goes off at 2am and everyone is forced out the building when it's usually something immature (making soup in a sink?????). I get annoyed but the constant smokers around the building, they're suppose to be a certain amount of feet away from the building but they don't care. Guys playing in the hallway around 3am when some people are trying to sleep. Actually, I'm going to drop my rating down. The level of enforcement is horrible, we had multiple talks and no one pays them any-mind. I hated the dorms, and was relieved when my roommate left."
College Junior,2,"I hated my dorm! It smelled horrible, it was not clean and my roommate was horrible. After one semester I never lived on campus again."
College Freshman,2,"My overall experience at my school, Norfolk State University, so far, is that classes and developing new friendships does not seem to be difficult, but rather easy. My favorite experiences are of the extra-curricular activities and beneficial academic programs that I am affiliated with. What makes my school unique in its own way is the surrounding environment and how much the community is involved with our school's activities.. A reason why I would not choose this school again is because I wpould really enjoy diversity, larger class sizes (population of students) and a safer surrounding environment."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial Aid is the biggest problem at Norfolk State. I personally would not recommend anyone to attend NSU, because financial aid makes it hard to enjoy college."
College Sophomore,2,"The local neighborhoods include either expensive 4 bedroom family homes or low-cost, low quality apartments."
College Sophomore,2,"Around my school we have McDonald's and church's, it's no student discounts at neither one of them."
College Freshman,2,need better places to live for cheap
College Freshman,2,need better choices with better discounts
College Senior,2,"When I lived on campus, I bemoaned the fact I had to sign someone in every time I wanted visitation. Don't park in the wrong parking spot because there will surely be ticket waiting for you in your windshield. 25$ for your first offense and if you decide not to pay within their given time frame, there will be a boot put onto your car."
College Sophomore,2,"My major, is offered here but I am not comfortable with the Nursing program provided here"
College Freshman,2,"Before being enrolled in classes as a freshman in the fall of 2013, I had to deal with constant back and forth bickering with financial aid because they didn't clear my scholarships, grants, and loans till the last minute.  I almost couldn't attend."
College Freshman,2,"The houses near NSU are not very ""go to"" places that I would live."
College Sophomore,2,The city can be boring. You have to catch the Tide train to downtown to find things to do. Most times there's nothing to do but go to the mall and movies.
College Junior,2,Many students have the wrong idea about why they are in school
College Junior,2,you have to stay on them to get anything done.
College Junior,2,Norfolk  State University is strict when they want to be. They are out to get money from students for every little thing.
College Freshman,2,"They always seem to be taking their time to do anything finance related. Especially when it comes to refunds, it can take seemingly forever to get your check."
College Junior,2,"I have access to the computers at school, however the computer access can
often be limited because the vomputer labs are often crowded. I would encourage
students to bring their own laptop if they like to use the computer often. As far as the
internet is concerned, there are often bad connections or no connections at all. The wifi
connection around campus varies as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Her housing sucks there's no room in any of the dorm areas, and the places is a dirty."
College Sophomore,2,There is something bad always going on in my community. There's always some type of crime going on at all times of the day. People hailed at gunpoint and robbed for everything that they have.
College Sophomore,2,The shuttle doesn't run often enough to save us
College Freshman,2,It is a shuttle that takes students to the club
College Freshman,2,There are not many options around the school
College Freshman,2,Its always cold and raining
College Freshman,2,I really don't think this school is for me.
College Sophomore,2,Its in the hood. I don't feel safe unless i'm on campus 
College Senior,2,There is not enough parking.
College Freshman,2,School is a fun experience but not sure if its exactly the one im looking for 
College Freshman,2,Parking is okay but its sometimes a hassle
College Freshman,2,Housing is okay some buildings are old and need renovations 
College Freshman,2,Are Teams are average and that is Ok but mostly no school spirit during games
College Junior,2,"Norfolk State is in the process of putting up a new nursing building therefore, a huge parking lot section was closed to use that location for the new building. Having said that, finding parking has become a hassle and even with a parking decal, I often park off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"So as a freshman of course you're the underdog so that means you get the ""not so great"" housing. You have to start at the bottom of the food chain so to speak. Honors dorms, music dorms, and upperclassmen housing is a step up. I guess you have to work your way up."
College Sophomore,2,If you're not involved in some kind of student organization you're going to be bored most of the time. There are limited things to do on campus.After you do them a few times they get boring. You can only go bowling but so many times. Different clubs and organizations make up the majority of activities on campus.
College Senior,2,"There is always students smoking and drinking around campus. It the norm. Cops usually harass students for it, but nothing really changes. I feel like if there were more security or they paid more attention to students' safety, rather than the drug use, campus would be much better."
College Sophomore,2,"electronic engineer-rising sophmore
the professors give tests on what they dont talk about.
expect you to always have the answers. expect you to study their own class rather that your others.  all they do is talk instead of demonstration."
College Sophomore,2,people dont pick up the phone. always late. application fee is only 20 dollars. make sure to start early and call daily.
College Sophomore,2,Weather in Virginia is bipolar. One day it's hot the next day it's raining then it will be freezing the following week.
Recent Alumnus,2,"At Norfolk State University the work load is pretty average depending on the major. Every now and then the registration process can be confusing and unorganized however, overall they do a pretty decent job."
Recent Alumnus,2,Fines Are the Worst – Don't park if you don't have a decal. That is enough said ! Parking is very limited especially around the lunch hour.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is difficult to find diversity at a historically black university. Most students are found on the athletic teams if they are from different backgrounds.
College Junior,2,"It's very average to live off campus. You will find some landlords that work thoroughly with you and them you have the ones that just want your money. Parking is always a problem on campus and off. The cost is pretty decent, almost equivalent to the housing packages on campus."
College Sophomore,2,The wireless speed really isn't all that . I am actually considering bringing my own router down this semester.  Printing is a hassle too as you have a daily limit and with big projects that can create a big effect.
College Senior,2,The weather here is very inconsistent and changes on a nearly daily basis. The best advice I could give to someone from out of town is to keep a change of clothes nearby to stay weather appropriate.
College Freshman,2,Off campus life will only be good if you don't with your parents.
College Freshman,2,"The greek life to me seems fun and exciting. They throw parties and have special events but, i never was apart of the greek life so i dont know too much about them"
College Sophomore,2,"Finding parking on campus at times is very hard. I have to arrive on campus most days, at least 30 minutes prior to ensure I get a parking space and can get to class on time."
College Sophomore,2,A lot of places are too high for the average amount of money a college student has.
College Junior,2,There are some places that you can use your school card to purchase food.
College Senior,2,"Housing definitely varies in this area.  Especially if you are working and going to school full-time.  The further away you decide to live from campus the costlier it gets.  There are also a few houses that rent out rooms to students, who choose not to stay on campus.  Very convenient, seeing as they are in close proximity to the school.  NSU, overall, is a safe environment- considering campus police works closely with the city police."
College Sophomore,2,norfolk state is a hbcu meaning there isnt alot of diversity you may see one person of anoter race in one of your classrooms
College Junior,2,The majority of the off-campus dining restaurants are a hassle to get to. You have to take the bus or the tide to get there. There aren't any late night options but 7-11.
College Freshman,2,"As the saying says,""When It Rains It Pours,"" that was meant for the area of Norfolk. Everytime that it rains it floods and it is a hassle gettin to and from classes back to the dorm."
College Senior,2,"Some of the teachers I've had were the best professors there is to ever have, that I still try to keep in touch with even if i don't have their class anymore. A few of my teachers were the worst, had the highest failure rates, and the poorest attitudes. Also for our business program is supposed to be good, I find it contradictory that many of the classes I need either aren't being offered at all, or not at a convenient time."
College Senior,2,"Not many administrators emphasize the importance of learning the morals, values, qualities, and benefits of diversity around us and in our lives. Even our foreign teachers have attitudes towards our differences. I think that there should be more work in appreciating the diversity around us even if we are an HBCU."
College Junior,2,"The campus feels more like a high school, than a university full of adults. The rules are asinine and immature. For example, after big school events like Battle of the Bands, residents are not allowed to have guests in their rooms. Security guards were standing at all the entrances of residence halls ensuring that the only people who walked in were residence of that particular hall."
College Freshman,2,"Overall NSU has a few nice looking buildings but the academics are not that great. The professors don't offer any makeups or redo's . The advisors are no help as far as helping you choose classes and graduating on time; this may become a serious problem for freshmen. As far as campus life it's always seminars but never any fun activities to relieve the stress of school work. There are only parties off campus and most of which are 21+. However the people are nice here and the environment is welcoming, it just needs improvement."
Recent Alumnus,2,The police department is on hand but when it comes to parking sometimes you have to park a long way to get to class.
Freshman,1,"I've only been here for a month and I am planning on transferring anyway. They accept nearly everyone onto the campus, so there is never enough room for every student or any room for people to move around. The faculty and staff here have the worst attitudes. The shuttle sucks. The campus is unattractive, they only show the middle of the campus on the website which has the brand new buildings so that the school looks nice, but in reality outside of the middle of the campus, everything looks run down. Lots of kids here drink and smoke openly but the smell of weed is horrific. They tell freshman that events are mandatory for us, but only half of the class shows up. They say that we are all a ""family"" but the people here separate people who are more conservative/reserved and the non-black kids who go here. It sucks to be stuck on campus on the weekends, because barely anything is open which is inconvenient for the people who cannot go home. Lastly, financial aid sucks."
Freshman,1,"Overall Norfolk State University is a well rounded budgeted HBCU school for your high school graduate. As a freshman coming into NSU I have honestly had mixed reviews, however the school has their perks of athletic scholarships. Even though the area is not safe for your son or daughter, just make sure that you child downloads the Live Safe app on his or her phone allowing you to monitor them when they are walking alone."
College Freshman,1,Security sucks! The people at the gates let everybody on campus and they never check!
College Freshman,1,"The rooms suck, and the bugs are outrages! The bathrooms are disgusting."
College Freshman,1,I don't go to parties but people say that it is terrible here so they go to Old Dominion University for parties
College Freshman,1,Boring nobody is ever on campus because this school sucks
College Freshman,1,The academics here are terrible none of it is ranked
College Freshman,1,This school sucks I hope I get this scholarship so I can get out of here
College Freshman,1,People walk around the campus smoking marijuana and nobody says anything to them
College Freshman,1,The dorms are terrible and dirty. The dining food is the worst they have the same thing almost everyday. The social atmosphere is terrible everybody commutes so they won't have to stay at this terrible school
College Freshman,1,All the athletics team are sorry and the facilities are terrible.
College Freshman,1,You won't even see the greek people it is rare 80 percent of the students commute
College Freshman,1,Anybody can walk on this campus and have a gun.
College Freshman,1,This school is terrible the alumni that graduated from here don't even donate back to this school.
College Freshman,1,The professors don't care about anything except a paycheck. The courses are terrible not much variety at all.
College Freshman,1,Its not a comfortable atmosphere.
College Freshman,1,they barely give out any financial aid or scholarships
College Freshman,1,Not really  anything near campus
College Freshman,1,The area has a very high crime rate. Students are even told to stay away from the local 7/11 at night
College Senior,1,The food on campus is disgusting.
College Senior,1,The campus floods so bad when it rains. And don't let their be ice outside.
College Sophomore,1,"My experience with Financial Aid of Norfolk State University, was and still is a constant issue. I dont know if its the lack of staff or the lack of care in the office, but everytime i call...noone answers or if they do I am on hold for 20-35 minutes. The office needs alot of work, I hope it gets better"
College Freshman,1,FLOODING! RAINING! WINDY! PUDDLES! MUD! We are close to water!
College Freshman,1,"I don't know what it feels like to live off campus, but most people told me they don't like it."
College Sophomore,1,never really know what the weather will be like
College Sophomore,1,"Bottles everywhere. You can smell the drug in the air.
"
College Senior,1,Every thing is limited to time. There a curfew for visitation on weekdays and on weekend. We can only have over night for weekends if you fill out a form. The lobbys close in your own dorms at certain times.
College Senior,1,Campus policies are too strict. I feel as though we pay entirely too much money for all of the unnecessary rules we have. Such as having visitors in your dorm and the curfew policy.
College Junior,1,"At Norfolk State University parking on campus is horrible. There are never enough spaces, and the parking decal price is outrageous. The price was $has and has since gone up to $85 and the parking security has booted my car once before because of their own fault and they gave me a hard time taking it off. They damaged my rim and have yet to apologize or repay me for the damages."
College Senior,1,I am kinda upset about the fact that we still have to pay for the bus passes at our school.
Recent Alumnus,1,Non Greeks look up to Greeks and if Greek organizations can not get along with each other what does that say about them and their attitude towards non Greeks.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Drugs Are Popular – The drug scene is ridiculous. I have never seen so many people smoke marijuana. This is not only a guy things but girls are just as worse. No matter the time of day, you will always catch somebody smoking outside or even in their cars."
College Junior,1,We have a on campus shuttle but by the time you wait on the shuttle you could already be in class. It's very slow. The plus is you have free access to the tide.
College Freshman,1,"Parking can get crazy, make sure you are there EARLY!"
College Sophomore,1,Not to sure the campus has any type of public transportation
College Junior,1,My car was broken into and security never responded to my phone call.
College Sophomore,1,The dorms here at norfolk state compared to the ones on Old Dominion or Christopher Newport campuses are tragic. All of our dorms look like project housing. The best set of dorms on our campus are Midrise and the Suites. But they are only the nicest ones we have but they still do not have any greatness about them compared to the dorms I have seen on other campuses.
College Senior,1,"The water is disgustingly dirty, there are roaches, pipes and heaters constantly busting. At one point when I was pregnant, nothing was done when my whole class and I repeatedly complained of a gas smell in one of the classrooms."
College Senior,1,"Very few of the professors are fair and can be learned from. A majority of the teachers are terrible at teaching and have even more terrible attitudes. Even if you study, do all your work, stay in contact with the teacher often, and go above and beyond to pass, those attitudes and grades recevied are just not fair at all."
College Junior,1,"The wireless network of Norfolk State is horrible. It is very slow and unreliable. Doing homework on it is unbearable. It is shocking to know that this network is the university's.
The computers in the computer labs are up to par, but the printing can be a bit unpredictable. Some labs have had printers that haven't worked all year around because of lack of ink and/or toners."
College Junior,1,"Campu parking can be a problem within itself. Most students who attend my university drive to and from school and parking isnt suitable for them. There are parking permits; howeverthey are a little costly, so most students just park off campus; which can put them behind schedule."
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene here is terrible, especially with the project right across the street and people smoke weed outside in public."
College Junior,1,"NSU is a HBCU so predominant black, but there are different races on campus and everyone is accepted."
College Freshman,1,"The Dorms Suck ! They try to fit all the freshmen in the towers . The towers are the absolute worst . The rooms are small , and they just look old ."
College Junior,1,The cost of parking increases every year and the price is ridiculous!! This year it's $85.00. Its so hard to find a place to park you have to follow people to their car just to park. Just to get a park I have leave home 30 to 40 minutes just to find a space. Parking is definitely a downer when it comes to the campus.
College Senior,1,First off they don't have enough parking to accomidate the people who posses decals.And the cost is $75 for the year butneed to be cheaper because of the limited availability. Ticketing is sparatic if you know what time their on duty and what time they normally come to that particular lot you can avoid tickets. Also they block parking spaces when there is an event in the commuter lot when its limited to begin with. The only reason they get a D is because I eventually get to class!
College Junior,1,"This Is Only from Word of Mouth – I really do not know too much about off campus living. Most students, however, say it's really not worth it."
College Senior,1,Computer Lab Hours – We need to have Computer lab that are open 24/7.  It is ridiculous that our classes demands 3 hours of school work but the computer is opened 9:00am-9pm on week days and 1pm -5pm.  The computer lab should be open everyday and around the clock for nontraditional and commuting students to have better access to them.
College Senior,1,"Community Based Activities – I believe that a community based activities show interests between the school and community interactions.  Community based activities built trust, interactions, and commitment. It allows the students to become pro-active with life outside campus ground that enhance internships, employment, and hospitality.  The community will have the opportunity to engage with the school curriculum, education conferences, and academic programs that are beneficial and rewarding, as a whole."
College Senior,1,Shuttle buses guarantee safety and control.  It shows that the college cares for the welfare of their students on and off campus.
College Junior,1,Shaking my head...word of advice: KEEP ALL COPIES OF YOUR PAPERWORK!!!!
College Freshman,1,Drugs are used pretty openly on campus. There is rarely ever any authority around so I'm guessing that is why.
College Freshman,1,Almost everyone on campus smokes. That's all you smell at night and during the afternoon.
College Freshman,1,Car or Bust – Their is nothing to do on campus or near campus. The closes and best parties or clubs are in Virginia Beach. Unless you have a car your stuck on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Lots of Black Students – The school is populated with mostly black people. There are a few whites and a few other minorities, but because NSU is an HBCU, it is expected to be full of black people. As far as religion, it's all over the place. While there are a lot of Christians, there are many different other religions as well. Orientation is crazy too. There are a lot of straight and gay people at our school. It's sort of normal seeing that kind of thing."
College Senior,1,Parking here is very bad. Every town hall or SGA meeting we have the student body complains about the parking situation. The most complaints are that there is not enough parking for on-campus students and not enough parking lots. But the parking decals are very reasonable compared to my other friends.
College Freshman,1,"The housing is really tough to get into, the housing is unfair because they charge you a unrefundable fee which is not fair, and they still won't have a room for you."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is available and NSU offers parking passes,but there are hardly any parking spaces unless it's the weekend and there is always a meter lady stalking the outside of the school giving tickets to people who are parked there for 10 mins of an hour parking limit. The security gaurds wont even allow students to get dropped off in the front of the dorm at night and they make you walk a long distance just to get dropped off. All they do is eat and socialize among each other and they dont patrol the borders. The Worst!"
College Freshman,1,"Not Many Choices! There are not many off-campus options for housing, unless you have to drive some distance or rent a house. The housing is not student-afforable, and in some places are not safe."
College Student,1,The food is is not that great...sometimes there is something good nut a lot of people are sick of it.

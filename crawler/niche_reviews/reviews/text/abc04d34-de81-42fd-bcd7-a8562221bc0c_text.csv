Sophomore,5,Assumption is a well rounded school with ample athletic and academic opportunities. The religious door is also held open by students for each other and acts as a social net that helps keep students energetically pushing forward with their education.
Alum,5,"Assumption was a small school that was perfect for what I wanted. The professors were willing to help in class, as well as office hours. There were plenty of ways to get involved on campus and to take on leadership roles. Sports are competitive at Assumption and fun to watch on the weekend. The location in Worcester allows for great internship connections as well as fun night life. The location is incredibly safe with a gated entrance and own police force on campus. I would definitely recommend Assumption to a friend if you were looking for a small school."
Sophomore,5,"Great school. The advisors, teachers and students are amazing. Everyone wants to se should succeed and since it’s such a small college every student can really take full advantage of all the resources that are offered. Assumption has made me a strong and more confident person and student."
Freshman,5,"For a small campus in the wealthy part of Worcester, the overall atmosphere is phenomenal! The student body is very welcoming and friendly, and I had no issue making friends right away. There are many new facilities on campus, with an upcoming Neuroscience building under construction.
Class sizes are usually less than or around 20 people and professors are truly motivated to help you succeed. Food at Taylor dining hall is fantastic and you can always treat yourself out to Charlie’s Snack Bar if that gets old. There’s a Dunkin’ on campus and a plethora of clubs to join. Division 2 sports have a fantastic win rate and you have free access to the D’Alzon library and the Plourde Recreational Center (containing weight rooms, treadmills, basketball courts, a pool, etc.). There are plenty of on-campus jobs to choose from and financial aid is easy to come by."
Freshman,5,"Great School, Love everything about it! Assumption is an all-round great school, the faculty is very knowledgable and helpful. The class sizes are just right and all the professors know you by name. All faculty I've encountered are incredibly professional, and helpful. The campus is the perfect size, and it takes at most 10 minutes to walk somewhere. The food is good, and the dining hall staff is incredibly polite and friendly. The athletics are excellent and the atmosphere around football games is electric. All around it is an amazing experience and I recommend it to everyone."
Alum,5,"Great college community.  Professors are involved, passionate.  Lots of on campus activities with a beautiful campus but downtown Worcester has a lot of great restaurants and bars to go as well."
Sophomore,5,"I chose Assumption because of the community. Everyone is always willing to help others out and everyone gets close to each other. It’s a small school, and the location of campus makes it feel like your own world. Being a small school, I saw the same kids all the time and could know who was who on campus. I joined clubs where I was able to continue my love for music, theatre, sports, and to grow in my faith. I personally don’t mind the core classes because I went in undecided so it gave me a chance to make sure I wanted to Major in History and minor in English. The teachers always have office hours and Academic Support is always good to look over a paper or go over material for an exam. There’s always activities to do on campus on the weekends, whether it’s a sporting event or a CAB event. I just went to visit campus just because I missed the school and now I can’t wait to go back."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the way students treat each others in a nice and friendly way. The community in which the school is located is very nice. The sports teams are very good and they are strong and they take people of all backgrounds and race. Assumption college is a diverse school and that is what I really love about it.
Alum,5,I loved that Assumption was a small school and I was able to have the a good relationship with my professors. I wanted to be known by them and not just a number.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy Assumption College! The professors are amazing, and they really want to help you succeed. Classes are small so you can ask questions and go to office hours and the professors know your name. The campus is beautiful! in the fall the trees look so pretty. Sometimes it can feel pretty small and sometimes cliquey, but also a lot of people are friendly to everyone and you can definitely find your place, there are all types of people here."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Assumption College has all around been very positive. I do not have anything to complain about. The student to teacher ratio is great and the opportunities here are beneficial to everyone. They have a really strong academic support center with peers that are very smart and excel in the subjects that they are tutoring, and the library has a lot of other great resources as well. The campus is very clean. The dining hall offers a variety of different meals every day, and it compatible for every person, despite if you have an allergy or eating preference."
Alum,5,"I loved Assumption! Just the right size for me. Great community and atmosphere. Can always find something to do. The food could be better but it isn't as bad as other schools. Excellent professors who actually help you. Good DII sports, especially the football and women's basketball program."
Freshman,5,"My experience so far at Assumption College has been amazing. Everyone here is so welcoming, it's so easy to fit in. I feel comfortable in every class. Classes are capped off at thirty students, so you're never in a class with a ton of people. This creates an environment where you're more than just a number to your professor. Assumption College has been one of my best decisions so far."
Junior,5,I came to Assumption because I liked how it was a smaller campus that still had a welcoming and fun community. The friends that I've made here are the best I've ever had and I'm closer with more professors than I ever thought. My only complaint is that time is going way to fast.
Freshman,5,"I love the community aspect here, I have met so many amazing people through campus ministry and chorale. I have always wanted to go to Catholic school, and I definitely call Assumption College my home."
Freshman,5,"I love how much of a community this campus is. It has a small enough student population to be familiar with a good number of people while it is large enough to be able to meet new people everyday. Everyone is so giving and are willing to help anyone at any moment. Also, the professors are extremely helpful and are willing to work with a student until they feel confident in their abilities in that course. There are also an abundance of resources available for every aspect of life that students do not always know about. One thing that is certain is that no one will ever have to struggle on their own, because a helping hand is somewhere near. "
College Senior,5,Love the classes and courses.  Professors are always engaging.
College Senior,5,Dorms are kept up with as far as cosmetics etc.  There are some very spacious rooms for upper classmen.
College Senior,5,Committed quality professors and staff.  Assumption offers students plenty of extracurricular activities and opportunities to do on a beautiful campus setting.  Quality education.
College Junior,5,99% of our teachers really care about how their students are doing and want them to succeed!
College Junior,5,99% of our teachers really care about how their students are doing and want them to succeed!
College Junior,5,"We have a really safe and small campus.  I have never heard of anyone ever being assaulted on campus, but I do know groups who work within our school and the Worcester community to support victims of sexual assult"
College Junior,5,"Assumption is an amazing school.  Between the close knit community and the diversity that it provides every one loves it.  There is something for everyone, both with classes and with student activities!"

College Freshman,5,the career center is great.
College Freshman,5,Some of the best professors are at assumption!
College Freshman,5,Assumption college football ranks one of the top eighteen in the United States of America.
College Freshman,5,I have had a great 1st semester at Assumption. It is easy to get involved in many clubs and activities. An on campus job is easy to find also. Housing is great. The recreational facilities are also very nice. The professors are very approachable and are highly skill in their area of study.
College Freshman,5,"I am loving the challenge that professors give to me, while making classes enjoyable. The opportunities around campus are immense, as a freshman I am a mentor to younger elementary children and am also interning with a psychologist this summer."
College Freshman,5,"I could not have found a better fit for me, academically or personally. Assumption has created the perfect environment for College. Helping their students to excel in their education, personal and spiritual growth. I am very happy I chose Assumption, I have not had a second thought about my choice. I am very grateful for this opportunity."
College Freshman,5,I love living in desautel hall this year.  It is very close to my classes and to the dinning hall which is perfect for freshman just starting out.  My roommate and I were placed together randomly and the roommate survey placed me with the perfect match.
College Senior,5,Academic programs and professors are great
College Senior,5,The marketing and accounting programs have been great. I know I'll get a job soon after graduation
College Senior,5,If you want to party then you'll definitely find something

College Senior,5,Tons of great restaurants and bars in Worcester

College Senior,5,Varsity sports have been gaining more attention. Very nice recreation center
College Senior,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,Every one here is very friendly and kind and will always talk to you and have their door open and feel free to just walk right in.
College Sophomore,5,"The Worcester Police station is located inside of our campus. They are pretty good with safety. They are not overly protective because they are aware that college students are simply trying to enjoy their weekends but they are not lenient. Parties do not go on for more than four to five hours and any minors are always kicked out of parties if campus police or any RA knocks on the door. No alcoholic beverages are allowed in freshman or sophomore dorms and they will be written up if any is found but RA's are not allowed to check inside the refrigerators if it is not AC property. Overall, AC is fairly strict."
College Sophomore,5,The education as Assumption College is wonderful. I sincerely felt like I grew as a person and especially as a student. All of my professors were incredibly intelligent and always helpful. The professors do their best to give the students the benefit of the doubt and they are always available for office hours.
College Sophomore,5,"Worcester weather is crazy. Lots of rain, snow, and sun. You never get the weather you were hoping for, but it makes each day an adventure."
College Senior,5,"Worcester is full of great dining finds! If you want to eat healthy, check out EVO, if you are vegan, check out the Loving Hut, if you want a italian food, check out Ciao Bella! The options are endless, and there is pretty much a restaurant to meet any food craving. There are also lots of student discounts offered at these places."
College Freshman,5,They have the latest computers in the library and mostly anywhere else computers are available.
College Junior,5,"As a junior I am 100% satisfied with my major. I might work for a local magazine, but the school helps set up jobs so who knows what i'll find! The college offers a few English programs so i can really concentrate on what I want to do, this is really helpful because it gives English majors more experience where they need it. I am a little worried about finding a job, but that is not because of the school."
College Junior,5,I LOVE being an English Major at Assumption College. The professors are wonderful and the classes are interesting. We always have guest speakers and are able to talk to authors and people working in the field.
College Junior,5,"I am a biology major.  I was undecided when I came to Assumption, but I could not be happier about my choice to be a biology major!  I love my classes and the professors are great!  They are so knowledgeable and helpful!  It is the newest and best building on campus and the best!  The labs are interesting and have updated equipment."
College Senior,5,Every classroom I have been in has enough Mac computers.
College Sophomore,5,"A Great Sociology and Psychology Program – I came to Assumption for their Sociology program so that I could concentrate in Criminology.  I really enjoy my classes.  The professors are awesome, and they try to limit cost of required texts.  The psychology department is very nice as well, and some of the classes overlap between both my majors, making it a little easier to get through."
College Sophomore,5,A Lot of Options – There are a lot of places that will deliver or that you can go to. I have heard that Salisbury Street has an awesome selection. There is even a day where you can go and test all of the different foods.
College Senior,5,Human Services and Rehabilitation Studies Review – The Assumption College HSRS major provides its students with the knowledge to be successful in their careers. Professors genuinely care about students and vice versa. Class sizes are small and conducive to a better learning atmosphere. Students gain the ability to help people from all walks of life realize their full potential in society.
College Senior,5,The Best!!! Academics are awesome at AssCo. Professors are attentive. Class sizes are small. Workload is average to above average. Meeting with profs is convenient and always helpful. There is a tutoring center on campus that is a free service run by students who have previously excelled in the classes you need help with. The career center also helps to locate internships and job opportunities after graduation.
College Senior,5,"It's All Good – Our campus is absolutely beautiful and I love walking to class. Knowing that the school is located in New England it is expected that there will be a good amount of snow in the winter, especially in Worcester so I can't really complain. But during the summer and fall months I love being out and about on campus."
College Sophomore,5,The computers at our school all function far beyond the minimum requirement for getting work and research done and are easy to print from upon completion
College Sophomore,5,There Is No Real Drug Use – Drinking is popular on campus but there is little to no drug use.
Sophomore,4,"Professors adapted very well to the sudden need for online based classes. Many promptly recorded lectures, modified syllabuses, and changed assignments to fit the new situation."
Alum,4,It was a very community-oriented school with a lot of different clubs. The school had good professors and good courses. It was a good school for Community service learning and for the major on Human Services and Rehabilitation Studies.
Alum,4,"I only took online classes when we went online due to the pandemic. There were definitely some hiccups, but that is to be expected when transitioning material from in person to online. For the pressure and last minute notice, the online experience got the job done."
Junior,4,The online classes i took were overall a good experince but i wouldn't say they were anything special.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the community I found there - my roommates are some of my closest friends. Being on the swim team was also a big part of my experience and really shaped my life for those four years. I enjoyed the small size of the student population, and the campus."
Niche User,4,"The school environment was so good, the people were so caring and felt like a new home. I went to visit campus for ""Greyhound for a day"" and I felt welcome. This was the only campus that made me feel happy to be there and not make me feel out of place. Food was fantastic and I am excited to start classes there."
Alum,4,"I loved Assumption College, it was the best four years of my life and I made life-long friends throughout my time there. The academics and social life were the highlights, with there being a great offering of classes and it just being a welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Being a student athlete was a great experience as well. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars would be the dorms and the food. Although I never thought the food was bad, there wasn't a ton of choice. However, Worcester has some of the best restaurants and I still visit back there just to go to them! The dorms really need to be updated. Other than that, I would highly recommend Assumption to anyone!!"
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the academics at assumption but the social aspect sucks. All the professors are very kind caring and knowledgeable. Campus police is not great! They don’t do their job! And it’s hilarious how assumption calls itself a blue light campus when there are two
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Assumption College. The people are very kind. Great supportive and educational atmosphere. Helpful with the college transition. Food is just okay, they do not accommodate allergies very well."
Sophomore,4,I had a great first year at Assumption! I was lucky enough to be recruited for the varsity softball team and I had such a wonderful time with my team and working hard for our season. My classes were also very enjoyable and I had very knowledgeable professors. One thing I really appreciated was how understanding my professors were about my athletic commitments. Campus life was also good as Assumption has a very strong and active community there was always something to do!
Junior,4,"My freshman year I struggled to keep my GPA up I ended up on probation my second semester of freshman year. The amount of support and help I received from the college was outstanding. Now I'm going on to my junior year and have been able to keep my grades up and learn to get help when I need it. College has many quite study places. Everyone is friendly, I mean everyone!"
Junior,4,ask anyone about assumption college and they will tell you they love it for its community aspect. it is a very welcoming community with a good student body and faculty.
Freshman,4,"Assumption is a very welcoming school, the students are all very accepting and nice to each other.  The professors are willing to help you whenever you need and are flexible to fit your schedule.  The coaches care about how you are and how your doing.  And the tutors are great, they have helped so much.  The food at the dining hall could be better."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see the scholarship awarding system change.  Since I commute after moving out of the dorms at the end of fall semester, I might not receive a merit scholarship of $12,000 like I did at the beginning of the 2018-2019 academic year. I would like to see this change."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Assumption is that the professors are very helpful, they not just lecturing, they make sure that the students understand the material."
Sophomore,4,Assumption is a great school and provides many opportunities for success. The small classroom size allows students to ask the professor questions and feel like they are valued.
Freshman,4,"I’ve only been here one semester, but so far so good. If you’re considering coming here, from my own personal experience I reccomend, but being completely honest it’s pretty much an academic school and not so much what you’d expect your average college to be like. But getting involved has been key. If I hadn’t signed up for clubs and other activities I would be stuck in my dorm with nothing to do. We do have a great community here, you just have to find the right people. I’ve met amazing people my first semester and had great professors and classes. It is a very tight and small feel for a college, but it’s the kinda school where you get out what you put in. So if you work hard, get involved, make an effort to be social, and keep an open mind, you could really find a home in Assumption."
Senior,4,"It's a small campus where you can get to know people. The professors are interested in getting to know the students and helping them. The administration has been shown to put the budget before the students on a few occasions. While we are a liberal arts school the “arts” programs have had large cut backs. So if you are looking into this school be aware that it seems to be shifting away from liberal arts and toward STEM. There is also a large core which is annoying to complete and you need to plan classes carefully.The food on campus is run by Sodexo. Most of the food is low quality and makes you feel sick after a long time eating it. The dorms on campus are okay. Most of them are in need of renovations. The apartments are nicer but they need to be updated, most of the appliances are very old don't work. Each dorm building needs your ID to scan in, but people will just let you in. Health services isn’t great and only has hours 8-4 on weekdays which is when classes are."
Sophomore,4,"The small classes allow for students to engage on a personal level with professors and connect better with other students. The campus is a tight knit community, and the location is slightly away from the city part of Worcester, so students feel more safe and ""at home""."
Senior,4,The faculty and staff with whom I've interacted have shown a sincere regard for my well being well beyond the classroom. The sense of community at Assumption College is unparalleled.
Sophomore,4,I love the community and classes. I believe Assumption provides great opportunities for work experience. One thing the school could improve on is freedom. I believe the school can be a bit strict and I think since we are adults we deserve freedom.
Junior,4,"Assumption college has great professors, decent resources for life after college, a friendly helping community, and great sport programs. Food can definitely be improved. Residence halls could be improved as well."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and the overall feel of the college! I have enjoyed the majority of my classes so far as well. There are many very nice and helpful professors who genuinely care about your studies and plans for the future. Biggest downsides are the overall price is quite expensive and there are not a ton of options for food or activities on campus, but it is very close to Worcester! Overall it has been a great experience!"
College Senior,4,I haven't used the alumni network but plan to do so.
College Senior,4,The campus police are visible and steps are taken to keep us safe with the changing times.
College Senior,4,Much is done to promote school spirit especially with themed games.
College Junior,4,I love the school. It's a great experience. I've built amazing friendships and networks with the professors.
College Junior,4,"While the admins, Deans, campus advocate, and ResLife team do a good job making students aware of sexual assault, the college and its admins have been accused of covering up various sexual assault incidents. RA's from ResLife are knowledgeable and aware of these incidents but admins still deny it."
College Junior,4,Housing lottery is a pain. It is very unforgiving.
College Junior,4,The close-knit community is what has helped me succeed. The professors are dedicated to helping students grasp the material since class sizes are so small.
College Junior,4,How good your housing is like any school gets better as you get older.  A lot of the dorms are getting updated or are new!  Apartment or townhouse style living is the best!
College Junior,4,Our football team just became D2 and won the NE-10 in 2015.  Other sports are big on campus too! the intramurals are fun and pretty expansive in choice!  Volley ball can get pretty competitive!  We have a brand new gym as well!
College Sophomore,4,Almost everyone who looks for a job after aduating will get one. Especially dream jobs. I have friends who take paid internships at the jibs they want in life. This is the reason I came to Assumption.
College Sophomore,4,4/5 professors here are great. Every once in a while you get some old crazy professors or young ones who dont really know how to teach. The best teachers here are Professor Christensen and Professor Mahoney hands down.
College Sophomore,4,Cops are everywhere and are generally friendly.
College Freshman,4,The professors are what make this school great. I think the amount of effort and passion they put in to teaching and helping the students is remarkable.
College Freshman,4,The alumni are extremely supportive and try to give everyone the best advice with career fairs and such.
College Freshman,4,"Honors housing was very spacious however it was very far away from campus. The community in our dormitory was very applicable, we all liked each other and would have study groups and always hang out with one another."
College Freshman,4,Assumption College has a strong and vibrant community. There is always something to do on campus and everyone is so welcoming!
College Sophomore,4,"It is very exclusive for those who are not on a team. The coaching staff is also not the best, considering do many people quit, including me."
College Sophomore,4,Many students participate in sports whether is be varsity or intramurals. It helped people get to know one another and allows the community to become closer. Communication among athletic teams and administration is not very clear at times though which makes it hard
College Sophomore,4,I like the close knit community at assumption and how the professors want to get to kneel students. The class sizes are small that allow for professors to connect with students and help them grow and learn. I also like the opportunities for extra curricular activities and how it is easy to get to know a lot of people on campus
College Freshman,4,really good security on campus
College Freshman,4,I love the political science program!
College Freshman,4,College was pretty much what I expected it to be. The work load was definitely higher and I had a lot more free time.
College Junior,4,"Assumption has a welcoming atmosphere, and it's always easy to find a caring face. Classes are small, and the teachers really get to know you."
College Sophomore,4,I love Assumption College! I have had a great experience so far and have truly immersed myself in the community at my school. Assumption's academics are generally a good fit for me and I have been truly pleased with my academic advisor.
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid process is easy but unfortunate when it is not enough
College Freshman,4,I loved the Shewsbury Street food tasting that was available to students! it helped me become familiar with the area and great restaurants!
College Freshman,4,"I think the rules are fair, they aren't unreasonable at all."
College Freshman,4,I appreciate the cleanliness my college housing has.
College Freshman,4,i like my major and they have a good business program
College Freshman,4,campus is really nice and kept clean and facilities aren't stuck in the past
College Freshman,4,worcester has so much to offer and its fun to go out to eat or go to the bars for sure
College Freshman,4,you make some awesome friends here and the guys are all cute and fairly preppy if you're into that
College Senior,4,The biggest tip to receiving good financial aid is to work hard in high school so you can obtain an academic scholarship. The scholarships are great.
College Senior,4,The dorms for upperclassmen are fantastic with apartment style living.
College Freshman,4,"The campus atmosphere is very small and community oriented. The dorms are spacious, and the social atmosphere is friendly and inviting."
College Freshman,4,I haven't had any experience with off-campus housing.
College Freshman,4,Dominos is always open which is wonderful.
Junior,2,"The only online classes that I have done have been because of corona virus. Though they were rushed and unexpected, they were absolutely terrible and nonproductive. I learned almost nothing from them. The only bright side was that the teachers were good about trying to stay connected and responding."
Freshman,2,I took all my classes online for most of my second semester due to coronavirus. My professors did not host any online lectures so it mainly consisted of me teaching myself 5 classes.
Freshman,2,"Be warned, Assumption is just like high school. You will see everyone in your grade at the dining halls, around campus LITERALLY EVERYWHERE. The people are very two-sided and it felt a lot like a high school from the movies. They say they dont force religion onto you, but they do. You have to take 3 theology courses and on religious holidays good luck finding meat anywhere on campus. The administration sucks too. I have seen police officers physically abuse students. There are a lot of policies in place for the money-hungry administration to keep them out of bankruptcy. If you want an actual college experience, I would go elsewhere. The sports are average but no one really goes to the games. I liked it at first because of the freedom but once you get in the groove of things it really is miserable and toxic. The food is also gross and lacks variety. There is another dining option off campus but it is so expensive and they give you $100 with your freshman meal plan which don't last long"
Freshman,2,"Currently a freshman but transferring next year. The appearance is deceiving. It looks like a good school but when  you get here you realize you could be having a better experience somewhere else. Food is occasionally pretty good but awful more often than not. Res life is slow and consistently failed to meet my needs. Campus is small and tightly knit, which is good at first, but if you cant find a clique to settle in with you're sort of screwed. Not a whole lot to do here either. Can't really complain about academics, though. Overall I can see how people would like this place, but if you live more than an hour away, don't bother."
Niche User,2,"I really had a hard time at the school when it came to friend making, the academics and everything else. I stayed almost three years was put on academic probation twice and left the school. It is a drinking school and that what kids did three nights a week. Students were constantly being sent to the hospital for being drunk. It was a bad environment."
College Junior,2,We don't have greek life but it wouldn't work on the campus.
College Freshman,2,"Some buildings are old, and not taken care of."
College Senior,2,No one even really considers living off campus. There is no where safe and clean to live.
College Freshman,2,"There are not many off campus housing options in the area. The safety is definitely a main concern, as well as the fact most students choose to live on campus where they have easy access and availability."
College Freshman,2,no one lives off campus but a few kids who can't live on campus anymore
College Freshman,2,there really isn't anything ever going on unless you are 21 or over
College Freshman,2,"The food options on campus are limited, and the variety is virtually nonexistent. The presence of healthy options for protein, and fruits and vegetables is extremely limited and is a problem for many athletes trying to follow a healthy diet. However, the Charlie's points allow for some variety, and the food is better quality. The unlimited meal plan that all freshmen and many sophomores are forced to purchase is often unnecessarily, as even those who frequent the dining hall the most only use 2-3 swipes per day. The plan is more expensive than it is worth."
College Sophomore,2,"It doesn't matter how strict Camus Police tries to banish drinking, or how the RAs will transport you to the hospital if you blow over a point 0.00, drinking is only among those who have some sort of tie to an upperclassmen. Almost impossible for freshman with no connections to someone older to find a party, even sophomores have difficulty. Drinking is a binge drinking sort of deal, but only through certain groups, which becomes very noticeable through things like social media."
College Sophomore,2,"Good amount of places, but you only seem to get Domino's or another type of fast food chain since the restaurants nearby are all pretty expensive."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many courses offered.
College Sophomore,2,"Taxis suck, even though the school has a program with them.  However, there are two shuttles that run to bring students to specific areas in Worcester or neighboring cities.  If your friend has a car, make sure you become their best friend."
College Sophomore,2,"We are on the snow belt and in 2012-2013 we had gotten 9 feet of snow.  The campus is generally good about clearing out the snow before the 8:30am classes, but only so much can be done about ice on stairs.  Expect to land on your ass a time or two."
College Sophomore,2,If you want to live off campus you can find a place. The school won't help you at all because they want you on campus for 4 years
College Sophomore,2,Plenty of parking on campus
College Sophomore,2,majority of people drink a decent amount smoke weed but thats really it
Niche User,1,"Assumption is honestly a pretty bad school. most of the reviews here talk about how the community is welcoming which don’t get me wrong it is. but at any school, you’ll find your people. classes are very easy to the point you are at a disadvantage education wise, party scene is awful and i mean A W F U L. Not much to do on campus or outside of campus since it’s worcester. Campus itself has about 1 nice building, the rest is run down. Everyone here lowkeu knows the school sucks but just saying bc the friends they make, and quite honesty that’s sad. Find a school filled with oppertunity, challenges, and constant things to. Most other schools have hunderds of clubs,good party scenes, and more connections to aid your career. assumptjon is the opposite."
Freshman,1,"I really hated Assumption when I went. I only stayed there a semester before transferring out to my state's school, which I now love. From my God-awful experience, I can tell you that my classes were really easy and juvenile. All the material felt like it could have been taught to a fifth grader. The other thing is that the college really holds your hand throughout your career; almost everyone sees a tutor (which isn't a bad thing, but c'mon have some independence), the professors still track you down like in high-school, and you need your advisor's approval to enroll in every class, which gets really annoying. As for the social scene, this is NOT an academically elite school. In short, I felt like I got stupider by going here. Felt like being stuck in high-school. This isn't the ""college"" experience anyone deserves."
Junior,1,"Very mysterious place. A serene campus, laden with various shrubs and lilies, distracts the eye from the faint glimpse of a shawshank facility. The type of school that the box car children would have gone to. Partially content with maggot-ridden bagels, chobani-paint mixtures, board games before bed on Saturday night, and  a challenging test on the Alphabet in English class. Need medical attention on campus? Just call life star, or simply hope to wake up in the morning.

A typical interaction between two students:
John: “Hey Katy, you and you’re friends should come to my pregame tonight”
Katy: “Sure, I’d - “
Assumption Police: “PUT YOUR HANDS UP RIGHT NOW! YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT...”"
Junior,1,"Poor reputation,  that will you will see is very justified once you come here. Do not come here looking for the college experience because you will be disappointed."
Freshman,1,"If I could do it over, I would have never applied here. Nothing like they make it out to be, so do not be fooled. Career services SUCK for such a ""small school"" you would expect the school to be more invested in students but that is not the case. Very strict school which defeats the independence of college, I believe that because of the strictness of the school, people here graduate at a disadvantage to the real world. Take a long second and rethink if you actually want to come to a school like this."
Freshman,1,"Assumption has been an awful school. Serveral kids transfer out, the campus is not very put together since there is only 1 nice building. RAs and campus police are very strict. Not a party school by any means, most students that want to party need to go into the dangerous city of worcester to bars which is costly and unsafe. Academics are easy, but I guess that may fit somes academic levels. Professors dont care, classes are also usually 40 or more... not sure why Assumption falsely claims to have smaller than that. Boring school as well"
Niche User,1,"Truly a failing instituion. Assumption College has really become the laughing stock of the Worcester College Consortium. I seriously don’t know how they stay open with the amount of kids who transfer out. Academics are below average for the money being spent and professors could care less about their job. Food is very sickening. Police prohibit anyone from having fun, Assumption feels more like a detention facility."
Niche User,1,"Terrible. Classes are easy, professors are not helpful. You might as well be in a massive lecture hall. Campus is decrepit, everyone is super cliquey since it is so small, worse than high school. Campus police and RAs are overly strict, the party scene is awful since there is no off campus housing. Any ""party"" is in the apartments which is pretty much and insane amount of kids squished into a dorm sized room. ""Parties"" also get shut down by campus police before 12. Food sucks here too. Do not come, most kids transfer. Retention rate is very low which is why they do not publicze that on tours or open houses."
Sophomore,1,"Everything about the ""college"" aspect of AC is flat-out terrible. The classes are boring. The professors try to act like they like their job (but you can tell they hate it) or act cruel and superior to their students. Based on their life stories, I am convinced that some of them are actually crazy. Don't get fooled by the tours, when everyone is screaming crap like, ""We're so concerned with community! Community means friendship, and you're a part of it!"" Most People here are clicky and judgmental as hell. There is no ""community."" Others are stuck-up, full of themselves, or try to act cool, when they're just being stupid. Lots of parties go on here, so if you're into that we'd love to have you. I guess if you STRONGLY feel this college is right for you then it probably is (honestly, if you feel that way about any college you should go there). If you don't know where to go and Assumption didn't feel like anything special to you, I'd look past it. There's a reason it's a small campus."
College Freshman,1,"None of the students have any school spirit, no one is involved with campus activities at all. It seems like almost everyone goes home on the weekends, campus is pretty much dead all day Saturday and all day Sunday. It's the most boring college ever. It feels like you're still in high school, even in the classes."
College Sophomore,1,People Are Nice but Arrogant – I feel that a lot of people are stuck up and very wealthy and it shows. People are not very friendly and usually keep to themselves and their friends.
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly all of the kids stay on campus, and nobody seems to dislike this at all! Although there isn't any off-campus housing, nobody cares and everyone seems to want to stay on campus!!"
College Student,1,Freshman can't have cars on campus although some can bring their car for two weeks. There is never any parking spots seeing as most of the academic buildings don't have parking spots for commuters so they park in the sports parking lot or dorm parking. Also upper classmen take parking spots instead of walking five minutes to eat or go to class. The campus police give out tickets for parking violations on a daily basis.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Few and Far Between – THe parking cost for in-state (MA) drivers is $100, and slightly more for outof state divers. THere's not enough spots for the number of drivers that the school allows- meaning that the overflow parking lot becomes the main lot more often than not."

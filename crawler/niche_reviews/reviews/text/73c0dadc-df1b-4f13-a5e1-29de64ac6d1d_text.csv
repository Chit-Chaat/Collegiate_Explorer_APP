Junior,5,Most of my classes are taken online. At first he was a struggle to learn CANVASS which we use for our online courses but now it is really easy and I enjoy taking classes online as a post to face-to-face. I also enjoy the involvement that each student takes part in during class.
Junior,5,Love my University! GO PIRATES!! Every time I call into our main campus which is in Parkville Missouri I always get the upmost attention and assistance with all my issues or questions. The staff is amazing so is the faculty.
Alum,5,"Easy registration, Pricy but very good technology and flexible online schedule. I took courses while in the military and was able to finish on time"
Alum,5,Park University was very convenient while I was in the military and was always there to serve my needs
Freshman,5,I did take online classes. I was worried of how I was going to do it but my professors were very helpful in everything. If I had a problem they would explain how I can do to fix that problem.
Freshman,5,I like the way that they have alot of resources to help you achieve in your college years. For me that I have not been in college for years is very helpful.
Senior,5,Taking classes online were excellent and professor's were really good with the curriculum. Enjoyed my online experience.
Senior,5,Park University is a college with high standards. Excellent academic advisors that will help you throughout your semester's with all your academic needs.
Junior,5,My experience has been amazing. Military friendly and affordable. The staff is amazing and always willing to assist.
Junior,5,Teachers will always engage with students and encourage everyone to participate. Learning phase is good and if assistance is needed it’s easy to reach for help.
Junior,5,I was lucky enough to have a great online learning experience. The Sociology department definitely goes out of their way to keep tabs on students and make sure everyone is able to complete assignments/tests since everyone has a different schedule. I'm looking forward to being online for this next year for sure.
Junior,5,So far the online learning experience has been better than I thought it would be. At first I was afraid to take an online class because I feel that I can learn from not only the instructors and materials but from the natural discussions that take place in a classroom. Different people bring different points of views and thought processes to a discussion that can act as a learning experience. I was afraid that in an online classroom I would be missing out on that. I like to ‘people watch’ there is so much you can learn by just listening to another's point of view. I’m glad that the discussion was required.
Junior,5,"I have taken four classes so far and they have all been online. It was not my first choice for a classroom setting but it has been amazing. I can do school work around the rest of my life and the time they give to turn in assignments is great. 
The staff is amazing from the teachers to the counselors to the financial aid staff. Everyone has been helpful and understanding during the whole process."
Senior,5,"I am new to an entire set of online learning...I've only taken 1 or 2 classes in an online setting. Unfortunately I bombed on those, until I attended classes this past semester at Park. Their staff and professors  went over and beyond to ensure that I had access as well as that I understood all my options available  for online learning. 
Originally all of my classes were in person, but due to the pandemic arising I had the opportunity to  experience online learning with Park University, and I must admit they surpassed my expectation. They made sure to give directions on how to access assignments, allow times for the students to request assistance and tutoring via the online environment. I rather enjoyed the experience and actually passed the classes-again online learning isn't normally my forte`..."
Senior,5,"Despite the onset of COVID-19, my school pressed forward, readjusting classes throughout the semester. They offered Zoom classes as well
as tutoring sessions. My professors actually made time and arranged phone conferences with us as well to work through tech issues and help with understanding assignments. The faculty at Park took great strides in keeping each campus on track, informed, and involved throughout the  pandemic. They even offered some adjustments in terms of the normal withdrawal or extension period for students to assist us with adjusting to the new layout of education. You can tell the mission of this school is to educate, not to take your money and allow failure, something that is far and few nowadays with the current American education system as a whole."
Sophomore,5,Park University has been great. I am currently in the military so I have not attended the campus and all of my classes that are offered in person are through the military base education center. They do offer Park education counselors and they have been awesome to work with! They are very helpful and have great communication. I take a lot of classes online and the website is very easy to navigate almost dummy proof. I actually recommended this school to a few of my coworkers and they have all attended and have loved this school.
Niche User,5,"Park is a really nice smaller school located on the bluffs of the Missouri River in Parkville, Missouri.  It has alot of online classes available."
Sophomore,5,I have always been treated very well from the Park University teachers and they are always willing to help me with any issues I had.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled full time with Park University for their online program. I live out of state so I cannot speak about how their campus and student life is. I can say that their staff is very helpful over the phone and through e-mail. The online courses professors are excellent too. I recommend Park to anyone who is thinking about it, specially if you are planning to be an online student."
Graduate Student,5,"Because I am pursuing an online graduate degree, I only see the Academic side of what Park University has to offer, but I've been very pleased with what they have to offer students who are taking classes online. Their web portal for all students, as well as their online classroom are very easy to navigate and it is obvious that Park works to make the online aspects of their curriculum easy to use and provide technical help for any issues. They have a solid team of advisors, including academic and success advisors who are very in-tune with each students' progress and are helpful to resolve any problems that may arise. I find this the best thing about Park, because as an online student, I can see how it's possible to get forgotten about unless tuition is overdue."
Senior,5,"I cannot say enough good things about Park University. From starting as a older yet nervous freshman, the advisors, instructors and support staff have all been phenomenal. They truly want to see you succeed. They tuition seems a bit high but they provide decent military and other discounts, so that helps."
Freshman,5,The Park  University staff is awesome. They are with you every step of the college process to answer all questions and most of all the classes are small therefore the instructor has amble one one time with  the student.
Freshman,5,I love that everything has been so easy for me doing my enrolling.  The Financial Aid team has been excellent as well as my volleyball coach.
Sophomore,5,The faculty and staff have been a wonderful help with my transfer to Park so far. I started with them several years ago and enjoyed the online experience. In my decision to go back to school the transition has been very smooth.
Sophomore,5,"Park University has made it so easy for me to apply. They kept in contact and advisors have been really helpful with getting me started with my classes. They continued to check in on me about classes, and my progress."
Senior,5,"Their AU ABC partnership made it easy to change majors and pursue the field I was interested in.
The representative on Grand Forks Air Force Base has been nothing but helpful. He ensures all active duty and veteran students have their tuition assistance squared away and that we stick to our degree plans.
I am very glad I choose Park to continue my education."
Senior,5,I've been enrolled with Park since 2014. I'm currently enrolled as a full time student online and unable to attend campus. Attending online classes with Park has been great thus far. I'm two classes away from my degree and glad that I choose to pursue my Bachelors with Park.
Senior,5,"My experience at Park University has been great! Because I work in the daytime, I decided to enroll in online classes. This option has enabled me to work on my Bachelors in Public Administration and also be able to continue to provide for my family at the same time. The instructors are motivational and really encourage students to work hard in class and participate in group study. The instructors are always open to read emails from students and answer any questions that you might have about the reading material, quizzes, and any other assignments."
Sophomore,5,At first when i started everything seem so difficult but employees are always willing to take time out of their day to make sure i had everything i need to start a school term off.
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent University for those who really want to graduate and pursue a career. I read the bad reviews on this site and all of them is about not having a greek life so really do you want a degree or be parting all days... if you only want party life then DON'T STUDY, move to Las Vegas and Party every day 24/7. So funny there is even a bad review for not having drugs in campus... really! LOL. From my experience it's a great University and I got assistance and help when ever I needed it. I never had issues with finantial aid."
Freshman,5,Park University is a great college. I was a first year college student so it was a very scary thought of going to college all by myself. I did not know what to expect and I nobody to talk to. Park was very welcoming and helpful by making me feel comfortable. Park is a great university. I was expecting the professors to be mean and uncaring but that professors at Park are great. I can tell they really care. Park has tons of resources for their students to help them as much as they can. I was expecting college to be very isolated where you had to do everything independently. Park is always there to help so it's amazing. Park University is a great college to go to because it's affordable than most colleges and they really care.
Senior,5,"What I like about park university is that the classes are small, the professors are very good at giving the student information and help that is needed."
Freshman,5,It is diverse that makes it a great place for internationals. Faculties are always there for students. The curriculum is very strong too
Freshman,5,"I believe park has great programs and the professors are experienced. It was a great school for my busy schedules. Everyone at park university are very helpful. I really enjoyed my several years of going there. I worked really hard to earn my degree at Keller. academic was super, enjoy two months classes, online and wonderful professors."
Niche User,5,Was recruited to play volleyball season 2019-20.  Coach Webb was awesome with me so far they have been very resourceful.
Freshman,5,"Park University is an excellent learning institution with a wide variety of demographics. There is no set political identity to the campus, which is good as it does not iterate rhetoric from either political side. It is a very open to everyone and there is plenty to do for the students and their families. The faculty is great and treats the students as peers."
Senior,5,"My experience at Park University has been great!  Because I work in the daytime, I decided to enroll in online classes.   This option has enabled me to work on my BS in Social psychology and also be able to continue to provide for my family at the same time.  The instructors are motivational and really encourage students to work hard in class and participate in group study.  The instructors are always open to read emails from students and answer any questions that you might have about the reading material, quizzes, and any other assignments."
Freshman,5,This is my first year here and i like the school the people and especially the teachers because they're fun and they make the learning experience engaging.
Senior,5,"Park University is a great place to attend. I am someone who suffers from major anxiety especially when it comes to test taking. Park has an online program to where I can get my degree from sitting in my bed. It allows gives me freedom to travel and not have to worry about missing a class. I can be in Japan  and still be following along my classes. I live in California, 3000 miles away from Park's main campus and I don't pay out of state fees. The staff are completely wonderful. Every time I called up with a question, I always got an answer fast and the people were friendly and easy to talk to. My adviser really goes above and beyond for me. Park University isn't a very big name in higher education, but it truly is a great school and I recommend everyone to attend."
Senior,5,I am attending Park University on athletic scholarship for the women's basketball team. I am very happy with my choice to attend Park. The diversity is beautiful on campus as there is people all over the world and very recognized as a military school as well. I am very happy with my living assignments in the dorms and feel as safe as can be on campus and within the city of Parkville. The academics and professors are all concerned for the students and push them for success.
Sophomore,5,I love going to school here. Some classes I take on line and some classes I take on campus. I have had a great experience here and believe I will continue to excel Greatly! #Go Pirates!
Senior,5,"I go to Park using their on-line courses. All the instructors have been great and the material is challenging, but manageable. Glad I found them to continue my degree progression."
Graduate Student,5,"Transitioning from the military to the civilian world was difficult but Park University made it easy for me. They not only helped me transition but also help me accomplish  my goal in obtaining a degree. I never thought I would earn a degree but with their help I was able to. Now, I am on my path to earning a Master's all from them believing in me that I could."
Junior,5,I loved how helpful and hands on Park is compared to other Universities. They check up on their students to ensure they are getting everything they need in order to be successful. I've never been to an institution where they cared so much about their students education and experience. It is truly unlike any other schooling that I have experienced.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Park University is very limited but I have already seen very positive things out of it, the campus is a nice size with a nice professor to student ratio. There are all kinds of different sports and clubs to be apart of. Park is very welcoming and I knew that was the school I wanted to attend as soon as I stepped foot on the campus."
Sophomore,5,Great faculty and staff. Always ready to help you with whatever you need. Most teachers don't give you a huge work load. They understand that you have other classes and jobs. They give enough time to finish each assignment. It is not overwhelming. If you need more time you can talk with your teachers. They are very understanding. The athletics are also great. You can go to games for free and support your school. Most of the teams are very good and it is fun to watch and support.
Freshman,5,"I couldn't be happier at Park University. Every faculty member is helpful and genuinely cares about your success, and will do everything in their power to make you feel at home. I feel confident that I'll succeed here!"
Junior,5,"Park University gives all the benefits of the college experience, but on a smaller campus. For me this is great because the small aspect of the college makes it easier to connect with other students and professors. Having a personal relationship with my professors has helps me greatly in achieving a high GPA and expanding my knowledge of my major."
Junior,5,If you are an active duty military member and are looking to get your degree online or at many of their on base campuses then Park University is a great place to go. They offer plenty of degree options and will cap the cost per semester hour for military members.
Alum,5,"I am not a traditional student and I had to take all my classes online or on a satellite campus. The courses online are very challenging, however the instructors are more than willing to help and are very knowledgeable. I would recommend Park University."
Sophomore,5,"I started attending Park University Fall of 2016. I am so glad I chose this school. I appreciate the mass amount of diversity, as there are many international students who attend here. Not only am I working towards my major, but I am also learning so much about different cultures around the world. I appreciate how diverse Park is."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy Park University. It has small classes, usually ranging from 6 to 30, and the professors honestly care about your success. The faculty actively engage and the President of the University invites people to his house to get to know him better. The housing is great and the multitude of student organizations helps you get involved. I have yet to find someone who wasn't willing to help you succeed and meet your potential."
Freshman,5,"I love this school so much, it is a really Good college. The campus is really nice and is in front of the Missouri river witch is a great view. The dorms are awesome and has a  good price range so it's easier to live on campus. The teachers and faculty, are amazing, they see to it that nothing holds you back. The school also has great chefs that cooks the best meals for lunch and breakfast."
Niche User,5,I have visited the campus and the community is absolutely beautiful! I really look forward to becoming a pirate this fall! Im so excited to be studying my passion Interior Design with an amazing school. I have heard their program for Interior Design is one of a kind!
Freshman,5,"Park University is by far one of the most diverse colleges I’ve seen. Diversity is embraced and everyone here is extremely nice and accepting of you for who you are. Park gives you so many different ways to get involved on campus that it’s very easy to become a part of the campus. The only thing Oark could work on honestly is getting better food in the cafeteria, since they serve most of the same foods daily."
Junior,5,"It is a great school. The environment at the school is wonderful. The staff always helpful. The professor are helpful, always trying to get the easier why to teach every student. Park has a great academic and athletic program. Park has students from every part of the world. I love park."
Freshman,5,"Park University doesn't only have a very beautiful campus, but it also has very friendly professors, students, and staff. Everyone at park is willing to help and very friendly. It is a very good atmosphere to be in for college, everyone wants to see you succeed."
Freshman,5,"As a second time student at Park University  I can honestly say that this is a college that cares about its students, there have been many occasions that the instructors, staff and student success coordinator went above and beyond the call of duty to help me"
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my time as a student of Park University. The courses are engaging. They have a wide variety of classes to choose from. You can choose to take classes online or face to face. They give the option of day time classes or evening. Some of their classes are condensed into 8 weeks and some of them are 16 weeks long. The faculty is very helpful when it comes to recommending classes that are popular or that fit into your interests. The faculty is always willing to help and friendly both on the phone and when stopping by the office.
Senior,5,I love Park University. I may be taking classes online but I wish I could be on campus because it's been pure enjoyment working with them.
Junior,4,"Park is a great school for those who are really focused on their academics. From my experience (I've been here for 3 years), professors are almost always willing to help and work with their students in order for us to reach our full potential. The activities on campus range from big movie nights to something simpler like a special dinner out on the Chapel Lawn, and going to games with friends is always exciting. However, one major critique I happen to have is the communication aspect. Even before COVID, the school seems to lack a solid foundation for getting important messages/notices out to their students in a timely manner. This also isn't singled out to one department either, as multiple departments have had this same issue before. Other than that, though, Park has been a great fit for me and I'm excited to see what else this university has in store for its students!"
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed my online courses at Park University but I do have some critiques of my experiences from the University. There have been times where deadlines (scholarships, events, etc) have not been clear until the week or even day of the major event. Communication is not always on the University's side when discussing admission topics with your counselor, but overall the Admissions team is responsible and does take care of any issues you bring to their attention. The staff and student body are kind and considerate, and there is no party life on campus - which is a plus if you are not a party student. I think the University could work on communication, but overall it is a wonderful and welcoming place."
Freshman,4,"I took two courses online. Both professors were kind and considerate to students. There were some miscommunications with deadlines (Canvas is the primary online classroom and if there were multiple deadlines within an assignment it causes confusion), but the professors I worked with were flexible and took note of students' situations."
Senior,4,Park is a very accommodating school for military and working students who need the flexibility of online courses.
Sophomore,4,It is an amazing and diverse school. Everyone is able to be free and express who they really are with no fear of judgement. Most of the professors are eager to help with any problem you may have.
Sophomore,4,Good School they care about you a lot their rules are annoying at times but cant complains much about it. Academic wise the learning and education level seems very mediocre and old fashioned.
Junior,4,"Online classes went well. Set expectations and schedules. Easy to contact teachers, etc. Some professors did better than others with the transition during the ""covid19"" mess. I personally still prefer face to face classes."
Junior,4,"Overall a good school. It's small and therefore has limited classes and class times. There needs to be more full time staff. Communication is an issue, between departments and advisors and advising and students. You have to stay on top of things with your degree program to make sure you're in the right classes at the right time. Most of the professors that are there are dedicated and available."
Alum,4,Took online classes only to get  CS degree. You must be self disciplined to succeed but most of the professors I had were very helpful if you try and communicate to them where you are struggling. My degree help me get a job in my academic field after my separation from the AF and am very happy now.
Freshman,4,"I'm an international  student at Park University It's a private university with limited amount of students. It's a well equipped university with experienced professors and good infrastructure like labs, library, classroom, dorms and many more. It's  a small peaceful university along with pleasing scenic views which gave me a homely vibe."
Junior,4,"It’s a small campus, the student life is lacking, and if you want to party, it isn’t the place for you."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed park very much. The intimate classroom setting is a big bonus when trying to follow along and get on a same basis with your professor.
Junior,4,I liked Park because it was small and not heavily populated. I like the professors that I had. I like that it was a bit far out but not too far from home.
Freshman,4,"I wouldn’t change anything! As a online learning student, I really like how they schedule and format everything."
Freshman,4,I like Park University because the environment is so nice. There is a lot of diversity here and they have tones of things to do to get involve and meet new people.
Freshman,4,"I have only been at Park for one semester, but it is not a bad college. It's a very quiet school which just isn't my type. There is no greek life and also not a big party scene. A lot of diversity and a beautiful campus, however. If you were to live on Campus I recommend Copley Quad, the dorms feel like apartments! Also, there doesn't seem to be a lot to get involved in."
Sophomore,4,"I like the area where Park is located. Kansas City is very close by, where you can do just about anything. The size of the campus is very ideal because you can walk anywhere in just about five minutes. Every faculty member I have met is willing to help their students and is very thorough in covering the course material."
Sophomore,4,"Park is a perfect fit for me. Although it is a smaller university, it is one of the most technologically advanced and diverse schools in Missouri. It has also been voted the safest campus in Missouri."
Senior,4,I really like the flexibility at Park University. I am able to work full-time and also is able to complete my courses online.
Niche User,4,good stuff and i like it because it is a cool college and it is super dope and also very nice and i just like it so much
Junior,4,I have gone to Park since my Freshman year. I have gotten to know many different people I would have not known otherwise. There is nothing that I really  would like to change about Park.
Senior,4,What I enjoy about Park University is that I felt as though I had a second chance to gain my degree. The faculty and staff made me feel important in my belief that obtaining a higher education knows no age! At this point and time I would love to see Park University have more diversity from a masters program to a doctorate program within the healthcare academia.
Freshman,4,The instructors are very good. They care about your academic progression and do not take shortcuts. You get the grade you deserve.
Junior,4,"I love Park. I have attended Park Univeru every since I stared campus. The thing that I love the most is the campus and how it is structured and the ambiance of nature. It is surrounded by lots of trees, animals, nature trails, a park, in a quiet areas but accessible, and contains many other great things near by. I just love the campus even before I decided to become a Park Pirate."
Sophomore,4,Overall positive experience. I find it fairly easy to reach out for help when I need it because administration/staff/etc really do a lot to help their students make sure they have things squared away. I feel safe even when I'm on campus really late because I know campus safety can be reached very easily if anyone needs them.
Senior,4,"Open to Veterans,  Active Duty and Civilians. Classes are mostly in the evening and weekends. Very helpful. Offer Brick and Motor or Online course. 8 Week courses are provided very helpful."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my overall experience at Park University.  The area surrounding the school is peaceful and tranquil.  The atmosphere was positive.
Senior,4,Great school just not smart with their money. The campus is beautiful especially in spring and the professors care about everything but they loose money and can't keep track of it.
Senior,4,I took two classes on line and had one very good professor and one bad. The overall experience was a positive experience.
Senior,4,"very diverse community. small class sizes and one on one communication with professors. Very personal staff, but financial aid office could be improved."
Junior,4,"Park University is an excellent school for someone in the Kansas City area who is looking for a school that offers a lot of value for its students. It’s not a big school like Kansas State or the University of Kansas, but this can be a good thing. Classes are small, averaging about 20 students per class. Also, they offer a lot of classes online as well. The staff is nice and everyone is willing to help. E-mails are answered in a timely manner and someone is always there if you call. Students are always informed on how they are doing in their classes through the online function where students can view grades. Some of the downsides are that there isn’t a whole lot of parking, and there are a lot of hills to walk. There aren’t any fraternities or sororities at Park either. I am not a party college student, I am here to get my education and get out, and so far, Park has done a great job at helping me to do this. The best part is the tuition. It is far less than the bigger schools."
Junior,4,"This is an overall great university! If you are not looking for a party school, but want to be around people with various backgrounds then this is the place for you. Downtown Kansas City is 15 minutes away along with plenty of places to eat, shop, and hang out (on a college students budget). The academics are pretty standard for a 4 year university and the average class size is less than 30 students. We have an awesome, new school President that engages with students and is hoping to expand and make this university greater!"
Sophomore,4,Military/Veteran friendly school that makes it easy to apply and attend.  Good return on investment.
Senior,4,"What I love about Park is its willingness to work with us the students schedules.  The OnLine classes are a must for me as a single parent since I have to work full time. Other universities only give you the online program for the Masters and above...So Park is Perfect for me.

Jade Baucom"
Senior,4,Park has been a wondeful place to be apart of. Going into my senior year there has been so many things to do on campus due to student life. The athletics are always awesome. (Considering I play softball here) the only thing I would better is the food on campus. Its not the best but its food and I'm happy to have it.
Freshman,4,"I love this school. Everyone is so friendly, the campus is beautiful, and the class sizes are small enough for professors to be able to help you 1 on 1. Close to downtown, always stuff to do! Not a very social/late night school, which is one downside. The dorms are beautiful! There are events on campus every once and awhile, great way to meet people. It's small so meeting people is not easy, but everyone is so friendly!"
College Sophomore,4,The professors have been open to help and give advice. The school administrators are 100% in supporting you.
College Freshman,4,"It is a good school with some great teachers.  Not every teacher is gold, but they still know their material well.  To say one thing wrong or right about the teachers would a misrepresentation.  They have a diverse staff of various teaching styles that complement each other well when taking multiple classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Park is very unique because of the variety of students on and off campus. Each sports team represents a different country, the men's soccer team is Brazilian and Chillein, the women's soccer team is English, the Women's Volleyball team is Brazilian while the men's is Russian. There is also a large population of middle Easter students in the engendering and science programs. This school is one of a kind.  Our president is heavily involved in the student life, from attending the sporting events to hosting student faculty meals. A school I would recommend others attend."
College Freshman,4,Campus Safety Officers are always roaming the campus and are extremely helpful.
College Freshman,4,Very exciting and well supported my students and faculty.
College Junior,4,Thus far my educational experience has been well. I've not had any major issues to address. The small ones that I've had were resolved immediately.
College Freshman,4,The security does a good job of creating a safe environment. There hasnt been any mentions of sexual assault cases that I know of.
College Freshman,4,Student involvement is more so for the students that live on campus.
College Student,4,"At Park University, the baseball and basketball team are really good and the school always knows how to support them."
College Junior,4,This department at park is very helpful.
College Junior,4,Great school and great experience.
College Junior,4,"Great school , love it."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are really nice and spacious. Only problem is we need more community builder activities.
College Freshman,4,Great school for academics. If you're looking for a party school Park University is not it.
College Junior,4,I love the fact that I can attend a college from my home town growing up utilizing the distance learning techniques. I do wish that there were some Masters classes also offered at the local Air Force base branch where they do have Bachelor classes. But so far it has worked with my schedule to do it online. It also makes it possible to continue if my husband needs to move for his career.
College Junior,4,So far Park has been very accommodating to my personal situations. Such as our move overseas. The curriculums are very challenging which pushes me to work and focus harder. I enjoy having the opportunity to take classes while I'm in another country. I would choose this school all over again because of these reasons.
Recent Alumnus,4,I like the fact I can take fast pace classes online and on campus every semester .
College Senior,4,What I really like about Park is that it allows me to take all my courses online in which it really helps me out with my time management. This was the only way I was going to be able to finish school with a full time job and a family at home.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school. I am finally not a number, I am a student by name and I am known. Every class is challenging. The professors are engaging and actually respond to emails. They are always there to help. The services on campus are amazing. The students are involved and we are like a family. I love that about my campus, as well as the scenery. I wake up feeling great because the view is outstanding."
College Junior,4,"As long as you keep up with deadlines and fill the FASFA out ASAP there should be no problem getting financial aid. I had a bit of a problem one semester with aid going through to confirmation, but I got it sorted out."
College Freshman,4,The campus security does their job at maintaining a drug free campus
College Freshman,4,"I like living in the dorms. There is so much space and is close to the classroom. The price is not cheap but is nicer than the other dorms. Housing is easy, too. They notify you your housing in a couple weeks."
College Junior,4,"Class sizes are only 25 students at max. The average is 15. Most of the instructors are there to help you and if they won't, then the tutoring center is a great tool to use. Most instructor reviews are not posted online, so you have to ask fellow classmates if you want opinions on their teaching styles."
College Junior,4,I love my major (Management Information Systems). I love computers and I am interested in business aspects so with this major it is perfect.
College Freshman,2,I really wish I chose a different major and school
College Junior,2,Parking is my only complaint! It is heavily spread out and yet spots are almost always full
Recent Alumnus,2,You do not really hear about the sports being much of a big deal like say you do at Mizzou.
College Freshman,2,The food is terrible and repetitive
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, make friends quick"
College Junior,2,"The city of Fairbanks, AK has a very limited dining selection."
College Freshman,2,"In Missouri, weather tends to be bi-polar. Being up north everything is aplified. So, if it snows in Lee's Summit, there is at least double the amount in Parkville."
College Freshman,2,The only transpertation provided by the university is a bus that goes to the grocery store every once in a while.
College Junior,2,"I was told initally that my entire degree program was available online. That was a lie, now that I am about a year from finishing, I am told I have to come to campus to finish the rest. I run two home based business. One during the day with my sister in law (so she can fill in for me on that one during the day). One at night, my husband and I usually do these jobs (computer repair, installs, networking, etc). Large jobs we work together, small ones, we divide and conquer. Now that they are FORCING me to go to the campus, we are losing income on the nights I have class, as those are nights, I could have been seeing clients. Online classes are PERFECT for my lifestyle as I can do them when I can fit them in. Also, we travel a great deal. Some for work, some personal. Now, we can't...due to these stupid campus classes...from 5pm to 11pm in the evening. Plus, I am an early riser (5am). My day clients start around 7am. I purchased tickets to travel overseas before they told me, I had to attend on campus. Now I am stuck with tickets I can't use. Talk about upset!"
College Junior,2,"There is no police force. We have our phones out in case our husbands or ours kids call. For instance, my son is deployed and I WILL NOT miss his call EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
College Sophomore,2,I am not aware of any public transportation options for this campus.
College Senior,2,"I've only eaten at the diner a few times, but I felt that it was overly packed and the food was of low quality for the price. Other than that, the variety was good and I like the beverages."
College Junior,2,"The food is not very good in the main dining hall. The food in the other places located on different spots on campus have somewhat decent food. If you do not have a meal plan, it is very expensive!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria food isnt really good, except for the breakfast.  There's a very small selection and not much of a variety."
College Senior,2,"I am a double major in Business and in Graphic Design. Business gets a B and Graphics gets a C. Business has good classes and good professors, but the classes overlap a lot and some could be eliminated due to redundancy which kind of made me feel like I was wasting money. Workload is to be expected really wasn't light, but wasn't heavy. They do great with internships as well. The Graphic design department has a Mac lab, which is super nice. However I have been kicked out of graphic design classes because I'm  ""not a graphic design student"" even though I am, and when I correct them and the class is full (graphic classes fill up fast) I was SOL. So I got screwed out of some of my classes that I needed."
College Sophomore,2,There are Greek organizations on campus but no Greek housing available on campus so if you're a part of organization it's a fun way to socialize with others
College Freshman,2,"There are always computers available so thats nice, but there are not printers everywhere and some you have to pay like 10 cents to use so it can be a hassle. Also, the wifi can be so incredibly touchy, especially in the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"It's Missouri so you never know what weather to expect. However, when it is raining or snowing it can be terrible, especially if you live in the old dorms because they are on like the other side of campus from most classes. But when the weather is nice, campus is beautiful."
College Junior,2,"I did not apply for financial aid, however I would like to qualify for scholarships as I am a great student."
College Freshman,2,"Public transportation is okay around Park. They do not have a bus line at all in Parkvill but, if you need a bus/taxie to pick you up late at night, then there's a number you can call, and they'll come get you whenever you need them."
College Student,2,There is not much of a variety due to the fact it is a small town.
College Sophomore,2,i think park have to change old computers for new one
College Senior,2,"Parking is okay real early in the morning, but when you are looking for a parking spot around lunch time expect to be driving around for a while until someone pulls out. Maybe you can get lucky if someone is leaving when you are coming. Give yourself enough time to find a parking spot at school and walk to class, otherwise you are going to be late to class."
College Senior,2,"Park University is located in North Kansas City, in Parkville where public transportation is in fact a real problem. One has to have his/her own car."
College Sophomore,2,It's Missouri so the weather changes every minute!
College Junior,2,The advisors at Park don't like transfer credits. I have had to prove several times that I had courses that are equivalent or of a higher standard which already fulfilled requirements for my major. Park University wants students not to graduate to keep receiving payments.They do not seem concerned with producing graduates.
College Junior,2,"Being admitted into the University was fairly simple, however once you're a student things become a bit more complicated. I for instance, had a hard time with my transfer credits from a 4 year University (Brooklyn College) Park University listed almost all of my trasfer credits as electives. I had to make several phone calls to the main campus to show I fulfilled many of the requirements for my major through the already accepted transfers. My science with labs were not accepted however due to a rule which for some reason is not written anywhere is Park University policy. That the science with a lab has to be 1 course equating to 4 credits 3 course credits and one lab credit. If you had multiple science with labs which exceeded the 4 credits it would not be counted. In my case, I believe it is a money issue. I am military and I believe Park is trying to get as much Tuition Assistance money as possible by trying to delay the completion of my program by nit picking with rules that simply don't exist. I may be transferring to Excelsior which tells you upfront what degrees you are able to get without issues. Park recieves a C- for easy to apply to, but they do not take care of their military students."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a huge selection, but then again we don't have a huge number of students. Would like a little bit more of a variety, but oh well."
College Student,2,"I think the parking is a little horrible espicially for commuters but the fee to get the permit was not that bad.Other shools I know charge pretty much the cost of one class on semi-annually basis. Thats why i suggest to live on campus and don't use your car that much, just use public transportation."
College Junior,2,The computer labs at Park are antiquated. They use very old PCs. You would think a private university would have Apple computers or at least modern PCs to use but no. It is possible some of the more advanced equipment is reserved for specific classes like graphic design or something like that.
College Junior,2,Frats aren't all that plentiful at Park. This isn't really known as a party school. Most students are in their 30's.
College Sophomore,2,"I had to go to my advisor's office two times for no reason really.  I had to do a Financial Aid Verification which I have never had to do before and apparently did not send in the backs of the sheets so instead of them notifying me of this, I had to contact them more than once to find out what the hold was for.  I would offer a tip to get started early on enrolling for admission so you can get the process done quickly."
College Junior,2,"The professor was sparse on her grading. Didn't grade all students the same, some more harsh than others."
Recent Alumnus,2,I found it very difficult to find applicable scholarships at Park or programs to assist students that fall between the cracks of the system.
College Senior,2,The computer lab at my campus have very old models; however they are updated and get the job done.
College Freshman,2,i don't really like to eat at the cafe.. one of the server is a jerk... and also the food is the same on weekends.. i prefer the smarttmaket at underground.. the guy down there is cool
College Junior,2,"Classes Are Hard – The classes are hard, and the professors don't pay attention to the students, so if you're the type that likes some one-on-one, this isn't the place for you. - mainly online professors, anyway."
College Junior,2,I Have My Own Housing – off campus is on campus. there is only a office here no campus
College Junior,2,"I only rated them a C, due to the classrooms being very old and outdated. I know this is not the Universitys fault, but it's the military installations."
College Junior,2,"Classes Blow. The classes are very small and packed. It's hard to find a seat close enough to the front to listen to the professor. I don't mind this school because it's close to home. It has a beautiful campus, but again, the classes are small. I would think that would make classes better for more interaction for teachers and students, but most classes are lecture which only allows students to ask questions at the end of class."
College Junior,2,"No Difference – The students in my school treat everyone the same, not paying mind to sex, religion or background."
College Freshman,2,No Bus Service to Campus – Park University has not bus service to campus or from campus. You can walk to Downtown Parkville.
College Junior,2,We have access to computers however the majority of the time they are unavailable due to very poor internet access
College Junior,2,Park University is more into academics than parties and sororities or frats. It's mainly a commuter college with a smaller amount of students living on campus. A good deal of the students that attend Park are from oversees and they don't seem to care much for the wildness that sometimes accompanies a frat or sorority.
College Senior,2,"Park is really big on parking tickets, which is a real problem especially if you take afternoon classes. Parking at Park is limited and often frustrating and the tickets range from 10-100 dollars. Its also a dry campus, getting caught can get you expelled."
College Senior,2,"There are clearly marked areas where students can park. This is good, because if you park someone you aren't supposed to you, you know it! But be careful, campus safety will give you a ticket.

Parking accommodations could be improved. Commuters have limited parking and students living on-campus have to walk up/down large hills to reach the dormitories."
College Senior,2,"Some Available – There is plenty of parking available, but only some available close to key buildings.  A lot of the closest spots are reserved for faculty.  I was once on crutches and got chewed out by a faculty member by parking in a handicap spot in a ""faculty"" lot.  Otherwise, parking isn't bad, just plan on getting there early enough to ride the shuttle or walk to class."
College Senior,2,"Some Sports – There are some sports, but it's not a major thing at Park.  The teams do well, but there's not a ton of student body turnout, and sports certainly aren't anything nationally known."
College Junior,2,Long Reponse Time – I didnt recieve as much financial aid as i thought i would but ht eporcess seem to take forever because they would tke days to respond to my questions.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There really is no way to get to Park unless you drive, walk, or bike. Taxis are not seen around here."
College Senior,2,There is very few things to do on campus for fun. If a student does not have a car there are hardly any activities to participate in especially on weekends.
College Freshman,2,There are no clubs around campus to attend because Park University doesn't believe in student drinking and partying. I feel like it is really good not to have clubs because we can all focus on our studies instead.
College Junior,2,"Minot Could Be Better – Minot, North Dakota could be perfect however it would be greatly appreciated if they would shop building hotels and start building more homes and apartments.  We recently encountered a flood that devasted the small town.  Many attractions like our state fair which brings the most income and people all over down to minot for about ten days was cancelled.  But hopefully this year, they will come back and bring income to this town.  There could be more activities or shopping.  We have plently of restaurants as well."
College Sophomore,2,Computer Use – The computer lab at the satellite location is limited usage and is only available during certain limited hours.
College Junior,2,"as i do not attend Park main campus, we only have honor fraternities"
College Senior,2,A Lot of Clubs and Casinos – A lot to do if your over 21. Not much underage life
College Student,2,if you live on campus its no problem. could be problematic as a commuter
College Junior,2,"This class was tough, the instructor was vague and somewhat unhelpful.  I think that I could have gotten a much better grade if the instructor had helped more and answered questions more thouroughly"
College Sophomore,2,I havent really seen many scholarships that are available or offered through Park University. I'm sure they offer them it is just not advertised enough or in enough time for students to take advantage of them.
College Sophomore,2,Non Existant – I was not aware of any Nightlife at Park University. I'm sure they do have nightlife due to the fact that it is located on a military base and the soldiers often go out to relieve the stress of their day. I'm a mother of four so if their is nightlife I don't have the luxuary of going out to explore it.
Sophomore,1,Online Classes were horrible the teachers would just pile up work and showed 0 compassion for the pandemic.
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have a greek life at this university.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life at Park University.
College Senior,1,I have hated going to Park University. Every year it seems like there are complications with my paperwork and I didn't even receive a proper adviser until my third year of attending. The place is a sinking ship. They are constantly switching teachers and patching up the dam. Because of this a lot of my teachers either resented the school or didn't know what they were doing. It's ridiculous and frustrating. Do not go here. Everyone regrets it.
College Junior,1,"There is no drug use on campus, including alcohol. There is very strong security presence, from what I understand, in the dorms."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is a small town, there is not much too do at all."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The financial aid process at Park University has been a nightmare. Every single person I have spoken with has been uncaring and rushed me off the phone. Financial aid is a big deal, and they have messed up on my account as well as numerous others and somehow they always make me a pay a good chunk out of pocket. I regret choosing this school because of the financial aid department."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone in the financial aid department tells you a different story, and they never have anything right. Absolutely terrible help in this department."
College Freshman,1,There ISN'T any greek life on campus.
College Senior,1,"It's really hilly so when it rains or snows, it's difficult to both drive and walk. Also, parking is very limited and far away so I get incredibly hot walking to class during the summer."
College Sophomore,1,"They just initiated a transportation project, which includes a bus tour to certain places like convenience stores and shopping centers. this just started about a month ago, but I haven't seen it with my own eyes."
College Freshman,1,"I only say C- because a lot of people had stuff stolen during workouts, including one of my teammates cars. However, all Park had to say was that she was parked in a blindspot and they didn't see it happen. Otherwise, I have felt safe and never had anything scary happen."
College Senior,1,"There are no athletic facilities at the campus, if anyone wants to be involved in athletics, they would have to enroll for classes at the main campus in Missouri"
College Senior,1,I have to drive nearly 40 minutes to get to the campus from my house.
College Junior,1,"Considering that I'm allergic to fast food, there is really nothing for me here. On campus, there are 3 places where you can grab something to eat:
1 Student Union - Roasterie - a place that looks like have been made by students only, you can get candies, donuts, chips, coffee.
2 Underground - similar sort of small place except that there is no coffee, but cookies, sweets, canned food, ready-made salads (which are not good), cold drinks like soda etc.
3 Thompson bldg Cafeteria - $6 all you can eat for non campus residents, you can get pizza, some really poorly made and cooked on burnt oil meat, tasteless hummus, few cold salads. Tableware is made of glass i.e. reusable; therefore, in a flu season like right now, I'm not really willing to eat from those plates used by others. Especially when I don't know how they are being washed... 
Well, conclusion: I bring my own food to school OR drive 15 mins to some decent place in Parkville town."
College Junior,1,"Facilities are poor at Park University. Very small library, computer labs and many of the offices are located underground, where I feel like in a cave.
Computers in labs are running Windows 7, however, they're ridiculously limited in their features. You can't type in a foreign language, can't run Task Manager when browser freezes etc. All besides the fact that the number of available computers is very limited.
Study spaces are extremely limited as well. I often need to walk from building to building to find a comfortable study spot, and I only find good ones in a Student Union basement floor. 
Most of the buildings on campus are very old and outdated, with ancient dark-brown wooden doors and smelly carpets. 
Because campus is located on riverside hill, you always have to climb ridiculous amount of stairs up from the parking lot to the buildings, and this exercise is not something I feel like doing all the time...
Road pavement is not good in some places on campus as well, with many cracks, ditches etc.
Tables and chairs in most of classrooms are also very old, has drawings on them... everything basically needs to be upgraded and renewed because this school makes me feel like daily I'm going back to 1970's."
College Junior,1,"There is almost nothing in the area. In order to get some decent food between my classes, I have to drive for 10-15 mins minimum to get to the Parkville town. 
Other than that, there are very few fast food places within 5 minutes drive (not walk, drive!), but I'm allergic to fast food so that doesn't work for me at all."
College Senior,1,"I don't believe it is very strict on campus at all, which is quite disappointing."
College Junior,1,As an online student it seems that the courses available are more suited to generate a grade rather than teaching concepts.
College Junior,1,Many online classes seem automated and essentially mediums to receive a grade rather than teach a concept.
College Junior,1,Being an online student limits interaction with the teacher and slows down response time to questions. As a computer information systems major most upper level classes require prior knowledge and experience since the students are left to teach themselves and the instructor just grades work.
College Senior,1,There is no public transportation located near Park University.
College Junior,1,It is on a military base so we have no night life. you could drive 15 min to UCM. hey have greek life and parties all the time.
College Junior,1,At Park University-Lackland Campus there is hardly any computers available at any of the classrooms or labs.
College Freshman,1,"Unless you arrive on campus at 7 am in the morning like I do, It can be extremely difficult to find a spot to park, even in the most far away places."
College Senior,1,Any time I have gone to park for a final there is absolutly no parking.
College Sophomore,1,"There are plenty of places to eat nearby but I am not aware that you get any discounts for being a park student.  If you do, I am not aware of them."
College Junior,1,No Help – if you fall behind you are going to be left behind
College Junior,1,There Are No Greeks! There aren't any frats or sororities here at Park. The closest thing to Greeks is small clubs that have Greek names. I can't even name a club with a Greek name off the top of my head because they're so scarce. There aren't any Greek houses so no parties or events hosted by Greeks.
College Senior,1,"They Mess up EVERY Time! No matter what your financial situation may be you can always count on one thing with Park's financial aid office, the always mess up something with your financial aid so you conveniently end up pay MORE money out of your own pocket! It doesn't matter if your information has been the same for 3 years or not, each year you will have a different set of problems."
College Junior,1,"Poor Wireless Network – Computer lab had sufficient computers, however, the network was very slow and unreliable."
College Senior,1,"From what I've heard, the Austin campus for Park University may not be around past the lease expiration in a couple years. I would not recommend starting a social psychology degree here unless you like taking everything online, since, as of last semester, there is no longer a psychology professor on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"The only fraternities at Park are honors fraternities and fraternities for your major. It's not the same as a regular school, there's no Greek housing or pledging or anything like that"
College Junior,1,"Park is located in a rural area, very limited public transportation."
College Freshman,1,Not Even Ok – The quality to me isnt that great. There isn't much variety or options to choose from.
College Sophomore,1,Night Life Huh? I attend online classes because I am a night owl.. ;)
College Freshman,1,"There are tons of parking lots at Park University, but residential students will get tickets for parking in any of them except for the two most inconvienient lots there. They are both located on hills and about a quarter mile away from the newer dorms. You would think that they would do their best to make the students who pay the most by living on campus' lives easier. The only upside is the parking permits are free."
College Freshman,1,"Not So Good for a Transfer – I had an issue that my credits were not transferred correctly resulting in a lower GPA.  After the issue was corrected, the financial aid office refused to give back my transfer scholarship."
College Sophomore,1,"Computer Labs Are Always Crowded – There are not many computer labs available, and for those students that do not have the opportunity to receive one it can be difficult to accomplish tasks. They are very small and sometimes just not available."
College Junior,1,Greek Housing – There is not much for Greek Life or social atmosphere of Greek students on campus.

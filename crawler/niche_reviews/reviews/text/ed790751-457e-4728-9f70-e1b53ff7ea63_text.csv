Freshman,5,I'm a freshman in Berkeley and everyone in the school is super helpful and nice. The admission office made the applying situation easy to apply plus they were super understanding situations about the situation I was in.
Freshman,5,I haven't been a students that long but the online learning its very easy and understanding its very informative on what work should be done
Sophomore,5,"Overall the experience has been great coming in as a new student in 2020 class year. The year started so well until the mass spread of covid-19, which didn't stop the motivation."
Sophomore,5,"Great Considering the circumstances. Covid-19 has made a mark on schools overall. The best thing as students now, is to focus on the important things, which is health."
Sophomore,5,"This is my third semester, but it's my first time taking online classes and the scary part is my first time taking 6 classes in a semester. They are patient with you and work with you. Yes, it's somewhat difficult because some classes weren't supposed to be online such as Public Speaking class. However, we as students and professors are communicating and working things out."
Sophomore,5,"Hello,
I am currently a college sophomore at Berkeley College. I always took on site classes and they were terrific, teachers are engaging, they work with you pretty well, their goal is for you to learn and not just get a diploma. At Berkeley College, you not a number, they know your name and help you many ways to succeed. They have patience for you and even during this pandemic, which I am currently in my third semester and taking my first online classes, the most scary part is that this is also my first time taking 6 classes in a semester. Challenging right! I love the Berkeley Family they are really supportive. They always keep you updated on opportunities and the most wonderful thing that they helped me with a payment plan that goes pretty well on what I can afford monthly. The best thing is that I was originally graduating on 2023 but I am a year ahead now so, soon will be a graduate. A big shoutout to class of 2022 and class of 2023! THANK YOU BERKELEY COLLEGE WOODLAND PARK !!!!"
Freshman,5,"Online classes at Berkeley College Woodland campus is by far one of the best I have ever known about, and gladly, I took a leap of faith enroll in their program and I was not disappointed to say the least. Lectures are with you all the way to ensure no student is left behind and give extra help for those who need it. The weekly coursework are very understandable and interesting. Great online program."
Niche User,5,It was a small campus which was good. The professor I got for my class was very much concerned when students would be absent and or had to leave class early which was nice. They also had the library available which was good and even allowed me to print my papers which was very helpful.
Niche User,5,I did not always understand why this school follows the curriculum and tatics that it does but now being in my last semester i understand. This school prepares you for the future. This is has an amazing graduation rate of those students who finish thier degree or program of choice. I love this school
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Berkeley college. It’s an amazing school, it’s very diversified and the teachers are amazing! Most of all I love the fact that the professor have actually had a career in what they are teaching. Which means the knowledge is coming from experience."
Senior,5,"I like overall everything the teachers the classrooms the library it's not to big I feel like I fit right in ,"

The staff and faculty make sure that the student has all the benefits as a student in this institution. The faculty and the professor are professionals and understandable in all the situations. The educational formation in this institution is great, they implement real-life scenarios in order to make it more compatible with our starting knowledge. The staff provides all the facilities need to be success in the determinate time of the college life. Also, the faculty helps you to clarify any complication that you might have during the process of approaching the degree."
Senior,5,I completed my Associates Degree in Paralegal Studies and decided to return for a Bachelors in Justice Studies. The staff is extremely helpful and welcoming. They have services available to address any challenge you may face. I would highly recommend this school to anyone.
College Junior,5,The professors are very knowledgeable and add value to our discussion conversations.
College Junior,5,There is an internship course in the final semester and there are career boards sent to our emails to let us know of upcoming job openings and career fairs.

College Senior,5,"as a future surgical technologist, berkeley has given me the opportunity to get hands on in the field, work in a real OR, with doctors, nurses and other surgical techs motivates me to keep studying. in addition to that i get a lot of exposure to a variety of surgeries that will help me to  get a job in a future."
College Junior,5,"My major is Fashion, Marketing, and Management. Not many schools that I had applied to have this major actually. What I love about my major is that I can use any of the three courses to advance myself in three completely different feels if the need be. At the end of my graduation year, I will intern for a company related to my major too!"
College Junior,5,"You really get your monies worth at this institution! When I first applied, I thought nothing spectacular of Berkeley College. I applied to many other school and sat with all kinds of administration and staff. None of each compared to Berkeley! From the moment I walked in, I felt like a human being and not a profit of business like the other schools made me feel. Each teach takes one on one time their students and values them. The small classroom setting helps with that too."
College Junior,5,Online classes are flexiable and excellent
College Junior,5,"I have not had the experience upon career service but it is a lifetime guarentee once you have applied, become accepted, and attended Berkeley College."

The professor do care about you and are willing to work with you on anything you are struggling with and or need help with. I love my college!
College Sophomore,5,I love the students I have encountered. The vibe they put off as well as the friendship we gain is awesome
College Senior,5,I love my school it's a great experience. Faculty and staff are awesome with the exception of financial aid department the times I have been there everyone was inpleasant and they do not match the rest of the faculty.
College Senior,5,All my professors are awesome.
College Senior,5,Wen have a mixture of students. I do believe everyone is awesome and friendly.
College Senior,5,All the staff is excellent.
Recent Alumnus,5,The school and its' professors speak for itself. I can not begin to tell you how satisfied I am with the education that I'm receiving from Berkeley College. I highly recommend Berkeley to all that inquire.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The academics are up to the standards of many other colleges and universities.  The best professors in the world would not be able to teach one that does not want to learn.  Here at Berkeley, you want to learn, just because it is that type of atmosphere."
College Senior,5,The Campus Resources Rock and Berkeley!
College Senior,5,I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS THEY HELP ME TO THEIR BEST OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE
College Senior,5,I LOVE WHAT IM TAKING AND THE TEACHERS MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT IM TAKING
College Senior,5,IT HAS HELPED ME GET TO COMING TO SCHOOL
College Senior,5,"The first 2 years I had a complete free ride due to FAFSA and my scholarships. After my high school scholarship ran out, I had to take out a Sallie Mae loan. The financial aide office have very patient and friendly people working there so when it came down to me taking out a student loan to cover the rest of the cost, they were helping me with options."
College Senior,5,"The Academics in this school is amazing. From registering the class, to being in the class you are guided every step of the way. This is one of the reason why I picked Berkeley College because every single student is taught as if they were a friend. Many professors even when they have to follow a strict teaching guideline, they know how to flavor it up and still make it fun and teachable at the same time."
College Senior,5,I've never had an issue with Berkeley College. I even was granted a second chance to come back with my fees waived so I am happy I was treated like a person and not just a statistic.
College Freshman,5,"My career that I am majoring in I felt the tuition is fair, I thought it was going to be much more I like the fact that they have a tuition freeze which means the tuition remains the same for the 4 years that I have enrolled in. The financial aid process was smooth thanks to the financial advisor who explain everything in detail and I totally understood everything without having any doubt or questions."
College Freshman,5,"Great school, great staff, everyone friendly, feel like your at home.  Can't wait to attend"
College Senior,5,I've learned so much which prepares me immensely for my career.
College Senior,5,Plenty of computers for students to use. They brand new every year!
College Sophomore,5,Career Services is always available to you. They are always helpful in getting interviews and also helping you prepare for the interviews. They also deal with mentors and internships. 
College Sophomore,5,Student center and campus activities is my favorite part about my time in Berkeley College. There is always something new and entertaining going on. Volunteer work is always available.
College Sophomore,5,"When making my schedule, Berkeley College is very flexible in making schedules. I didn't transfer any credits from my last college."
College Sophomore,5,"I didn't take too many online courses, but our in class courses use the online community too. It's very convenient and I love it. It's also good because when I start online courses, I will be familiar."
College Junior,5,I'm receiving my money's worth because the financial aid representer makes  the work much more easier. The reason why its easier is they try to fund you with different grants as possible so that you get pulled out of class for entire quarter.
College Junior,5,"The career center helps you through the process of getting a job; i.e. they help you with your resume, cover letters, recommendations, interview preparation and dressing to impress your employer or interviewer."
Recent Alumnus,5,The value of education I received was worth the tuition I paid simply because I learned materials I could take into the real world.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors have great communication and interpersonal skills, and have tremendous knowledge in ones related field."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Effective course material, lectures and assignments and tests. Great internship opportunities, interned at the Public Defender's Office Mercer Region, and job opportunities available are great sources of information."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I enjoyed lectures, learned the various aspects of the Criminal Justice System. Went for tutoring if a material was difficult to comprehend, managed my time effectually, studied vigorously and never gave up. Motivate your mind and body to always work hard and enjoy yourself whiles at it."
College Senior,5,"The professors are excellent because they currently work in that area of study.  The curriculum can be challenging but with the help of the advisors it is possible to finish on time.  The class registration process is easy, you can do it online or in person.  The workload can be a lot to handle but the professors are understanding and try to work with you."
College Senior,5,"Everyone at Berkeley is very friendly, including the faculty. The student center is always packed and everyone gets a long. So many people are mutual with each other and the atmosphere is very comforting. Everyone is funny, dedicated, and hard working. I feel like people don't judge as much at Berkeley. Everyone goes to the student center to enjoy themselves and I think that's what they do. My experience at the student center with the student body is amazing. I always hang out there, I met so many friends, and I'm very friendly with everyone around. Of course everyone is focused on their education, but the student center is a place where students go in between classes. This student center offers students to make friendships and develop socializing skills. I honestly believe Berkeley College is very united and it's a wonderful thing."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Berkeley College was the best choice I made when it came to advancing in my education. Berkeley stands out from all other schools in the aspect that we act more like a family, than just another face in the crowd. I know when I first went to visit the school, I was skeptical. I thought that an admissions rep would just talk my ear off to get me to make my choice, but that wasn't the case at all. They actually took the time to give you the ins & outs of the school and also took the time to answer any specific questions you had. Once I began taking classes on campus, I made a lot of great friends and after a few quarters, you were running into staff who knew you by your first name. In big colleges, it's very rare for the staff to know  you this well, and I was really happy to be able to have that connection around campus. Once of the other great things on campus was that there was ALWAYS something to do. So many clubs, sports, and just so much involvement around campus. Even now as an alumni, they are always hosting events so that students can join together even though we've completed our degrees. I also LOVED the fact that there was FREE tutoring whenever you needed it. Sometimes seeing it in another perspective really goes a long way, and on most colleges, tutoring is not free at all. Lastly, the career services department is here for you for life. I was fortunately able to place myself in my own job, but the fact that I can rely on them in the event I got let go, or decided I needed to branch out to a new position, they would be there for me. Even 15 years down the road, they are still here for me. It's the lifetime guarantee that no matter what, they will assist you in finding that perfect job. 

The classes are great...the professors make it fun...and you are not just another face in the crowd...you are part of a GROWING family! 

Thanks Berkeley College! :)"
College Senior,5,"When I first heard of Berkeley College, I was a senior in high school.  The college had a table set up near our auditorium and like many students I was interested in seeing what they were about.  I thought about college but wasn't too sure if I was going to go right after high school.  Once I sat down and spoke with the admissions department, I knew this was the school for me. 

Berkeley College is a home away from home.  I'm not just saying that because I'm nearing graduation, I genuinely mean it.  The Woodland Park campus was my immediate choice because of how close it was to my home town of Passaic, NJ.  The campus had a great vibe to it.  I went in the spring time and the atmosphere was unbelievable.  I felt comfortable at the campus, something that every high school graduate would like to feel.  

Coming into College I was nervous about the professors and the staff.  No one wants to be in a place where the teachers are bad, and the staff is worse.  Luckily for me, this College had the complete opposite of that.  I've met so many amazing people because of Berkeley.  I've made some friends that I'm pretty sure will be stuck with me for the remainder of their lives.  

Many people complain that Berkeley College isn't a big school and as much as that is true, it definitely packs a punch both academically and socially.  The professors are remarkable.  I remember early on in my college career sitting in class rooms wowed at how much these professors knew.  Each of them with unique backgrounds in the fields they taught and that was the icing on the cake for me.  Being taught by someone who had been in the field made me feel like I was speaking to a friend and that gave me the extra confidence to excel in my chosen career path.  As I sit back and approach graduation day I am glad to say that choosing Berkeley College was the greatest choice I've made in my life thus far.  

Good luck to all in their college experience.

College Freshman,5,"I attend this school now but I am looking to transfer. This school is incredibly helpful with ANY questions you have. Just stop to the department you have a question about, and they will answer you almost immediately. They do care about their students and the styles of the teachers are different. The community is small, and with this comes a strong relationship within the student body and staff. Unfortunately, this is not the school for me. But I hope that the school I transfer to is as helpful and friendly as this school!"
Freshman,4,"What I like about Berkeley College Woodland Park campus is that, the lecturers are always there and ready to help you with any issues you may have with assignments. They make learning not as stressing and difficult especially for online students who may at times feel like they’re alone. In the end it is always worth the hard work because the lecturers and staff are there to help. Speaking of staff, the in office staff members are easy to talk to and very understanding, couldn’t have asked for better campus to enroll in."
Alum,4,I love the fact that professors are so helpful and know what they are talking about. The school genuinely cares about the students and their success. One time I had a terrible professor and enough people complained and he got fired and replaced. Just wish they had more activities.
Senior,4,"Berkeley College is an outstanding educational institute for those individuals looking to run through their college careers at a much faster pace, and with the support of many faculty members around them. The campus is extremely easy to navigate, the class sizes are small and give individuals an opportunity to sand out, as well as be recognized by name, and Berkeley College is dedicated to helping all of their students succeed with a lifetime of help finding a career."
Junior,4,The College works with you closely. The professors and administration want you to succeed and graduate with a good job. It is an affordable school and offers a lot of flexibility with your schedule.
Alum,4,"The classes fit my schedule, the campus is very beautiful and well kept. The down side to this campus is the travel time and the location itself. I was not too comfortable sitting in the traffic that route 80 has the closer one gets to Downtown Paterson. Granted I do come up to the college a different way then most but I prefer the scenery on the other end of the campus."
College Junior,4,My overall experience at this college has been nothing but positivity.  From the moment that I enrolled the staff has been very supportive and accessible for students.  I have had the most attentive professors and have been fortunate to have classmates that are just as enthusiastic and I am about the educational journey at Berkeley.
College Sophomore,4,I LOVE online classes mainly because I don't have to even worry about leaving my house.
College Sophomore,4,The career center is great. I believe the people at the center will help me find a job after I complete the program.

College Sophomore,4,Earning a degree from this school is a great achievement and will open up many doors for me in the near future to enable my success.

Recent Alumnus,4,"It is like actually being in the field. The knowledge I encountered, I really felt like I was working in my career field. My internship experience has been a great one for me so far. I am completing 120 hours at the Family Division unit in the Superior Court in Passaic County Courts. I have learned a lot so far, and I have only been there for 3 weeks."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My overall experience at school was actually the best decision I have ever made in my life. I was able to experience things I never thought I would experience in college. I was taught how to complete resumes, cover letters, thank you letters etc. I was also taught how to answer questions while on an interview. I use to be afraid to go to interviews. Now, I am excited, and more involved. I am the one asking questions about the company background, etc. Of course I was taught how to right great essays, in both MLA, and APA format, and how to access Excel, Access, and Power point more professionally. I really enjoyed my ""Forensics Science"" class. It was more hands on, being that I am a Criminal Justice major, I liked most part I liked about that class, was that I learned about ""DNA, residue, gun powder,"" etc. Also, we explained how we can tell a person is most likely to comment a crime, by the tip of their ear as well as their nose. My school is unique, because unlike most institutes, Berkeley College have professors who have worked in their field, so they know what they're doing. Also, my school is convenient, and has resources available to students, such as Academic Support, to help assist you with school essays, homework, etc. I would definitely choose this school again, and also recommend this school to others."

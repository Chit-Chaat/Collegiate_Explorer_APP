College Junior,1,South University-VA BCH The instructors are great but admissions did not tell me everything upfront about getting into the nursing program.  They lied about how long they had their program.  Tuition is increased by $2000 a semester once entering into the nursing program.  I have been trying to reach someone for about 3 weeks now to ask more questions about the nursing program but they have been giving me the run around.  I really hope they get the kinks straightened up because I was looking forward to attending their program.

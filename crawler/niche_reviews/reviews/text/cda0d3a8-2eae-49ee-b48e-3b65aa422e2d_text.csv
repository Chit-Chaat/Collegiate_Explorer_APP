Sophomore,5,Washington State Community College has been beyond amazing and always exceeds my expectations. The faculty and students genuinely care about how students are progressing throughout their educational journey. The free tutoring also adds to the success of their students. I would like to see more student parking that is closer to some of the buildings to lessen the walk distance to class.
Sophomore,5,The faculty here is awesome. I personally work full-time and go to school and it is so nice to be around professors that understand what your going through and will help you in whatever ways that they can.

College Senior,5,My major is being taught very well and I'm learning more about it then I thought I would just in my first year.
College Senior,5,The tuition is very affordable for a college at this level of experience. My payments for this school year has already been paid for through a student loan that says I don't have to start making payments until six months after I graduate. This is very helpful and gives students time to save money before they have to pay for college.

College Freshman,5,"I have the most helpful teachers I have ever had. They are willing to help in any way they can. I have learned a lot and I think it is because of the class size. They are small, so teachers can work easier with individuals."
College Freshman,5,I have had people meet and talk with me during their own time.
College Freshman,5,"I love my major. Their are a variety of courses I am able to take to get my degree, and I get to choose which ones sound the most interesting to me.

There are many job opportunities with a Psycjology degree, and even more for me since I am furthering my degree."

College Junior,5,"Love Online Classes – I had no idea what to expect with online courses. The first day I logged onto my online class, I felt very overwhelmed. I had no clue where to start and was afraid I was going to miss something and not get a good grade. It was a big workload, but it was mainly just 'busy work'. I liked my online class because I didn't have to go to campus everyday."
College Junior,5,"Nursing at WSCC – The main reason I chose this school is because of the flexibility with my personal schedule. However, once I started here, it wasn't what I thought. Nursing school, you pretty much go by what schdeule they tell you. I have not had to transfer any credits, but I have friends who have tried and didn't get all their credits from before. I do not like how some professors pile on so many test and due dates right on top of each other."
Niche User,4,"There's a variety of classes to take, with many of them being online! Faculty are very friendly and understanding as well. The campus is easy to navigate!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors are great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and it’s the perfect distance from my house. So far, I have passed all of my classes with a 4.0 gpa. Friends of mine are using their degree’s and feel like they have learned so much towards their field now that they are working."

Sophomore,4,"WSCC is an amazing place to learn especially if you are a nontraditional student. With online classes, night classes. The flexibility is so helpful. Also, there is free tutoring  available on campus. You are never left stranded if you are having trouble. The teachers are magnificent. They attend to emails promptly. The overall cost of the classes are affordable and the school helps those who may need any financial assistance. The school wants you to succeed. This allows you to have peace of mind knowing that you are in good hands."
Freshman,4,"My experience has been relatively good at Washington State Community College. The staff are wonderful, and very caring. They care about your every need, and want you to be successful. One thing I'm not to thrilled about with this college are the classes, I feel they should have more of a variety of classes to choose from."
College Junior,4,"The professors and other staff members are really helpful and nice. The school is a bit outdated in some areas, but there are some renovations/remodels being done currently, as well as some planned for next summer. So far my experience has been a lot of fun and I've met a lot of nice people."
College Junior,4,not much experience with that yet
College Junior,4,Smaller classes which makes it easier for 1 on 1 education when you need it.
College Junior,4,My teachers have past experience in the field. It makes for accurate learning of what to expect from the workforce.
College Junior,4,Great experience so far. Awesome teachers who truly care about their students.
College Sophomore,4,I have my own place so I am still working through school. I can work with my work schedule where I can choose morning classes.
College Sophomore,4,I love the online classes. I'm able to do work on my own and at my pace through out the week. I never feel rushed or hurried.
College Sophomore,4,"The college sends out emails about job fairs that are coming up. They constantly have college recruitment there. I personally know someone who got an internship for the summer. Once the summer had ended he was actually hired on full time. It's great because it works toward his degree, and gets him work experience."
College Sophomore,4,My major is competitive with not a high job rate. The people I get to work with are great though!

College Sophomore,4,I get to go to school for nearly free so no complaints from me!
College Freshman,4,I think the tuition and financial aid is great. I feel like it's a pretty cheap college for the experience and education I am getting. I had some trouble applying for loans and the financial aid office took their time to walk me through everything.
College Freshman,4,"The students are great. We have so much cultural diversity. There is also a club for almost anything, so it's easy to get involved."
College Junior,4,It's cheap and fair. You get what you paid for. Financial Aid helps. My fasfa covers most if not all of the costs and I even get money back with my pell grant. They offer scholarships.

College Junior,4,There is more teacher student interaction
College Junior,4,Easy to registrar and very nice people
Recent Alumnus,4,"Academics are good and you will learn while you are there. The only knock I seem to have any problems with is the financial aid (student services). It seems they have had more problems staying up to date and reviewing their work. With that being said, anytime I notice a discrepancy and notify them, they usually have it fixed within the hour."
College Senior,4,"The student center here is very nice. There are always snacks available to students, the computers are never all occupied, there are many tutors, and a writing center available for students' papers to get edited by someone experienced."
College Senior,4,"The great thing about Washington State is that the class size is small, which allows students and teachers to have a closer relationship and makes it easier for a student to get help when needed. The only bad thing is that this school does not have a huge selection of classes to take, but most of the general classes needed are available. Sometimes you have the same teachers for several subjects, which can be good or bad. Registering for classes is easy if you know what you are doing, but it is very hard to get help unless you actually go to the school and speak to someone personally."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Health Science major, and my school is just beginning the paramedicine program. As it's the beginning, there are a lot of bugs to iron out, but the teachers and medical directors are exceptional."
College Sophomore,4,There is a high level of teachers holding a PhD at WSCC.  Teachers are easy to access and helpful whenever they can be. Help desk and the Center for Student Success are almost always available.
College Sophomore,4,"Online courses can be hard to follow at times, but teachers are very effective with helping out as needed."
College Sophomore,4,"We all pretty well come from the same type of back round and area. Rural or city, but we get along well."
College Junior,2,"The art program is awful, to say the least, and the art history class doesn't even teach from the state regulated syllabus, which is the whole reason the class transfers to other schools."
College Senior,2,Some teachers want you to spend more time online than you would in a class room

Freshman,5,My online experience here has been really helpful. Professors understand the change and adjustment us students have to make and do there best to provide assistance as much as they can.
Freshman,5,"My Experience has really been a true come true, with the exceptions of co-vid19. I have not only gotten a Job my first semester but got involved with school clubs and activities. I made a group of friends that I feel like i'm going to be friends with forever. My professors all see a lot of success in front of me and I am doing good in all my classes."
Sophomore,5,"With Covid, I was forced to take some of my classes online through zoom. As said in the first question, the professors have made sure to ease the workload that we have in case there are any other issues at home. They really care about your education and balancing it with your outside-of-school life."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are all very knowledgeable with what they are teaching. They are truly invested in your education and sincerely want you to succeed. They are a lot more helpful than I would’ve ever thought and consistently offer extra help if you are struggling. The advisors are also very helpful and are always reaching out to try and give you the assistance that you need. Overall my experience with UB and its professors is a 5/5 very helpful, kind, and I know for certain that I will be able to compete with other students on the competitive level for the career(s) that I aim to have."
Sophomore,5,"Personally, I haven't taken any online classes but I bet that the online learning experience is as good the traditional student experience."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the University of Bridgeport has been amazing. When I was looking for a college, this was the one for me from the start. The main campus has everything very close to each other so you don't have to walk very far from one building to another. The campus offers many interactive events and has a variety of clubs. The students are also very friendly and the campus is very diverse which for me was very important since I am a Latina. The faculty are very friendly and willing to help you and do care about you. The classes are small which was also so important to me because I enjoy having that one on one interactions with my professors. Overall, my experience has been amazing at UB."
Freshman,5,I mean it was stressful but not as bad. The school did what they could to support us. Some professors were so understanding while others were just plain wicked and inconsiderate!
Niche User,5,"My experience so far at Bridgeport has been really good so far. They have a really easy to talk to staff and it is very easy to obtain information that you need either it's academic or financial situations. They have a very welcoming environment with current students  giving incoming students good advice on how to see their life here. Tons of on campus activities for everyone to enjoy such as bowling, sports games, parties, and having a campus near seaside park and a Museum. Bridgeport has incredible food and a clean, comfortable dinning hall for students to eat and chill with their friends . The admission and financial office supply's tons of opportunities for students before and after they graduate and also having a lot of campus events giving the students the chance to work on their networking skills .Bridgeport is the place to spend the rest of your four years to head start your career."
Junior,5,"very easily accessible, professors all seem to be kind and care about their classes. Campus needs updating but overall a good school"
Freshman,5,I like that I got accepted to the college and I would like to see what is new in the college. It's a very good school and it has a lot of things to do in there. I wish i can afford the financial aid cost to be able to attend the school.
Niche User,5,"My experience with visiting the campus of this college was great. It felt like home, not only because it's in Bridgeport where I live but also because of the people who attend this campus. The programs I have been apart of that were associated with UB made me feel at home in a sense."
Freshman,5,"In my opinion, the University of Bridgeport is on an uphill road to greatness. This year, we have inducted a new president who has been changing and developing new programs and activities around campus that have been increasing the value of our school. The view of the water is something most people dream about, and the helpfulness between teachers for students are two things UB has great of. For me, Bridgeport became my second home as the culture, area, professors and fellow students were everything I was looking for in a college."
Sophomore,5,All faculty and staff have made my transfer process very easy. I am a sophomore who recently transferred  from the University of Tampa.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Bridgeport is an amazing school with a lot of resources for one to use and many activities to do outside the classroom. The university has a very diverse community with people from all over the world, and also having great professors and advisors in case you need any help. Overall the university is great and very welcoming."
Freshman,5,The people are nice and very understanding. Join clubs and getting to know everyone on campus was amazing the professors are very understanding.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Bridgeport is way more than I expected. Not only did the financial aid award I received cover my tuition expenses, but the entire of environment of the school makes you, as a student, feel at home. College is what you make it and the University of Bridgeport gives each student a helping hand in making the transition to college an easy and smooth one."
Sophomore,5,I like how warm and welcoming the campus is and how everyone is focus on getting their education and is driven to better themselves through bettering their degree. I love how there is so many different people across the world getting a better understanding of getting to know them and where they are from.
Freshman,5,"What I like about the university is academically the system drive you to success. For example, there’s several times I have difficulty with a subject being taught by one of my professors, but what I liked was that the professors were always helpful when I came to them during their office hours our email them about it. There were also tutoring options I could attend to and the tutoring experience was great. I liked the fact that the University have so many options in regards to academic success. To continue, one thing I personally think the University can improve on is too much testing on electronic things. For instance, in the University of Bridgeport we are required to use an app call lockdown browser in order to take quizzes or tests. I am faints this because not every students are capable of purchasing a laptop or even have a laptop that is capable of downloading that app."
Freshman,5,"Staff if very helpful and kind. Nice class rooms, and library. Teacher are very nice and fair. Very safe campus. Excellent food and drinks. Cafeteria always clean."
Junior,5,"this is a great school, with small class sizes. great learning environment with nice and helpful teachers."
Senior,5,"The professors are great and the advisors respond quickly. When taking an online class, you never feel alone. The professors will help you throughout the course and offer assistance as needed. I love the flexibility of having online courses, evening, and weekend courses."
Junior,5,I love the University of Bridgeport. I am majoring in Dental Hygiene and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene at this Institution. The professors here are so dedicated and passionate about dental hygiene that it has inspired me to want to teach it as well. I really love the second year of the program because I love the patient exposure on outside rotations that we go on. I love treating patients and I love the emphasis on dental hygiene public health and I also see myself as public health dental hygienist.  When I graduate from this program I will be a proud alumni and try to give back what was giving to me through education and amazing guidance from my professors.
Sophomore,5,Really supportive atmosphere. Quiet campus. A lot of healthcare opportunities. Food is terrible. Clubs are good. Area is Bridgeport.
Junior,5,UB is a great school. The faculty and staff truly want the best for their students. The Fones School of Dental Hygiene is fantastic. I am a transfer student in the Hygiene program and the curriculum is all that I expected and then some. I most definitely feel prepared to facilitate in the work place.
Graduate Student,5,UB has become my second home. The community on campus helped me grow as a person and I have met so many wonderful people here. The faculty and staff are very accommodating and love interacting with the students here. Coming here has been one of the best decisions of my life!
Alum,5,"Being a purple knight at the University of Bridgeport was a true blessing in every way. Not only did I learn so much being a psychology major in all my classes but socially I grew. I met my friends who I know will last a lifetime and built relationships with faculty and staff! Also, the campus is beautiful!"
Alum,5,I love the teachers and classes. The area is beautiful. You're near a park which you can walk around and feel the nice breeze. They have great activities. Their martial arts are great. I wouldn't change anything.
Freshman,5,"The university of Bridgeport offers an array of majors for young educated and well driven students from political science all the way to journalism. No only hat bu it offers financial aid. Including Fafsa and grants, for example the pell grant."
Sophomore,5,I had a great experience at the UB financial aid office. People were willing to help me with a smile and took the time to review my financial situation.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman this year and the school is great. I am an accounting major and the professors are fantastic. The are always there after class to help you if you have any problems. The student life is great. It's not crazy but there is always something fun to do in campus I strongly recommend this school for a great and fun college experience
Niche User,5,"I am committed to the University of Bridgeport and I have all positive comments about the University. The community at Bridgeport is 100% diverse having nationalities represented from all over the world. The ""party scene"" is low but the amount of safety of campus is high. The athletics at Bridgeport have winning as well as highly national ranked teams with coaches who always have their athletes best interests in mind. Student Life from what I have experienced on visits is safe, welcoming and enjoyable with several things to do as well as wonderful surrounding areas."
Graduate Student,5,I attended University of Bridgeport for my Masters in Elementary Education. The professors are extremely knowledgeable. Staff is helpful with whatever you need. Honestly had such an amazing experience all around. I definitely recommend this University.
Freshman,5,"It is very diverse, there are so many things to do around here and the classes are very easy. The campus isn't too large or too small but you're able to know where everything is."
Freshman,5,"I might not know as much considering I will be a freshman this upcoming Fall semester, but I did receive a lot of inside scoop from current students and alumni's about campus. Security on campus is AMAZING; my favorite part by far. The faculty all work with you in planning out a successful 4 yrs"
Freshman,5,my overall experience with the school has been great in a way that I've been able to meet tons of people from around the world.
Niche User,5,"University of Bridgeport is an amazing school! They have an amazing campus right next to the ocean! There are many sports and clubs that students can join. The dorms/housing are very clean and have amazing views. You can fin many great places to eat on campus. University of Bridgeport is very diverse. There is many students with many different cultures who go to this school! Students on campus are very friendly. If you need directions just ask one of he many wonderful students on campus. The safety on campus is taken very seriously! They care about there students safety very much. There is campus police, who make sure all students are safe!"
Senior,5,This is my 4th year and the university of Bridgeport and i love the school and the experience it has provided for me. I was apart of the ideal program which allowed me to work and be a parent as well as take classes later in the day and online. I am extremely happy i went back to school and was able to give my all and perform well.
Junior,5,"It is an amazing college. The University of Bridgeport built the new dormitory and is currently planning to build the new  gym. I think professors are nice and they teach well. Since this school has many different races, there is no racism in here. Students are nice to meet and easy to be friend."
Sophomore,5,"This school is exactly what I was expecting it to be. I had been on the tour a few times and got the perspective of several different student ambassadors. The faculty and staff are all great from what I have experienced. I don't see a problem with any of the food, although others would probably disagree. It is a very diverse school with many different countries represented. The dorms aren't terrible. I live in Seeley and the only thing that sucks is no air conditioning. Have an open mind and participate in the different activities they have to offer."
Niche User,5,I was very impressed with the facilities they were very nice and clean.  The campus was small and it felt very comfortable
Junior,5,"University of Bridgeport is an excellent University, I would recommend to anyone. It is very credible and have a lot of resources for the students to use. the Professors are very helpful, they make you understand something when you seems lost, they are available via phone call, emails, Skype you name it there is always a way to reach out to them. The library is very useful not to mention the workers always willing to help, the campus is to die for, so beautiful. I love going to school here."
College Senior,5,I have not encounter a baby experience with the staff at my school everyone is good at what there do
College Senior,5,I feel very safe going to school here. Every time I turn around there is security around so it really cracks down and makes sure that nothing happens.
College Freshman,5,One of the most diverse schools I've visited
College Freshman,5,My field is very good for attracting internships
College Freshman,5,professors are very helpful and engaging
College Freshman,5,Security is very effective and understanding
College Freshman,5,I love my residence hall and the community inside
College Sophomore,5,I am currently within the top 20% of my class and I believe that is because of the wonderful professors that work so diligently at my school.  Classes are small which allows a personal teaching style and makes it easy to ask questions as the lecture rolls.
College Sophomore,5,"Because dental hygiene began at the Fones School at University of Bridgeport, my B.S will be very valuable and lucrative for me after I graduate. The program is highly respected, and I'm told job placement is very high."
College Freshman,5,"i absolutely love the school, the classes being small, the wonderful teachers, the educational labs and wonderful campus life. I love it all"
College Sophomore,5,I plan on pledging soon
College Freshman,5,"This school is amazing, everybody is so nice and caring and welcomed me with opened arms."
College Senior,5,I feel very comfortable walking around campus. There are always police officers and security keeping us safe.
College Senior,5,Athletics are a big part of campus. UB students take lots of pride in their school.
College Senior,5,"I have never had such a great experience at a university. From the second I applied, I felt welcome and I felt like I had all the support I needed."
College Sophomore,5,I see security everytime I leave my building
College Sophomore,5,dorming is the best option to meet friends.
College Sophomore,5,my school has local trips for the student body regularly.
College Sophomore,5,"The security team is very friendly and approachable. They're are on campus 24/7 patrolling around on bikes and cars being very visible even at night. Also, in the dorms there is a security guard at the front desk when entering residence halls from 6pm-6am every night. Knowing that they are there allows me to sleep well and in comfort at night."
Alum,4,"I liked going to this school, I didn't want to travel far or stay on campus and it was one of the only schools at the time near me that offered the field I was looking to study in."
Senior,4,My online experience was great! The professors always responded quickly and were very helpful. If there was a problem they always understood and allowed more time for assignments
Senior,4,"When looking at colleges, I knew I wanted to stay local. UB was great at helping me decide and the counselors and financial aid office was very helpful. I like how the classroom sizes aren’t huge and all the professors are so kind. One thing I would change about UB is the tuition. Every year it seems to get more expensive"
Junior,4,"UB is a decent school . I am a transfer student but I am from Bridgeport where the school is located.Although I do prefer being in Florida at my previous school, the University of Bridgeport provides me a cheaper alternative.The people around me I know due to living in the same neighborhoods and attending some of the same schools."
Freshman,4,"The University of Bridgeport is an excellent intuition. The facilities, Professors, are qualified and easily understandable. The only unfortunate thing about the university is its location."
Junior,4,Really great school environment! Professors are very helpful and insightful. They help you understand the topics with clear and thorough notes
Freshman,4,"My first two semesters were a great experience! There are many opportunities to be involved with the community and the teachers that I had so far cared so much about their subjects. They are willing to work with you as long as they recognize you are willing to put in the effort. The dorms are the biggest I have seen compared to other schools I have traveled too. The food could be better and I wish all dorms would have A/C, but the view of the seaside is gorgeous."
Senior,4,I like that the university is diverse and how they try to help you with academic by helping you pick out the classes you need to graduate. The only thing I think that should change is the food. They should have more variety for people who are eating the food. Also the hub should have some new food in there also.
Alum,4,"Focus on research and development to be strengthened.
Safety in and around the campus to be focused."
Freshman,4,"What I like the most about the University of Bridgeport is the diversity and how everyone here is very nice and everyone can get along with each other very well. What I would like to see change is the cost of going to the University of Bridgeport. I believe if the cost is not as much as it is, no one would have any problems in paying their debt."
Freshman,4,So far I am really liking my experience here at the University of Bridgeport. I really like my professors and the overall environment here!
Freshman,4,University of Bridgeport has a lot to offer. From academics to athletics it will give you the experience of a lifetime! their is a lot of diversity and all different kinds of people.
Sophomore,4,"The beach near campus is really nice. There is a lot of work, but the classes are enjoyable. There is a variety of food from different cultures. The campus is very diverse, there are many international students. The dorms arent that great. The campus is starting to refurbish with new equiptment and activities."
Sophomore,4,"What I mostly liked about the University are the people. I have met some of the most genuine people on campus. What this school lacks is activities. As a commuter I feel like I am missing out on the college experience. I feel like more activities would help,"
Junior,4,"UB faculty really help promote opportunities to the student body. I like that study abroad is very supported and encouraged. Also, it is easy to start your own club, and make your own opportunities on campus. Students are generally kind and diverse. The location definitely needs a revamp, but I do see construction happening on campus often, and pretty quickly. Funds should be allocated to the dorms and food to ensure better on-campus life."
Junior,4,"The University of Bridgeport is overall a great school, however, the dining options are horrible and close proximity to the South End of Bridgeport prevent any fun things on the immediate location off-campus from happening."
Sophomore,4,"University of Bridgeport is very diverse and has a lot of campus activities going on. Although I would like more indoor activities. The professors for the IPED major are great, easy to talk to, friendly and can be easily reached out too. I am not a huge fan of the Computer Science faculty so far.
Students around here take time to socialize but are very helpful if asked anything about the campus or for any help."
Niche User,4,I really loved how the professor for my major (psychology) is so passionate about it. The way she describes the course gets me so excited. The campus overall is very safe. The school is big but not so big that everything is pretty much walking distance to your classes or if you want food.
Sophomore,4,"I like the school, started my freshman year and met plenty of people. School spirit is a thing but if you want to stay by yourself definitely an option as well no one will bother you. Theirs always something on, from sports events to free school events like concerts , fairs, and job fairs plus way more on the school event calendar. Little pricey but aside that you are getting your moneys worth as long as you go to class. Party scene is pretty good, not  a dry campus. Only thing I would change is probably the food and update the dorms a little."
Freshman,4,The university of Bridgeport is a great school.  I love the diversity of campus it make me feel welcome. The Professor at this campus treat us with respect and want us to succeed. Also I love the view from my dorm room of the park and beach. The sunset is beautiful.
Freshman,4,"Well, I’m still attending this school. I really like the campus. I’m really big on greenery as I find it relaxing."
Niche User,4,I like University of Bridgeport for its academic outstanding perfomance.I love to become one of the students this year.The certificate is internationally recognized.Kudos to the management of the institution.
Freshman,4,This school is so good. I'm a bit nervous about the next 3 years since their tuition and overall cost of attendance goes up.
Sophomore,4,One of the most intricate things about the University is there diversity. On campus you see people from all walks of life. The Professors are very supportive in and out of the classroom which makes for a comfortable learning environment for higher Education.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Bridgeport is a very average school at best. They do offer wonderful programs to students as to further your careers. The academics are average at best as well as the professors. Its a smaller setting so if your into that then this school is for you. As for dorms when it come to the older ones Barnum, Seeley, Cooper, Chafee, and Bodine. Don't expect too much, its communal bathrooms on each floor the rooms are livable and cozy.  Campus can be pretty but its in the poor part of Bridgeport/Park Ave and driving on Park Ave."
Freshman,4,So far my experience with this University is amazing.I love it here and there is not much to complain about. Academically all is well for me. One downside is that the math teacher I had was Russian and didn't speak English.My hall mates are horrible and don't respect quiet hours.The food is good but you get sick of it if you eat the exact things all the time.The walk from my dorm to the dining hall is literally too long even though we have a small campus.I generally stock  up on food to avoid walking.The bookstore is over priced.
Sophomore,4,"The most important aspect of any college experience is academics. We are there to grow personally, socially but most importantly to experience growth through education and knowledge. The student life needs a bit of improvement as a boost in campus social life would be great. The dorms need updating and tuition is also an issue, it’s expensive. The food however, can be really enjoyable depending on which food hall you are in, (for the most part it’s good.) The university is family like and will always feel at home, the professors are very well chosen and I’ve learned a lot during my time here."
Freshman,4,The professors are nice and are there to help you if you ask. There are many resources to support you with transitioning into a college student.
Sophomore,4,"University of Bridgeport is a great school. I had transferred there my spring semester of 2017. I liked it because Bridgeport helps motivate and grow as a person. the school is very diverse. I found who I am and where i would take my life after 4 years. The teachers were great and they helped a lot in terms of work, understanding and really adjusting to school and Bridgeport as a whole. the only thing i would change is the food because at times it was very funny tasting. but overall it is a great school and i loved everything about it."
Junior,4,"The University of Bridgeport is the most diverse school I have ever experienced so far in my life and this environment displays my dream for more diversity among future medical professionals. I don't think it is even possible for the University to be any more diverse. The university has an excellent campus security team and system to ensure the safety of the entire university body. However, the University has a lot of room for improvement in many other areas and I hope to see them grow."
Sophomore,4,"Although starting my second year of college, my first year was fairly good. There were moments that things were specified or could've been explained better, but it was good overall"
Niche User,4,The campus is very diverse. They have a nice party scene. The teams there are very exceptional. The dorms are a reasonable size. Everything is within walking distance and there are many stores nearby.
Junior,4,"Personally I love diversity and that's exactly what the University brings. The campus is close by Seaside Beach where it helps for some fresh air, exercise or entertainment for students. Academic wise, it isn't lenient which is a good thing and the professors seem to have the exact expertise in the course which really helps. There are awesome events with free food and the private university does reach up to its expectations. A change would be the marina food. Upgrade it."
Sophomore,4,The university of Bridgeport is a diverse college. All the students and professors are very kind and help each other to succeed.
Freshman,4,"The campus definitely feels safe, especially with the PALs that they hand out in the beginning of the year - which you press and security knows where you are and they go to your location.  Outside of the campus, I haven't really been, but they do have shuttles that take you places, which is a huge help. The academics are good, they have a variety and unique choices of majors and the languages one can learn are amazing. The classes are mostly small sized, but there are few classes that will have a good amount of students. The food here is good. The dorms are nice. I haven't really seen a party scene - probably because I'm not too into those types of scenes, but there are parties happening and it's not dull here. The clubs are interesting and fasnicating, though I wish they had better clubs, but it's okay. Overall, it's a nice college. "
College Senior,4,The school is there for the student and offer wide range of help for student to remain health and stress free
College Senior,4,Everyone has great school spirit and everyone participates in rallies and goes to games.
College Senior,4,"I absolutely love my school. The only draw back is I live in Norwalk and work in Stamford. The commute is killer sometimes. I began going to school at UB because it offered classes in Stamford at their Stamford campus. Unfortunately, they discontinued classes there so I am forced to go to Bridgeport or switch schools."
College Senior,4,"My experience so far at the University of Bridgeport has been a journey. I say that because when I first got there my freshman year, I did not have much faith in my ability to do well in college. It was a different environment and I knew I would have to live independently. If I had to do it all over I would still choose UB because it helped me grow mentally, emotionally, and academically. The professors there definitely saw the potential in me that I didn't see in myself and pushed me to be the honor student I am today. My favorite experience there so far has to be getting the email saying I made it into the Honors program because of my outstanding academic achievements. This school is full of diversity and new experiences for all students. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to attend college."
College Freshman,4,I like Greek life although I am not part of it
College Freshman,4,Personally I am not athletic but it is very good
College Freshman,4,I love the students and the atmosphere of the area
College Sophomore,4,From my understanding UB offers wonderful internship options to their students!  I begin mine this semester and I am really looking forward to it.
College Sophomore,4,"University of Bridgeport is located in the south end of one of Connecticut's largest cities.  That being said, crime ratings in the city are relatively high.  Although crime in the city is a common occurrence, crime on campus is extremely rare.  To my knowledge only minor crimes have taken place last semester (underage drinking).  Security is scattered around campus on every corner 24 hours a day.  I feel safe enough to walk around campus alone no matter the hour."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a student at the University of Bridgeport has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had.  Professors are amazing, educated in their field, and truly try their best to know each student (thanks to the small class sizes).   UB offers so many opportunities from events to internships.  I am without a doubt, a proud and enthusiastic Purple Knight!"
College Freshman,4,I love the fact that they internships helps me network and build myself
College Freshman,4,They have this thing called PAL and i think thats a good thing for security purposes
College Freshman,4,So far meeting the teachers and faculty has been a great experience. They have been very helpful and encouraging.
College Sophomore,4,UB is the place I want to be for the next three year's
College Sophomore,4,Security takes safety very serious with the students
College Sophomore,4,"I live in Cooper and so far it has been great. But one problem I have is the lack of more washers and dryers in that build, there is one of each on each floor."
College Sophomore,4,So far it has been great. Everyone is friendly and very approachable. The campus is very clean and easy to get around. The resources available to the students and faculty are of the highest quality.
College Senior,4,"I love my school and would not change a thing about it. From the professors to the administrators, I have nothing but great experiences."
College Sophomore,4,I only had trouble with one professor who seemed very inexperienced in the course she was teaching
College Sophomore,4,a few of our teams are popular
College Sophomore,4,I had professors in multiple courses that really wanted me to exceed and reach my goal of an A. Other teachers that taught a required general course who also taught a bigger class did not help me as much in the way that I would have liked therefore I did not reach my goals.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic staff and teams are close knit. For Instance the Women's Soccer Team was advancing in playoffs and all the other athletic teams participated in a video to wish them luck. Also, coaches always encourage the team to watch other athletic events, and do activities created for athletes such as athletes workshop or health day."
College Sophomore,4,"Being on the softball team for the University of Bridgeport allowed me to find family in just the first days I arrived on campus. I love my team and would not trade it in for anything, and I am so excited to see what next year bring us. Playing and representing my school is a great opportunity and privilege. In our school's conference, the University of Bridgeport are the only Connecticut team while all of our components are from New York. This allowed me to have great experiences and see other parts of Connecticut and New York instead of just being stuck on campus."
College Junior,4,"Though i live off-campus but i do visit friends who resides on campus. The rooms are spacious. The bathrooms and toilets are clean and also spacious. The social amenities are of great standard, which helps the students to connect and bond with each other. The cost is relatively cheap. it range from $6000 to $9000 depending on the amenities provided. The process of housing process is easy as students do not go through difficulty in securing one."
College Junior,4,"i believe there is a great security presence in my school which helps to create a sense of safety on school campus. Every student is allocated an electronic security token, which when pressed send a instant signal to security officials. This leads the security officials to where the student/victim is. There are also the presence of the police officers and their patrol cars on campus throughout the day. i feel safe on campus."
Alum,2,Dental hygiene program has racist students and nothing is done about their racist antics. The school often messes up when it comes to financial aid.
Senior,2,"I took one online class as I prefer the classroom. It was okay, my experience was similar to other online classes at other schools."
Junior,2,"The University of Bridgeport is an excellent return of investment as the academic programs are superior. Financial aid and grants are generous here and the tuition at UB is much lower than comparable universities.   Safety is a priority on campus, as UB was ranked the safest college campus in Connecticut in 2018. UB is a friendly campus and very diverse. However, there are many negative aspects to UB. The food available to students is horrendous and many compare it to “prison food.” Repeats of the same meal are often seen for an entire week. Housing accommodations are lackluster unless you dorm in University Hall.  The party scene is nonexistent here, but Fairfield and New Haven are a few miles away. To end on a good note, UB has many clubs and organizations to offer for students and we have a bowling alley!"
Freshman,2,The orientation leaders made it seem very welcoming and fun. But a few months in and this school is boring. There’s literally nothing to do on campus. The student activities all take place during the week when people have classes so it’s hard to attend. On the weekends there’s nothing to do. Everyone who lives close leaves for the weekend. There’s never a lot of parties.The dorm rooms suck. The food sucked besides the salad bar .The clubs are decent some of them are completely unorganized. Making friends here is not as easy.The professors are wonderful and are very helpful. I wish I would’ve chose a school closer to home.
Works Here,2,Advising is not the strong suit of University of Bridgeport. Even though you get assigned a direct advisor you're better off going to academic advising services. Residential life is unorganized. Overall there are good people there but for every person that cares there are about three who are just there for a pay check.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do on campus.
College Freshman,2,Not very good. No grounded place off campus either except the soccer house.
College Freshman,2,"Boring, this is not a major hub for partying. Think about this, NYC is an hour and a half away. Providence the same in the other direction and Boston 2 1/2 hours away."
College Freshman,2,"Drinking is a given in college but the weed here is chronic. (Pun Intended) Weed is decriminalized in Connecticut yet its still against school rules to have it on campus. If you want to, just be smart because a lot of people get kicked out because of it."
College Freshman,2,"Many are Divine Nine so you have you AKA's Kappas, Ques, Deltas, and Poodles. There are two Latin greeks but that's about it."
College Freshman,2,"D2, nothing special. Good Womens Soccer and basketball."
College Freshman,2,"Not what i thought it was gonna be. room fairly small. no A/C, sometimes the showers clogg and expected more."
College Freshman,2,"Once my friends and I were by the beach and a car kept chasing us so once we got back on campus we pressed our PAL which is supposed to alert campus security. We waited a long while after before security even showed up. Not to mention they WALKED over to us. Ultimately, they were no help. It's as though campus security is a joke."
College Freshman,2,"My school isn't a place I plan on staying for the next four years. When I am here I feel trapped, I feel like the school is just filled with a bunch of people who chose to settle, and don't really care how far they get. The classes themselves are very good as long as you pay attention. However, the people to me are what add to the downside. People are immature, and seem to not have their priorities in order. Also, the clubs don't seem to actually ever take place."
College Freshman,2,I don't really enjoy the marina. It cost a lot and the food isn't really that great. Its like quantity but no quality. I started going to the university deli down the street from campus and their food is better than most of the food on campus. And its for a good price.
College Freshman,2,"they suck. nothing targets main spots like abs and such, all cardio or lifting and there is not enough space. The sauna pool and steam room are great"
College Freshman,2,There should be a better option of off-campus housing since campus is isolated anyways.. they should also make them look better
College Freshman,2,"Bodine is too small and closed in. The rooms are falling apart, some beds are bigger than others and the water is cold in the morning, The kitchen is always dirty and there should be more washers/dryers. It overall needs a complete reconstruction"
College Sophomore,2,They don't care about anything..
College Sophomore,2,Gives me stomach aches all of the time. Don't bother getting a meal plan. The dining dollars don't even cross over.
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is okay but I don't recommend it.. For the amount of money that it costs to dorm, I don't recommend it. Especially if you get placed into Bodine, the all freshman dorm, or Barnum. The school is full of people who rob your stuff. Do not trust anyone.."
College Freshman,2,i had a complete headache but i dont want to leave bridgeport because its a good experience for me and i like it here
College Sophomore,2,"I don't live on campus, but my friends do. The rooms are small, they smell musty, and its old theres no self expression in the halls or rooms."
College Sophomore,2,the immediate surrounding area is bad but once you venture farther out it isnt.
College Junior,2,"Need watch out for yourself, area is know for lots of thefts and robberies. Not safe at night, need a buddy or two if walking around or getting to your car. School is good so if you want the education you must suck it up."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I go to school in Bridgeport, CT and it is not the greatest/safest area to be in if you are not on campus. Our campus though, is right on the Long Island sounds so every morning when I was a freshman I was able to leave my residence hall and see the water and in the distance was able to see Long Island! We also have a nice beach area and a nice walk along the water! There is public transportation, which we have a free pass for the bus with our student ID. The busses literally go everywhere which is great if you do not have a car on campus. I just highly suggest traveling with a friend. I am a small blonde, nice girl and I will be honest, I didn't always feel safe. 

Downtown Bridgeport is decently nice and we have a train station right by campus so you can be in NYC within an  hour! I loved that my freshman year. Our city is surrounded by nicer towns like Fairfield which is great to go out to eat our just a walk in a nice town. Our campus is a few blocks away from an arena where a lot of concert and sports event happen so that is pretty cool. We are also next to the Bluefish Baseball stadium and they hold events as well. 

This school was not the picture perfect school I imagined, but now I can't picture myself anywhere else. You learn to love the campus and the people you're surrounded with are amazing!"
College Junior,2,the area is not safe to live especially with kids.
College Sophomore,2,its a bit of distance since the area is broken up by the poorly place highway system
College Sophomore,2,if your not absolutely poor and smart or a super star athlete you hardly get enough to cover what really needs to be covererd
College Senior,2,The housing in the area of the waterfront in general are neglected.  Remodeling is a necessary tool to generate more students and higher quality of life.  The majority of students that live on campus seem to be international students.
College Senior,2,"The water front property in Bridgeport is historically toxic due to over pollution from industrial waste in the area.  The gentrification is evident in the type of industry within the city.  The off-campus housing is expensive due to  a variety of reasons.  For example the high taxes the city pays due to large government funding which has been historically exploited by corrupt politicians that manipulate gaps in legislation therefore continuing the cycle of  high taxes.  Although in the immediate area of the university of Bridgeport seems somewhat o.k. to the naked eye, slum lords and poverty is a major issue in the demographic area."
College Sophomore,2,The shuttle has the worst running hours. There needs to be more than one shuttle running at a time. The bus is always late which makes it difficult to get to class on time.
College Sophomore,2,Most students take some form of drugs but it isn't anything crazy such as cocaine.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't live on campus but from what I know, there isn't much of a nightlife at school."
College Freshman,2,nothing but papa johns  or dominos is open past 11 pm. There are other nice places to go but you need to take a bus or car to them.
College Junior,2,The school is in a bad area and safety in a huge concern.
College Junior,2,The only thing I like about the city is the hockey team. The city is unsafe and dirty.
College Junior,2,I've heard that the rooms are extremely small and smell like cheap beer.
College Junior,2,"I don't live on campus and the surrounding area is pretty bad so I would be careful of where I went at night. The Sound Tigers are close by, so there are hockey games and other events there on occasion but I would be extremely cautious about walking any where near campus at night."
College Junior,2,I attended a different school for my undergrad and have gone to sporting events at many other universities. The teams are better than I expected by the feel on campus is very strange. It seems like no one really wants to be there. Most people live off campus I think and have no desire to make an extra trip in (I know I don't).
College Freshman,2,in the hood.campus is fairly nice though and nothing happens here clean.
College Freshman,2,"Everything closes early,often you end up starving at night because the few places that stay open close at 2 in the morning. Could be way more variety of food options close to campus that stay open later,and wasn't so much of fatening fast food."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot goes on on campus, parties are fun until they get shut down. Party locations are inconvenient sometimes because they are far for people who don't own cars, plus there's no bus or train transpitation after 11:30."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a lot of places. Most places are far.
College Sophomore,2,Not a nice place to live. 
College Sophomore,2,Its cold and snows in the winter otherwise ok. 
College Sophomore,2,"Everybody that eats there hates it, even some of the professors hate it."
College Sophomore,2,"The Athletics at University of Bridgeport is ok. The school is not focused on sports, the school is more of a academic school."
College Sophomore,2,"Its not really that diverse, I am from New York where I am used to every race in my class. Now i only have 2 races over populating the school."
College Junior,2,The only way to get around Bridgeport is by bus or car. There's nothing really close to the campus and the bus schedule isn't that great.
College Freshman,2,City Buses never are on time. Run 1 to 2 minutes late. On campus buses come 1-2 minutes earlier than scheduled.
College Freshman,2,There's nothing to do in Bridgeport. The nearby cities offer attractions like malls and bowling alleys. I enjoyed the food from one Italian place called Nino's.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is lacking a lot of high academic performances, as well a a lack of school spirit. And also the school would be a lot better if they informed the students about the beneficial factors they could get."
College Freshman,2,they say that they are strict but it's not that serious.
College Freshman,2,"There are two different malls that the shuttle will bring you do. There isn't a lot to do in Bridgeport itself but the surrounding towns a few exits away people go out for ice cream, to bars and parties, but around campus is not that safe to go walking down the street."
College Freshman,2,There is many dining options but it gets difficult if you do not drive.
College Junior,2,There is really not a whole lot of nightlife at UB. There a few 18 and older clubs but I don't frequent them regularly
College Junior,2,I do not enjoy being on campus at the University of Bridgeport because a lot of people are unfriendly.
College Junior,2,alot of the people here are rude and have alot of drama but once you find the right croud you wont even pay attention to those negative people. they are mostly from urban areas in new york so of coarse there is alot of rude new yorkers and people from jersey.
College Junior,2,"Not Much Offered – Although I received a decent amount of financial aid, the process was confusing and unorganized."
Sophomore,1,"I hated my online experience, I was better off staying on campus and learning but obviously I could not so I had to make do with my resources. Also one of my professors stopped teaching because she got severely sick."
Senior,1,"Never have I ever wanted to graduate and leave from some place so bad. The staff here in almost every single department like financial aid, registrar, security or even the workers in the cafe are absolutely disrespect. They do not know how to talk to children because really the age group of a college student rages from 17-24. Which is considered adolescents or should I say young adults rather. So they basically don't know how to talk to or treat students that go here. I can honestly say their customer service is so bad. Also I think they've been over charging and scamming their student in order to delay the time that they are actually supposed to graduate. So that they can get more money out of them, it is unbelievable.   "
College Sophomore,1,I have literally only heard about Greek life once...and it was by accident. The Greeks don't seem to do much and I don't see much interest in it.
College Freshman,1,"It's as if Greek life barely exists. Yeah there are parties, but people often talk about how bad they were. You don't even really get to see Greek life on campus. You only hear them at odds hours of the night yelling and dancing in the quad."
College Sophomore,1,"i did not like attending the university of Bridgeport. I had the worst time there. The school is located in a dangerous neighborhood, and the dorms were so disgusting and just so nasty. I did not feel comfortamble staying there at all. I was so excited to transfer out of that garbage university. Plus the food is disgusting, I felt like I was living in jail or something staying there, they kept feeding us the same garabage everyday. I can not even recall how many times I had gotton food poisoning from there. Just one bad mistake going to the university of bridgeport."
College Freshman,1,Nothing available besides fast food places
College Sophomore,1,"They are charging me for nothing. Don't go here, save yourself."
College Sophomore,1,"All of the ""parties"" are for African dancing.. If you can't wine, or dance to Caribbean music, don't bother going."
College Sophomore,1,When it snows it is very difficult to get to school because as a commuter sometimes the bus does not run.
College Sophomore,1,The food is terrible There aren't enough options to choose from.
College Sophomore,1,"From what I know, the Greek life at UB isn't what it is supposed to be at all. People I know who have joined say that they easily became a member and that was it."
College Sophomore,1,They should improve on the people who work with the students in the financial aid office. The people that are there now do very little to help a student that is in need.
College Junior,1,"The people working in the financial aid department take forever to get back to you, are constantly giving you the run around, making mistakes in their advising, and basically just don't care. Out of all the people I've come in contact with was any help whatsoever. It really is a shame."
College Sophomore,1,The graduate dorms at University of Bridgeport are not very nice looking. They are old and outdated. The building maintenance is poor and not very well taken care of.
College Sophomore,1,You will find in the school many foreign students who come from other parts of the world to play a sport. Some are good looking while others are average. i feel as if it came to looks for both boys and girls the percentage of actually attractive people would be 20%.
College Sophomore,1,I personally believe the school is to over priced. Others school over twice as more as what Bridgeport does for a cheaper cost. So when it comes down to scholarships I think it is best that students receive a good decent amount of aid. Especially for such a high cost school that is not worth it for all.
College Sophomore,1,You have to get there 1 hour prior to class to find a decent parking spot. you cant even get a parking spot n campus when school is not in session.
Recent Alumnus,1,I had a technophob who taught an online class.Heard other prof are better.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm sorry to say, but living here is like living in the projects in your own community. It may look wonderful on the outside, but it's not on the inside. As the rooms are a small square box, and may have to share with a roommate. The price you pay is not worth it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The campus is located in Bridgeport, Connecticut in a section of town that is unattractive and poverty stricken. It is frightening day and night to travel in this area. It is notorious as being the number one city of violence and crime. Walking from the bus station to the college is unsafe and it is told by the people in charge at the bus and train station. They suggest to take a cab or catch a bus that goes directly to the campus."

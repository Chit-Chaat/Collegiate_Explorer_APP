Alum,5,I did not take any classes online. I was a stem major and National Science Foundation scholar  with many labs.
Alum,5,Encouraged excellence in all areas of life. The very nurturing relationship with instructors was commendable. The number of “ firsts” that the school accomplished and the historical significance was inspiring. Leadership was something one absorbed through osmosis.
Sophomore,5,"The second semester of Freshman year, we were moved to finish our classes online from home.  The professors that I had, they were very helpful with answering questions and responding to emails."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at the Illustrious Fisk University has been nothing but amazing. When I first stepped on campus, I was instantly welcomed with opens arms and a smile. All my life, I've been struggling to fit in because of my race and I finally found a school who accepts me for me. Being a student there means everything to me because the school is very strong on family orientation and they have succeeded in that. Fisk University feels like a home away from home and the faculty, staff, professors, and upperclassmen make feel as if I belong there. One great thing about Fisk is that you can create a close bond with your professors and are willing to go through challenges to help you and see you succeed. I don't wish to change anything because everything is perfect for me. I found a family, I've made life-long friends, and I have a home. Fisk now, Fisk forever!"
Sophomore,5,"Online classes can be a challenge since you don't have to get out of bed a go to class. When taking online classes, you don't really have to motivation to open your laptop and work on your assignment as soon as it's uploaded. I, personally, am not a fan them but you have to make due with some things in life. One good thing I can say about my online learning experience is that it motivates me to work harder because my professor isn't in front of me, so that means that I have to figure most things out for myself. I have said that so many times, that it has become a life lesson. Your lack of motivation should even motivate you even more. Not all online classes are difficult; some are fairly easy. So, don't be afraid to take online classes because you are the only person who can tell you what you can and cannot do."
Niche User,5,Fisk University felt like a home away from home. Everyone was very welcoming and the atmosphere was family-friendly.
Sophomore,5,My online learning was somewhat better than being face to face. With online classes professors answer their emails faster and better at communicating. I can go at my pace and look up stuff to help me. It made my Sceduel a little better as well for me.
Niche User,5,"Fisk is the right size college, it is not too small or too big. They offer scholarships for many different sports and clubs."
Freshman,5,Fisk university is a small and very family orientated school. The professors are very close with their students and be sure to check in on them when they miss class.
Freshman,5,"Fisk is truly like a family. Fiskites take time to greet each other and hold conversations with you. They check on you and look out for you to make sure you are taken care of. Professors and coaches act as surrogate parents to keep you on the right track.  The outside of the campus is well kept and very neat.  
What I would change at Fisk is build new dorms. The dorms are outdated and need to be renovated. Floors and restrooms need to be redone and the entire inside of the building needs to be painted."
Freshman,5,"Fisk University is a Historically Black College University. After spending one whole academic year, I have come to have a very pleasant experience. The academics were fantastic, the material was exposed to me at a nice pace where I felt like it was not rushed, and fast enough for me not to get bored. The professors aided in this process of how efficient the learning material was. Being a historically black college there is not much diversity as it is 95 percent African Americans. Having a total student population of less than 1000 makes for student life to be fun. Going to Fisk is always like having an extended family gathering because that is how close you feel to the other students because you see them everyday. Fisk is located just 5 minutes from Downtown Nashville with an abundance of activities for students to get involved in. It is a glorious school which I am blessed to attend."
Junior,5,"My best experience at Fisk University was the spirit walk. The spirit walk is a bonding moment for the incoming freshman class. They are to close their eyes, holds hands, and walk around campus. During the walk, the students are singing the school's alma mater.This is a symbol of sticking together and never breaking the strong bond that is made."
Niche User,5,"I loved Fisk when I went to visit everyone was for certain they made the right choice about choosing Fisk. The students have a saying at the school “I didn’t choose Fisk, Fisk choose me” and I believe that the saying is true fisk stood out to me out of all the other schools I applied for and visited. The Campus is real small therefore students get one on one time with their professor. Also Fisk is a HBCU and holds very important history for Nashville and its black community. Therefore Fisk gets all five stars because it's an amazing university."
Niche User,5,"I went on a college tour here and it was beautiful. We went into the Jubelee hall, and we learned all about the Jubelee singers, and sacred stairs. Tour guides were very nice. I loved it !!!"
Niche User,5,"when i went on a college tour of Fisk university it felt like home. Also, at Fisk they provided the major i want to pursue for my future career."
Alum,5,I am a daughter ever on the altar.  FIsk university has been educating black minds for 150 years.  I am proud to call myself a Fiskiste.  I had two cousins go to the school also.  Fisk is a family legacy school.  We believe in the talented tenth.  We are the hopes and the dreams of the enslaved.
Junior,5,Fisk University is a wonderful school. It is small and confined that everyone knows each other and has some type of relationship with one another. Everyone at Fisk seems to work as a family. Every family has a combination of personalities and attitudes and majority of the campus knows how to mix in well. There were never any bad stories being told to me before I arrived as a freshman and I still have not heard nor witnessed anything bad about Fisk. The education department here is fantastic and it keeps someone challenged and focused.
Sophomore,5,Very close-knit and friendly. Amazing teachers and people doing great things. So many people stop and talk to you and are very helpful. It’s hard to feel alone here. Like any schoo there’s occasional drama.
Junior,5,"Fisk has been amazing to me. Ever since I was younger Fisk was all I knew, being that my mother attended and graduated from the university back in 2000. When i first got to Fisk I didn't really like it being that it was really traditional and wasn't really modern. However it grows on you. You grow to appreciate the connections you gain from the teachers and students, and how everyone wants whats best for you no matter if they know you or not. Fisk is my family away from home and I love and appreciate all they've done for me thus far."
Senior,5,"Fisk universtiy is a loving HBCU that i would recommend to every student  I come across. they have great teachers that love assisting you and their every step of the way. being at all Black college has shown the the culture of this University and what it stands for as a whole. i say the only thing Fisk should improve on is making the excellence of the school, more excellent. they can only get better."
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on campus. We have automatic locking doors and security out at all times.
College Freshman,5,Small class sizes and wonderfully staff.
College Sophomore,5,"Before attending Fisk, a friend of mine would always tell me about Greek life, but I never took it serious. Once I witnessed it for myself, it made me want to be involved. It's truly amazing."
College Junior,5,Lots of people from all over the world. Be involved and get to know them all. Always good points of conversation.
College Junior,5,Our academics are top notch for those who choose to participate and do well. There are countless opportunities to grow and thrive if you put the time in them. They can be challenging but you can handle it with time and preparation.
College Junior,5,"If you speak to the right people, there are lots of opportunities and internships. When people see a degree from Fisk,, or you tell them you attend or went to Fisk,  it is well known. Fisk is a very valued educational experience, and others envy the experience we get. I highly recommend it and I enjoy it."
College Junior,5,"There are classes for almost anythign taht you are interested in. There are soem things that we do not offer, and that can turn people away at times, but if Fisk offers what you are looking for, it is a great place. It is wonderful and I enjoy the classes and the professors very much."
College Sophomore,5,"Despite minor problems, Fisk is one of the greatest institutions out here!"
College Junior,5,Fisk is very underestimated. You won't know the greatest of Fisk unless your matriculating through it.
College Junior,5,My experiences with the professors have been great.  Professors I had freshman year I still keep in contact with and they always help me out any way that they can.  The classes are a small size which is great because the orofessor is more hands on woth their students. I never felt once that a professor ever wanted me to fail.
College Junior,5,"I love the Greek life at Fisk 	University.   They all do a lot of community service as well as have numerous parties and barbecues for non-greekers to enjoy.  On campus, there are the divine nine as well as others.  Some of these greeks are Alphas, AKA's, Q's, Deltas, Sigmas, and more."
College Freshman,5,One of the best things on campus.
College Freshman,5,The best place to have that family feel.
College Junior,5,Our career center helps alll students all the time
College Sophomore,5,I love my school. My experience has been awesome and the faculty and staff have been very kind to me as well. I am glad that I chose to go to Fisk University.
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy that the school is an HBCU, yet it is small enough where you can get to know every face there. Also I love the energy of the school and the curriculum."
College Freshman,5,I have never experienced anything like this so far but i love it .
College Freshman,5,The best parties hands down are Vanderbilt and TSU. Fisk University is strictly for Academics.
College Freshman,5,The school gives out a lot of money to their students if you have good grades.
College Senior,5,Financial aid is not hard to get at Fisk as long as you take care of everything on your end. The school is constantly working for students and giving them opportunities to receive scholarships on the daily. If there is ever any trouble all one has to do is call or go there in person and work it out. They lay everything out for you and will find the solution for you if they do not have it right away.
College Sophomore,5,Fisk grows you and teaches you much about life!
College Junior,5,"I interned at Lehigh University last summer. I learned so much about research ethics, more biochemical methods."
College Junior,5,My career goal is to be a medical researcher and a surgeon. A little bit
College Freshman,5,The workload is insanity but it teaches good work ethic and i enjoy it seeing as i was never challenged in highschool.
College Freshman,5,The academics is the best. Period.
College Freshman,5,A lot of diversity. Gives good lessons in tolerance.
College Freshman,5,"Nashville's amazing! There's every kind of restaurant, every kind of clothes outlet, everything! They have Thai food, Greek food, American food, Mexican food! There's a Kress, Walmart, Forever21! Nashville is the awesomest place to do anything you want. I just take a bus to West End or walk to West End."
College Freshman,5,BEST THING ABOUT FISK! They give you SO much and they actually care about you!
College Freshman,5,"Extremely rigorous. The coursework forces you to think and argue, at least in history anyway."
College Sophomore,5,West End has a variety of restaurants with a range of costs. Sonic is also down the street
College Sophomore,5,Fisk prepares numerous bio majors for med school
College Sophomore,5,Very few students have visible drug usage
College Freshman,5,"I love my HBCU! They really take the phrase ""it takes a village..."" to heart. Everyone is very supportive and caring. There really is a family atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,I love my major because there are a lot of interesting classes. The only downfall is that I can't access some of them until I get into my sophomore year. This may just be better for me since my workload is already quite large and I'm still adjusting to college life.
College Freshman,5,I LOVE SECURITY!! They really do care. There was a race at another nearby college and security immediately offered self defense classes.
College Freshman,5,"Greek Life is a HUGE thing here at Fisk University. Unlike what's shown in movies, the Greeks here are dignified a dyes, they do throw great parties."
Recent Alumnus,5,Diversity is distinct on campus!
College Freshman,5,"There's a definite family feel. Honestly the school is what you make of it, it's easy to focus on the negative but of you open yourself. Up to it, there are great connections to  be made"
College Freshman,5,"The downtown Nashville area is amazing and not out of reach at all. Being that we are located near Tennessee State University as well as Vanderbilt University, I would definitely say that we are in a college area.  "
College Freshman,5,For the most part everyone is really open. There's a real family feel around campus and because the school is. Small one everyone knows everyone's face and it's not unusual for someone that you don't really know to sit down and socialize with you
Niche User,4,"Our online system, Canvas, made taking online classes very easy. It sent us reminders on upcoming assignments and also sent email notifications."
Freshman,4,"There are a lot of things to look at when looking at Fisk University. Yes, there are many things that needs to be upgraded and put more thought into. Yes, I do feel like there are many things that need to be communicated better and well thought out when it comes to campus ideas and where are money goes too. However, I will say that coming to Fisk was an amazing experience for me and I learned a lot about myself and others while getting a great education in my study and major of Biology and getting the “Different World” family type feel. I met a lot of many great people here who later became my close friends and made our own fun since this is a smaller campus"
Sophomore,4,"Fisk has a family atmosphere. The professors know their students by name, and the classes are not very big. Everyone at the school is pretty friendly and students there get along well. Attending Fisk will give you an excellent Black school (HBCU) experience."
Freshman,4,"Fisk University has been a great experience so far and I have learned so much from the school. I have learned a lot from the professors and my peers, this is an experience that you just can not find anywhere, it is hard to come by. This school has made the transition from high school to college fairly easy.  Overall, Fisk University is a college that provides a genuine experience, great people, and a great academic experience."
Junior,4,"Being a first generation college student, choosing an HBCU was my main goal, however, Fisk University chose me. With the ""family"" environment and private campus, I am able to excel and grow beyond my own belief. Since my time at Fisk I have been selected for scholarship for the Women's basketball team. A student ambassador and I have joined the United States Army Reserves. Fisk has allowed me to open up and grow as a young woman. The growth and maturity that I have seen in myself within the past two years at the HBCU have exceeded my expectations, the connections I have made with my peers and professors have opened doors for myself that I never would've imagined growing up. Being a first generational college student I have faced so many obstacles and trials, yet being at this illustrious University, I have no doubt that I can, and I will be a successful black woman in the psychological field, and most importantly in life."
Freshman,4,"Fisk is a wonderful campus that captures a family atmopsphere. With that being said, families have many ups and downs, but in the end they are always there for each other. The biggest flaw of Fisk University, just like any family, is communication."
Alum,4,"I liked the small class sizes, historic value of the campus, and overall atmosphere on campus events- student organization/clubs , the Spring Arts Festival, and various campus events tailored toward life after graduation executed by the Office of Career Planning and Development."
Sophomore,4,I LIKED THAT THE PROFESSORS CARE ABOUT THE SUDENTS SUCCESS. I DO NOT LIKE THE OLD DORMS AND HORRIBLE FOOD.
Niche User,4,"Fisk University is, in my opinion, one of the best HBCUs out there. The campus is very social, the restaurants around are very good and the academics are top notch."
Freshman,4,The school is very welcoming. You won’t really have any problems here unless you like bigger spaces. The school is very small but everyone gets to know each other and makes you feel like family.
Niche User,4,I love that Fisk University is built on uplifting their students and helping them achieve their independent goals. Fisk University comes with open arms and love.
Freshman,4,"Fisk University is rich in history. It is up there with Howard University, Hampton, Spelman and Morehouse. It is slowly losing its appreciate but it is important for the students to keep that up and going. I would like to see the students become more involved to make Fisk like the 70's, 80's, and 90's Fisk that alumni use to talk about."
Freshman,4,The people at the school are amazing. It's a very small school so everyone kinda knows everyone.  Also it's a very old hbcu.
Niche User,4,"I like how if you do the medicine program, you get 3 years as an undergraduate and go into your program."
Senior,4,I love the diversity and family dynamic of Fisk University. Fisk has a very rich history and has had a huge impact on the advancement of African Americans. I love that Fisk also has a great academic record and is nationally recognized. The thing I would change about Fisk is the business aspect of the school. Fisk lacks successful communication with their students business wise. Overall I had a pleasurable experience while attending Fisk University and would definitely recommend it to other students looking to further their education.
College Freshman,4,"It was scary at first, but now I understand the swing of things. Everything if set at a fast pace, but I truly feel like I am learning"
College Freshman,4,The school I am at is wonderful.
Sophomore,4,I like how there are many opportunities giving at Fisk. I like how the students are engaged and willing to help one another achieve. The things that Fisk differ from other HBCU's is the number of students. I feel the less students the better relationship you can build with your professor.
College Freshman,4,I will hopefully know soon.
College Freshman,4,I don't really know ALOT but it seems good.
College Freshman,4,"When. I need help the school is always there, they will do anything for your successful, which is wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,I've made long term relationships with some of my professors.
College Sophomore,4,"Although, financially it is tough attending Fisk, the education is everything. I am most comfortable at this school than anywhere else."
College Junior,4,"Safety is very important. Our officers take care of us and make sure that we are safe and able to live safely. They are always there and you can easily access them and they will help you. They can be slow if it is not an emergency, but in emergencies their response time is very quick."
College Junior,4,"Greek life is very prominent, but it is not necessarily the forefront of Fisk. It is popular, but you do not have to participate."
College Sophomore,4,the campus is pretty safe
College Sophomore,4,Everyone loves the Greeks as far as I know
College Junior,4,Retieving a degree fron Fisk University helps students get more job opportunties and internships because the school is very prestigious.  Fisk always allows you to gain connections and the alumni are great.  The alumni helps out a lot of students as well as the school
College Junior,4,The atheletic department at Fisk University is good.  Our basketball team is good and everybody always attens their 	games.  I am a tennis player which is a club sport but it gets just as much support as the other teams.
College Junior,4,"My overall experience at Fisk University has been wonderful.  When I came in as a freshman, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.  After two years I changed my mind and my professors and advisors really helped me figure out what I love to do.  The professors are always helpful and never want to see a student fail. I love Fisk University's environment the most because it is family orientated from the faculty to the students."
College Sophomore,4,There is a great alumni department and some opportunity come from attending this college mostly for US citizen. It lack international student opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"I have a good Greek live on campus. Every Friday is Frat Friday and they scroll, which is pretty cool to watch."
College Freshman,4,Nothing really to worry about.
College Freshman,4,The safety is great. They just move pretty slow but they are great.
College Freshman,4,The alumni and the staff are nice and great supporters.
College Freshman,4,"The best dorm, Jubilee hall."
College Freshman,4,They network with everyone to make sure there are a number of options available for students
College Freshman,4,Getting the knowledge I came for
College Freshman,4,They make everyone feel at home everyone helps everyone
College Freshman,4,They want you to succeed.
College Freshman,4,"One of the best things on campus is our security. They're great. personable, and effective at their jobs. They keep us updated anytime there might be a possible threat, and they're always on the move to make sure our campus is secure. I hardly ever feel unsafe on campus. If you are feeling threatened in some way, they will respond immediately to your call, take action, and make sure that you get where you need to go safely."
College Freshman,4,Had great and caring professors. They definitely don't look at you as just another number. Class sizes vary on your major and the course.
College Freshman,4,School places heavy emphasis on internships and jobs. They hold job fairs fairly often as well as seminars on how to get you and your resume as job ready as possible. This school is great in helping you get into the career you want if you know how to utilize their programs.
College Junior,4,Our security are always willing to help
College Junior,4,Professors and advisors are always helping
College Junior,4,Dorms are nice and better than most colleges
College Junior,4,The best part of my school is that it is small. Because it is small that gives everyone a chance to really get to know one another. This is why my school feels like more of one big family than a college. The biggest reason that my school is unique is because it is a Historically Black College/University. I love this because we are all still so very different. We all have very different styles and are from many different places so it is easy for everyone to express themselves.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy my school because it is small which creates a family atmosphere. I like the events held around campus and the professors and courses.
College Freshman,4,The school will always support you financially!
College Freshman,4,"Food is good, but adds up."
College Freshman,4,"The school is very generous with scholarships, however I still had to take out a loan to cover the difference."
College Junior,4,As a rising senior the night life is great downtown for ages 21 and up. Bar and club hopping are what we are into more as we are getting more mature and wiser :)
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe during the day, it's obviously not very safe to walk around campus alone at night."
College Freshman,4,"I pay very little out of pocket, almost all the current freshmen are here on scholarship. Fisk, recently, have been very generous with their financial aid."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the classes I've had so far have been good, and I have good professors."
College Freshman,4,"I like the local atmosphere; it's a nice city, but it's not too crazy or crowded."
College Senior,4,"To go to a Historically Black College & University the diversity here is great. Diversity does not have to be displayed by skin color alone, but by the things we do, are interested in, and opportunities we create."
College Senior,4,"Everyone knows the rules and is told about them constantly. If you get in trouble for breaking the rules it is no one's fault but your own. Even the administrators will be lenient with you once or twice, but after that it is on you."
College Senior,4,"For the under 21 crowd the party life is restricted to any of the campuses they can get to. Vanderbilt usually has a party going on each weekend at different fraternity houses on their campuses. The only problem with that is that they do not always let non-Vanderbilt students join unless you know someone in the fraternity. When they do let outside students in though, it is a great time. Tennessee State University usually throws a party at a night club, but sometimes you can find one at an apartment or house. Downtown is for those of the 21 and over crowd. The party never ends down there and is always fun."
College Senior,4,"If you are looking for healthy options then you will really have to search unless you only eat sushi, then there is a lot of that around. For the late night eaters many places in Nashville are open until 2 or 3 am and they deliver. Other than that we have cuisine from all over the world: Ethiopian, African, Hispanic, Italian, Korean, Middle Eastern and of course American."
Freshman,2,"Being online was ok. I’m used to doing online classes from dual enrollment in high school. However, I feel like I retained more information and hands on experience when I was in person rather than online."
Freshman,2,"My experience so far is not great. It could be a lot better than what it is. Depending on what teachers you have, some of them try to make life very difficult for no reason. They need make the cafe more available. Also, they need to start rebuilding some things."
College Sophomore,2,the gym equipment is in need of replayment
College Sophomore,2,Housing is expensive considering that we lack some amenities like having a kitchen or clean microwaves.
College Freshman,2,Need a lot of work .
College Freshman,2,In the summer AC doesn't work.
College Freshman,2,"Students are rarely involved unless its a game for our basketball team, who rarely wins. Our cheerleading teams are entertaining, but its obvious that very few are actually talented. The gym is in dismal state and our track is literally uprooted gravel. Pray for us."
College Freshman,2,"My school isn't the worst school in existence, but it is frustrating when you know the faculty could be doing a much better job if they tried. The student activity center is a joke, there's multiple activities, but hardly anyone there at any of them. The male-only dorm - New Livingstone - and the female upperclassmen dorm Crosthwaite both look like penitentiaries for their respective genders. You can tell the food staff put a lot of effort into creating the meals, but they seem to continuously fail 8/10 times.  The main complaint is that the food isn't always thoroughly cooked, meaning inedible and dangerous for consumption. All facilities are outdated and the faculty is a bit dubious, especially concerning finances.

The party scene is pretty average if you're friends with the right people. There's at least two parties a week thrown by different Fiskites. Otherwise you're forced to stay in your dorm, or go to the clubs out in Murfreesboro where you have to pay for entrance."
College Freshman,2,"Fisk University is probably one of the most disappointing experiences I've had. Do not come here expecting to experience college, because this is far from a college experience. I can say that this feels more like the 5th year of highschool as opposed to the 1st year of college. Though i will agree that from the size of this school that the teacher-student relationships are much stronger than at a larger school, that is all this school has going for it. If I could redo my college application process all over again, I wouldn't even consider this school. The city of Nashville is wonderful, I will not lie. But the position that this school is placed within the city leaves any without a car at a disadvantage. The school is isolated from the liveliness, so when you are there all you can complain about is how little there is to do."
College Sophomore,2,"Fisk University is unorganized and the faculty is nothing more than the students that graduated from Fisk but couldn't work somewhere else. When you come in as a freshmen the school spends a lot of time assuring the parents and students that campus safety is a priority. The dorms are atrocious. New Livingston is a step above a jail cell. They renovated the first floor but that was all they did and that's all they show to freshman parents. Ask to see the second floor and the rest of the building while you are touring. The gym, track and tennis courts have not been renovated in over twenty years. The school will say one thing and do another in a heart beat. Administration is a joke. They do not care about how they handle your paper work or what you need as a student. I will NOT be returning. Fisk is trying to live off of a legacy that no longer exists."
College Sophomore,2,"Pro: The academics are excellent and the professors are passionate about their subject material. There is rich history, and it is very possible to succeed and get connections if you put the work in. Help will always be given at Fisk to those who ask for it.

Con: The food is universally acknowledged as subpar, the surrounding neighborhood isn't in the best condition, and there are fees for features that aren't even there (no clinic, but a health fee? $100 housing application fee?). The dorms are in poor condition and the communal bathrooms are ruined by people who don't clean up after themselves. The administration is often more of a hindrance than a help, and has been known to take outside scholarships and keep the money to themselves."
College Freshman,2,"Beats the heck out of me. I've only ever witnessed one party on campus that wasn't the result of freshman orientation. They start out strong at the beginning of the year with raves and gatherings, but it peters out pretty quickly. Everyone I know almost always goes out to clubs or someplace."
College Freshman,2,"There's the policies, which are par for the course on paper, and there's the execution.

Basically, no one cares.

They really don't. The boy's dorm, New Livingstone, legally doesn't condone any drugs, alcohol, or female visitation to dorm rooms. Not only do people constantly smoke cigarettes and marijuana nearly every day, and have parties almost directly next to the RA and RD station, but the people who are in charge of the rules don't even do anything about it. One of my own RAs would even casually bring his girlfriend back to his room. No reason for the rules if no one cares enough to enforce them."
College Freshman,2,"It could be worse, but you'd have to try really, REALLY hard.

Except for a handful of people, the staff isn't very kind.

The food is usually below standard, except for one or two items you can almost always find something better down the street.

The majority of the time, the food isn't conducive to a healthy diet, and most of it is incredibly high in sodium, even in the Sub Shop.

The fruit, especially the apples, is almost never in good condition. Most of the time it's too green, and other times they won't even sort out the rotten ones. This is a very bad school to be a vegetarian at."
College Freshman,2,Volleyball team is the only good thing. Not football. Basketball  and Soccer sucks on campus.
College Junior,2,Everything is either too expensive or run down.
College Junior,2,It's bad but I must say they are trying to get better but it takes time and proper staff
College Junior,2,It's pretty horrible for the most part. The only thing good is the pizza and fry section. Which gets pretty old and I healthy after a week. The sub shop was much better last year when we could get burgers and chicken sandwiches. I also am very disappointed about the new meal plan hours.
College Freshman,2,Fisk pretty much has the worst basketball team. So they aren't that important on campus.
College Freshman,2,"No parties near Fisk, only by Tennessee State or Vanderbilt."
College Freshman,2,"Biology is not easy, but what I want to do (veterinary science) requires it. If I  didn't have to take it, I wouldn't."
College Freshman,2,"My school gives lots of money, but lose things (important papers) in the office which obviously causes problems."
College Freshman,2,Not many sports and basketball is barely talked about
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are small, single's are better than sharing a room with someone"
College Freshman,2,There's one group that is popular while others are in the shadow.
College Freshman,2,The cafe sucks. Horribly. But the sub shop is ok and makes the meal plan partly worth it.
College Freshman,2,"The sexy, accomplished men are at Vandy or TSU. With Fisk men, you get one or the other. Same with girls."
College Freshman,2,Everyone gets free transportation but us! :(
Recent Alumnus,2,Fisk is not very big on sports. Academics is priority.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you don't have a car, you're pretty much stuck unless you ask for a ride or take the bus to your destination. The bus system isn't the worst that I've encountered, but it isn't great either. If you miss it, you're probably going to have to wait between 30-40 minutes for the next one to arrive, and a lot of the time that's not even a reliable time-frame. Walking to certain places is possible, but I really wouldn't recommend it after dark, unless you're walking with a few other people."
College Sophomore,2,We have the metro bus and bike racks to tour the city. The bus is $2.50 for a pass for all day and the bikes are charged by some sort of card and you're charge for however long you have them
College Sophomore,2,"As far as where I want to go in my career, Fisk is not the best university for it. I eventually want to be a bilingual speech language pathologist, and didn't discover that until second semester of freshman year. If I had realized it sooner, I would have gone to school with a much better language program. It could get better, but so far I am not impressed. Science majors such as Chemistry and Biology though, are very popular at Fisk, even though it is a liberal arts school. These programs have a lot of partnerships with other universities in Nashville. Such as Meharry and Vanderbilt. Do your research before a choosing a school that doesn't offer a lot of different programs, or ones that you may be interested in in the future."
College Sophomore,2,"The traditions at Fisk are alive and well. The ceremonies you'll participate in as a freshmen will definitely be memorable. The campus facilities are in pretty bad shape. Do not expect to be super nice. The gym needs a face lift, the dorms need a lot of upgrading."
College Sophomore,2,"Its an historical black college. Its diverse being that the majority of the school is black. If you are looking for an array of different ethnicities and heritages, it may not be the right school for you."
College Senior,2,"There are a few areas for housing that are close to the school, but they aren't that nice. In order to find decent housing in a decent neighborhood, you have to travel a few miles."
College Senior,2,If you dont have a car make friends with people that do and have gas money ready.The bus takes 20-30 mins to come back around. Its cheap  but you must plan your trip wisely and be prepared to wait. It is nothing like the buses up north. You can call a cab service but some cabbies will rip you off  by charging a flat rate when running the clock will be cheaper. It is more convenient than a bus because you can come and go as you please but it isnt cheap. There are no shuttles. You can ask public safety for a ride around campus on the carts though.
College Freshman,2,the cost of this school in farky overarted it doesn have all the program it once owned and need to lower price or rebuild renew and bring back
College Senior,2,"Weekends Downtown – Although a lot of clubs and bars are for the 21 and older crowd, there are a few places for younger students to go. There are a few house parties, yard parties and gym parties that are spread throughout the academic year. In my opinion nightlife is what you make it. Parties aren't always available, but your friends and a good time are."
College Freshman,2,"Fisk is known for its research and education... Sports... not so much. Sincce the closing of the football team in the late '80s, Sports has truly taken one for the team. In atheletics, Fisk is a D3 school in the NAIA. All in all, if Fisk had a football team, it would definetly carry vibrancy."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the time to get were you want to go, you would have to walk. If you know an upperclassmen with a car then you can ask them to take you some place in exchange of gas fare. If you do not want to do that your best option is to call a cab or take the bus."
Freshman,1,"I've been taking online classes and I don't really like them. Mainly because I have to wait on responses to emails, can't talk to people fast enough, and I'm just used to learning in a school setting. I really don't know how to work the different apps, like zoom, and sometimes links don't work. I rather be in class, but we have to stay safe so I'll make the best of it."
Alum,1,"My experience with Fisk has been subpar since the day I landed there in 2013. If you want a university that is on top of its business affairs, please go somewhere else. There business practices leave a lot to be desired. The education was fine. I feel like my professors cared for the most part. But it isn’t work the stress that comes along with the business, financial aid, and registrar’s offices. PLEASE CHOOSE ANOTHER UNIVERSITY."
College Sophomore,1,"Dorms are nasty, especially New (old) Livingston. They are actually talking about building a new living learning center instead of renovating what is already there. Faculty is difficult and the school overall focuses on the wrong things. Too expensive for what you get in return."
College Freshman,1,The school doesn't cover off campus housing.
College Freshman,1,"Generally, the food is terrible. I only eat it because I will starve otherwise."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have off-campus housing. Either you get your own place or room with a relative, the University isn't involved with any housing that doesn't concern the dorms."
College Freshman,1,"If I had known what the dorms were like, I never would have come to Fisk. The hallways and bathrooms are constantly filthy, people aren't considerate enough to clean up after themselves or even flush the toilets when they're done.

There are plenty of smokers here and you'll often smell weed when you walk down the hall in New Livingstone. None of the RA's do their jobs and they're usually part of the groups breaking the rules.

If I could afford an apartment, I'd definitely stay off campus. Unfortunately this is Nashville, and unless you have a relative within commuting distance, the school won't let underclassmen live off-campus."
College Freshman,1,The meat is mostly undercooked.
College Junior,1,The sport facilities are horrible be just got new bleachers in the gym. The school is generally focused on academics and not on athletics
College Junior,1,I have not really seen an experience but I have heard about some occurence
College Freshman,1,WHY CAN'T WE HAVE FREE TRANSPORTATION.
College Junior,1,it is difficult for me to obtain the scholarships i need.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Night life is what you make it, which means that if you want one, you should go to Vanderbilt. Parties do happen at Fisk, but they're usually over by 1 am, and if TSU is invited, it's probably going to get shut down by 11:30. Your best bet if you want to party is to head to one of the other colleges around the city. Plus, the area around Vanderbilt and Belmont is where the best bars are located."
College Sophomore,1,"Fisk has a curfew of midnight for all freshmen. In the freshmen girls dorm, you get one or two warnings then get fined $50 for being out past midnight. The boys have the same rules but they are not enforced equally. In the freshman girl's dorm, visitation is from 7-11:30 pm and can only be done in the lobby. No one can go in your room, except for the girls that live in that dorm. Upper classmen dorms have visitation from 7pm-12am. No matter what day it is. A lot of people get around this by either sneaking in, being cool with an R.A or security."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is horrible. After your freshmen year, do not bother getting a meal plan. You will eat off campus way more. The food isn't healthy. There were a couple occasions of pests being in the food and drink machine. Get a fridge and stock up!"
College Sophomore,1,The whole entire campus needs an upgrade. Like most HBCU's the facilities are less than lack luster. It is definitely not five star but its livable. The campus on the outside is beautiful but on the inside (particularly the dorms) need a lot of cosmetic help.
College Sophomore,1,Varsity is not a big part of Fisk University because it is mainly a liberal arts schools. The school does not have a football or baseball team. Basketball is the biggest sport on campus and the team never turns out to be competitive. The games are always crowded because of the support of the students and alumni.
College Freshman,1,"Shabby at Best – Fisk has a lot to offer students when it comes to a prestigious education, but when considering the atheletic department, it could use some major rennovations. The same goes for the residence halls and cafeteria/student lounge. The Historical venues are what keep the student life active in my opinion."
College Junior,1,"Sports Are Not That Great – Fisk University is a school mostly focused on academics. They offer sports in order to allow students to have a well balanced life, but the sports aren't all that great. It's nothing we take serious; it's all in fun."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Fisk needs a lot of work in order for it to survive in the future.  Facilities and student life are very subpar, with rodents and bugs in the dormitories, crumbling infrastructure, and a general lack of things to do on campus.  While the lack of university-sponsored activities leaves the students responsible for their own amusement (which may or may not build character), many people feel continually bored and unhappy staying there, resulting in a low retention rate.  The academic life is phenomenal and I feel luck to have attended and gotten a great education, but I do wish I had been happier outside of the classroom."

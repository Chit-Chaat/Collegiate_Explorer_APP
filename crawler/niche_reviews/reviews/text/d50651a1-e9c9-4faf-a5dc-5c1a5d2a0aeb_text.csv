Freshman,5,Personally my online experience with NCCU has been great so far. My professors have been very vocal on how everything online will go including the labs and so forth. They've reminded me their always in contact and I can always reach out if I have any questions!
Freshman,5,"I loved the diversity at the university. Once I got on campus of NCCU it felt so welcoming the counselors helped me figure out how everything was gonna go, My parents met my professors, and everything was just very easy going. My first few days on campus were interesting I went to my classes and got to meet my professors and instructors. There isn't much I would change to NCCU they have plenty of clubs for you to join and make connections too people with. All I could say too anyone new or transferring to NCCU is to have a opened mind and enjoy your time on campus or online."
Niche User,5,I start taking my first class in January 2021. I am looking so forward to learning with them. I will take online only classes

Freshman,5,The online experience is great. I really love that I can always be in contact with all of my professors.
Alum,5,Overall my experience at North Carolina Central University was excellent. I admired the Student Life and a variety of organizations. The only downside was the housing and campus food.

Freshman,5,The professors are amazing and learning through Blackboard is amazing. Blackboard is very easy to use.

Freshman,5,"Surprisingly my online experience went well. The professors were very attentive and understanding. It was a little challenging to stay focus every day, but I came out on top."
Alum,5,NCCU was such a great experience for me. I got my degree in Biology with a concentration in pre-med while playing on the volleyball team. All of the staff was always willing to go above and beyond to help and the teachers were always offering extra help for students who may have had a hard time learning or understanding concepts. My time there was unforgettable and I'm so appreciative to have gone to a school where the genuinely care about the success of all of their students. I wouldn't have changed a thing.
Freshman,5,"My freshman year at North Carolina Central was a crazy experience, from homecoming, to the freedom of being independent, all the way to the pandemic that is currently going on which led all the schools to being let out early."
Niche User,5,"I'm so excited to become an Eagle pride. North Carolina Central University prepares students to succeed in the global marketplace.  I will study in nursing.

Freshman,5,"What I like at North Carolina Central is how everyone is very friendly and wants to see you succeed in everything you do. Wants to help you get that job you want after graduating school. If you don't know what you want to do, then they will help. I would like to see more food options on campus."
Niche User,5,I am taking online courses at the moment but all my experiences with the professors and visiting campus for orientation have been great.
Niche User,5,"I like the fact that they have a good law program, because that is what I want to go to school for in Fall 2020. They are student friendly and respond to you in a timly manner. They always have the best and positive attitude when you need help or need assistance with your admission.  They make sure you are guided and know exactly what you need for school. They reach out to you if you have a question and try to solve your problems. The school itself is very professional and has a very high graduation percentage. They are one of the best universities I could consider to further my education."
Junior,5,My experience at NCCU was excellent because everyone was willing to help get you to the correct t building. The staff and students were delightful and respectful. I'm glad to be apart of NCCU.

I have always wanted to attend an HBCU and I am happy to say that I have chosen a great school.  I am also an online student and I have all of the resources to be prepared for my classes.  When I need help, I always get assistance.  I would like to see elementary education online for a change in the near future.  Overall, I recommend NCCU to anyone because it is just a wonderful school in person and online."
Sophomore,5,"I love my HBCU! They are very understanding when it comes to life situations. They welcomed me back and allowed me to show them that I can progress in being me and making myself proud! My professors are awesome, football team is awesome, great dinning services and great activities! Wouldn’t of chose a better school"
Freshman,5,Made my transfer from ECPI smooth all my credits transferred and my advisor was really good about staying in communication with and always a helping hand when I stumbled across and issue.
Sophomore,5,"Teachers are here to help, friendly staff. Students are nice and helpful. Never hesitate to ask questions. The best HBCU in North Carolina."
Sophomore,5,Since say one (orientation) I have loved NCCU! This is an awesome HBCU. The school itself is in great condition and it has many buildings old and new. The main thing that I love about central is that you get a lot of support from everyone no matter who you are or where you come from. This is my second year here and the experience for me has been great.
Freshman,5,"While visiting the campus for orientated, I really enjoyed myself. From the time I got there to the time I left I experienced nothing greater. The staff was very helpful and had every answer to all of the questions, they made sure we had everything we needed and everyone was well taken care of. The campus is very beautiful and neat, the cafeteria food was awesome, the dorm rooms and bathrooms were clean and neat. We were told everything we needed to know about the campus from history and class work, to academics and fun events ,we were given good advice to be freshmen at a HBCU such as my NCCU."
Alum,5,"NCCU was a last resort for me, but I am so grateful for the experience. I made great connections and life long friends! Such a welcoming environment and atmosphere. I love it so much that I'm returning in the fall for Grad School!!! The best HBCU EVER. #EaglePride"
Niche User,5,"I am looking forward to starting my college career at North  Carolina Central University In the fall of 2020.  After visiting the campus, I couldn't have chose a better college to attend after graduating high school.  I will be playing softball for NCCU."
Freshman,5,"I am enjoying my experience. The orientation program was fun and very informative.  The orientation leaders are well trained on campus history and hospitality.  I was greeted by many friendly faces and experienced the beautiful campus.  When I look around my campus, I feel safe knowing security officers and blue boxes everywhere.  When looking from the dorm, class, or even the cafeteria there is always at least one security box.  There are many dining options on campus and I enjoy the diverse range of food options.  The only negative aspect is the old dorms."
Junior,5,It has been a good experience and I’ve learned a lot about life. I’ve made a lot of friends that I consider family. The teachers are more like parents and they help you when you are done. Nccu is one big family and everyone looks out for each other the best way they can
Freshman,5,"My experience at north carolina central university was very fun, I went on a two day tour filled with other upcoming freshman’s. The school was very helpful, fun, and informative on what the upcoming 2019-2020 school year was going to be like. The soar leaders were very nice and answered every question truthfully and nicely. I definitely recommend this HBCU."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the diversity of the school. I love how everyone is a big family! The campus is not too big including the classroom size.
Sophomore,5,I love the view of campus! Such a welcoming environment. Definitely feels like one big family. The professors are great and so are the students .
Freshman,5,I love the whole experience !!!! When I went to orientation as soon as I arrived the energy was AMAZINGGGGG !! At first I was nervous but everyone there made me very comfortable. I am very excited to be attending there in the fall.
Freshman,5,The experience touring the campus was a great experience. It was even better than what I thought it would. Only thing I would change would be renovation. I would renovate.
Freshman,5,"I loved the energy and vibes the students gave around campus. The campus has a family oriented feeling. The main reason I attended is because, of their nursing program. They have a great nursing program and according to their nursing program, 89% of their students pass. That is a dream goal of mine and I feel as if central will guide me in the right direction for me to accomplish those goals."
Graduate Student,5,It is a nice college campus . I enjoyed my time there. I am currently enrolled in the Master program.  I was able to finish 1 year early so that afforded me to continue with my college career with 1 year left of A college basketball scholarship.
Freshman,5,There is always something to do never a dull moment. So many activities to do to keep you engaged on campus. Great professors very helpful
Freshman,5,"North Carolina Central University is a wonderful university.  All of the faculty and staff really care about the students and their overall well being.  It's not just about the education, its about the students as a whole.  Every Professor I have had has been personally invested in my success as a student."
Senior,5,"The illustrious North Carolina Central University is an esteemed historically black college university that roots itself in Truth & Service. NCCU is unlike any other and for me was a home away from home. The campus is beautiful, the education is great, and the sporting and social events are fun & exciting. Likewise, NCCU continuously works to improve on their technology & efforts to enhance the student experience. Overall, this school is the place to be!"
Niche User,5,"So far, North Carolina Central University is my go to school. Their communications with students is excellent, and are always very helpful. If there was one thing I would want changed it would be the fee amounts. They are pretty steep in pricing but do-able."
Freshman,5,"I have always been welcome at this fine University. The buildings are nice and clean. Parking is a hard to come by at times but that just means people are ready to learn. I don't have any changes,it is a great school."
Alum,5,"North Carolina Central is a lovely university. It's not far from other schools such as Shaw University and Duke. The college has their own shuttle that allows students to travel off campus safely to surrounding areas. The mall isn't far which is a good place a student might want to look into a part-time job or to just get away for a little while. Also, freshmen are allowed to bring car their first year which would insure even more independence."
Niche User,5,I like the energy. Theres alot of people that look just like me. My overalls experience was great. I was grateful to be there and surrounded by wonderful people. The scenery is great.
Senior,5,My experience here has been a great one. I have definitely had a lot of doors open and opportunities have been given to me because of the work I got to do while in school. I have made wonderful connections with some of my professors and I definitely have made relationships with people who I consider true friends. The academics are wonderful. It is definitely a place for anyone who wants to have a bright future and a great time.
Sophomore,5,"Great school, just need a little tweaking as far as professionalism. Experience is really fun and they offer a lot of things for you to do on campus."
Freshman,5,"I went to orientation in Early July to get a feel of what campus would be like my first year. I loved it because the people are friendly, there are a lot of other people that look like me, they are like family. The dorms are okay, they are average size. I like my classes for this year, and I get to be home again, in North Carolina, so I love the thought of being home. But one thing I really do love is the view from the dorm, because I'm on the eighth floor, so it's beautiful."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love central! It’s the school to be! From the student life to the academics it’s all around great. When I first began college I didn’t know what to expect but Central allowed me to feel right at home and guided me every step of the way. The students on campus are friendly and helpful I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about the my University. I feel at home, the atmosphere is lovely, and I feel loved and cherished. I feel like I belong and like I'm wanted, needed. However, I would love to see more unity in getting updated buildings."
Freshman,5,"As far year at North Carolina Central, I had a great first year there. The parties, classes, sports, Greek-life, teachers were great there in Durham, The only negative to this school is I wish the rooms looked a little better and that  the café food gets better options on the menu."
Alum,5,"Being at this institution made me feel like home, this was literally a learning experience for me and I’m grateful for getting this. It’s taught me a lot of things about myself, the good and the bad."
Junior,5,I have had an exceptional two years.  NCCU helps students transition from high school to the college sector.  I specifically appreciate the programs for freshman's that aid in a smooth transition.
Freshman,5,"I love the school completely, its so amazing. it has a beautiful campus. the band is amazing and the dorms are to die for."
Freshman,5,"My experience with NCCU was great. I went on a tour there about a year and the tour guides were very friendly and informative. Also, the students who were not tour guides made me feel like I already went there."
Senior,5,North Carolina Central University has given me more than I needed for resources. I will be a very good Social Worker.
Junior,5,"I really love the environment. I love that there is still little diversity at this college, even though it is a Historically Black College University. I am really hoping that I can graduate! I am needing a scholarship because I am in need of a car for transportation. The car I did have just died on me. It was my dad's car. My father always buys used products and cars and think that it is always the safe thing to do. He gave me the car at 300K miles (with a new motor)."
Sophomore,5,"The verdant greens and sloping hills of the illustrious North Carolina Central University has been a wonderful experience. First and foremost, the opportunity to even join a university such as this one was a great honor. There is so many people from different walks of life and people here for majors A-Z. I enjoy how free you are and how your individualism really defines you as a person. Being in class with different professors and really getting to dissect their teaching methods; helps you ascertain your learning style. Overall, being at NCCU is a breath of fresh air to be around people just like you. On the other hand, there are some things that I would like to see change; campus safety and cafeteria food. Safety for me is very important because of our large population and our open campus. I believe campus police and security should be heightened just to ensure the safety of the students and staff. The food is okay, but I believe there should be variation in our menu."
Freshman,5,"I love my school! The atmosphere is amazing, although I am a freshman I have met so many amazing people. Being apart of the marching band at Central is a plus because you get to do what you love and be apart of a great organization with amazing people. The teachers challenge you with the work you do, and your advisers push you to do well in your classes and they help you remember the reason you went to college in the first place."
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed my college experience at Central University. I think for everyone transitioning into college is always a difficult process, but the staff at Central have been very patience and helpful with me and all my questions. They've always gone out of their way to making sure I'm on the right path to graduating."
Freshman,5,"When I went to visit North Carolina Central University the campus was so beautiful. The sloping hills to the green scenery of the fresh grass. The class buildings looked very nice and put together adding to that the dorms were very modern and clean. The professors on campus looked very educated and they were great at explaining what they lecture in class. The campus food in the cafe was good, they also had a good choice of different mini restaurants in their buildings. The students were nice and very helpful and everyone seemed to show pride in their school. North Carolina Central University was a great choice for me, I am glad I applied."
Sophomore,4,Very big and chill campus. The staff and students are very wholesome enthusiastic. It just needs more on-campus activities to be more engaged in school.
Freshman,4,"I love my school because I can experience things outside of where I live.
Also I feel like I can receive a better and quality education here."
Alum,4,"The online learning experience at North Carolina Central University was satisfactory. Although the majority of my courses were in-person, I was enrolled in 3 online classes throughout my 4 years. The professors provided clear instructions and were available any time you needed them."
Freshman,4,"This school has been an amazing experience. Being a student here as taught me responsibility, individuality, and diligence. The staff makes you feel at home, the students make you feel like family, and the experience is something I feel like I could only get here at NCCU. I love it here and I plan to graduate from this illustrious university."
Sophomore,4,"I love NCCU. I am now a rising Junior and my time at Central has been great. I made friends and was able to transition to school very easily (i am a A/B student though). Teachers are willing to work with you and can be challenging. Campus life is also great. There’s normally always something to do. The food for some people is trash, but I don’t mind. The dorms can be pretty crappy, but in 2020 they built 2 new buildings, and plan on building more. It’s a really good school and the more involved you get the more opportunities you’ll be able to find."
Niche User,4,"I plan to transfer to this school for a online program in Psychology in Fall 2020, but so far with admission it has been a great experience.  Everyone I have talked to on the phone or through email has been so helpful and kind"
Freshman,4,"I really think Central is an amazing school with lots of opportunities for learning and excelling in life. The resources are generally easy to access but there are some things that are difficult for me to get accustomed to, possibly because I'm a freshman but it's nothing too severe to obstruct me from enjoying the campus and everything it has to offer."
Senior,4,"I also believe that NCCU has a great undergraduate program which was designed to stimulate intellectual curiosity and the habit of disciplined learning, to give students a strong background in both general Western culture and African-American culture, and to equip students with marketable intellectual and professional skills."
Niche User,4,Once being on my first college tour I felt at home. My tour guides answered all my questions and very friendly. Seeing the different buildings and dorms in a full-depth view was better than any other campus tour I been on. The cafe is a great better than a lot of other colleges I've been to.
Junior,4,"North Carolina Central University is a very diverse community. The professors that I have had so far have always been very help and show to care for their students. The faculty and staff are all friendly and willing to take time out of their own hands to help others.  One thing I would change about Central would be the food. However, the new chick fi la they opened is amazing! There are good places to eat around Durham."
Sophomore,4,I am currently a sophomore Business Administration major at the institution. So far I am enjoying my time here. The biggest take advantage in my opinion about NC Central is the amazing business opportunities they present to their students every week.
Junior,4,I enjoyed the dorms and events that were held. I would like to see the RA's show more attentiveness.
Sophomore,4,I’ve visited and I’m going there fall 2019. The school seems wonderful I just wish they had more housing for people.
Senior,4,"I'm going into my senior year here at NCCU. So far the first thing I have to comment on would be the HBCU feel of campus, I love the atmosphere around here and enjoy most of what this campus has to offer. I've made life long friends here which was a main goal when coming to college and networked myself out to various areas. The reason I didn't give it the maximum amount of stars is I've ran into multiple professors at the university who don't speak very good English, and it's baffling to me that you find that issue with a professor."
Freshman,4,The people you meet on campus can become some of the people you keep in your life for a very long time.
Freshman,4,"I haven't officially attended the school yet, but I have toured it and I was extremely impressed. Its a very competitive school, and I feel that that will help me later on. I am also extremely happy that it is an HBCU, because I've always wanted to go to one, and this is one of the best."
Junior,4,"I really like the positive atmosphere and the professors that push the students to be successful. Here, the students are given all the tools needed to be prepared for the reality of the world."
Freshman,4,"I like the atmosphere of being at a HBCU. Being around people that I can relate to, but also can learn a lot from. The professors are genuinely there to help you in any way they can and that's what I really appreciate."
Freshman,4,"Central is a good college because it has a very good environment, they have many different ways to help a student in any moment of need, and there is always something to do on campus. Something that should probably change from Central is the way their financial aid office do their tasks and how they help their students. When it comes to figuring out someone’s tuition you should try your hardest to quickly get the job done but that is not that the case at central."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at NCCU are awesome, they are willing to tutor and help you succeed. The campus is pretty big and the food is pretty good."
Freshman,4,Great affordable education. I am a non-traditional student that is working towards a nursing degree. My experience so far a freshman has been great. I have experience with online and on campus classes. So far everything the professors have been responsive to any questions and are there to teach you.
Sophomore,4,"Hello, I am in dire need of this scholarship so I will be able to help cover my costs. I have no financial assistance."
Sophomore,4,This is a great school specifically for people seeking out to be lawyers and the doctors on campus care about the students even though there are tons of us and the campus is in a bad part of Durham so a lot of crime goes on near campus but the security is not 100% on it
Sophomore,4,"North Carolina Central is not the best university, however, I am very happy I chose here. I've learned a lot in my first year of college here that I don't think I would have learned anywhere else. The academics and the professors are the most important to me. The professors are genuine for the most part and are willing to teach you. I also appreciate the ""chain of command"" so to speak. If I ever have a problem with a professor I may go and speak to the next in charge. The area isn't too safe and the food isn't great. But as long as you don't go to parties often or walk alone in the night, you're not going to have a problem with that."
Freshman,4,NCCU is a great place to get to learn more about yourself. My experience has been fairly good. I’ve made life long relationships already in the first year here.
Freshman,4,I love this school it is an HBCU but the only bad part it is in the hood part of our neighborhood so if something happens across the street the school has to go on lock down.
Freshman,4,"An important point is the community service requirement. I believe there should be more opportunities for students to gain community service hours combined with their classes and possible jobs. Not everyone has the time to gain the necessary hours each semester to reach the graduation goal or more. Majority of the opportunities listed under the NCCU site are for off-campus and adding more on-campus opportunities, even at a lesser hour rate, would be highly beneficial. 

Another issue are the money-grabbing set ups. For instance, the bookstore has a great rent program for getting books at a lesser cost (such as on Amazon, etc.). However, instead of just spending the rent amount, the difference in the prices is also put onto a bookstore card that can only be used at the bookstore. Students already have to pay to keep the school running as part of our overall tuition, so there should be some give somewhere in terms of how much we have to pay."
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere at Central. Its a great place for African American students to to grow and learn about their history and culture. All the resources on campus ensure that you are successful in the future. Only thing i would change is providing more dorms to avoid over crowding.
Niche User,4,"I've only experienced this campus as an early college student, so I can't review this school on every level but from the classes I've taken I see that the professors care and give work that reflects the lesson their teaching."
Sophomore,4,My experience at North Carolina central so far has been life changing. Not only has It made me grow as a person but the experience has been able to help me connect with people in a whole different way.
Niche User,4,"To receive an education at a HBCU school that has been ranked each year, and the many majors it offers. It is located in Durham which was recently ranked #2 in the nation for the best college town in America. Central is a fun school that shows much pride"
Alum,4,I went here post graduation and did enjoy the HBCU atmosphere.  Class sizes were not too large and professors seemed really invested in student success.  You do however have to stay on top of student financial aid as there seems to be a small issue with competence.  There is a great sense of pride among students here.
Freshman,4,Nccu feels like home to me . Mostly everybody who works here is welcoming . Even most of the students . You would really like it here . It's like a big family . It's diverse but not diverse enough . But we welcome everybody here .
Freshman,4,"As an upcoming freshman and class of 2021 I have much more to learn, and experience about NCCU. So far I love the campus and the students seem friendly and willing to help freshmen settle in. I love how the campus is close to Raleigh which is a very cool place to hang out and meet new people."
Junior,4,"Not the greatest of areas but its a great school. A lot of school activities, and events. Many concerts and volunteer opportunities to do."
Freshman,4,My experience at North Carolina Central University has been good overall even though there has been a lot of challenges. I like the atmosphere of the campus and how I can be greeted by many people. I also like the athletics because our football and basketball team are the MEAC champions and I love how we can support each other as a whole. We have a lot of support from certain staff members and advisors to help us be successful. I would like to see a change in the food in the cafeteria because there has been a lot of complaints about what we are being served.
Freshman,4,"I love the diverse community that make up the student body on campus! There are so many people from different towns, states, and even countries! On top of this, each person sports a myriad of interests, classes, and work experience. Students are very ambitious at this campus, which allows you to surround yourself with people who strive to be the very best at whatever they apply themselves to. Ultimately this pushes you to challenge what you know, defend what you believe in, and in the end, make you a better person."
Freshman,4,North Carolina Central is a great school. This school was one of my interest because they have a great nursing program. The best part about the school is that they teach you professional development.
Freshman,4,NCCU is a very family oriented school and very friendly. The students and staff are very diverse. The overall atmosphere is lovely.
Freshman,4,The students of this school are very friendly and welcoming. I think it is a great school to attend.
Graduate Student,4,"It's a great education at a very affordable price, compared to other schools in the area. The campus could use more housing options."
Freshman,4,I honestly love the school. Every school has it's flaws.  As far as NCCU goes... there is one major flaw i see as a battle for the school and it happens to be turning down loan companies such as sallie mae and many others. There are many out of state students who are unable to pay their full tuition and struggle trying to get the money to pay the sometimes $5000 that financial aid doesn't cover. Many go home and others get sent home which happens to be a huge issue because us as students come to school to receive a degree becoming a positive product of North Carolina Central University we don't want to have to leave because the loans we know of aren't accepted or because financial aid will not allow us to be a student at central longer than a semester. If there's anything that could be done on the behalf of the out of state students and tuition payment as far as accepting more loan companies Central will honestly and truly be one of the most amazing HBCU's there are.
Freshman,4,"Before the start of the school I did not expected much from it, but after attending class at Central I been having a good time."
Niche User,4,My overall experience with Niche is good because they help me apply for scholarships and its fast and easy to do so. I really wish that I can get a scholarship that I applied for as much as I apply for them. But other than that I love Niche.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic facilities are great. There is a standard soccer field with a track around it, a football field, both outdoor and indoor basketball courts, Olympic sized swimming pool and variety of other courts that I cannot name. The fitness or workout room is also well organized and loaded with various machines and equipment to keep fit with."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at my school are amazing. There were couple of former students who played football and got drafted into the NFL last year, so sports at NCCU are pretty important and are taken seriously. Our sports events are a great opportunity for the students to show our pride."
College Freshman,4,"Eagles stay connected. Alumni connections are strong at NCCU, but networking is key."
College Freshman,4,"Love my school. If I could do it all over again, I would."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Annie Day. It's honor's housing so my opinion may be a bit biased. They are suite style dorms and the rooms are pretty spacious. You have 3 other roommates in a suite style dorm but you will share a room with one. All four of you will share a living space and your own bathroom. Annie Day has several study lounges, a computer lab, and its own library. It's in great proximity to everything on campus. It's a straight shot to the caf, library and greek bowl. You may run into issues with maintenance as Annie Day does not have its own maintenance crew, but they are usually very good about fixing whatever needs repairing. DO NOT APPLY FOR HOUSING LATE!!!"
College Freshman,4,All of our sports teams are great and receive a lot of support from the student body. Everything from football to golf is well appreciated!
College Freshman,4,"I love my HBCU! NCCU is a great school. A lot of the reviews here are very negative, but I promise it is a great institution. The professors are great, and the overall atmosphere is enjoyable. I would choose it all over again. We are a very traditional and respectable school."
College Freshman,4,I just love the Greek life because they have so much energy
College Junior,4,Athletics are the biggest thing on campus next to Law and Nursing. The majority of campus is dedicated for athletics.
College Senior,4,NCCU has made substantial improvements on their building structures.
College Senior,4,Greek life seems to be pretty normal and steady.
College Senior,4,Athletics is a huge draw to this school.
College Sophomore,4,"Career services at my school is very beneficial for students. It helps students in various ways whether it be jobs/internships, career goals, etc. This fall I will do a better job with using this resource because everyone at career services are very passionate about making sure each student is being helped wherever they might need it."
College Sophomore,4,"Although attending an hbcu doesn't really put students in a entirely pleasant environment outside the campus, I feel that Nccu tries to make all students feel safe and secure while attending the school. Every student gets alerts on their phone about if anything criminal has taken place so that we are aware. The police on our campus I know take their jobs seriously in protecting us and our campus. I love my school and it's environment and I never felt unsafe my freshman year."
College Sophomore,4,"I loved my housing for freshman year at Nccu. Mostly all my friends that I gained my freshman year came from my dorm. Everyone on my floor was cool and easy to make friends with. I think out of all the freshman dorms, the dorm I stayed in was by far the best of the bunch. The hardest thing about transitioning from living at home and then living in a dorm for a whole school year was the bathrooms. It was hard knowing that I was sharing a bathroom with my whole hall but as time went by I ended up getting used to it. The housing process was easy, and the thing I liked most about the process was how they matched my up with my Roomate based on a survey we both took. That survey matching helped put me with a Roomate that was easy to get along with."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I never really went to any events associated with Greek life, I always heard how their parties were all around campus. I feel that non-Greeks don't understand all that the Greeks do for their community. I know a lot of students only think that their only good for their parties but I know how much they help other people. Greek housing includes many sorority and fraternity houses available to students associated with it"
Junior,2,"Horrible. Always losing paperwork, staff is inconsiderate and rude. Financial aid is trying to get over on people and the students while requesting aid ."
Alum,2,"There are some very good aspects of NCCU. The tuition is low, and there are some truly great professors. The classes are far too easy for the most part and don't actually prepare most of the students for the real world. There is too much of a focus on creating your own business instead of going into the world and getting any experience first. While the Diversity grade is a B right now, this is a farce. Yes, it is an HBCU and yes, there are many people of color that teach and attend, but diversity means people of all backgrounds, races, genders, and diversity of THOUGHT. If you are not black or brown and attend here, you will immediately be treated as inferior and as an outsider. This does help you focus on schoolwork, but you will not make friends easily at all. The teachers and students will practically shun you from participating if you have a different political viewpoint than they do and it is FAR to the left to say the least. If you are moderate and think openly, DO NOT go here."
Freshman,2,"When I chose to go to North Carolina Central University, I thought this school would be the perfect choice for me. People always spoke about all the fun they had at this school. What my high school mind didn't realize is that ""fun"" hid a lot, including the abysmal academics at this school and similarly mediocre resources and amenities. This last year has been the worst year of my life, filled with too easy classes, students banging on my door w/ loud music at night advertising bad parties (that can get violent), and a school in the middle of nowhere. The only good things include my roommate, the counseling center, and the career center. Avoid this place at all cost, especially if you're not from North Carolina/a large city."
Senior,2,"I've transferred from a community college to a university and based on the years I've attended, i haven't had a good experience. I was misguided with classes and finance. The tuition was too high for out of state students and the university made it difficult find solution to help students in need."
Senior,2,I like the classes I take at NCCU and the instructors I had and have. What I don’t like and needs to be changed is the administration like housing and higher position people need more training and communication.
Junior,2,"While I am currently a student at NCCU, I honestly wish I had chosen another college. They were very inexpensive and the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" and I do. I get no assistance with registering for classes, no assistance with financial aid matters, and no other help when needed by an advisor or other staff member. I finally received help from one person in the department for my major and then s he transfers to different department. To day I was upset would be an understatement. The website is complicated and not at all user friendly. All the instructors can set up blackboard differently and that gets rather confusing as you look for new assignments and due dates."
College Sophomore,2,It's not good. All most anyone can gain access into a dormitory which can lead to rape or robbery. There is also no security in the dormitory which means even a student can be attacked by another student without being caught or apprehended.
College Freshman,2,Living on a floor with all girls you would think it would be clean but its not we need our own bathrooms
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms are very disgusting they need to improve the conditions
College Freshman,2,The freshman halls are horrible.
College Freshman,2,Football team isnt good. Basketball used to be good but fell off when the good players graduated
College Senior,2,The food in the cafeteria is not good.
College Freshman,2,"For off-campus student housing, you really only have two options. Campus Crossing and Level 51 Ten (the Verge). Campus Crossing is very run down and not visually appealing but it is 5 minutes away from campus. The Verge is much nicer but it is farther away, about 15 minutes from campus. There are also a number of houses directly across the street from campus (literally, walking distance) that you could rent out."
College Freshman,2,I was told I received a full scholarship. Then they took it away because I am an out of state student. Still dealing with how I am going to pay for the remainder of my education.
College Sophomore,2,Its somewhat difficult to earn scholarships
College Freshman,2,I think the freshman dorms could be better quality for the expense. The rooms are just two small for two people. There's insufficient storage space for clothing. The space would be sufficient for only one person per room. Maybe I'll look to move to more spacious accommodations for my sophomore year.
College Sophomore,2,It seems like everyone on campus either smokes or drinks. Most students smoke or have smoked before.
College Freshman,2,Mostly people have food delivered from dominoes or the Chinese place. These places are very expensive since they have to deliver. Their isn't a really big variety but the food is okay.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of walking to do on this campus, and North Carolina weather changes relentlessly. If you dress for the sun and it drizzles, you are done!"
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is crammed, only great facilities is school of Law and the school of Education. They are trying to construct much more pleasant facilities."
College Junior,2,I receive no financial aid from my school
College Junior,2,To much money for nothing!
College Junior,2,Parking you can never find!
College Sophomore,2,"Not currently in the program because of a mix up on the student advisors end. I had not taken all the classes I needed to get into the program and I did not find out until it was too late. Entry into the nursing program is only offered in the spring semester and because I didn't not make the deadline this year, I have to wait basically take a semester off. i know entry in the program is not only based upon grades but they are very very important."
College Sophomore,2,the food was not that great. I spent a lot of money eating off campus. And the dining hall seemd to keep strange hours. not to mention that it is only 1. 
College Freshman,2,The wireless network on campus is of horrible quality. The computer labs are often always full and even though they are equipped with printers you must provide your own paper. 
College Freshman,2,"North Carolina Central University is located in rural Durham. I am from Charlotte which the city, therefore the atmosphere is not nearly anything I am used to. "
College Freshman,2,At North Carolina Central University trying to receive your financial aid is a absolute hassle! Waiting in the office just to talk to someone can take almost hours and calling on the phone could take even longer! After you endure the waiting game and talking to people who seem to care less you will receive your aid but it is just annoying to deal with.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of off-campus violence that tends to be brought on-campus and put students in great danger for no reason. It a lot of people who do not attend the college but are always on the college campus. The campus security sends out emails but sometimes they are at the last minute which is not very useful at all. And there are sometimes that I do not feel safe on campus at all, especially when I have late classes at night. Just walking from the library to the classroom feels dangerous sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,It cost about $300 per semester and you can barely find parking near your classes or your dorm room and if you say off campus its worst because you have to spend at least a hour and a half trying to find a empty parking spot
College Freshman,2,This school allows absolutely no drinking or drugs. Even coming back on campus while drunk counts. 
College Freshman,2,The only options close by is Burger King. Everything else requires driving off at least a mile or 2. For delivery there are only 2 places that will. Other than that there is nothing. 
College Sophomore,2,"It's North Carolina. The weather is often very unpredictable.. Once it rained so hard any and all steps around campus were turned into waterfalls. I went to class with water filled sneakers, and I was completely drenched. Rain boots and umbrellas are a great investment on any campus not just ours."
College Senior,2,The campus shuttle only runs during the day so at night if anyone needs assistance back to their building there's no one to help.
College Sophomore,2,Restaurants in the Durham area attracts many students. Being one of three colleges in the area NCCU has its beneficial discounts in some restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,It is really average because buses run at a certain time and stop at a certain time and it is really inconvenient because there are many places where you want to go at a certain time and transportation will kill you if you do not have enough money for a taxi.
College Sophomore,2,Outside of our school there is a burger king and a churchs chicken. Both are not very good at all and not to add that the employees are rude and dont even want to serve you. Cost wise they are reasonable but the quality of the food is just not up to par and is not healthy for you at all.
College Junior,2,The school would be much better if it was in a nicer environment
College Junior,2,There are only two off campus apartments that work with students ( all bills included )
College Junior,2,There are a few eateries near campus but the neighborhood isn't safe to be walking to. There is a Burger King which is about a 15 minute walk from the other side of campus. There are two eat in restaurants down the street from the school and a Church's Chicken two minutes next to the eat in restaurants.
College Freshman,2,"It is really hard to find good parking spots, but they do have shuttle services from the student lots."
College Freshman,2,"I myself do not do drugs but I am on the football team and 20% of our players failed. It is not hard to purchase marijuana. It is also not hard to get caught. They let alcohol slide. But if you are wondering around past 11pm, campus police will most likely question and test you."
College Freshman,2,"If you enroll to NCCU, you would want to purchase a laptop or iPad. The computer labs are usually full and the printers get jammed pretty often. Wifi here is pretty good."
College Freshman,2,"NCCU is not really diverse. Many african americans. Most caucasians are at the Law department. Religous wise it is predominantly Baptsit and Protestant. Many gospel concerts occur on campus. Politcally, there are very little republicans. NCCU campaigned for President Obama pretty strongly. Sexual Orientation, it is mixed but most people are very accepting."
College Freshman,2,You will find a plethora of men and women at my school but the majority of them do not really seem to be worried about school itself. Most are preoccupied with what party is going on for the night. There are some pretty well dressed people on campus but the majority of people dress as if they are at home relaxing. The social life however is great there are plenty of people to meet
College Senior,2,"The cost for a permit is roughly $400 total for two semesters. Many students on campus do not fiind this to be reasonable. While they do have easier access to parking spots with this permit, the price is too high. Students have had to park around the neighborhood to avoid the prices."
College Junior,2,"The permit costs are way too high, and it does not gurantee you a parking spot. Even with a parking permit you still have restricted areas where you can not park"
College Junior,2,"This is North Carolina so the weather is very bi-polar here, but on the days that is nice out we get out and enjoy the day, you may see some greeks and other organizations having various events"
College Freshman,2,"We have a lot of the same food every day (pizza, hamburgers, fries,etc). The food is normally good however. The healthy options that we have are usually not healthy. 
The good thing about the meal plan is that you can use it in different dining facilities around campus such as The Eagle's Nest and others where you can get Pizza Hut, W.O.W., Starbucks, and others."
College Junior,2,"The guys and girls at my school some dress with loose clothes but maybe 1 out of 25 guys might wear his pants below his butt.  1 out of 25 girls may dress like she is going to the club.  The community is really close because everyone know somebody that know somebody because we only have about 8,600 students."
College Junior,2,You are required to keep a 2.0 to remain at North Carolina Central University.  We are on the 10-point scale.
College Freshman,2,"They have really good scholarships and grants for North Carolina residents and athletes. Unfortunately, if you are a nonathletic 'out-of-stater', like myself, there is very little money they are willing to give you. The process, to even get the little they are offering, is tedious and intimidating."
College Freshman,2,Campus has international students but I've never met one. I see students from different backgrounds while walking to class but I've never had the chance of sitting down and talking to them.
College Freshman,2,Their aren't many different races here at NCCU. We are one of the least diverse HBCU's.
College Freshman,2,"This school is located near the Urban environment and a couple of robberies happen throughout the year. It's not a bad environment, but I don't believe that it is very safe."
College Senior,2,Bland and Repetitive – The food is the same all the time and it is very bland.
College Senior,2,Bad Neighborhood – The area immediately surrounding the school is very shady. I don't recommend going out at night or traveling alone. People get mugged and cars get broken into all the time.
College Senior,2,Computer Lab – I gave our computer lab a C because some of them do not work in the Physical Education department. They also take a long time to boot up.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Painfully Low School Spirit – Varsity sports at NCCU are growing, but are far from reaching the level of support from fans and donors of its peer D1 institutions. The students rarely support the athletic teams over the larger adjacent universities and the facilities are poor.  
The teams' performance is at best average on the conference level and poor on the national level."
College Sophomore,2,"Exam Time – Our library is the only place to study for your exams, with the exception of the study rooms in the dorms. This past spring semester, the A/C was not working in the library, and dorms so there was really nowhere else to study. "
Works Here,1,"NCCU is a horrible place to work.  It’s a very toxic and stressful environment full of micro managers that are paid large salaries, but underpaid staff do all the work. A place where people with high school educations get paid more than people with degrees. At NCCU, everyone is related to one person or another. Nepotism runs high here and it seems that all the dumb cousins have high positions. One of the red-headed step-child institutions of the UNC systems."

Junior,1,Horrible the professors lack the compassion for anything pertaining to students and they do not care for us
Freshman,1,"What is your overall opinion of this school? 
This place has a beautiful campus, and a few passionate students and professors. Everything else, however, is a mess. The party culture overtakes everything else and it’s all that people worry on. The student culture is just obsessed with partying, drugs, drinking, and relationships. This is just like high school all over again, with the same drama and fights."
Junior,1,I never liked attending Central. I felt that in my experience at the university the teachers never cared about learning enough which is why i have made a decision to attend a religious private school instead.
College Sophomore,1,I WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL BEFORE I TRANSFERRED AND KINF OF WAS UNHAPPY.
College Freshman,1,"Idk if it where I reside, but my housemates are very messy which causes us to have to pay extra fees. They have even taken out trash can out of the bathrooms. The janitors do not do a good job cleaning the hallways, like I know people here are grown, but that's their job. They shouldn't leave stuff on the floor. They never refill the soap dispensers , and there is hardly any tissue. The CA never does her job cause the hall Is always noisy!   The cost i think is suitable, but the living environment is the worse!"
College Sophomore,1,My experience at the school was good but the only thing holding me back from completely staying and attending school is the amount of tuition I'm paying. I'm an out of state student and its tough paying out of pocket each semester. Every semester I find a way to get it paid but I cannot continue doing this each semester.
College Sophomore,1,The only off campus restaurant is Burger King and everyone gets tired of eating that.
College Sophomore,1,"My $500 phone was stolen, along with dozens of other students. Some students have been robbed at gun point. If its dark, walk with a group of friends, even though I have still heard about groups still being robbed by another group. They are people from the surrounding neighborhoods, and many crime alerts happen, usually 3 a week."
College Senior,1,Parking can be real rough especially at the beginning of the semester.  But the real problem is when the landscapers park their vehicles in the spots we pay for.  The parking real expensive as well costs $300.00 dollars a year.
College Sophomore,1,he local area of the school is not safe. Cars get broken into all the time.
College Junior,1,Parking passes are really expensive and even if you pay all that money for one then you are still liable to get towed because there are only certain places you can park. There is limited parking around school if you do not have a parking pass. Even then you are somewhat likely to get a ticket for $50. There is not very much to do on campus sometimes so it's good to have a car but being there makes you not want to go through the hassle of having one.
College Freshman,1,We dont have any to offer according to the financial aid office which I have visited several times. Upon looking online the only scholarships available were for the nursing program.
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife is usually quiet and boring at North Carolina Central, especially on the weekends because everyone goes home."
College Freshman,1,You can ride the number five bus for free with your student i.d but it only goes on its route if you want to go to other places like the mall you must get on a different bus and pay. Other than that getting off campus without a car is hard if you want to go a great distance.
College Junior,1,We do not have a lot of events on campus to engage the students. We have bowling and movie night. There is nothing to do on campus and students often go to house parties off campus through word of mouth.
College Freshman,1,"There isn't much diversity in food choices, but it does taste pretty good. "
College Senior,1,"There is only one restaurant immediately outside of the campus, and that's Burger King."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Crime and Safety – durham, nc is a very unsafe city and multiple crimes occur around campus daily"

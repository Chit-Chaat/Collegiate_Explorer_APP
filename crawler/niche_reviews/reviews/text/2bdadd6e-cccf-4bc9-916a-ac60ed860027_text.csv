Sophomore,5,"Foothill has been a great experience so far. It’s a campus I was already very familiar with and it’s not too big or small. My favorite thing about Foothill is the support they offer to students. As a student with mental health issues, I have felt completed support 100%. Foothill has a disability resource center that helps students with all kinds of things. They offer therapists, computers on loan, and work with you to find the best plan for your major. Often whenever I was having a bad day I would drop by in tears and immediately someone would jump up to check on me. I even dropped in before an exam I was worried about and left completely confident that I would ace the exam. Foothill is a great college."
Alum,5,Classes were flexible with options of all online or hybrid. Teacher office hours are helpful and accommodating. Different centers for tutoring available to everyone
Alum,5,Very diverse and inclusive. There are a lot of clubs to join and events planned. Different help available for tuition
Junior,5,"The concept of community college must not be underestimated. The rewards and results of participating in an educational system are derived from the students efforts, and lesser of what one believes of the standards a professor holds. Community college beyond all else, provides a fruitful learning environment––conducive for all walks of life to develop their drive for learning. This is very valuable. The drive to learn is paramount in the initiation of ones higher-educational studies, since albeit other colleges may have materially higher standards and content, some of those who jump to 4-year universities fail and drop out for lack of drive. Foothill College provides the means for enjoying ones education and allowing a student whom have struggled or excelled in high school, take further ownership of their learning, thus allowing no material educational standard to faze them."
Junior,5,"The content was dense and fruitful, and the professor put a strong effort to connect with their students even behind the digital wall. This be only one class, and it is recognized that such opinion of the online learning is complete with experience, I find it very good."
Sophomore,5,It was very easy to take classes online. Professors demonstrate their confidence of use of Canvas and other platforms.
Sophomore,5,Beautiful campus and welcoming faculty. They really are there to help in any way. Take advantage of all of the resources and network with the wonderful faculty
Sophomore,5,"I loved my experience at Foothill College, and highly encourage returning or high school students to consider attending this college. I was a low-income, first-gen student with no idea on how to navigate higher education. I came here because of Foothill Promise, which is two years of FREE tuition AND book costs. they have a food pantry which is a lot more accessible and higher quality than other community colleges as well as four-year universities due to their concentration on solving food insecurity in their students. Campus had a good atmosphere because it is all trees and nature, so it was nice to look at it and be on campus. Immersive campus culture and had a very active student government/club life which is VERY rare in community colleges. Overall, I loved attending here because of the college administrations' personal investment in their students and equity work. Attending UCLA for the next two years as a transfer student, due to their TAP program and great counseling!"
Junior,5,Teachers are super helpful and classes are easy to understand. Definitely learn a lot as well. I've been able to take beginning programming classes and do well.
Junior,5,"I've attended several colleges over the last 10 years and I have to say the classes and teachers at this college are unparalleled. The teacher are enthusiastic and care about their students learning experience and the wide variety of classes are amazing. The other school programs that are offered to students such as the food pantry for those in need, to the clubs on campus, to even the library are the best I've seen thus far"
Sophomore,5,I really like this college as they have many resources to help students in need. They offer a lot of tutoring and online courses.
Junior,5,I'm currently still studying at Foothill College but I really enjoyed my time there because I met really great people including professors! I think choosing to go to community college was the right decision for me and I'm really happy with my experience at Foothill. The campus is also really nice!
Freshman,5,"Good academics, helpful teachers and staff; nice campus and students friendly also.  Lots of classes online and offers many degrees. The President is very approachable and cares about making the school a better place. She reaches out to students.  Overall an excellent school.  They also offer one 4 year degree (pilot program in California) for Dental Hygiene. Only 15 community colleges were selected to do this. This is a 2 year community college that offers opportunities."
Niche User,5,"I took one online class during my sophomore high school year. It was a beginners digital arts class. Even though I already knew how to draw digital art at the time, I was able to learn new skills and experience a college class for the first time. The experience to see students of varying ages and art styles was refreshing and fun. The class was also free."
Freshman,5,Foothill has helped me get back on track ever since going back to school and they have been so supportive in my journey.
Junior,5,I really like the campus environment at Foothill because it’s very green. I also like that Foothill offers a good variety of online classes along with in-person classes. Overall I’ve had good expereicnes with most of my professors and counselors .
Sophomore,5,"This campus has the most stairs that I have ever seen, and you will definitely get a workout while trying to get to your classes on time. Cafeteria food is better than expected, and professors here are great!"
Freshman,5,The campus is great and I really enjoy the disability resource center they do an amazing job. The sped 8 class is also a great intro for incoming disabled students.
Freshman,5,"It has a beautiful campus, that is always kept clean. They offer a variety of programs, that can serve beneficial to future careers, especially in the health science field."
Niche User,5,"Foothill College was an amazing community college I went too. I had one class at De Anza College but I really preferred Foothill. The stairs were hard at first but then it got easier later on throughout each quarter. I had a really fun time with EOPS, they helped me a lot with books and being there for me when I was struggling with classes to choose from. I didn't know what to major in and wasn't sure if I was taking the right classes. Everyone is nice and helpful and they worry about every student and if they are taking the correct classes, they are also worried about student's health so if we ever felt stressed out or felt anything else to go to the counselings and talk about anything."
Junior,5,"Foothill is full of amazing teachers and faculty. I've made lifelong connections and learned life lessons in my years there. The campus is beautiful, and makes a full-time student schedule sustainable. The support is truly there for you. Some teachers and counselors could stand to be less harsh on their busy, working, parenting students, but overall I am happy with my experience and the quality of education I have received there."
Freshman,5,Extremely inspirational campus. The professors genuinely care about the quality of the material and if students are understanding. The student involvement is very high and very encouraged through their weekly events on campus.
Alum,5,"This is a very excellent school for a community college. However, it is still a community college. The academics are great here, and this school is as challenging as a four year university (trust me on that). The social scene isn't that great here. The key difference between a CC and a university in terms of social scene, is that you live on or near campus with a bunch of students. Also, at a university there are many more resources, clubs, and social events. However, it is definitely possible to make connections and friendships at this school. You just have to be super proactive in your classes, in clubs, or outside activities."
Graduate Student,5,"Foothill has been a great three years, it has opened many opportunities for me to further my education. Foothill has been a great source of connection from teachers, to the athletic director and my football coaches. I definitely matured at foothill and found my purpose."
Freshman,5,"My review only concerns the online distant education programs. There are many choices in online coursework, most of them are 100% online. Courses materials are provided on the school's online platform Canvas. Professors have high credentials and are personable, they always make sure that students are getting all the help they need, and no one is left behind. If student truly focuses on the coursework, the success rate can be very high."
Freshman,5,Foothill is one of the best community colleges sou could possible find. It is filled with amazing opportunities  to grow and learn as a person and as a student. The teachers give tremendous amount of support.
Alum,5,I took classes at Foothill through their extensive online course offerings. I had incredible professors who were very accessible and helpful despite the distance learning situation. I discussed course concerns & questions with my professors over email and some over Zoom (video chat) and through their responsiveness and commitment to my learning I felt I had genuine connections with a few of them. I received an award through Foothill and even had teachers offer to write me recommendations.  If you are a motivated student who needs flexibility I highly recommend taking classes at Foothill online.
Sophomore,5,The counselors at foothill are AMAZING they made the transferring process very easy! the professors are so amazing and easy going .
Freshman,5,"I like the amount of freedom and accessibility you have with the school, it gives you a good amount of opportunities and activities to take advantage of."
Junior,5,"It is an amazing place to study because they have great professors who are ready to help anytime. The classes offered are also amazing and there is a lot of variety in them. In STEM classes, I believe Foothill is the strongest and has the most resources for it."
Freshman,5,"The campus is lovely and surrounded by trees. The professors are high quality and kind. The campus itself is nice and pretty, with a very nice library with a quiet zone for studying."
Alum,5,"Although I initially disliked the seemingly endless stairs to get to the main campus, I began to appreciate the workout and interacting with incredibly warm faculty and peers as a transfer student. There are incredibly helpful resources and even flyers posted around campus to remind students of them. Overall, I would rate my experience as a student at Foothill College a 10/10!"
Sophomore,5,"Foothill College has a great accessible college level education requirement. For all of the classes I have taken, the professors are great teachers whom take interest in their student's success."
Sophomore,5,"Foothill has been the best community college to go to. When I was in high school I went to a neighboring community college to complete my high school and double up on college units, but once I transferred to Foothill, many more programs and even incredible fellow student connections have been found. A school is professor and course quality + networking with students (future co workers!), which Foothill really provides. I can't say enough about the college."
Sophomore,5,"Foothill has been so helpful both to and for me. Their services and support have helped me through homelessness, food insecurity, and depression. The food pantry, psychological services, and the ASFC have all been incredible to me. I can hardly ask for a better school. Sadly, there are budget cuts and many classes being cancelled. Hopefully Foothill can find a way to keep many of the important classes running regularly."
Sophomore,5,"The engineering department puts in a lot of effort in getting students to learn the material. There are a variety of STEM clubs on campus, like Women in STEM, Engineering Club, Chemistry Club, Computer Science Club, etc. to get people involved in student life."
Junior,5,"I have been to Foothill College for two years now and I am glad to say I will be transferring. Foothill has a successful transfer rate and are very helpful with helping you get an education plan started, if you need tutoring and help with financial aid."
Junior,5,"Professors, campus, and students were great. Professors are enthusiastic and there to help. Campus is absolutely beautiful, sometimes I just find a spot to sit and think. Many facilities to help a student succeed in any course they're enrolled in. Students are quite respectful of the campus grounds, so it stays relatively clean. Also, I feel safe walking through the campus and parking lots early in the morning or late at night. However, you have to drive off campus for good food."
Sophomore,5,"I just recently started attending Foothill College and I absolutely love it. The teachers and counselors are great and informative. The classes are easy to find and interesting. They have many classes and programs available at this school. Lastly, Los Altos Hills is a beautiful area! I transferred here to apply to one of the programs that this school offers!"
Sophomore,5,"It is an amazing college. First of all, It has a beautiful campus. It is surrounded by green hills and you feel great when you enter the campus and see the fascinating view. They have some good program and teachers are so experienced. If you are trying to transfer a 4- year university, it would be a good choice to start here. I am a stem major and the college has a great stem center, if you are having a problem with your classes, they helped you enormously. Besides that, they have other places that you can get help. I think Foothill college does everything to make you successful. The only problem for me is, the campus is not so active but I think it is normal since it is a community college. I definitely recommend this college, my experience so far is awesome."
Junior,5,I've been attending Foothill College for about 2 years and I really enjoy my overall experience there. My favorite part about this college is the STEM center that they offer 7 days a week. The tutors are very helpful and guided me through questions I have trouble with. I found this resource to be most helpful during finals week because I'm given a place to study at my own pace and get help when needed. The atmosphere at Foothill is also a lot more open and relaxing than the other community colleges I've visited which I really enjoy.
Freshman,5,"It's pretty great, except you have to take initiative to get involved in things. Seek out all of the opportunities you catch wind of, join clubs, search for on campus internships, etc. Don't expect these things to search for themselves! Single best piece of advice is to join student government, it will open up all sorts of additional opportunities. Plenty of ways to make friends although you likely will meet them in activities outside of class. And don't lose track of your transfer goals! Setting a plan in advance is the single best way of guaranteeing that you will only need to stay at Foothill for two years before transferring."
Sophomore,5,I would like to see more computer science professors that have actual work experience not just teaching experience.
Freshman,5,"I am an international student. My first quarter was quite difficult, because I did no know how the US educational system works as well as mental barriers. I went to a few departments seeking help and in all of them I was treated with respect. Foothill college has been a wonderful bridge between my education and how I deal with challenges. I did right picking up Foothill College as my first college in the US."
Sophomore,5,"Foothill is a really awesome college. Getting involved on campus has definitely made my experience all the more meaningful. I would advise students to take advantage of the resources that the campus has to offer early, for it makes the process towards earning a degree, certificate, or transferring much more intuitive. I also advise students to do everything they can to socialize with others. The social environment at Foothill is fair, but there's always room for improvement!"
Graduate Student,5,"Foothill has been my college for my first two years in college before transferring. I graduated in Biochemistry at UC Davis and later decided to take a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering. Foothill is where I chose to complete my missing undergraduate Engineering courses. The classes here are often not full, so much less frustration to register for classes compared to other campuses I have been to. Classes are also generally easier. Plus, the scene here is beautiful; the campus is super nice and clean - it is quite all the time; and the staff, especially the STEM center, is very helpful. They want you to succeed. This is the place to go."
Sophomore,5,"Great instructors, beautiful campus, strong curriculum, good resources. Commuter school so poor social life, dorm rating N/A because they do not offer housing. Extremely affordable."
Freshman,5,"Foothill is a great Community College and what makes it an incredible school is how everyone is friendly and nice. Also, the faculty and students have a connection where the students feel as if they were reading to ask any question the students know that the faculty is ready to help."
Senior,5,"I love most of the professors, they help you prepare for a four year university. They are very challenging and fair at grading. The environment is green and homey. The library is a great resource and has many places to study-it was my second home. The counselors are awesome and very knowledgeable. The transfer center is very helpful and the staff there are friendly and easy going. The disability resource center are very organized, they really care about their students, they easy to talk to, they help us with our accommodations, and do a lot more for us. The veterans office are a group of people who care and is a safe and positive environment."
Sophomore,5,"Foothill is an excellent transfer school. Great, kind professors who genuinely care about their students' success."
Alum,5,Beautiful Campus with marvelous teachers. The honors program is particularly helpful in getting students into their dream 4-year universities.
Freshman,5,"Foothill has opened a lot of doors for me and made possible for me to follow my dreams. Being part of the Honors program at Foothill College gave me the opportunity to participate in the UCLA TAP which raises my chances of being admitted up to 97% just by maintaining a 3.3GPA, and I'm transferring with a 4.0GPA! 
Thank you Foothill College!"
Alum,5,I went back-and-forth between Foothill College and De Anza College but I finished my community college years at Foothill and got a transfer degree from them. I'm in a lot of great teachers here and it was a fairly easy getting to any class I wanted to. There was a lot of's great support with the stem Center and teachers. I learned a lot of new skills thanks to the school.
Sophomore,5,"Foothill college was an excellent stepping stone towards applying to a 4 year school.  The diversity of the campus was refreshing, from all nations around the world, and age groups.  The instruction was superb.  Instructors were mostly well vetted, with on line class options and multiple times for working adults.  I would highly recommend Foothill to anyone seeking either a specific entry into a field such as EMT, Nursing or Vet Science, to completing lower level general education as a gateway to a 4 year school."
Sophomore,5,I have received the best education and guidance at Foothill than any of the other two schools I have attended. I was challenged and pushed for more. I would not be as successful as I am not if I had not attended.
Niche User,5,"So I'm a middle college student and in all honesty, it saved my life. I wouldn't have lasted through traditional high school and definitely would have dropped out if I hadn't been welcomed into the community. I love it at Foothill, the classes are interesting and engaging, the campus is beautiful and the students are friendly, and I actually enjoy going to school again."
Niche User,5,When I was driving up to Foothill it was so amazing. It's so green! And when I got to the campus it was so beautiful. It's a great school to transfer from. The teachers are amazing they care about you and your academics.
Niche User,5,"Excellent Community College in Los Altos Hills! Georgeous campus, great professors, very diverse student body. A very supportive environment for younger students."
College Sophomore,5,The school has been convenient to me so far. I didn't have any hassles or frustrations with the experiences at Foothill College yet.
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are usually small and I love it because the professors will know everyone. They will care about their students. I had the best experiences with all of my professors. I learned about what is important in life. They teach their students the subjects we need to know but they also teach things such as motivation and success. It helps motivate students to do better. The professors are more understanding and friendly.
Freshman,4,I am an upcoming freshman for this Fall of 2020. So far I have had such an easy time adjusting to a new space compared to high school. I do admit that some of the counselors are a bit difficult to communicate with and are cranky but it just takes time to find the right one for you. There are also so many opportunities for preventing debt or any kind of money issue so I suggest that you all do your research and have friends/family that can help you along the way.
Freshman,4,"The fall quarter has not started yet but as far as I can see, there will be no problem in being taught online."
Junior,4,Foothill offers a lot of online classes. I've only had positive experiences with them mostly because the professors do their best to keep students engaged. That usually means reminders about what's due and a thorough syllabus at the beginning to know what to expect. Generally there's a lot of reading and discussion posts involved. I don't like that there's never really any lecture portion. It's much easier to be able to talk to a professor directly and ask questions and they don't offer that unless it's one hour a week during their office hours.
Junior,4,"Foothill is a great community college. There's a lot of highly educated professors that are really passionate about what they are teaching and many really care about the success of their students. It's located in the Los Altos Hills which is an expensive area. The school is also tucked away which is inconvenient if you're tired of cafeteria food. Any restaurants or grocery stores are maybe a 10-15 minute drive away. Because of that, I reduced one star but overall it's great. It does lack camaraderie but I think that's just because it's a community college. Many international students tend to stick within their own group which can be problematic when required to pair up in class. Not sure if it's language or cultural barriers but it happens, specifically in math classes. Overall, it's hard to make friends here so join a club if you can. 
If you're a STEM student, the STEM center was usually a great place to study and get help. During finals, it stays open until about 10PM pre-covid."
Sophomore,4,It’s been great except for one or two professors who don’t respond to email or grade until after the midterm.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I was really happy with the education I got at Foothill. The staff is generally really friendly, and the president constantly is having events, handing out free boba, etc so there is definitely a sense of community that I personally feel is really lacking in a lot of community colleges. If you wanna make friends easily take a theatre class or join the theatre club everyone there is super nice in my experience."
Sophomore,4,I love that there is so much opportunity to take classes online at foothill. I'll admit I do have mixed feelings - I have taken genuinely awesome online classes (shout out to History professor Steve Batham and Prof. Provost who teaches philosophy - both amazing) but I have also taken mediocre and poor online classes here. Positive outweighs the negative tho.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are very lenient when you message them and explain your situation. In my experience, the professors are trying their best to respond to the COVID-19 by being reasonable and lenient with deadlines. Understandably, some professors may not be the most technologically informed and may be not as responsive now that everything is online and they have a higher volume of online students to attend to."
Sophomore,4,"Foothill college is the #1 online college. I really like that they offer many online courses, since I have a job."
Junior,4,"Foothill college is a very good ""bang for it's buck"". For the cost you pay it is very much worth it. There is a large class diversity, and age diversity which is nice. The location is absolutely beautiful, and I have never had a class be too full for me to take."
Senior,4,Easy to use website. Canvas online learning is easy to navigate. The instuctors are helpful. There are scheduled meeting times online for virtual meetings. The office responds fast to emails. Easy to register with payment arrangements of 3 payments.
Freshman,4,"Amazing college. All the teachers I've met so far are kind, supportive, and just wonderful! The library and the STEM center is open throughout most of the day for students to relax and study if they have nowhere to go, or if they have to wait for the bus."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus and the classes are fairly entertaining in. I don't participate in the ""nightlife"" so I don't know how that is but there are various activities and events throughout the week for day students."
Sophomore,4,"Foothill college has great academic programs for students to utilize whenever they need it. There are really good students there and clubs for students or incoming students to join if they are interested. I recommend if you need to start somewhere and as well if need to save money for college too if considering a community college. They also have a great scholarship program that can have California students get their first year of college covered by meeting the criteria of requirements for be able to be eligible. Overall, it is a really good school. 10 out of 10 rating for this school."
Junior,4,"One of the best aspects of Foothill Community College by far is how incredible the professors are. Currently I am a homeless student at Foothill College, in my personal experience I have found all of my professors extremely compassionate and willing to go above and beyond to accommodate my success."
Freshman,4,"Foothill is a very good school. Even though it is only a community college it has very good teachers, and the counselors are very good with helping you create a transfer plan. There are a lot of opportunities for those who want to get involve with clubs or sport teams but no one will look down on you if you choose to not to get involved with them."
Niche User,4,"Offers very good summer programs.

Facilities are right there when you need them.

Good campus scene and friendly professors."
Senior,4,"the teachers are great but needs to offer more classes instead of offering in there sister college. Calming campus, plenty of seating outside and plenty of resources when you need to ask for help. STEM courses as there is tutoring for both lower level and upper-level courses in all of the subjects. Good variety of classes and the best STEM center I have heard of. The STEM center is also open on weekends as well during the fall, winter and spring quarters."
Freshman,4,"I came to Foothill because it is known to not be impacted like many other schools. I also heard that it is easier to get classes and transfer faster. Although, I would like to see more class options because due to budget cuts we are cutting classes many would enjoy taking."
Freshman,4,Foothill is a beautiful and huge campus with a ton full of stairs. The teachers and staff are super helpful and make sure your college experience is the best. The teachers take their time to make sure you understand the curriculum. The staff such as the councilors make sure you get the help you need and the questions you have get answered.
Sophomore,4,"The school is very beautiful. Lots of nature, landscapes, and modern classrooms. The teachers vary in quality and difficulty, but I found it very easy to find good teachers for every subject. The parking is a little difficult at times, but that is true for any college. It is much better than De Anza Community College in my opinion, which is the alternative community college to Foothill. I really enjoy my time here and I'm glad I chose this school to attend."
Freshman,4,"Foothill College provides students a lot opportunities to transfer to good 4 years College. Generally, the professors are good. They are a little bit strict on students, but I know that is actually good for us."
Freshman,4,"First and foremost, the campus is amazing. It’s this combination of nature and modern schools that you’ll just love. Second , the food is a lot better than most schools food so if you your high school food was bad, don’t worry the foothill cafe won’t let you down. And lastly , I enjoy the liberty of choosing your schedule since most of us have jobs in the weekend or through out the week. So to have that flexibility is just another plus ."
Junior,4,"The class sizes are usually 40 or less people, which gives you the opportunity to really connect with not only your classmates but your professors as well. Often times you take classes for your major you'll end up having the same classmates which is nice. The financial aid department can be a little behind at times which is frustrating for someone who is a recipient and needs it to attend college, but other than that I love this school."
Freshman,4,"Although I have only attended Foothill College for one quarter, I must applaud the college for having an easily approachable administration. Unlike many other colleges in the Bay Area, Foothill does not suffer from the same degree of overpopulation and impaction. As a result, the administration can give the moderately-sized student body more attention because there aren't as many students requiring assistance. In my experience, the counseling department does a great job at acclimating new students to the college atmosphere. In particular, students who plan to transfer to a 4-year university can rely on the counseling department to lead them in the right direction by creating an educational plan that ensures they meet the transfer requirements in a timely manner. A few gripes I have with Foothill include the fact that the college is a bit secluded so there isn't much to do in the area and that even with a small student body, the parking lots can fill up quite quickly."
Junior,4,Good school with lots of diversity. All the teachers are super nice and helpful. The vet tech course is great.
Senior,4,It is overall a great school. The campus is beautiful with lots of trees. I have encountered many great professors that really encourage us to learn.
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful. The only drawback is how many stairs there are on the campus. Most of the professors I have had have been good. I had a few that did not know what they were taking about and could never answer questions that the students had. Overall I have had a great experience here.
Senior,4,Foothill college is located on top of a hill with a beautiful scenery. There are no dorms at this campus due to the fact that it is a community college. Therefore there is no party scene to see but if you are looking for a college that will support you and help you with school then I recommend foothill for that especially since it is a lot cheaper then most colleges and has a high reputation.
College Junior,4,"The classes usually fit my schedule, and there's always spaces for the classes that I want."
College Junior,4,"Teachers are there to help when you need them, same with students."
College Junior,4,The class size is perfect for a student-teacher interaction. It's more focused on learning and understanding individually.
College Junior,4,They have plenty of student jobs available and there's programs like dental assistant at this school.
College Junior,4,"By taking my pre requisites to transfer to CSUs, I also meet people who are in my major, which is a plus, because they can help me out."
College Junior,4,"It's a clean school, everything is up to date and they always renovate to make things better. All my teachers have been great at teaching their subject. Students are easy going. They have a variety of classes."
College Freshman,4,Foothill offers a lot of opportunities for students to get help in school and the job market. They have a STEM center with many tutors available to you.
College Sophomore,4,"The great thing about online courses is the fact that you can work on them wherever you are and whenever you are available. There are times when you cannot make it to class when you are sick. When taking an online class, you have a longer period of time to take the test. The workload depends on the classes. I think one of the downfall is the fact that you won't be able to interact with the professor as much or with other students."
College Sophomore,4,Learning Japanese can be quite confusing at times but our program has tutors that you can request. It helps me improve my conversational skills. The teachers are all great too.
College Sophomore,4,Great online course options. Particularly enjoyed a web marketing class which was very fun and interactive
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, the professors were fantastic and interesting to talk to in and outside of the class"
College Freshman,4,There is always updates and announcements for post-graduate services.
College Freshman,4,Great Job opportunities. The courses you take will prepare you for  your dream career
College Freshman,4,The professors are great .
College Senior,4,Online classes are ideal with my busy schedule. Foothill has plenty of options for a variety of topics in regards to online courses. My professors for all online courses I've taken were just as engaged with my learning as those I've taken in-person.
College Senior,4,"My counselor really broke down all the options I had in terms of transferring and what I need to get done in order to get to my desired career. I didn't have any experience with alumni, though."
College Sophomore,4,my major is chemical engineering
College Junior,4,"So far, it is fine, but staff are really not communicative."
College Junior,4,Teachers are friendly and willing to help student.
College Junior,4,Most of  my experience at Foothill has been good. I've learned it's good to ask questions and to ask for help  from other sources if the teacher has decided not to lecture.
College Junior,4,"You have graduated High School but you have no clue what career suits you? Neither did I and foothill's best quality is being able to explore your interests more! I have taken classes in all the fields that appealed to me and after 4 changes in major over the past year, I have it figured out. I didn't feel like I was wasting my money or time because all those classes counted for GE. Foothill is a great choice for anyone without a set career or even someone with one. It is affordable and easy going for new comers!"
College Senior,4,I've had a great experience with the professors of my classes. They are all very lively in class and in the subject they are teaching.
College Senior,4,There are many times offered for classes but they do fill up quickly.
College Senior,4,"I've only taken a hybrid class, so half of it is online. So far it is great and very manageable. The course load isn't too bad."
College Senior,4,the class sizes are small and the teachers are very focused on the classes
College Senior,4,My major is very popular at my school and my school offers a wide variety of classes geared towards my major.
College Senior,4,There is a great support system. Many counselors and tutors are available. It is very easy to talk to teachers as well.
College Senior,4,Helpful administration and a large library.
College Senior,4,"While I can imagine it is not right for everybody, my personal experience at this school has been great. The majority of teachers are friendly, open and dedicated to their work. Class sizes are decent, especially if they are very specific subjects. As one of the better funded community colleges, foothill offers a wide range of coursework and n my experience tteachersa re more concerned with making sure you learn than giving you busy work"
College Senior,4,"Being in the SF bay area, the school is pretty diverse and draws people from all ethnicities in. We get a lot of international students, typically from various east Asian countries. Beyond ethnic diversity, political leaning is certainly towards the left, but I don't think you would have a hard time her as a conservative. Can't say about religious diversity, people don't talk much about their religion. Again being the the bay area, sexual diversity is present and LGBT couples are most often open and accepted. The school, as a community college, draws from plenty of economic backgrounds, and age is also pretty diverse. In some classes the mean age would be closer to 35-40"
College Senior,4,"As a community college, tuition is pretty reasonable. Out of state it is significantly more expensive but still much more affordable than a 4 year school. I am not aware of the qaulity of financial aid on campus"
College Sophomore,2,Not very many of my credits transfered even thought the syllabuses were very similar.
College Sophomore,2,Community colleges lack an engaged alumni base.
College Sophomore,2,"The curriculum is no problem, however the location is a bit of a hassle based on my home location. But its a 50/50 situation because of online availability for classes."
College Senior,2,"It takes some work finding student genuinely interested in learning, but they do exist! Surround yourself with those circles and Foothill will be a transformative experience!"
College Junior,2,"I can't really give it a meaningful grade, since my major is psychology for transfer. I don't actually have classes related to my major--they're all GE classes and the courses required for me to transfer to UCSD. However, if you're planning the same route as me, know that you must take MATH 1-C, which are calculus classes. Also, Foothill has psychology courses that would be nice to take just because you're that interested in your field. For me, I definitely want to take psychobiology."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm the type of guy who prefers to be in a classroom learning things from a professor. When I took an online class it was very straightforward. You read a textbook, you answer questions on a quiz and then post a comment on a discussion board. I however couldn't really stand these classes because I can't really sit down and read a textbook and learn a lot about the material. I need that teacher that interacts with the students and can answer my questions right away. Whereas online when I ask a question it may take up to a day to get a response and teachers usually don't look at their emails on weekends. Then there's the fact that I end up not doing certain things online because you could come back to it anytime you want and I would forget about the class. For me, the only really nice thing about taking an online class is that you don't have to commute to school."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything is very average, remodeling could definitely be applied to some areas. Library is very old."
College Sophomore,2,The resources are all there and are very average. Nothing special comes to mind and everyone has access to these tools
College Student,2,"Learn How to Study – I am in a situation where I am currently unable to attend classes on campus. I think all of the online classes that I have participated in thus far, have been really good, however I am the type of learner that likes to interact with my peers and professor."
College Freshman,2,"It's Hard – It's hard, because questions can't be fully answered by e-mail."
Niche User,1,the professor just used email and google docs because their online portal was too dated and unwieldy.
Niche User,1,"School gave me a bill 3 years after a was part of a study abroad program due to an accounting error, and refused to take my calls and emails to clear it up."
College Senior,1,People in the position seems to don't know what they're doing
College Freshman,1,The student body does not really contribute very much if anything it feels more like an exclusive group that does not really pay attention to people who are not a part of it. Do not raise awareness enough for students to have the chance to participate.
College Sophomore,1,"All foothill has going for it that might be considered better then other community colleges in the area is the view. Location in los altos hill is very nice, but can be difficult for some to commute to."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Helpful Unless You Are a Computer Science Major – They have all of the basic information available for students to use and learn about certain career paths, but very little help in providing students with hands on work experience in their desired fields of study"
College Junior,1,"It Was a Nightmare. My first online class I took at Foothill was for me, stepping out of my comfort zone. I say that because I need people to stimulate my mind and when people hid behind their profile pictures and expressed themselves behind computers, there was a disconnected and stagnant environment. 

Forget about building any type of relationship with peers or teachers. I don't recommended online courses to those able body peers.

Only a small list of positives. You can go to class anytime of day. The classes are in generally easy to pass, but you only get out of the class what you put in."

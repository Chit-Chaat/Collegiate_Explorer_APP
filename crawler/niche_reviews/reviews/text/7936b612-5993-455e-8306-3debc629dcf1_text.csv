Junior,5,the environment/campus is small but really welcoming and everyone is friendly.and since the class sizes are small it is easy to focus for me.
Junior,5,"yes, because it's very convenient and the professors are very patient and lenient with us students. I honestly think everyone is doing a good job cooperating with the transition to online classes."
Junior,5,"My experience with Washington Adventist has been a roller coaster but I love my school. My university is one of the smaller ones, I love the location of where my school is. The neighborhood is very safe and welcoming.  My classes are a lot smaller so I get to have a personal relationship with my professors which I also love."
Freshman,5,I liked that Washington Adventist brought out a new version of myself more outgoing and the school itself has pushed me to being the best student and version of myself I can be.
Sophomore,5,I love how the teaching involved god and how the professor are really helpful. The nursing program is really good. Iâ€™m happy I get to be on this program.
Sophomore,5,They were helpful and understanding. They were a able when I need help with homework assignments. It was a good experience for my first semester thanking classes online.
Sophomore,5,My experience here at Washington Adventist university has been great.  They have the best of teachers who believe in you and want you to succeed.  The environment is safe have lots of study areas.
Freshman,5,My experience was excellent with all sincerity. I love how Washington Adventist University is located at an elevation with the mountains. I felt the fresh air flowing through my lungs. I had a tour guide who took me to buildings that were remodeled. Their service was not disappointing with all honesty. The ones who attended me were cooperative and non-bias. I had an intimate relationship with a tour guide that taught me some lesson on how to be prudent when it comes to colleges. The thing that disappointed me was how the dooms were in poor condition.
Niche User,5,"The good thing about Washington Adventist university is that it is christian University. One reason is that I Live in Takoma Park MD, so it is a place that I am familiar with. As a result, I knew a good amount about this University before I came. This knowledge of the people who work here as well as the allowed me to feel confident that my education would be in good hands."
Junior,5,"Great school, friendly educators/ teacher ... the nursing program has being great, a lot of learning and teacher are ready to go extra miles to make sure you understand"
Sophomore,5,The experience I have with Washington Adventist University is wonderful. First time registering with the university is a good experience to remember what is expected of me to earn a Baccalaureate degree in nursing. I believe I will a great student here for awhile to achieve my goals.
Freshman,5,"I am a first year transfer nursing student working on bachelors degree. I love the Christ centered approach, small classes and structured learning at this university. I appreciate the support and resources available to me at this campus which allowed me to nail a 3.1 this semester. I would only change the food options and include more variety such as meat."
Freshman,5,"i like that everyone on campus is very helpful and respectful, and we get to grow each day with one another with out feeling judged."
Junior,5,"Last semester at Washington Adventist University was awesome .The professors are good, and the enviroment is very conducive for learning . I have had the best of my accademic at Washington Adventist University ."
Graduate Student,5,My experience was great! Professors were challenging but were always there to help you reach your goals.
College Junior,5,You can get a mix of every culture you want in the area. Very diverse
College Sophomore,5,Do to the fact that it is a Christian University one doesn't face or hear about campus crime. I do get nervous when I leave from night classes after ten and door are not locked. However the most we see is a ticket on an illegally parked car.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is awesome. You have hundreds of neighbors which over time become friends and then like family. They make it so easy for people to move into the dorms and are very well organized on the process of moving people out of them when the time comes.
College Freshman,5,The centers are amazing. They recently invested into upgrading the students study area which is also used for mass on Saturday. So the facilities are well maintained and couldn't get any better.
College Freshman,5,It's amazing they treat you like an individual rather than just another student. Some of these people in. The financial aid office were former graduates of the school so they understand how expensive school can be. They make this process go by super smooth and so easy.
College Freshman,5,The athletics here at WAU are the best for a small university. Everyone on campus loves to go out and see a basketball game or a soccer game at night. Students come from near and far to show support for the shock.
College Freshman,5,The dinning halls are very big and are the place were no one is rejected from a table because of their appearance or because of their race. The food is great and the staff is friendly and feels like family.
College Freshman,5,The average student here at WAU is of any possible race and ethnicity. They are super religious and believe that this university has the history and outstanding experience to help them achieve their life's goal of obtaining a college degree through a school that is so religious based.
College Senior,5,The Washington Adventist University a school that is open to religion.  This is the first college that offer a pray before and after class.
College Senior,5,"Washington Adventist University is an equal diversity and acceptance college.  The school offers great counsel for any topics or help with racial, sexual or student challenges.  There are programs developed in the school that relates to diversity problems if they were to occur.  I have never experienced a problem with the diversity on campus.  The school has all different religious of students and I have not experienced any political or non-acceptance from anyone on the campus."
College Senior,5,"During my tenure at the Washington Adventist University, I feel my safety is not at risk.  The campus security performs routine security checks.  Our campus has a security office that is open 24 hours for the convenience of the students.  The patrol checks give the students and myself confidence that we are protected within the authority of our school safety policies.  In addition to the campus security officers, we have police patrol on campus and the school is less than a mile from the Takoma Police Station."
College Junior,5,I have never experienced any violence nor felt threaten while on  school property.
College Sophomore,5,Absolutely no drinking on campus. probably outside of campus
College Junior,5,This is a christian school therefore drugs are not tolerated (unless prescribed by medical doctor).
College Junior,5,"I attend evening classes.  There is always security in evening and at night when leaving.  Also, there is security rounds for each facility.  When on campus, you must display your badge to show you are a registered student."
College Junior,5,There is always ample parking when I arrive.
College Junior,5,"My major at my school is Business Administration/Management.  My unique aspect of my program will certainly enhance my career as a Contract Specialist for the US goverment. When I receive my degree in Business Administration, I will advance to a management level in my career.  I already have the time and experience, so the only thing that I am lacking is my degree.  I have learned to juggle my education and career workload by seperating my responsibities. It is very difficult with the workload of homework and the workload of my professional responsibilities, so I have to priorities my schedule and devide my time up accordingly.  My curriculum is very outlined by my professors and coordinated extremely well.  The Professors at Washington Adventist University (WAU) always start every class off with a syllabus that each student must follow throughout the class.  The syllabus outlines the class structure, deadlines of assignments/reports, provides grade point structure and have significant details about the student responsibilities."
College Junior,5,Washington Adventist University offers academic programs leading to several degree programs. Degrees are conferred only upon those who satisfactorily complete specific requirements for graduation. The professors are really well known and most of the professors have very long tenure with Washington Adventist University.  The registration process is as normal as it would be for any school registar office.  The requirements to register for WAU is extremely organized and structured.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Central Americans, Caribbean, Africans, Americans, Europeans and etc"
Recent Alumnus,5,Downtown Silver Spring is 5 minutes away
Recent Alumnus,5,"It's just hardly used, I hardly see people use drugs, very strict rules "
College Junior,5,"This school has rarely any alcohol or drug issues. On a rare occasion we do have this issue, as with any schools, and the problem is dealt with immediately. The consequence that an individual will face may be to be expelled from school, however long that may be; but not until a committee meets with the individual and or the other parties involved to reveal this issue, address it, and come up with a solution."
College Junior,5,"Our campus has a diversity like no other. It includes African Americans, Hispanics, Russians, Ethiopians, Whites and many other ethnicities. This school should be considered a missionary school because it contains a great amount of diversity alone within the student body that enables everyone to learn from at least two other cultures before they graduate."
College Junior,5,"There are bus stops close to the women's and men's residence halls. It's a 20 minute ride to the Takoma Metro where you can access DC, part of northern Virginia, and sports venues. The same bus line also goes directly into down town Silver Spring where there are plenty of food options, some entertainment - including a nice movie theater - and an ok mall."
College Freshman,5,"Considering how close WAU is to the Takoma Park Station, you literally go anywhere; Washington, D.C. and Union Station are just a few examples. There is downtown Silver Spring where a plural amount of authentic cuisine is available along with the mall, shops and boutiques. There are also numerous of job opportunities on top of the plural amount of job opportunities on campus. There are parks nearby and trails to walk along."
Junior,4,My online learning experience with Washington Adventist University wasn't?  rocky but what university wasn't? Majority of my professors were very understanding and put a lot more effort into getting the knowledge that we needed to learn across.
Freshman,4,Washington Adventist is a very good school especially when it comes into the different diversities and the atmosphere the school is very good when it come to academics and also sports are very well.
Junior,4,The university has great faculty dedicated towards the higher education of the students. Over the years there has been many issues but they are being resolved little by little.
Sophomore,4,I like how the classes are small so you can get more personalized help and lessons from professors. You also get to know your classmates really well. I would like the wifi to be improved.
Senior,4,"Washington Adventist University is a good school, They have been very wonderful helping me throughout my program due to the fact I have Sickle Cell Anemia they have been amazing. The professor are awesome they are always around whether on campus or by email. Library and Science build is available when you need to use the computer or study. The new nursing building is wonderful. My experience so far has been great, I can't complain."
Junior,4,What I like most about WAU is the people there they were nice in the area around the campus was beautiful in the events were fun and very interacting.
Junior,4,"The actual enrollment and everything outside of teaching and classes are horrible. But the teachers there are amazing. Very helpful, personable, sees you as a person."
Junior,4,What I like about WAU is that we all know each other for being a small campus. We don't look at each other as strangers in my opinion but as I know you and encourage each other to raise up. The university is known for it's moral and spiritual aspects that it teaches students to be highly qualified for the future in they're lives and goes beyond that. What I was impacted by this school is networking and working together to make everything run successful for the students like me to have a great and stress free educational life so that i can enjoy my valuable time here.
College Sophomore,4,"I generally feel safe walking around on campus and around the campus. You can never be too safe though, I always try to walk with a friend especially late at night."
College Sophomore,4,"When it comes to sports this school is very supportive. I would say the most popular sport is basketball. There are always supporters at each game though. As far as basketball though, it's tremendous. People from everywhere come to the events, and they are actually worth going to. It brings students together for a period of time, even some of the staff like to come and watch. I feel like the school is revolved around basketball."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe my experience at school has been great due to the school's unique emphasis on service and the availability for me to serve in a variety of ways on-campus. I'm so interested and involved in the spiritual aspect of the campus and that's the most important part for me. Other than that, my teachers care about helping me succeed, and they make time for me. I found friends that share the same passions as me, which always make one's college experience extra special. But most of all, I have learned how to lead and I have grown as a woman here. I wouldn't trade that for anything. Because I have learned and experienced so much here, I would definitely choose this school again."
College Sophomore,4,My college is very good because i am taking courses that will help me with my major and also we go on trips that help us get better with our fellow classmates. My school is unique because the learning  style and they let us express ourselves. I would choose my school again because its small and everybody is welcome.
College Freshman,4,This college supports it's students
College Senior,4,To have fun and meet alot of people you have to play sports.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is a great opportunity because everything is right there. Even though you may want to be alone sometimes there are places you can go but there are always people there that can help you with your work or talk about life with. It may cost a lot to live on campus but if you add up gas and food when living off campus it is about the same.
College Junior,4,500% better than the dorms
College Junior,4,i couldnt ask for anything better
College Junior,4,"Both the guys and girls here are attractive and fun to be around, and overall really great people. There are a lot of cliques, unfortunately, but most people are very kind. Students here tend to jump into serious relationships too quickly, in my opinion. But it's expected at a small school like this one."
College Junior,4,"This university is extremely diverse. Many students hail from the Caribbean, Africa, and Latin America. There are other Asian ethnicity too. We take pride in our diversity here. Despite being an Adventist school, there are a large group of people who are not Adventist. And yes, there are people here who are LGBT. You just have to look really really hard."
College Junior,4,"With DC right around the corner and a Metro Station nearby, it is very convenient to take a group of friends and head downtown. Silver Spring is a great attraction and has many restaurants, shopping, and a movie theater. PG Mall is also nearby, but the best place to go is Columbia Mall. But even that could be a bit of a stretch. It's still worth it though. In the spring time, we have our annual Family Fun Fest (Taste of Takoma was the original name) held right on the campus."
College Junior,4,"It's pretty safe on campus. It's always advised to stay in groups walking alone at night, but people walk around by themselves at night anyhow and do not get harmed."
College Senior,4,The diversity of this University is great. You get to meet people with all sorts of ethnic background.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is located just outside of Washington D.C. and near Downtown Silver Spring. One is never more than an hour away from any adventure, whether you want to hop on the metro rail and visit the Smithsonian, eat and listen to live music in Downtown Silver Spring, or take a scenic drive out to Columbia, MD and go shopping. Whatever you want do you can find it."
College Sophomore,4,"Since I'm a transfer student getting into the program was fairly easy. One just need to make sure that they have the appropriate documents, Transcript from all previous colleges, two letters of recommendation and application the fee."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is diverse in age, ethnics, and gender. Having an extra curricula activity as well as attending a religion group or service is highly recommended for students living on campus. Students present themselves in a modest way on and off campus. Since there is no co-ed dorms students spend a lot of their down times in the student center or in the campus yard."
College Senior,4,I live off campus and the housing is awesome.  The advantage of living off campus allows you live as an adult.  Depending on where you live can determine if the landlord is responsible.  My landlord is very responsible and responsive. I can really count on my landlord to fix the things required for the maintenance of the property.  The cost of living in my area is a little high but the property is really nice.  The parking and safety in the area is fair.
College Senior,4,"It is an honor and a pleasury to be in college and in the program that i desire, which is Business Management.  I am a full time student with a full time career and I enjoy both. The unique quality of my program is that I can take advantage of this opportunity and apply it into diffent career opportunities.  The curriculum is designed to allow me to facilitate just about any management roll for just about any job."
College Senior,4,"I really can not rate the students interest, social life and relationships because I am not interested in meeting the students and their interests. I am an adult student attending the school for one thing and that's to get my degree and further my education.  Some of the answers provided above I really felt uncomfortable answering, but there was not a choice for me to answer none of the above (ie. how accepting is LGBT?).  The question did not allow me to skip, which I would have but it forced me to answer. That was not fair."
College Senior,4,The school sports that's available for student extra curricullum activities is great.  The students take advantage of the sports offered.  The students participates and support the students during the games.
College Senior,4,"The campus at the Washington Adventist University is setup for the students to take advantage.  The campus has a great gymnasium, library, computer labs, auditoriums, lounge areas and many other student amenities.  The schooll offer great  sport activities such as (basketball, soccer, baseball and etc.) and also performance arts."
College Sophomore,4,"Tons to do, lots of variety and its accessible through metro bus and train."
College Sophomore,4,I got a ton of financial aid!
College Sophomore,4,"As far as variety and closeness to the campus, it is still a dangerous city especially during the colder seasons"
College Sophomore,4,They're cool but can be totally overbearing at times
College Freshman,4,My school campus is very diverse.
College Junior,4,The university has a great diversity of students as it relates to economic background and religion.  There are students from all over the world.
College Junior,4,Greeks at my school is kind and smart students.  Greek life does not affect the social atmoshpere on campus at my school. They are very easy to get along with and stay to themselves if they do not know you.  They are viewed fairly and no one at my school seems to have a non-discrimating view for the Greek students.  The housing at my school offers on-house campus to the Greek students with open doors.  The Greek students that stays on campus seem to have no problem with the living arrangement in the dorms.
College Freshman,4,Both women and men varsity teams are good. The students are very supportive.
College Senior,4,"The people at this school are some of the nicest most sincere individuals I have ever encountered in my life. I am not 7th Day Adventist, but coming into this school was a big relief compared to other schools in the area. Many are varied from moderate to very spiritual and this school is home to many different ideas and religious beliefs. I myself, am non-denominational Christian and was surprised to find at least 3 more students in my same nursing class under the same standing. Students are very friendly and ""Christ-like"". Everyone I have encountered are very nice and willing to help anyone in need. These are people who will help display and promote good morals and values."
College Senior,4,"I do not know much of the drug scene on campus. For the most part, I am sure there are students who participate in drugs as with all places. However, probably because the university is so small, I have yet to see or hear of anyone doing illicit drugs on campus. Off campus parties or clubs may be where most of the action is in this scene. But for the most part, I believe the campus is pretty clean."
College Junior,4,"Campus Security is always close by. I have not felt unsafe on Washington Adventist University. Although it is an open campus, the students are still safe to roam freely."
College Junior,4,The cafeteria is a great place to eat. It has a variety of vegetarian/ vegan dishes that are amazing in taste.
College Junior,4,"I love being at this school simple because Washington DC is so close by. There are a lot of attractions, museums and historical places to visit. The school's environment is beautiful and healthy to begin your college career."
College Junior,4,"The security has gotten pretty strict. They are concerned with the safety of the students. As a result, the security has come to our department and told us precautions and procedures to take when we come in conflict with danger.

The strictness involving the social aspect is moderately strict because people do have a sense of self-worth that enables us to dress properly. On the other hand, we can relax on days that we do not have school and wear jogging pants, sweats, or shorts."
College Junior,4,"The weather here fluctuates depending on the season. In the winter it can get quite cold; on the other hand, in the summer it can get quite hot as well. The weather going to and from class should not be a problem if the proper attire is being worn."
College Junior,4,"Washington Adventist University is located in Takoma Park, MD. Along the skirts of Maryland, is Washington DC where there are plenty of places to go explore with friends and family."
Recent Alumnus,4,I've not heard any serious complaints about it thus far.
College Junior,4,The professors have as much knowledge as most other places and they adequately challenge students. But it's partly the student's job to apply themselves to learning.
College Junior,4,"Takoma Park is a city that has plenty to offer.  There are plenty of places to eat, play recreational sports, and beautiful places to go for walks.  The University of Maryland is not too far from our campus as well.  With our school being in the DC area as well, we have access to museums, the verizon center, and many more places to hang out and eat."
College Junior,4,"I am a Physical Education major with a Teacher certification.  I am very happy with my program because I have very helpful advisors that help me decide what classes I need to take in order to graduate on time.  The classes I take such as Kinesiology, Anatomy and Physiology, and Physical Education Theory classes help me prepare to become a PE teacher.  If I could do it all over again, I would do it.  The teachers I had, and the overall experience was amazing.  After I graduate, I plan on becoming a PE teacher in public, private, or whatever school I find a job.  The only concern I have about finding a job in my field is that I hope schools will still keep Physical Education in they're system."
College Freshman,4,"In the first semester, I was in Broadcasting Jouralism, and they are so many internships and job opportunities because WAU is close to DC. The workload in this program is not a lot, its pretty easy. The facilities are really friendly and always willing to help you out."
College Freshman,4,They offer a lot of scholarships for mostly anything.
Recent Alumnus,4,"WAU has a wide variety of academics available and the professors are usually at the top of their field. Doing 12-16 credits is considered a full-time load and since this is a liberal arts school there are several gen eds that students have to acquire before moving on to more focused classes towards their majors. When registering for their first semester, students have to complete the process by working with teachers and the registration office. Afterwards, nearly everything can be done online with the exception of a few courses that will always require teacher approval. 

There are several special study options including spending a year abroad through a program we are a part of called Adventist Colleges Abroad (ACA). ACA has connected Adventist colleges from around the world together to create programs where students can spend a semester or an entire year abroad to study languages and other courses in one of the several countries available. If a student decides to declare a language minor, German for example, they would be required to spend at least a semester in a country that speaks that language in order to complete the requirements for the minor. 

Some of the most popular majors on campus are nursing, business, music, and theology."
Recent Alumnus,4,We have a variety of sports available on campus and are a member of the NCAA Division II.
College Sophomore,4,"There is one in particular in which every student, faculty, and staff goes to is Sligo Church.  Sligo Church is about an hour every wednesday and a time to chat with friends, sing with your friends, get inspiration and spiritual knowledge as well. It a great time to get together to give spiritual energy."
College Sophomore,4,"Not quite an A+ because the library computers are slow, however the computer lab is excellent as well as in the Center for Learning place. 
New computers and updates always coming in for those that are excellent and good available computers."
College Junior,4,The Experience at WAU has been fine. I have had teachers who were good and teachers who weren't.
College Junior,4,Happy for This â€“ This campus has a no tolerance policy. If this school would follow it I believe many people would have left. Here they give you more than three chances  to get your academics together if you need to and your social life. When they get fed up with the insubordination they will put you out.
College Sophomore,4,"Smaller Class Sizes â€“ The smaller class sizes definitely help in the professor being able to communicate with each student as much as they need it. They are always there to help you, talk to you, explain assignments and whatever else you need. The classes are not easy, but become easy by the helpful and caring professors on campus."
College Sophomore,4,It's Really Easy â€“ There are no difficulties or challenges when it comes to getting into any program. You have to freedom to switch between any major you want.
Senior,2,"The graduation rate is low for a reason. It seems as though they try to tie you down for a few extra years on purpose so you can pay them more. For example, the school lured me in with the promise of my final semester being free if completed within 4 years. I am fulfilling my end, but now they are starting to make things difficult, bringing up paperwork that was never initially mentioned. It is also very common that on your final semester they will magically add an unfulfilled class they never cared to mention or show in the checklist for your major. The good thing about this school is the small class size and most professors have your best interest in mind. If you have money to blow, have a sports or pastorals scholarship, by all means, attend. If not, I do not recommend this school."
Freshman,2,"Washington Adventist University is a mediocre institution. The pros of this institution include receiving Christian education if you are Christain, and this institution also has a good community of kind-hearted individuals. It's a very small institution, so classrooms are small and you'll get the attention you need from your professors to succeed. Despite these things, the institution has many old buildings that are run down and unhealthy to reside in. They have a slow system in the office of the registrar and the institution is outdated. The materials and equipment are outdated in the science department and most buildings."
College Junior,2,Very bad and is expensive. Would be great if living off campus wasn't so expensive
College Junior,2,Would be great if students didn't have to pay so much for college
College Senior,2,It's bad because I expected to have a clear career goal and set off into obtain multiple internships during starting at Freshmen year.
College Senior,2,There isn't much going on that career supporters here aren't active enough to help with career outlook and finding jobs you want.
College Junior,2,They really do just care for themselves and their salary.
College Junior,2,"The food is pretty bad... No options, always serving pasta/rice. No healthy food options except for the salad bar."
College Junior,2,"Though it is an Adventist institution, the most Adventist aspect about it is that they serve a vegetarian cuisine. The buildings are falling apart, the stop giving you the scholarships agreed in freshman year, housing is horrific, the study body is rude, administration only care for themselves and their salary... it's just bad."
College Junior,2,"The alumni is pretty strong, actually."
College Junior,2,"All you do is apply for your major, and you're in. Nothing special or hard. If you are pursuing a BA, you have to have a minor or concentration to graduate. It's really that simple."
College Junior,2,"The financial department does try their best. Unfortunately, it's not good enough. Because the school is expensive, people have a hard time scraping money out of the financial department. And you must be cleared before registering for classes, which is hard when you need money. Scholarships are limited, and honestly don't help much."
College Junior,2,"The workload is manageable for any major, you just need to manage your time effectively. Taking religion courses is mandatory. You need 128 credits to graduate. The math and science classes are mainly the only 4 credit classes, so it's hard to graduate in 4 years when most classes you need are 3 or 2 credits. Some classes are offered every other semester/year."
College Junior,2,"The campus is strict in one area, and not so much another area. Dorm policies are pretty strict for the girls dorm, as far as I know. The security will go around to check if your car has a parking permit, or you'll get a ticket. Always respect what the security has to say and there shouldn't be too much of a problem."
College Junior,2,"The majors are listed on the school's website. From what I know, they are trying to add more majors. What we have is what every school has, nothing special. The most popular majors are biology, psychology, business, nursing, and of course theology. The English department is not doing too well. Neither are the nursing, education, math and computer science departments despite what they may tell you. This might change in the future, but right now the nursing, math, and English departments have plummeted severely."
College Junior,2,"Because the school is so small, this can be seen as a pro and con. The school needs to expand on its facilities, which it is in the process of doing from what I know. The campus lawn is nice and spacious. The activity center is air-conditioned well and it's new. Student life events are very fun and entertaining. Other than that, the campus can get boring pretty fast."
College Senior,2,My only concern is safety. There is not much security going on around the campus .
College Senior,2,"One thing I'm concerned about is being able to know the right direction towards your career goals, so that near graduation you won't be like ""uh"". There should be motivated counselors or teachers willing to give students a heads up on finding a job in their field of study such as what to look for, how to prepare myself professionally, and how to be competitive in the real world."
College Senior,2,"I wish there were financial aid advisers who are willing to advise students before the summer session starts for next year.

By doing this, it will help students gain all possible funding for next school year. I feel like the financial process is a bit slow.

I believe there should be more to help student get funding that they need without any surprises or worry of their school bill. End of story."
College Sophomore,2,They need to upgrade the computers and the network. It sucks sometimes if not most of the time.
Graduate Student,1,The class professors are not that good. I'm just fed up with the school and cant wait to be done. Have a nice day
Graduate Student,1,"This school is the worst school I have seen, the administrative staffs are nonchalantly running the business to the ground, they don't care about international students and give no career assistance. Also, they offer no grant or scholarship to foreign students and you can't even get to a contact person either through a phone call or email. Trust me, invest in a better school especially if you are an international student as you will benefit from the outcome. Attending this school is one of my regrets in life since they 've continuously proved me right, they waste time in preparing work documents and you might also end up losing a good job offer. Lastly, their administrative staff do not act God-like and almost forget that they were once immigrants. This is my most sincere opinion."
College Freshman,1,We aren't allowed to have party's.
College Junior,1,The dorms are terrible. Not even worth the money you pay. Bathrooms are unbearable.  Have to wear slippers because it is so nasty in the showers. No privacy. Stinks all the time.
College Junior,1,"The dorms need to be re-done period. I do not live on campus, but after seeing the living conditions, I'm quite glad I don't. Not only is it expensive, the rooms are too cramped for normal living. I hope they build or re-do the dorms. Especially the women's dorm."
College Junior,1,"I have not heard of there being any nightlife around, since this is an Adventist school. However people still go out and party and have a good time. They just blend in with everyone else."
Recent Alumnus,1,No fraternities or sororities whatsoever
College Junior,1,"There Are Two Dorms â€“ There are only two dorms. A dorm for males and a dorm for females. I hate living on campus with a passion. It dirty, they cut the water off a lot through-out the semester, the carpet is old, the  bathrooms are dirty, the ac units don't always work. I personally think they should tare down the dorms and rebuild it."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly, there is hardly any parking on campus for the amount of students we have. Not only do all the students living in the dorm have a car, but the commuter students need somewhere to park too.

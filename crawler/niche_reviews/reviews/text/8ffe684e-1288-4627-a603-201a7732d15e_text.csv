Niche User,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time at CU. It was cut short due to some personal issues that came up and forced me to withdraw. Beautiful campus, rigorous academics, and a solid christian environment are some of the biggest strong points for me."
Sophomore,5,"With the switch to remote learning, my professors handled everything very well. Professors and students alike were encouraged to be gracious with each other. Several of my profs modified or cancelled certain assignments to help us adapt to the change. One of my profs also created a new assignment that helped us learn video/technology skills that were very beneficial during this transition. Unfortunately, the lab aspect of my classes had to be cancelled; that part couldn't be done remotely. And some of the assignments/classes I had been looking forward to didn't happen. Overall though, the professors were creative and flexible with their assignments and grading policies, giving additional grace to all of us during this strange time. It was inspiring to watch."
Sophomore,5,"I love the sense of community at CU! There is such a strong emphasis on doing life together. The professors are amazing and care deeply about their students. It is very easy to get in contact with your professor if you need clarification or to ask for advice. There is a strong emphasis on academic excellence and integrity as well. No alcohol or drugs on campus, which eliminates a lot of potential problems. There is almost always something to do on or around campus, such as movie nights and free student-run shows and events. Campus feels very safe, even after dark."
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at Cedarville University. I have no regrets about attending this university. Most of the faculty and staff are excellent at what they do, and they are kind and personable. They set a godly example for the students around them. Classes at CU are challenging but also practical. I learned so much from my major classes and even from several of my gen eds. The village of Cedarville is not much to speak of, but the university makes up for it with the many events and organizations on campus. The community at CU is like none other that I've ever seen. The majority of students are passionate about Christ and are very welcoming. I love our daily chapel times because it is so special and powerful to have a room full of 3,000-4,000 believers all worshipping God together. It is so encouraging and beneficial. Chapel also adds to our sense of unity as a student body. We are reminded five days a week that we have the same Lord and the same mission."
Sophomore,5,I love Cedarville University! The community that I have found is outstanding. The teachers and student body pursue excellence in their walk with Christ and in their education.  I would highly recommend attending Cedarville University.
Junior,5,"You will never find a place that is more intentional in growing every aspect of your life. They are a Christian university in more than just name. I feel as if I have been able to not only focus on my craft and build my career but learn how to balance the rest of my life. I do think that if you come from public schooling it can be a more difficult transition, but once you find a solid group of friends and mentors, you'll find yourself in a new home."
Freshman,5,"My favorite thing about Cedarville University would have to be the daily chapels. The great messages or worship experiences truly brighten up any day. I also love how the faculty and staff demonstrate their love for God and their for others in everything they do. The academics are challenging, but you learn so much! I definitely highly recommend this university if you are looking for a solid Christian education and student experience."
Freshman,5,"Cedarville University not only focuses on the academic side of students' lives, but seeks to make them better people as well as better learners. Cedarville encourages each of its students to be the best they can be both in their job field and in their culture."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Cedarville University. I am receiving a strong education, and am being trained by professionals who love their job and do an excellent job of preparing us students for success once we graduate."
Niche User,5,I visited Cedarville University last month and absolutely loved it! I cannot wait to attend there this Fall! The community there is amazing. They are intentional about their students faith and academic progress. Students that graduate from Cedarville are known to be successful and respected in their fields. 10/10 recommend going to Cedarville!
Freshman,5,"You can focus on academic stuff easily. Professors are so helpful and they are passionate about teaching and learning new things, also work with students. For sure, you can get good skill for your future professional job."
Sophomore,5,"I love Cedarville so much! Ask any student, and they will likely tell you that their favorite thing about campus is the community. I have never been to a campus that was so community oriented. The president of the University, Dr. White, is so involved in the student body. The professors are amazing! I haven't had a professor that I've had issues with. The professors really care about their students inside and outside of the classroom. They are all great resources and great people. I have absolutely recommended Cedarville to all that I come across."
Freshman,5,Cedarville University of a school of togetherness. This school has such a sense of community that you will be connected with others anywhere on campus. This school is so on fire for the Lord it is incredible! It is an amazing place to call home.
Freshman,5,"Cedarville University not only has amazing academics and professors, but it’s intentionality in serving Christ is breathtaking. Daily chapel services and approachable staff make spiritual growth opportunities at Cedarville unbeatable. The mission of being a university “for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ” definitely makes this university the unique, beautiful place that it is."
Freshman,5,"Cedarville isn’t like any other university. The professors really take the time to help you with ANYTHING you need. It’s a place where the community is strong. The students are always kind to each other and you’ll never feel like an outsider on campus. One of my worries was about how small the town is but there are so many bigger towns surrounding it that you won’t run out of things to do. They also do a great job of organizing on campus activities so you are more likely to be sad about not being able to participate in everything rather than feel bored. If you’re worried about chapel everyday, don’t be. The speakers are so so good and even when you don’t feel like going, it helps you start your day off surrounded by friends and good words of encouragement. I would recommend Cedarville to ANYONE looking for a christ-centered community with top-notch professors and academics!!"
Niche User,5,"A wonderful school centered on Christ with great Christian community! Academics and professors are great, and student life is lively!"
Freshman,5,"Cedarville University is an amazing school.  I love the campus, classes, professors, and chapel.  I love the Christ-center atmosphere where people are worshiping God together, praying, and have Christ-centered conversations.  The campus is beautiful.  Cedarville has a strong community where it is easy to meet others and get plugged in."
Niche User,5,Cedarville is a very good Christian school that has fantastic engineering programs. The campus is top-notch but there is very little to no surrounding city for weekend ventures.
Freshman,5,Positive environment! The professors actually care about students. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus!
Alum,5,"I went to CU and I am so glad that my son is there now. Love the professors, the chapel, and the preparation for life and career!"
Freshman,5,"Cedarville is not like any other Christian university. As I go on drives with my friends, the most common thing we all say is, “wow, I love Cedarville University so much” And it’s so true! Professors are amazing, but what really makes it amazing is the 10am chapel Monday through Friday. It seems like a lot, but it’s the thing I look forward to every single day. This school is so amazing and I can’t wait to graduate from here!"
Sophomore,5,Such an amazing school. The community is incredible and the professors are so great at keeping up with the students.
Freshman,5,"Cedarville is an amazing Christian college. The community is unlike anywhere else, you can definitely feel God working here! And unlike some Christian colleges, academics are still top-notch. The courses are challenging, and will prepare you for real-life work."
Sophomore,5,"Cedarville University is such a wonderful Christian college, that allows students to receive a great education all while proclaiming their faith. All faculty and staff on campus care about you being there and want you to exceed. Cedarville has been expanding their campus, and will continue to expand for the next 10 years by bringing in record-breaking freshman classes every fall and constructing better facilities."
Freshman,5,I have loved being at Cedarville and it has offered me an incredible opportunity to grow closer to Christ.
Niche User,5,I attended Cedarville University Summer Scholars and took the Politics in American Culture class. The class had an excellent teacher and I had an overall great experience.
Freshman,5,Cedarville is an amazing school. The faculty and staff are willing to help students do well in their classes. The campus is beautiful and never too far of a walk. The dorms are nice and provide great opportunities to meet new people. Cedarville offers many different groups and clubs that students can be apart of so no one will ever feel left out. Chapel is an amazing experience and is always a highlight of the day.
Alum,5,"Cedarville is an outstanding school with a first-class education. It is the best place if you want to be surrounded by people who are going to push you to grow professionally and as a Christian. Professors truly care about their students, and go the extra mile to help you learn. The small class sizes are wonderful too. It truly was a 10/10 experience, other than the fact that it is SO expensive."
Junior,5,"Cedarville University is located in an excellent part of Ohio. Although it is surrounded by cornfields, with not much variety, bigger towns such as Dayton, Columbus, and Cincinnati are only thirty minutes to an hour away, allowing students to drive a little to have fun, experience things, and make memories."
Sophomore,5,"A community full of God-focused individuals who care deeply, professors who really invest time and energy into helping you grow, and daily chapel that always inspires and convicts. I love this college, and it's truly a second home for me."
Sophomore,5,Great school environment and passion to see students succeed. Students are passionate about their work and about the people around them. Teachers care a lot about their students and are very active in helping and looking out for their students. Very easy to get involved with extra curricular activities and get plugged in with groups of friends and people. Campus is very nice and a decent size. Great location that is far enough away from larger cities but is not too far to be able to travel to them. Great dorms and great RAs.
Sophomore,5,Cedarville University is an amazing college that equips students with the tools they need to excel in their professions. The professors are eager to meet with students as they need. The daily chapels keep the students encouraged throughout the week. Finally the challenging academics prepare students for their fields of study.
Niche User,5,I will be attending this University in the fall. I have visited Cedarville twice and I have loved it every time. I attended a class in which the professor was very helpful to the student's questions. I also ate a meal at their dining hall both times. The food was of excellent quality and had a wide variety of options. I appreciated the numerous gluten-free options because I am gluten-free myself. I also enjoyed both of the chapel services that I attended on both of my visits. The Christ-centered curriculum is strong with the foundations of the school and the professors are committed to progressing your faith as well.
Sophomore,5,I can not imagine studying at any other Christain University. Cedarville has the kindest professors who don't only care about our grades but everything else going on in our lives. Having chapel every day were the faculty and staff join us is an incredible experience. I am convinced that we have the best president ever. He was so emotional talking about the graduating class this year. I love this school!
Freshman,5,Cedarville is a great choice for any type of major as the school seems to put a lot of emphasis on making all academic experiences on campus above most you will find at any other college. They put a lot of focus on the professors to make sure that what is being taught will prepare students for career success. The campus is really beautiful and the community of people is really encouraging to be around.
Freshman,5,"Cedarville is an incredible university to study at. The professors are beyond caring towards the students and make every effort to help the students learn; they even make gen eds interesting and enjoyable! The academics are not easy, but that is what shows its quality. If you put time and effort into the classes at Cedarville, you will get a lot out of the semester and come out with more knowledge than ever. 

Student life is lively and very encouraging! Students all around you, whether in the classroom or in the dorms, are always uplifting one another and encouraging each other to strive for academic and moral excellence."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this university! It i completely God focused and the community is like none I have seen before. People, students and professors alike, genuinely love each other and the academics are on point."
Senior,5,I liked the community of students. It was easy to become involved and find friends. I also enjoyed how professor cared about you academically and wanted to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman mechanical engineering student at Cedarville University. I came to this school because it’s engineering program is accredited and has very good rates of employment after graduation. The tuition is high, but having for a private Christian school it is very much worthwhile. Student life opportunities are amazing, from clubs to intramural sports and music. It is a wonderful thing to have so many people surrounding you who all believe in Jesus Christ. If you think Cedarville is an option for you, I would propose that it be your first choice. Even after only two semesters, I can say that it’s worth it."
Graduate Student,5,"Cedarville University is a Cristian college that not only excels at  academics that build careers but also at building the students’ spiritual character. Professors are caring and thoughtful in their preparation to meet this criteria. The campus is situated in a small Ohio town of the same name. If you are interested in learning in a school that also prepares students biblically, Cedarville is a great option."
Alum,5,I have loved my four years at Cedarville University. The professors made a point to get to know me and invest in my life.
Junior,5,Cedarville is a wonderful institution! I am challenged to do my best and equipped to do well. They do all that they can to make sure their students succeed for the glory of God!

Sophomore,5,"Cedarville has a fantastic community. Faculty is always there to help you, and the academics is spot on."
Sophomore,5,"I love Cedarville!  I am a current sophomore Nursing major and everything is awesome.  Their nursing program is so good, the professors are amazing, and I just feel at home on campus.  I have made so many good friends, matured in my Christian faith, and I know that I will be so prepared to work as a nurse."
Freshman,5,"I am only a first-year freshman and already, my experience has been incredible. It is a Christian university that prioritizes students and their relationships with Christ above all. Academics is still taken very seriously. The professors are well qualified and care about the students. Chapel is required everyday, but has been one of my favorite parts about my Cedarville experience."
Sophomore,5,"What is so amazing about Cedarville University is the Culture that you are around. People there are so genuine, and understand that everyone is struggling, but with that being said, people are willing to sacrifice to help one another."
Sophomore,5,The academics are excellent and the majority of teachers are caring. I think that the university could improve in discussing a wider range of worldviews.
Freshman,5,I love the community at Cedarville! The student body is full of fellow students energetic and passionate to grow together in their walk with Christ! I would not change anything!
Freshman,5,Cedarville provides such a great community to learn and experience new friendships. Within two weeks I felt like I was home and belonged there.
Senior,5,"Cedarville far outweighed my expectations! I would chose CU again in a heartbeat. Great professors who teach well and truly care. Clean, safe, modern equipment. Friendly campus. Although not in a big city, gives you a chance to get to know people. Fantastic food choices. Excellent financial aid & scholarship help. Thankful for the MK/TCK community that connected me to other foreign students & made sure I was doing well. Daily chapel and small groups kept my spiritual life real and growing strong. Felt I was learning with a purpose."
Freshman,5,"This university is amazing. The focus is not only on learning but also on God. Chapel arrives are phenomenal; they bring you closer to God every day. After you graduate from this university you are very prepared for your field of study. Overall, this is the university that everyone should go to."
Senior,5,The professors are outstanding. They care about your education needs as well as you as a person. They excel in their discipline.
Junior,5,"Cedarville University is an excellent place to get a strong, well-rounded education in a wonderful Christian environment.  The teachers are caring and their commitment to doing things with excellence is very evident in and out of the classroom.  I would highly recommend Cedarville to anyone wanting a high quality Christian education and a top notch student culture combined with a excellent education program."
Senior,5,Cedarville is focused on your growth both in your major and in your walk with Jesus Christ.  I was a transfer student and Cedarville was my third school. This school is by far the most intentional of any that I visited or attended prior.
Graduate Student,5,I love it here. It is warm and welcoming. Cedarville has great programs that push you to excel and learn.
Sophomore,5,"The athletics , community and christian atmosphere is amazing.  Those things combined together make to community amazing. Everyone is involved in something and anyone can get involved in anything. The friendships built here last forever. The people you meet can change the way you think and even help you step by step grown into an incredible person. The professors do whatever it takes to help you succeed and they always believe in you no matter the circumstances."
Niche User,5,"Welcoming atmosphere and beautiful campus. Staff and student are friendly, helpful, and caring. Loved the choices of food in the cafeteria!"
Niche User,5,I attended a summer camp and had a great week.  The classes were fun. I enjoyed trying out dorm life and the food on campus.  Everyone was so very nice.
Junior,5,"I transferred to Cedarville University and that was the best academic decision I've made. I came from a school of 30,000 students. At Cedarville the faculty not only cares about your performance in class but they care about your personal well-being. I have had professors reach out to me over the summer just to see how I am doing. I am constantly challenged to grow by the faculty, staff, and peers at Cedarville."
Sophomore,4,"The school is such a great place to find who you are and what the Lord is calling you to do. I transferred over to save money. Cedarville offers chapel everyday, Professors who are ready to help, and an environment that feels like home."
Sophomore,4,All the students had to leave in March unless you had special permission to stay and resort to remote learning. This was a huge unexpected adjustment the last two months of our spring semester. Professors did an excellent job in adapting well.
Sophomore,4,"The best part of Cedarville is the community.  I've met so many incredible friends while at Cedarville.  The town itself is smalll and there's not much to do, but there's plenty of stuff like restaurants and movie theaters 15-20 minutes away.  The food is good, it might bet boring and repetitive over time, but hopefully the Chick-Fil-A will help with that.  They are intentionally and devoutly Christ-centered, so don't be a surprised Pikachu when you get on campus and they are."
Sophomore,4,"I took online classes during the coronavirus lockdowns.  Cedarville allowed the professors to decide what the best way would be to return to instruction.  Some professors chose to just send documents or recordings for class, while a few professors held lectures over Zoom.  Professors were responsive to students questions and pproblems.  The experience was fine, I just wouldn't choose to go to school full-time online.  I personally had a hard time motivating myself to keep up.  As long as you have self-discipline, Cedarville's online classes will work for you."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love attending Cedarville University. The professors make such an effort to teach their students to the best of their ability. It is obvious that the professors care greatly about their students. My professors never just care about me doing my assignments, but they check up on how I am doing with other things happening in my life. They pray for me and help me with things that I need help with. Cedarville University pushes me to become the best me that I can be. The social work program is the best program that I have seen in many universities. Cedarville University has many activities for the students to connect and have fun. If I were to change anything, I would make the chapel services three to four times a week instead of five. I love the chapel services, but as a college student I am already very busy with my classes nevertheless the chapel services every weekday."
Sophomore,4,"I did take some classes online through Cedarville. The online classes were a change of pace for everyone. The professors were very lenient with us to learn how to do things differently than in the classroom. I still learned a lot in my online classes just like I did in the classroom. If I were to change anything, I would want my professors to explain things a little better online. Sometimes instructions get lost in communication, and I as a student need to know exactly what the professor wants of me."
Freshman,4,The online class experience I had was very different from taking the same classes in person. Only a few of my professors recorded lectures to watch. However I was still able to learn from most of them. My speech professor (Mishne) did an excellent job keeping a similar class environment by uploading TED Talks for us to watch and have an online discussion about because we would normally watch and discuss these speeches in class.
Freshman,4,"During the transition to online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, most of my professors did a very good job of adjusting to an online-only way of teaching. Of course some communication was strained especially with the older professors, however, most things were clear. Cedarville uses Canvas and it does remind when certain assignments were due. Also, many of my professors uploaded voice lectures and powerpoints. With those tools, it wasn't too difficult learning through this online platform."
Freshman,4,Most of the professors I had during my first year have been extremely kind and encouraging. They want to see you flourish in all you do. Chapels are usually very good and I always seem to hear the right message at the right time. I love the atmosphere of this school and most of the students here are super accepting.
Niche User,4,"I take classes online with Cedarville University, and the experience is mostly great. The teachers typically grade quickly and respond fast when you need to get in touch with them. The classes are somewhat challenging and I've learned a great deal."
Freshman,4,There is really good community among the students in the dorms. There are quite a variety of activities to get involved in although the town is very small. Professors are very personal and will talk to individuals outside of class.
Freshman,4,"Cedarville University has challenged me to push my limits and it has made me grow a lot in just the year that I have been here. They have grown me in my academics and my faith. They challenge me to do my best and strive to be the best that I can be, both on and off campus. The professors want to see me thrive in the classroom and they are more than willing to help me should I need it. I can already see that they are making me into a person that will thrive when I graduate. I can not see myself at any other school."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus and the environment of the people around me. Everyone was so positive and had a really good mindset about school which really made my experience on my trip really enjoyable.
Freshman,4,"Cedarville University has been a great choice for schooling.  Professors are very accommodating and work with you through challenging times.  Student life is very active, although school spirit is relatively weak."
Sophomore,4,Really like how the university sticks to its mission statement and how the university is managed. Lots of new construction and the university is growing. Just wish the school had a little more respect for ROTC programs me. The school seems to hold Army Rotc with a lot of distaste for reasons unknown.
Sophomore,4,"It's like all schools. You get what you put in to it. There is not much of anything in the area, not even one place that delivers and nothing off campus to do locally. I wish that would change. I love being part of Christian culture and knowing we can all pray together."
Freshman,4,I have always loved Cedarville since I can remember. My parents met there so I was familiar with it already. Cedarville has a fantastic education and excellent professors. Every student you talk to will tell you that they love their school. They provide excellent opportunities to all of their students and it is a great place to live and further your education.
Sophomore,4,"Cedarville is a great private Christian University. I like the environment because it is great for staying focused and on top of academics. The downside is that there is not much to do. It is basically in the middle of the cornfields and being a Christian campus, that limits lots of what is allowed."
Sophomore,4,"Cedarville provides a God-centered community full of people that want to encourage you in your walk with Christ. You'll always be surrounded by friendly faces and it was so easy for me to feel welcomed. The professors here care so intensely about your walk as well, but they also care very much about your education and will stop at nothing to enable you to do your best!"
Alum,4,"The town of Cedarville as well as the towns surrounding Cedarville are very weird and at first it is off putting but over time all the little hole in the wall coffeshops, dinners, antique shops become you escape. Not that you need to escape Cedarville because there is always some kind of event being held but the school is very demanding and expects a lot from their students but thankfully all the professors are more than willing to help and even from time to time invite you over to their house. Overall its a great college!!"
Freshman,4,Cedarville University is a very close-knit community which makes the experience even more enjoyable. The Profs are great and they consistently engage with their students both inside and outside of the classroom.
Junior,4,"Cedarville is great if you are looking for a good conservative Christian school, with really good, challenging academics."
Freshman,4,"I love that Cedarville has mandatory chapel, but I wish they would not have allowed staff to carry guns."
Senior,4,"Cedarville equips and educates students for their designated career field and for being beacons of hope wherever area life may take them in. It has plenty of STEM, art, education, business, etc. majors and minors. Academics are rigorous and all encompassing. You will be a better student and harder worker after experiencing their academic culture. It is fairly easy to get a job on campus if you use your connections well. Mandatory chapels are Mon-Fri at 10 am. They are a good time for campus morale and a time of rest in the middle of the morning. Dorm life is alright. Room checks once a week with criteria depending on the resident director, if room does not meet standard could end up with a fine, as well as if you miss chapel more than 12 times. Food options are good. Cafeteria is all you can eat and has everything from veggie bar to cook it yourself. Stingers is a snack shop you can eat meals in if you do not want to eat in cafeteria."
Sophomore,4,"Cedarville has been great, if a little expensive. The athletics are great and an awesome way to fellowship with fellow believers."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy attending Cedarville University. I love my friends, the chapel services, and the events that the school puts on. It offers a very fun and safe environment for all of the students. The only things that I don't enjoy about the school is the food and some of the faculty. The food is only good on occasion, and even when it's decent, it doesn't compare to the food I get at home. When it comes to faculty, I have a mixed review. While I was in the engineering program, my professors were terrible. I wasn't able to find any help and I always felt so lost. I would go to my professors after class seeking help and they would often shut me down. My advisor was a terrible communicator and was very ill-informed. When I switched my major over to business I found that the professors and my advisor are a lot more helpful. Overall, I am enjoying my experience and would recommend it to any incoming Christian student."
Junior,4,"Cedarville University is a Christ-centered university that is also great in academics. The student life & involvement is great and there is always something for the students to do on campus. All of the professors genuinely care about you, both personally and academically, and want you to succeed. The dorms aren’t the most fancy dorms, but they’re average living quarters and work if you’re living on campus. Our cafeteria is one of the better college cafeterias out there. There aren’t fast food options, but there are plenty of options at each meal. If you don’t want to eat in the cafeteria you can go and eat in the cafe-type option that is also on campus. Overall, the school is a great place for academics and establishing life-long friendships."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Cedarville! It's been an amazing experience so far and I can't wait to spend the next three years here! The professors are incredible and care about the students more than they care about their academic journals and whatever else professors do. They will work with you, help you, and do absolutely everything in their power to make sure you succeed. 
The quality of education is also amazing. I've learned so much and I am actually enjoying it. Many Christian schools tend to sacrifice quality of education for making everything ""christian"", Cedarville does not do this. At Cedarville they take education seriously and teach at a high academic level.
Over all, Cedarville is an excellent school and a great choice."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the fact that it is a smaller university and the people are all very nice. I wouldn't change much, if anything."
Niche User,4,"Cedarville is a great option for all Christian students who can afford it. Unfortunately, they don't take many transfer credits from other schools, CLEP, or Dual Enrollment."
Junior,4,"The community is by far the best part of Cedarville University, though I wish we had a more diverse campus. Academics do mean a great deal to both the administration and many of the student who attend.  This can be a good thing, but sometimes it seems the courses have been made difficult simply for the sake of being difficult, not so you will actually learn more."
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman, my experience at Cedarville is somewhat  limited.
However, 100% of the experiences that I have had have been great.  I took multiple courses at Cedarville as a high school senior which have helped to prepare me for college level academics; as a life long homeschooler this was invaluable. The courses were challenging and interesting and the professors were available and helpful.  During orientations that I've attended, the welcome that I have received from staff and students has been amazing.  I can't wait to live here full time, to grow as a Christian and to become the Doctor that I want to be and to help others as they begin their Cedarville journey.  Thanks Cedarville!"
Senior,4,"I enjoy Cedarville's campus, and their dedication to providing a quality learning environment.  The surrounding area is good if you enjoy hiking, and cornfields.  There is very little available for any kind of weekend or evening activities.  The nearest areas of interest are 30+ minutes away.  Overall though, a solid learning experience."
Niche User,4,"I went to Cedarville University's Engineering camp for a week and I loved the campus, which is a beautiful 400 acre campus built around a lake (some people would consider it a pond) with handsome buildings such as the Stevens Student Center, Engineering and Science Center, and Centennial Libary all with modern equipment and resources.  All of the faculty was competent in the different engineering concepts; however, some were more interesting than others.   My mother attended Cedarville for a bachelors in nursing and easily passed the nursing boards and effortlessly attained a job."
Niche User,4,Cedarville is the perfect school for people who want to succeed in class and who want to stay close to God. They have great professors who truly care and want to see every student succeed. They have athletic programs that are amazing for students that see themselves in that scene.
Freshman,4,"I like the nice christian environment the school has. It is very much a big family since it is a relatively small school. I would maybe change the amount of times the students are allowed to skip chapels. Since they are daily, it tends to be difficult to always attend them if we have a lot to do or study for."
Niche User,4,"I love the community atmosphere of Cedarville University. Everyone trusts one another so easily. The courses are academically rigorous, but the professors are always there to help."
College Freshman,4,"Just like at any other institution, some classes are easy and some are very difficult. There are a lot of resources for students that are struggling, and they're easily accessible. Most profs really do care and know what they're talking about. In your gen eds, you're obviously going to be in slightly bigger class sizes (think 20-100 or so), but they get significantly smaller as you advance. Professors are very good at integrating faith with what we're learning."
College Freshman,4,"There's no football here, which kind of sucks. Overall, there's a lot of support and morale for the sports that we do have, though. CU also has a very strong intramural system."
College Freshman,4,"Cedarville is overall an awesome school. The academics are great, and there's a lot of student life stuff to be involved in. People here are very passionate about their faith, and the school provides a LOT of ways to stretch your walk with God. However... There's also a lot of rules, and they can be overbearing. Some far more so than others. I have a hard time following them, especially ones that are particularly restricting, so it can be a challenge. Some of the people can be stuck up, fake, and judgemental. But, ultimately, you're going to find problems anywhere you go. Be aware of the problems... But, ultimately, this is a phenomenal institution."
Sophomore,4,"I thoroughly enjoy my time at Cedarville University, and I believe it really is a fit for me, however, I would need to see a more open-minded approach to other worldviews before giving Cedarville a five-star rating."
College Freshman,4,Pushes students to adjust to living with others.
College Freshman,4,Focused on the student's and athlete's success.
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe or insecure at my school.
College Junior,4,"I love the unit style dorms. I lived in the hall in the past and didn't feel any community. Moving to a unit was the best idea and I love it and my unit. Getting into the unit was hard, but the housing process is good."
College Junior,4,Going to the games is great! However we are not always the best at said sports. I really love the community of the sports teams.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of outstanding athletes at Cedarville.
College Junior,4,Career Services works hard for you!
College Junior,4,"Courses are challenging, but it's very possible to pass and even excel with hard work."
College Sophomore,4,Courses are very challenging but do-able if you put the work in. Professors are known for their passion toward their students and classes they teach. Class sizes very depending on the class but never too big where you wouldn't be able to hear or see the front of the classroom.
College Sophomore,4,Job fair is a big event on campus where many employers come to talk with the students for possible future internships and jobs. Our career services is always available to help students as well to find jobs on campus and for the future after college.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Housing is what you make of it I think, when you are with the right people then it's a blast. Freshman dorm is pretty small but helps you make friends very easily, you just need to look past the tiny space. Every other dorm though is spacious and people have no problems fitting into the rooms. Cost is pretty pricey but what college dorm isn't? Campus isn't very big so living in any of the dorms is close to everything."
College Sophomore,4,"Last year was my first year on campus and overall it was a fantastic experience. I enjoyed meeting a ton of friendly people, being a part of the sports, attending chapel everyday, and most importantly learning from the best teachers around. From the seniors down to the new freshman, almost everyone is welcoming and helpful. The sports are important but the relationship with God and your education comes first always. My school is unique because it is Christ-centered in all aspects of campus, allowing your faith to grow no matter what you are doing."
College Sophomore,4,"I really, really want to give a five-star review here, but the one thing that needs to change before that happens is less marginalizing of minority belief groups."
College Sophomore,4,"Really can't complain here. I wouldn't call it exceptional, but certainly meets the student's needs."
College Freshman,4,Getting a room and roommate was convenient and easy. The social life is awesome; you always feel connected and included.
College Freshman,4,"At Cedarville, the athletic experience is fantastic. Games are always well-attended, whether basketball, soccer, or any sport offered."
College Freshman,4,Always over 93% employed or in grad school within 6 months of graduation.
College Freshman,4,It's all about the people.
College Freshman,4,Teams and athletes have integrity.
Niche User,2,The pandemic online courses for 2 months is all I know.  Taking tennis online for a necessary credit to graduate seems worthless online but considering it was during the pandemic there is nothing much one can do in such a strange time and circumstances.  Mostly busy work was given.  I would not choose online but there was no choice obviously during a pandemic.
Alum,2,"I try not to be cynical about my Cedarville experience, but if I'm being honest, Cedarville as a school deeply hurt me. I spent the worst 2 years of my life here, and I was really disappointed with the way the institution held up to my struggles. I interacted with and asked for help from numerous people in leadership at Cedarville, and the help I received was insufficient. This includes the counseling center (who I went to in a time of extreme need and was told I couldn't see a counselor until the next semester), my RD, and the Dean of Women. I also had negative experiences with some of my professors and my academic advisor in my  department. I was struggling, and any systems put in place failed me. 

Academically, Cedarville is very strong. If you happen to have the same worldview as the people on campus, you can find a strong community. But Cedarville is not a place for people who are struggling, asking hard questions, or going through pain."
College Sophomore,2,This is the one point in which I must speak out against this school. Any belief presented differing from the status quo is just wrong.
College Freshman,2,"People usually get to hang out on the weekends, but the traditional ""partying"" doesn't happen. Most of the fun and interesting places to go are about 30min away."
College Freshman,2,Giant clique for the most part. Just a christianized sorority/frat life.
College Freshman,2,"Not that my school is AWFUL! but it definitely could be a little better due to such the high status that it holds. I really enjoy my classes. I definitely feel that my teachers are there to help me and they really do everything they can to not let you fail. However, my overall experience, isn't the greatest. To elaborate, I understand Cedarville is a Christian college, and rules are in order, but the way they set and enforce their rules is quite overbearing. Whenever I go into one of the higher up offices, such as financial aid or the registrar's office, they are always giving me a hard time and really don't seem to help me at all. Also, the student body, overall, is very rude and inconsiderate of other people."
College Sophomore,2,"Cedarville is a really small town, so there is not a whole lot out there. There's a pizza place, a Subway, a Chinese place, and a few coffee shops. That about sums up the off-campus dining within walking distance. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of options, and so almost all the time I eat on-campus. Occasionally, I will travel to Beavercreek with some friends to get many more options, but that only happens once in a great while."
Recent Alumnus,2,Students must seek approval to live off campus. I don't think it is worth the hassle. But some claim it is cheaper.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not really a ""party scene."" Great campus community though and student life offers many fun activities."
College Freshman,2,"In town is Colonial's, Stoney, Beans, Subway, and the DG. For anything else, you're going to have to drive 10 minutes to Xenia or 35 minutes to Beavercreek."
College Student,2,"There aren't very many restaurants available. Subway, a pizza shop, a coffee shop, an ice cream parlor. Not really much variety. I haven't seen any student discounts offered yet, except Chick-Fil-A a ways away, which offers coupons during sports events and such. If you want anything other than the few options around town, you have to travel 15-30+ minutes to another nearby, larger town."
College Sophomore,2,"I got a little aid but not nearly enough; I'd rather not take out loans and have debt when I get out of school; my parents had a bad income year in 2013 and thought there would be more aid available than what came through, especially since I have a twin brother in the same school."
College Sophomore,2,"The town pretty much has nothing but a new dollar general store and an ice cream parlor and coffee shop.  If you can get rides to surrounding towns, the options are abundant from dining"
College Sophomore,2,You have to travel at least 10-12 miles to find options.  So having friends with cars is key.
College Sophomore,2,"The living off campus can get expensive and the places to choose from are limited and aren't very nice either. They are pretty run-down. The school is not helpful at all in helping students find places to live off campus and you have to apply to live off campus, you can't just go live off campus. It feels like they are governing your life when you're an adult."
College Sophomore,2,"Living in the dorm can be fun for some people. For people who like to be in their room and study a lot, it is not good. People are constantly making noise and not staying quiet during quiet hours. People often slam doors and scream in the hallways and it can get very distracting. Living in the dorm is good for making friends and coming together as a hall unit, though."
College Sophomore,2,It's such a small town that there really isn't much to do around here. It is nice that they do have some festivals occasionally. The cost of living for what you actually get is pretty high. All the locals are really nice and welcoming toward students.
College Freshman,2,The town is tiny and there is nothing to do
College Freshman,2,Admissions never got back to me after first application.
College Freshman,2,The people here suck and the dorms have curfew.
College Freshman,2,"Its pretty bad. Really small town, nothing is really going on. Walmart is 20 minutes away by car (as well as other restaurants and stores). Would not live here unless affiliated with the University."
College Freshman,2,"Not many places to go out to eat in the small town of Cedarville. Some places are open late, but there isn't a whole lot of variety of places to go to."
College Junior,2,I have trouble stomaching the food. Ate soup all last semester.
College Sophomore,2,No real segregation between the student were allowed
College Sophomore,2,I didn't qualify for the ACT scholarship.. but I received some aid for my 3.9 major GPA
College Sophomore,2,You pretty much need a car to fully enjoy transportation. If you don't have a car you need to find a friend with a car or pay someone to drive you off campus.
College Senior,2,There are not many scholarships offered on campus and it is difficult to find off campus scholarships.  Financial aid can be a struggle but it is because it is a private institution.
College Junior,2,Only a few restaurants and coffee shops.
College Sophomore,2,People are very judgmental and unaccepting. Therefore guys are discouraged from showing interest in girls or starting a relationship. Furthermore girls discouraged from initiating the relationship and typically must wait on the guy to do so.  Once a relationship is started there is an immediate expectancy of marriage.
College Freshman,2,You can't always rely on the wireless internet.
College Freshman,2,In Ohio its freezing and walking to classes is terrible.  The wind blows across campus constantly which makes it seem even colder.
College Freshman,2,Most people stay on campus because only a very small percentage of students get approved to live off campus -- usually reserved for seniors and some juniors.
College Freshman,2,"Mostly white, conservative, straight Christians: but diverse in economic backgrounds.  Acceptance is widely found in different races, relatively found in political viewpoints, but is not found in differing sexual orientation or religions -- because it is a baptist school."
College Freshman,2,Cedarville is a very small town and about twenty minutes away from any type of grocery store or entertainment.
College Freshman,2,There are very few nice places to live off campus that are a reasonable distance from the school. 
College Sophomore,2,"I only say it's the worst because there are no transportation options whatsoever.  However, this is also not a huge inconvenience since everything is within walking distance.  Plus, transportation (specifically car-pooling where the driver may or may not get paid) is provided if, say, someone needs to get to the airport or go on some small excursion with other students."
College Junior,2,There is not a lot of diversity but it is a great college.  It is a small private college.
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much about this, but there don't seem to be many options since Cedarville is awfully small."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It was difficult to get any sort of scholarships for me a few years ago. Now, they have a lot more options for incoming freshman and transfer students. They didn't start these new programs until after I was already in attendance."
College Junior,2,"Gotta Get Out of Town for That – The only thing in town is a local restaurant that isn't open very much and a Subway. We do now have a Chinese place that just opened up. We have a local dairy isle and a pizza place, but that's it. You have to go to the surrounding cities, only 10 miles to get good restaurants."
Alum,1,"I would not recommend attending Cedarville. They have consistently covered up sexual harassment and rely on nepotism for faculty/staff to get positions through their connections with a specific seminary. Faculty that do not adhere completely to White's fundamentalism are pushed out, leaving sub-par educators. 

The financial costs and safety risks are simply not worth it."
Works Here,1,"I've sent more than 6 emails to HR regards issue in my account and I never received response, I left more than 3 voicemails and response as well!!  Cedarville University should work on their customer service level."
College Sophomore,1,"Ummm... What is this... ""Greek Life""? nonexistent."
College Freshman,1,"This school is not for moderate Christians or anyone that doesn't care about Christianity. I thought I would like this school but I changed a lot of my views within the first month because about 97% of the school is very conservative. They are against showing a lot of affection. The school doesn't allow females to go into males rooms. They are so strict about it. I don;t see the harm in it. Also, chapel is not for everyone. A lot of the talks deal with political topics. For example gay marriage. The school is very judgmental to homosexuals. Lastly, the curfew is ridiculous. The way they enforce it and why it exists is ridiculous. I would not recommend  this college to anyone that has at least two liberal views."
College Freshman,1,"As a Christian, I was always told to love my neighbor. But since coming here, I have never felt more judged in my entire life than at this school during this semester. Apparently, being of a different denomination is evil, and baptist is the only true way of life. It makes me sick, and I will be transferring."
College Freshman,1,"It's mediocre. Nothing really sticks out. We tend to go off topic a lot and discuss the Bible, even in classes like Biology where it is irrelevant."
College Freshman,1,"Professors do not really care about the actual class. We end up praying and talking about God for the most of it, which again proves how Christian schools lack academic integrity."
College Freshman,1,There is no swimming pool. The weight room is small and almost impossible to find an open space to work out in. There is barely any green space. Due to the fact there is an enormous lake in the middle of the campus making walking to class long and tedious. No campus activities worth going to.
College Freshman,1,I've heard bad things from upper classmen
College Freshman,1,"Cedarville University: a place middle class white kids come to study from all over America to make sure they grow in their faith because it was probably too weak to withstand actual resistance from a public university or liberal arts college. With mediocre proffessors and judmental students. You'll for sure feel right at home as you would in a church. As long as you follow the strict, overbearing rules set before you to follow. You will get along just fine!"
College Freshman,1,No one parties. No one drinks or does drugs. It is impossible to do anything remotely close to partying anywhere near campus.
College Freshman,1,"Getting into Cedarville is like getting in to High School. You do not need that great of an academic record to get in. What they do care about is your pastoral reccomendation. They do not even bother asking for an academic reccomendation to get accepted. Who needs that when you have JEZUS! As long as your Christian and have a pastor back that up, you can get accepeted. You don't even need to write an essay."
College Freshman,1,Four words. It is a joke. Everyone talking about how great the diversification at Cedarville is and they lie. Everyone is a W.A.S.P. It stands for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. I can count the people that aret any of those three things on one hand.
College Freshman,1,There is literally nothing to do on campus or off it for starters. Have to drive almost an hour to get to any place decent.
College Freshman,1,"Guys

Cons: Horrible Dressers

          Socially Awkward

          Conversations Always Associated with Religion 

          Not Many Attractive Guys to Choose From

Pros: You'll make great friends as you friend zone each and every one of them.

Girls:

Cons: Stereotypical Preacher's Daughter

           Dress horribly modestly (side note: If you wear yoga pants. Do not be surprised for the multiple ""slut"" insults)

          Always Discussing Religion

          Insane Amount of Women are Only Here to Get Married

Pros: ........"
College Freshman,1,"I would not choose this school again. Parents forced me to go here. Said they were worried about my walk with God. This school enforces being a Christian more than exceeding in academics. I have not enjoyed this year at all. Crossing my fingers, they will let me transfer."
College Freshman,1,"Even though I feel safe on campus, the amount of events that get shoved underneath the rug, by secretly expelling students and fear of expulsion if we ever talk to the media about an event that was ""leaked""."
College Freshman,1,"No, football team. No swimming team. No, rugby team. The other teams aren't even worth playing for because the budget for them is pathetic."
College Freshman,1,Next to impossible to get approved for off-campus housing. You might actually try to drink and have sex!!
College Freshman,1,"No options what so ever. Can't even go for a Taco Bell run in the middle of the night, much less get anything in the middle of the night."
College Freshman,1,"Going here is literally worse than living at home during high school. They are actually worse and more strict than my parents were. So much for this ""freedom"" I was told so much about."
College Freshman,1,Same food every day. We pay thousands of dollars in board and they supply us with off brand fruit loops? Seriously?
College Freshman,1,"Campus dorms are very small. No central air. Bathrooms are always full due to the poor ratio of students and showers/stalls. Beds are wooden, which means lofting your bed is out of the question and ends up taking more space in the room than necessary."
College Junior,1,"Everyone is the same. I'm literally the only Asian on campus. There are two African Americans, but everyone else is an upper middle class white conservative."
College Junior,1,Cedarville only cares that you stay Christian. That is why in every class you can not go without hearing your daily serving of how this subject is related in a biblical sense. Academic integrity is never a top priority.
College Junior,1,Have to travel half and hour to get to anywhere remotely fun.
College Junior,1,"Most guys do not know how to dress, and often embarrass themselves without knowing it. The girls aren't that attractive, but I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
College Junior,1,"If my parents did not force me to be here I would not currently be attending. Yale was an obvious and much better choice. Instead, I am surrounded by closed-minded, judgmental people. So unless you are white, Christian, conservative, and Baptist, you will absolutely hate this school."
College Junior,1,Professors care about one thing and one thing only. To preach the bible to you. They intertwine Jesus and the bible into every single aspect of the curriculum. They care more that you are still a Christian by the time you graduate than academic integrity.
College Junior,1,"My roommate was a victim of a sexual assault. When she told the administration, she was expelled for ""lying"" and the situation was kicked under the rug before anyone knew about it."
College Junior,1,They do not let you live off campus. And the people who get the special privileges are married. Ring by spring anyone?
College Junior,1,There's a subway and a pizza place. No other options for dining out in town.
College Junior,1,"Well, if you do not mind living with rules that have gone extinct since the 1800's then by all means Cedarville is the place for you. But do not think you'll have many opportunities to mingle with the opposite sex outside of class. Girls and guys can not enter their rooms even if it is a big study group, not just one on one. Because heaven forbid people want to study in their dorms with the opposite sex. That is the work of Satan himself."
College Junior,1,"It is a joke. Cedarville is in a town of 2000 people. And since Cedarville doesn't allow you to live off campus so they can ""patrol"" your behavior, there is no options to go off campus to a house party. Also with the self-righteous right wing conservatives that attend here, no one is remotely interested in any kind of nightlife anyway."
College Junior,1,"There's one cafeteria, and the Hive gets monotonous. Can not get food anywhere else unless you are willing to drive into town."
College Junior,1,I tend to feel trapped. So many rules. It is actually worse than living with my parents in high school. RA's are practically mall cops with a false sense of superiority complexes
College Junior,1,"We aren't as bad as Bob Jones, but we're pretty bad."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is very strict. We have a curfew we have to abide by, which is nice in the aspect that no one is coming in the door and being loud at any time of the night, but we are adults and shouldn't have something like a curfew. I understand not tolerating partying and drinking in the dorms, but the school prohibits drinking even off campus and I don't see why it should be a problem unless they are getting drunk, if they are old enough to have a drink."
College Freshman,1,If you have a party prepare to be expelled because you had fun
College Freshman,1,This school doesn't like anyone having fun

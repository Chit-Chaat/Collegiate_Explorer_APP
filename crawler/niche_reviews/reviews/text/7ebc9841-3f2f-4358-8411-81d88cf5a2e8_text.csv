Freshman,2,My experince of South University was a great one because I was greeted friendly my first day visiting the campus. I was shown even where my classes were before I ever started classes their. I was told everything I needed to have before I started my first semester of schooling and they even kept in touch with me so I could stay on top of everything I needed to have.
Recent Alumnus,2,The teachers are ok but I had an incident with one of the directors where he was very rude and degrading towards me in the presence of another director. She was very kind and disliked his actions. Also they do not fax or put an unofficial transcript in your hands. It goes through the same process and takes the same amount of time as an official one. (Might as well request the official one)
Niche User,1,"Do not attend this school for BSN. This is the only school that I know will fail you although you are passing your classes. The instructors certainly have favorites, they help who they want to help, and pass who they want to pass. The instructors and people at this school are all about a dollar. They will have you retaking classes just to get money out if you. The instructors do not care about the students nor care if they pass."

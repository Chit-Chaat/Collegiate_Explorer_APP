Graduate Student,5,"I found the overall experience with Brandman exactly what I needed. I went back to school to finish my Child psych degree, it was nice to have the support group that formed from others following the same program. I loved how simply my academic advisor made my time line. Her support was really what I needed when taking 7 classes and also working part time. I finished my degree before my goal. I recommend Brandman for those who aren't looking for the college life and are working at the same time. As I finished online you have to be a serious student to keep up with assignments on your own."
Graduate Student,5,While online classes can seem boring and disconnected I felt that my professors made a point to make it interactive. Sometimes it was hard to balance to mandatory check ins but staying in connect with teachers is important.
Junior,5,"Online learning through Brandman is great!

Continuity is key with them, Blackboard is used across the school and is always available.  I never have any technical issues with Brandman and they are always very forward when we will be experiencing any technical difficulties and are accommodating when issues arise.

Great communication and great resolve."
Junior,5,"Communication with staff advisors and financial aid is spot on.  Educators are flexible and understanding of workloads correlating with on the job training.  

Trimesters are fabulous and price of tuition matches accessibility and the quality of educators.

I would not go anywhere else, and hope to complete my graduate degrees through Brandman."
Senior,5,I am currently attending Brandman fully online and have had only good experiences with the online program.
Senior,5,I am a Liberal Arts major at Brandman and taking only online classes. I have had only great experiences with staff and teachers. I highly recommend this school!!
Junior,5,"my overall experience so far has been great. I have found them to be readily available, friendly, and thorough"

Junior,5,I have been taking all of my courses online. I enjoy the work and it isn't overwhelming. There are plenty of opportunities to seek assistance and the professors are helpful and communicative.

Graduate Student,5,Exceptional customer service and attentive staff. Great academic advisor and support support. Fast responses and assistance
Graduate Student,5,Very well structured online courses  and very flexible. instructors are flexible and understanding of work life balance
Senior,5,"Welcome to the Online Campus
Our team at the Online campus promotes a Student-Centered Care Model in all our interactions with students. We know and understand that connecting virtually requires a different approach to service, and we continually refine our services to better suit your needs. Our goal is to make the support services seamless so that you can focus on your academics and move toward graduation."
Graduate Student,5,I absolutely LOVE Brandman University! I love how they have so many options for how to complete your educational journey. I currently attend Brandman and all of my classes are virtual so I do not have to attend in person classes. This works perfectly for my busy schedule and I am learning so much information which will help me in my future career as a school psychologist!
Senior,5,Great experience and helpful advisors that tend to your academic needs. COurses are well thought out and allow you to learn immensely.
Junior,5,"I have attended Brandman since June of 2019 and so far I have really been loving it. I've noticed most of the complaints are about the financial aid department and I haven't had any problems what so ever. I rely fully on financial aid and have received them on time EVERY TIME. I feel as long as you've done your part, turn in all required documents early, and keep in contact with your one stop specialist you should be able to resolve any issue. I also think it's important to be familiar with policies of the school for example grading policies, dates to drop classes if you need to because you only get full refund if you drop the course before it starts, etc. I'm grateful that I have the option to attend an accredited school completely online and if you feel you need the flexibility to do so then inform yourself and see if it's a great fit."
Graduate Student,5,"Brandman is a great place to go for an accelerated degree. I am a single mom of two, working full time.  This was perfect for me."
Graduate Student,5,I attended the program in South Lake Tahoe California and was the first of nine to graduate from the newly established school. I loved my experience and found the program to be wonderful. The staff was extremely helpful and happy to accommodate the needs of the student. The hybrid program allowed for myself and other students to collaborate with our teacher in person on a weekly basis and interact with others in our cohort. I would recommend this program to anyone looking to further their education.
Junior,5,"I love the university and it’s wonderful establishment. There are a variety of veterans that attend here, including myself. The process to transition into school is extremely easy and the way the courses and academic workload is set up makes any student set up for success. One thing I would love to see different is the One Stop specialist and counselors. They do not help at all. Especially veterans. They always have attitudes which comes across as having one because they have a job they are paid to do. I also would like to see how financial aid is handled. Brandman will overcharge you 3 different times to rack up a bill so that it can take ALL of your student loans. Then it will wait a few weeks and correct the bill and eventually you get a refund. I’m unsure if it’s even legal tbh."
Senior,5,I love that Brandman is diverse and makes going to college as a military spouse so easy! The tuition waiver is great and they are flexible with our schedule. We are stationed overseas and I cannot imagine going anywhere else!
Graduate Student,5,"Amazing school for working folks, I could not have completed my degree in traditional school! With the support from my advisers and my professors I was able to complete my bachelors degree and now am moving on to my Masters!"
Junior,5,"I like how I was able to relate to a lot of people in my class, no matter if it was in class or online. Being a military spouse is pretty difficult but I ran into lots of military wives and It has been a great experience."
Graduate Student,5,The dedicated staff is very helpful and wants you to succeed! They srtie to answer all your questions and find the best path for you.  The school's variety of resources to help further your education and help with financial planning is very valuable.  The sense of community is appreciated and makes the daily grind easier to handle.
Graduate Student,5,"I felt like a perfect fit from the first day of my search for a school. That first call I received was the warmest and welcoming.  Everyone has been so nice, supportive and helpful. I look forward to attending class and learning. The advisors have been extremely helpful in getting my started and ready for classes."
Senior,5,"My experience so far has been great. I will be completed with my BA in Psychology by December 2019. The instructors are great and the courses are a breeze. I was very intimidated  going back to school at such an old age, but I’m here."
Junior,5,"The ease of the process to enroll and the super friendly and knowledgeable staff, made choosing this school an choice. The staff take a vested interest n your academics and check up on you, and are always just a phone call, email or office visit away. They always get back to you quickly and help in any way they can. I love going here!"
Senior,5,I have really enjoyed attending Brandman University. This university offers a great hybrid and online program that is excellent for working adults. Classes offered both fully online or as a hybrid model with class meeting once a week. I love the fact that they have many satellite campuses throughout Los Angeles which makes attending class convenient and accessible.  The professors at Brandman are great!
Niche User,5,"Brandman University is friendly. I went to the Palmdale, CA campus to inquire. They helped me figure out which area of study would help me out in my situation. I feel confident that this is the best school for me. They also attend our school districts employee recognition dinner. They had a nice display with literature and people to answer any questions."
Junior,5,"Great for military, affordable, the length of the courses are really great because you are not stuck in a class for months on end, it is fast paced, easy to stay on track, the student center keeps students on track, and there is a great deal of options when it comes to degrees that you can choose from."
Junior,5,"I am able to fulfill my entire degree online, but so far all of my teachers have been so personal that I feel like I am in the classroom with them. I feel like an actual human, rather than just a number in a lecture hall."
Graduate Student,5,"It's easy to apply just difficult to pay for as it's a private college. 
Not many options for payment plans."
Graduate Student,5,"Everything! It is a great school. I love the teachers and the advisors, staff that really take dedication in the students life."
Junior,5,Well organized program and affordable. Teachers are accommodating and willing to help students achieve their educational goal
Junior,5,From the moment I applied to Brandman there has always been someone there to guide me and answer any questions I may have. The application process is essy and fast.  The advisor taylors the schedule along with you and what will be most beneficial to achieve your degree.
Senior,5,They made sure that while I was having some issues with financial aid that I was able to continue school until that issue was resolved. They knew I was a good student and was passing all my classes. Now I will be graduating June 2019.
Junior,5,I attend Brandman Univerity via on-line courses. Their Blackboard application via mobile and computer is great and so is their self-help portal.
Graduate Student,5,Brandman University is with you every step of the way.  A personal coach is there to help you get started.  Enrollment is easy and their support system is quick to respond.  Their online classes are convenient and teachers are thorough and accessible.
Freshman,5,"Brandman has been the best college experience thus far. I'm returning to college after 10 years and the responsiveness of the academic office, the advisors and the professors is excellent."
Senior,5,"Brandman University is a great way to finish your degree on your terms.  I am currently taking 3 classes online every three weeks, and while it is hard to manage with work and home life, I make it work.  Brandman makes it easy for me to schedule the classes I want and the counselors help me schedule out my next three to four ""semesters"" so I stay on track."
Sophomore,5,This is going to be my first semester with the university but so far i love the program. I have found it to be the easiest thing to do is be able to have all of my schooling be complete online. This gives me time to be able to accomplish my task while working full time and trying to get my degree in school
Junior,5,They have been great and super helpful through my whole acceptance process! So happy to start at Brandman!
Sophomore,5,"Brandman University, Menifee has afforded me an awesome experience so far.  I am an aging student who is back in school after many years with a senior getting ready to attend college in August after graduation.  With the positive experience I have had at Brandman so far, I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a great place to continue their education and not feel like the odd man/lady out."
Sophomore,5,Brandman University is an excellent college. They offer flexibility in schedules and required courses are always available. The staff and faculty are friendly and helpful; they really make the process of receiving an education that much easier.
Senior,5,I enjoy that I am able to complete my schooling on my own time and i also enjoy that I am able to work from wherever especially when traveling.
Senior,5,"I absolutely love Brandman University.  My adviser and one-stop contact make registering and paperwork a breeze.  They are with you every step of the way.  Every instructor I have worked with is available for support via email, text, or call."
Sophomore,5,The staff are always extremely prompt and helpful with questions or concerns. The professors have all been amazing teaching the courses. I love it.
Sophomore,5,Extremely happy with Brandman University. I have had support from the staff the entire time as an on-campus and online student.
Graduate Student,5,"I have attended brandnan’s victorville campus over the last 10 years and the professors have been very helpful and supportive.  

The advisors and admin staff are very knowledgeable, helpful and caring. 

The small satelite campus is clean and safe. It has good and helpful resources and access to a computer lab"
Junior,5,"Honestly, I love Brandman University. I have had a great experience with them every step of the way, and they've made getting my degree (online) while being active duty military much more achievable. The counselors have always taken the time to help me create education plans, and the instructors are always understanding when life inevitably comes up. Additionally, I found one of the nicest things is that books generally aren't nearly as expensive as many other schools. I would say the only thing I wish I could change is that some of the classes I need for my degree aren't offered that many times per year, and that makes things a little bit less flexible. But still, my experience with Brandman has been overwhelmingly positive, and I'm glad to be a student."
Junior,5,I love Brandman's course structure and helpful advisors. They really take their time to explain things to you and help you out when needed
Graduate Student,5,My overall experience at Brandman has been amazing. The only thing I would like to see change is the online bookstore because the books tend to be very expensive. The professors are also amazing and very knowledgeable. They are always there to help and answer questions you may have.
Junior,5,"I truly enjoy attending Brandman. My academic advisor has been great with any and all questions I may have. I also have enjoyed my interactions with my professors. My favorite part has been my classroom interactions. I enjoy the online courses as well, but absolutely prefer to have an in-person interaction."
Junior,5,"Great school for army veterans, working students, and family life. Generous financial aid packages that go year round. Helpful enrollment coaches, academic advisors, and financial aid counselors. Classes available through the year on campus and online. Multiple locations all across the United States. Professors are well educated and knowledgeable."
Alum,5,"I attended Brandman University's Santa Clarita campus. Overall I had a great experience. Most classes were on campus or hybrid. The campus was small, just one building, but it was large and kept very clean. There was a small ""student store"" that sold coffee and an area in the back with tables for students to sit outside. My advisor and financial aid specialist were wonderful. They were very responsive to my questions and needs; the advisor was on it when I asked to make a last minute change to my schedule due to work. The financial aid specialist did all the work and outlined everything I needed to do on my end in order to get FAFSA taken care of, and she did the rest on time. On campus class times worked well with my work schedule."
Senior,5,I really enjoy the freedom of the online school and the quality of education. Everyone is there to help you. I look forward to graduating from Brandman.
Senior,5,I like the convenience of studying online due to work schedule and although I study online the staff at brandman make sure you are successful. Everything is available to you as if you are attending on campus. I don’t really have anything I would change because brandman is a great university to attend online and on campus
Graduate Student,5,"Brandman University offers great staff, helpful counselors, and overall educationally rich classes. If you ever have a question or concern there is a help desk always available. They made the process of achieving my BA very easy."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Brandman University. I chose to come here because my mother had nothing but positive things to say about this university. I was previously at California State University Northridge and felt that I was going nowhere, Brandman has shown me the light. I would not change a thing about Brandman because they was it is set up is just right for me. Brandman has the best staff and online courses I have seen."
Junior,5,"So far, Brandman has given me the flexibility and opportunity to continue my education. I am extremely content to be able to earn my BSW."
Sophomore,5,The staff communicates and supports well. I am a returning student after many years in between and they have made my return experience comfortable. I recommend this school to older students wanted to complete their long term goals.
Junior,4,I have signed up for all online classes for upcoming semester. But i have already logged in and trying to become familiar with the setup
Junior,4,Brandman is an amazing college and the most of instructors are very accommodating. Brandman was one of my first choice for school because there are flexible with there online class schedule. The schedule work well with my job schedule.
Graduate Student,4,professors are great . time of classes are well assigned . they are organized . just some staffs are not good .
Graduate Student,4,great online school . easy to adopt . can predict what is coming . better than other schools that I searched .
Junior,4,Brandman has been the best college experience. They are super helpful and involved in your academic journey.
Freshman,4,"I currently attend Brandman University through their Online Campus. So far so good, just your average online school. The classes are challenging but fair - though my teachers don't get back to you quick enough for the current week's assignment. Other students are friendly and are all of all ages and ethnicities."
Senior,4,"I'm part of the partnership between College of the Canyons (COC) and Brandman University. Unfortunately, there aren't any on-campus classes for my program (Information Technology) at COC's University Center so most of my experience has been online. Despite that, my online experience with Brandman so far has been great! All the professors seem really passionate with what they teach especially through weekly announcements and participating in their own discussion boards. Some professors also leave behind comments on assignments to let you know how well you did, any good points you made, or any improvements you can make."
Niche User,4,I like that they offer evening classes and online courses for students who have day work. This school is great for people who have other things involved outside of school.
Junior,4,"The best part of Brandman University are the professors. The ones I have personally had are fair, have high expectations, and are compassionate."
Senior,4,I liked that some teachers interacted in discussion boards not just expecting the students to. I would change how certain assignments seem rushed.
Graduate Student,4,I am enrolled in an all-online graduate program and so far it is going fine.  There is a bit of inconsistency in the workload and expectations of the professors despite the same requirements in each syllabus.  Instructional quality and text selection is great.
Junior,4,"I've been very impressed with how easy it's been to enroll in courses at Brandman and talk to an advisor whenever I need to. There's a lot of open communication with the faculty in general, so I always feel like I'm heard and helped. Their online program is an excellent way to balance classes with work and other responsibilities as well. I truly feel like the people at Brandman want me to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,I love how much help I am getting in different areas of my schooling as I have enrolled. Never had I had someone follow up with me to ensure that I did not have any concerns and to support me throughout the enrollment process.
Graduate Student,4,Teachers were great! Online courses made it convenient for me to finish! Financial aid was chaos. They messed up my aid and I had to skip a semester.
Junior,4,"I like the variety of classes that I can take online. I am a full time e employee and the online classes have been easily accessible and intersting. I also like that when I call to speak tomsomeone, an employee has always been available. The staff has worked with my student educational plan and has never pressured me to take more than I can handle."
Graduate Student,4,"Brandman University is a great place to obtain education, especially for graduate degree experience. Brandman University is especially nice for working adults who return back to school to further professional goals."
Senior,4,"What I like about Brandman University is it gives adults who have been out of school for a long time and wish to return an opportunity to earn a degree while working full time. As a non traditional college, Brandman offers both blended and fully online classes for its students. The Academic Advisors are very dedicated in helping students reach their academic goals."
Graduate Student,4,I just started but it has been a good experience so far. The advisors and enrollment coaches have been supportive and very helpful.
Senior,4,I love how easy it is to get a hold of the counseling and financial office. The staff is very helpful and attentive.  Everyone is very friendly as well.  Online schooling is a great way to get school done and still have a busy life.
Junior,4,Brandman provides fast paced classes which aims to help the student achieve their degree sooner. Professors are knowledgeable & strive tohelp students succeed. Tuition is costly but the path to a career hopefully will pay off. Support staff are involved with student progress and aim to help students successfully complete courses while learning all they can pertaining to their career path.
Freshman,4,Brandman University is geared towards working adults which helps students like me out a lot. I was able to return back to school after taking a few years off and the advisors and professors made it easy for me. Due to the face that it’s geared towards working adults I am able to continue working full time as well as pursue my bachelors in legal studies. The professors are easy to contact and more than willing to help. The only factor that I would change is being able to take more than two classes at once. Other than that I am glad I chose to go back to school and am attending Brandman University.
Junior,4,Professors are very insightful and helpful. Love the atmosphere and learning. Looking to complete my bachelors and continue here for my masters.
Sophomore,4,"Hello, 
My name is Tonya and I am currently a sophomore at Brandman University. Online education has been wonderful. It not only works around my family schedule but it's also moving quickly towards my degree. The amount per unit is rather high, I would appreciate a lower cost per trimester. But I have been grateful for the education I am receiving."
Senior,4,"People are very mature and also they take school seriously.You build many strong relationships with others. The professors are helpful and they answer any questions that you have. The classes are very small so, you get to know the people that attend your classes.Yet, they do need a library and also provide a cafeteria with more food."
Alum,4,"I went here as a graduate student. I like that the course expectations are predictable from class to class in terms of weekly assignments and time commitments. It usually meant a weekly discussion post and a paper about every week. It may include a group project halfway through the term, as well as a major ""signature assignment,"" which was simply the big final project/paper.  This school is ideal for those who are looking for a straight forward educational experience . If you take online classes, it may be difficult to build relationships with others, but if you're a working adult, it may not be a priority and therefore works well. If you're looking for additional support from students and faculty, accountability to establish those relationships will fall on the student."
Senior,4,"The classes are well taught and informative. It is a little bit expensive. The classes are fast paced and the only break is during Christmas. However, I find this a little helpful as it does not give me time to fall into bad habits."
Junior,4,"After 30 years in the business/retail world, I am finally going back to complete my BA. Brandman was the only University that met my needs for online courses, financials and course studies. The help that I have gotten has made this so much easier and fun. Never would of figured going back at age 50 to complete 30 units and to move forward towards a teaching degree.
The help/advise has been wonderful and I couldn't do this without them."
Senior,4,I would like a masters in criminal justice.  The online program was very time consuming.  I loved the 8 week classes.
Sophomore,4,"I go to the Yuba City Campus that is in Northern California. The staff in the office are amazing, they will help you with anything and everything you need. When I was first applying the enrollment  personnel  took the time out to call me  often and make sure everything was going smoothly. The program that the online community uses Brandman University is easy to use in is very easy to learn. I use the GI bill to pay for my tuition and my graduation date is in 2019. I recently called the staff at Yuba City to see if we can bump up the date so I can use my GI Bill to continue my Master's at the University. She told me that she would try her best and she emailed me with the next day with my new education plan. They go out of their way to make sure the student is taken care of. I would recommend Brandman University to any new student or any adult of thinking about going back to school. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else but Brandman University"
College Junior,4,"I feel safe at the building where the classes are held. The parking lot is small, so you don't have far to walk, and well lit."
College Junior,4,"This is my 6th college/university that I have attended.  All the courses are 8 weeks long, and there are more terms then a normal college/university. Which helps you graduate faster. The professors are very helpful, stern but fair.  The classes are either hybrid or online, which works out great for a busy lifestyle."
College Senior,4,the staff at Brandman guide you in the right direction so that you can be successful and get a job.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm very happy with the services provided by my counselors. Financial Aid is not very helpful, however they are currently working on assisting me with scholarships"
College Sophomore,4,I'm very happy with all the services the school has provided me in the past few months. I can communicate with both my financial aid counselor and my career advisor in a very timely manner via email. So far I have no complaints.
College Junior,4,Academic advisors and coaches are great
Recent Alumnus,4,The classes sizes are what attracted me to this program.
Recent Alumnus,4,They are willing to work with you to develop your career.
Recent Alumnus,4,"So far as a student at Brandman, I feel as if I am one of the only students. They make sure everything is being understood properly as well as checking on my graduation status frequently."
College Junior,4,The value of the degree currently being attained through this university allows convenience with current life events.
College Junior,4,"Depending on your schedule, this university can offer convenient ways with approved WASCU credentials to prevail in your current carreer."
College Junior,4,Classes start January 11. This will be my first time attending this particular university. I can say this has been by far the best experience I've had applying for school and registering for classes. Everyone has been so helpful and they are always calling and checking in. They care for the students and you can tell they love where they work.
College Junior,4,For going to a online mainly school it is better than I thought it was going to be! Best choice I have made
Recent Alumnus,4,"I just started at Brandman University and when I initially went into the Lacey campus to talk  to an adviser, he was one of the nicest people I've ever worked with during my college process. Actually, everyone I've talked to working for Brandman has been awesome! They were so incredibly helpful from start to finish. Brandman is geared toward that student with a full time job looking to complete their Bachelors or Masters. My entire program is online and I will have completed my degree in just a year and a half. I would definitely choose this school again based on its convenience with my schedule, the staff, and the programs that it offers."
College Junior,4,I really love the staff at the Whidbey Island campus. They have been very helpful in my transition from SVC.
College Senior,4,I'm taking Organizational Leadership and this will help me get my foot in the door teaching at a local college or in the school district.

College Senior,4,Hardly any problems getting in
College Sophomore,4,I am online so its a little different. I don't have the classroom feedback but I do have longer to consider my answer. The workload is not heavy for me because I have so much time to do it. The advantage of online.
College Sophomore,4,I had no problems getting into my program
College Senior,4,It's all online so it allows me to work in the field of my choosing as well.
College Senior,4,"Registration was a nightmare. Course loads are exhausting but expected, as each class only lasts 8 weeks. I like that I can graduate quickly. I don't like that the school offers almost no scholarships or grants at all."
College Senior,4,"This is for the area I live, as my school is online."
College Senior,4,I didn't experience much difficulty other than getting my transcripts to the college and getting financial estimates quickly.
College Senior,4,I am in the psychology program and I really like it.
College Senior,4,very diverse and no discrimination
College Junior,4,have not seen any real issues with diversity
College Junior,4,Good scholarships offered for certain degrees and when starting during certain terms.

College Junior,4,I do online courses through Brandman.
College Junior,4,"Interests vary, but in the program I am in social work and public service are the two main interests. Variety of races."
Graduate Student,2,"I took all classes online, staff was very vague with helping students. It felt as if the student was on their own. The online system wasn't easy to work with. I would not recommend this school to anyone in the future. I feel it could have a better learning experience."
College Sophomore,2,"I attended a community college, so athletics and clubs were not really advertised."
College Junior,2,"I dont think there is any transportation offered by the school. It is all outside providers, so a car is needed if you do not want to use public transportation."
College Senior,2,"There is not a whole lot to do here, although there are a few bars in Lemoore and Hanford."
College Sophomore,2,"At this college you don't take your major classes until your second year, the make you take your academics  until you get your associates degree. "
College Senior,2,"I attend a branch of the college, so there is not much that is offered to students in terms of a library and computer lab. If you need a book, you can request it from the main campus and they will send it to you pretty fast. "
Recent Alumnus,2,There different  land of apartments all over and you will just have to look for one
College Junior,2,"I am required to attend immersion sessions several times a year on campus.  Campus is located in Irvine, CA.  I am responsible for flight and hotel accommodations which puts a financial strain on me."
College Junior,2,"At my satellite campus there aren't very many options: IHOP, Burger King, Starbucks, and a gas station or two. But there are many locations throughout the city"
College Junior,2,"I attend a satellite school, so all the dining options are off campus"
College Junior,2,I attend a satellite school and do distance-learning
College Senior,2,"I am obtaining my BA in Liberal Studies with an emphasis on Teaching.  I have been somehwat satisfied with my education it really just depends on which teacher I get.  They are so varied, some have been very helpful and explain things very well; go out of their way to make sure you are doing okay.  Where as other teachers are distant and unhelpful.  Overall, I think brandman is average, from the office staff to the instructors."
Recent Alumnus,2,At the Antelope Valley campus most of the computers are not working and some are too slow.
College Sophomore,2,"Brandman provides pizza parties, pastries, and other food items for the students.  There are no bars near my particular campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The bus stop if very close to my campus; however, it does not run late at night."
College Junior,2,"The only school scholarship I'm aware of is for early childhood majors, and the on site staff were not very helpful in guiding me to financial aid opportunities.  The financial aid office has failed to package my award even though they've had it since March."
College Sophomore,2,Child Development – I was so happy to be able to and then they took it away from me.
Recent Alumnus,2,Odd Individuals – Being that Chapman University College is designed for working adult learners there are many students that are married and the very few that aren't are not of my liking at all.
Junior,1,"This is a typical schools that seeks to scam veterans and job them for their GI beneifts. They are purposely avoiding paying my tuition with the GI Bill so they can steal my financial aid. I have made several attempts to contact the staff to fix this. First time, said that it would pay week 7! Most recent time, said they are looking into it and never got back to me but tried to offer me loans! Nevertheless, the business school is trash. Upper division classes are full of non majors that don't care about the subject yet you are forced to do group assignments with them which affects your individual grade. Lastly, avoid this school like the plague!!!!!!!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"When I attended my community college, I felt very unsafe. The security was always telling us that we were on lock down because people were fighting and had guns on campus. When  needed to go to the book store, I would always carry my pepper spray because there would always be a group of guys harassing women and dancing to really loud and vulgar music. I once had a guy follow me all the way to my class, even when I asked him to leave me alone."
College Sophomore,1,I should have skipped this section as I am online. I don't think Brandman has housing.
College Sophomore,1,Brandman is primarily an online campus. There are no sport teams to my knowledge.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at Brandman.
College Sophomore,1,I attend school online so there is no party scene for me.
College Senior,1,"Because I attend a branch of the college, they do not offer dorm room living."
College Senior,1,"There is nothing in our break room except for three vending machines, a microwave and a fridge. The main campus actually has a cafeteria."
College Senior,1,"Unfortunately, I do not think my school takes the time to counsel its students.  Every aspect is to rush you through their system and they seem more concerned with getting you in as quickly as possible so they can get their money out of you.  Once in their system, they do the bare minimum to provide support.  More concern and care as to the students questions, degree programs and career aspects should be provided."
College Senior,1,"I am incredibly disappointed with the MA Ed Instructional Technology program at Brandman University.  I have completed nine classes and find the work to be repetitive and mundane.  The professors don't comment on the work.  This includes both the online and the ground professors.  The discussion boards are a waste of time.  There are several people in each class who write submissions which are unintelligible while others write responses which are incomplete and brief.  My exposure to new technologies has been limited and I have had to turn to colleagues who have shared their knowledge of technology with me.  We spend more time spitting out rhetoric than learning about technology.  If I hadn't spent so much on these classes, and if the classes would have been transferable to another program, I would have transferred a long time ago.  I am ready to be done with this program."
College Student,1,"Hi :
thats first time at school i give grade d from brandman"
College Junior,1,There is no on campus or off campus housing. It is not a traditional university atmosphere.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school is by far the most expensive plus their new strategy with Brandman University and their idea of the ""blended classroom"" is by far the worst and most exhausting idea out there.  I say, run for the hills!  This school has hardly been around long enough to establish a name, let alone getting started on the wrong foot. I am happy that my degree shows Chapman University and not the Brandman name.  I look forward to the CSU process from a reputable school with an actual Brand NAME, not to forget to mention... a way cheaper price plus instructors that are involved if you want them to be, unlike the lack of instructor involvement with Brandman.  Brandman has changed for the worse the last two years but mostly the last two sessions I've been a student with Brandman for their graduate program and have suffered from their new changes.  People, it is far worth the effort to apply to a meaningful school with a reputable name that is recognized! "

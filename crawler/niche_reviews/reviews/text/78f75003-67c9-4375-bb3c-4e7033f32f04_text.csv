Alum,5,"I am a graduate of Paine College. Everyone from the President to the Support Staff works to help students achieve. I decided to earn a Ph.D. because of Paine College and its Faculty and Administration. Our motto was, ""You can get there from here"" and that was true for me.  I just completed my Ph.D. from the University of Memphis and am working at Park University in Missouri! 

At Paine College, you will be supported. You will learn in an environment that cares about you and your success. I love Paine College, and would not have had the academic success that I have without it.

College Sophomore,4,"Paine College is a small, private, family orientated school; which is part of the reason I came. I like attending this school because of the 1 on 1 tutoring that I receive and also because of the many programs that they offer. We even have a student ran base tutoring program where students are hired to tutor other students in any subject they feel they are weak in.

There is one unique aspect to this program which consist of all biology majors presenting a research paper before graduation.
College Senior,4,the drug scene at Paine is big. About 90 percent of the students do some type of drug and most of the time they are doing them in the open. The security on this campus is not that great.
College Senior,4,Paine is a Historically Black College so there is very little diversity
College Junior,4,"Paine is really known for the basketball teams. Majority of the students go to the basketball games, boys persay, versus any of the other sports that Paine has to offer. The track and cross country teams are good but students dont hear about their success or failure until the teammates return."
College Junior,4,Mnay policies are reflected by the book; may be some leeway depending on the infraction; but academics and social activities are monitored closely by faculty.
College Junior,4,"Currently would like to complete my degree and look into graduate schools. Would like to pursue a stable career in business and look into some legal areas along the way.

College Junior,4,"Our computer labs are filled with 20+ computers that are up to date! printing is NEVER a problem, you can print as much as you want! Network reliabilty has never bee a problem and the speed is up to par! Wireless is all on campus and I say one doesn't necessarily need a laptop, unless you prefer to stay private."
College Junior,4,"It Depends on the Person.. Off0Campus housing location depends on the individual. If students want to pay cheap, you get cheap. If you have wealthy parents...well that's what you get, Nice Apartments!"

Senior,2,Online learning was bad because some professors had a hard time working with computer technology and responded late via email.
College Sophomore,2,its not really a great experience

College Senior,2,I am so far not in any of the programs i'm supposed to be in yet so i enjoy nothing
College Junior,2,financial aid is too complicated you can pay all the money but then there are fees and other things that you do not now about and you are notified late about these hidden fees and charges and they increase the price
College Junior,2,some people do get kicked out for drugs but drugs on campus has lead some students into danger and trouble
College Junior,2,alot of people has cars on campus and the campus is really small so there is not alot of room
College Junior,2,"Internet is horrible, online classes are down"
College Freshman,2,The campus officers are strict about some of the wrong things. They treat us like little children sometimes.
College Freshman,2,"When it rains, it pours. And then once it clears up the campus has huge mud puddles. And that causes a lot of mud tracking throughout the buildings."
College Sophomore,2,they are not playing around
College Sophomore,2,Food sometime just isn't what you want or find that you want
Recent Alumnus,2,If I decide to stay at Paine then yes I would be required to have an internship at on of the elementary schools. I would be student teaching.
Recent Alumnus,2,College apartments are available but normally college students like to party and I don't care for that. It also takes a semester to receive your refund so you can't depend on that to help.
College Junior,2,We have some computers that have relatively good speed and then there are some that take 15 minutes just to turn on. They are older model computers so their abilities are limited.
College Junior,2,You have a campus curfew to where you have to be inside your room at a certain time. The dorms are really old and have roaches in them. Residents have to wash in a community shower and the rooms are very tiny. Dining hall has limited food options and very few varieties if any. It is a hassle to get things done at this school but once the year kicks off and gets going you just kind of get used to it.
College Junior,2,Most students here are black and some are white and you have a handful of Hispanic students.
College Senior,2,"i dont do drugs. so if anyone is doing drugs .i dont know.
i donot drink. and i have not tryed. people no the rules and they know donot to
do these things on school grounds."

College Sophomore,2,The computers at Paine College run extremely slow.
Freshman,1,"My experience would very little. It’s different from other HBCU colleges. I would like to change the cafeteria food, the sports coaches, and the teachers."
College Freshman,1,"The food is disgusting , and bad academics"
College Junior,1,Well be dead by the morning
College Junior,1,It is a jail cell
College Junior,1,Paine College does not help me find off campus housing
College Senior,1,I came into my freshamn thinking i would take dramam classes and thinkingi'd be doign the things i wanted to as far as my acting career ! also come to find out all that had asked and applied for to major in isn't even at the school i attend which forced me to change my major and then i wanted to double major but they do not have a double major availability on campus
College Senior,1,"I barely recieve any aid ! my balance is always huge and is never covered for ,my semester  it's ahuge stress on me while in school"
College Sophomore,1,All off the dorms on campus are really old. There mold that they didn't bother to try and clean in my dorm bathroom before we moved on campus. Our floors are cracks and missing tiles. There are roaches in the dorms. The windows don't even open. I just feel the cost that we are paying to stay on campus is not worth it at all.
Recent Alumnus,1,Our only option is the city bus if you don't have a car and they have vans. When I first started school they promised that if we needed a ride to Wal-Mart or anything the vans would be available as soon as school started it wasn't. It was a hassle. 
Recent Alumnus,1,This school has taken so much from. I been sitting out for almost a year because I can't continue without passing GACE II and I only have my internship left. I just don't think it's fair because of student loans and the lack of support from the my department. I was only 4 and 6 points from passing and my chair if my department has yet to email me back. Transferring was never an option but now I have to do something.
Recent Alumnus,1,It's a long waiting process. There are a few different department heads you will have to go through in order to get financial aid. It would be easier if the department communicate with the other departments to cancel  out confusion.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid process is not very professional. Instead of doing it all electronically they put you through a estimated award letter process at the start of the school semester. Then, you have to wait a few days until your real award letter arrives in order to sign it and process your funding.  I am currently still waiting on my aid and it is September 16th. We started school on August 19th and i am not expected to get it until October."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking on campus is very hectic.  People park like they have a big 18-wheeler. To many locals park on our campus, the security don't do anything about it. For anybody that comes to this school the parking lot floods when it rain hard. So we all are in the same situation."
College Sophomore,1,"The guys fight like girls on this campus.  The girls act all stuck up, and a lot of them are some freaks.  Have of the campus smoke, like 98% of the campus smoke weed.  This is bad for this campus. Bad looks on the student and the faculty and staff because of what the girls and boys do on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"At our school, people be smoking weed all the time, the sorry security cops don't do nothing about it.  People be drinking all the time, they don't do nothing about it.  They let to many people get away with things on campus.  People don't come to class, still get good grades, matter of fact better grades than me and that's not fair."
College Sophomore,1,"They are to slow, and I have yet to receive a refund check, and the process of me getting cleared takes a long time. So most of the forms I have to keep up with them or else the people will claim that they lost my papers.  We need more help to aid our financial aid process, the people are playing with our money, and that is not cool.  I am struggling, I can't afford to buy books with money I have. Our financial aid need to be stronger."
College Junior,1,"When it rains really hard, campus has a tendency to flood so us students are trapped inside of the dorms due to the lack of rain boots. There are puddles everywhere and dorm rooms sometimes leak due to the heavy rainfall."
College Sophomore,1,Dont Eat Here – This food is very unacceptable. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. Students complain all the time about there food. Its too expensive for quality.
College Sophomore,1,"People fight, drink, and smoke marajuana frequently."
College Sophomore,1,The school is in the center of two rival neighborhoods.

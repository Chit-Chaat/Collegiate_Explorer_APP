Freshman,5,"I really liked Greenville University, because it has a great athletic program and education program. I am excited for my education whenever I get there, and to meet new people."
Junior,5,"My experience with Greenville University is quite next to amazing. I have never felt more involved with my education than ever. I mean it is like I want to shoot for that A+ on my papers, and even further for my final grade. I want to strive for better, and I have GU to thank for that!"
Freshman,5,The people here are great and love meeting new people. The teachers are easy to talk to and want to have there students succeed.
Freshman,5,The instructors are amazing. They really inspire you to do your very best! I have appreciated the opportunities we receive within the classroom as well as outside of the classroom. I enjoyed traveling to St. Louis for my Theology class and experiencing the different churches and people. I also appreciated working with an area St. Louis school and gaining the opportunity to work with children and instructors there. The experience has furthered my interest and excitement for the major I have chosen in Elementary Education!
Niche User,5,I will enroll in August of 2019 but I have had a great experience with touring the campus and getting accepted. Everyone I have come in contact with has been extremely nice and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I love Greenville University. Being a no traditional student was something I was very nervous about. However, when I got there everyone was so nice, welcoming and loving. I was able to stand out in the classroom, engage with my professors, and show my talents off to the student body. Everything we learned is Christ centered and I just love that about this school. Who would’ve thought that I would meet so many people running for Christ in one small institution was a blessing beyond compare. My experience here has been the best, and every year gets better and better. God has really met me in this place and it has made me a stronger believer in the Lord our God. When the president of the school knows you by name...as well as your professors, that’s how you know God is in the midst of this. No school can compare to what Greenville has to offer. We are not just a number, they genuinely care about us and our future."
Freshman,5,family town great learning east enrollment professors are always there small class size beautiful grounds very diverse culture and welcomes all cultures and international students
Freshman,5,"Greenville is a great place for students to get a base in many different areas of expertise. I am a music student and the music program here is incredible.  It is always evolving with the times and is up to date.  While at some other schools are stuck in the mindset of only classical style music degrees, Greenville offers a variety of music degrees from audio engineering to music education. Greenville also has a fantastic pre-med program."
Freshman,5,Greenville has been a great place to grow spiritually and intellectually. It has been an excellent place to try new things and stretch my mind and imagination. I have met amazing people and had amazing experiences!
Alum,5,Greenville is a great Christian college. It offers so many opportunities for you to earn your degree. I was a full time working mom while attending classes full time thanks to Greenville's UTEP program. I earned my BS Elementary Education with a 4.0 GPA!
Sophomore,5,"A Great atmosphere! The school is small enough that its easy to get to know your professors and fellow students. Its also large enough to offer many different extra curricular activities and sports. The student life is a great experience, and you learn the true meaning of the word community here!"
Freshman,5,"Greenville College is a great place to be immersed in a true Christian community. At Greenville College, students are encouraged to be their true selves. While the college has great academics and professors who know their students on a personal level, the college also does a fantastic job at integrating faith into academics, athletics, and extra-curriculars."
College Senior,5,Greenville College is a place of academic and spiritual growth through community and learning.
College Senior,5,I hear about a lot of great outcomes.
College Senior,5,I enjoy the way everyone is treated equally.
College Junior,5,"Due to the smallness of this college, the campus crime rate is small. of course, there is still the occasional theft but the measures set in lace help greatly."
College Senior,5,"Programs are great, football brought me here! I love the fan environment! One big community, winning or losing."
College Freshman,5,Our campus seems to be very safe and people are watching out for each other also.  Its a great community.  I like the small campus atmosphere too.
College Freshman,5,Professors have been very easy to work with in classes.  I have found they are very approachable and want to help students to succeed
College Freshman,5,I'm very excited to be part of the Baseball program at Greenville and believe I have a good future here over the next 4 years.  I appreciate the coaches and my teammates.
College Freshman,5,I was very pleased with the process of getting into Greenville College.  It was a late option for me and I was able to get everything taken care of in under a month.  Very pleased and surprised at how smooth it was and the admissions office was a great help in that process.
College Freshman,5,It's a bit family were we all help one another even if one slips on school work or just needs a study buddy we their to help.
College Freshman,5,"I love that Greenville challenges me to apply my faith in all situations.  I can walk from math to Spanish and know that I will be engaged in ways that push me to analyze why I should follow God in all that I do.

I don't have to question whether or not the professors care about me because I know that they do.  They are always willing to work problems out and have even taken one-on-one time to make sure I am comfortable in the class."
College Freshman,5,"I""ve never felt unsafe on campus and the teachers have talked to us multiple times about safety and Title IX"
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a resident chaplain, so residence life is something I'm very invested in.  So naturally I would think it's the best.  I love being able to take part in and facilitate the community, because the community is really Greenville's treasure."
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe at this school. We have great security. It is also not just a dry campus but a dry community. Also, students have a responsibility on this campus, every student who attends the college has signed a lifestyle statement which helps keep everyone safe."
College Freshman,5,Greenville is a really safe place to live and go to school. It is very uncommon for things like sexual assault and harassment to happen.
College Freshman,5,"Greenville knows that they are expensive, so they do their best to be available to students who don't have a lot of money. They have a lot of scholarships and they are very willing to help you get through the process."
College Freshman,5,Tons of school spirit and lots of things to get excited about! The football team is pretty good and it is fun cheering them on. Soccer ad baseball are also big hits.
College Freshman,5,"The teachers here make you feel as though you are part of one big family. I have already visited some of them in their homes and they are super welcoming and caring. I don't have any professors that I don't like, because they are all good at what they do."
College Junior,5,Top EDU Program. Profs make time for students
College Sophomore,5,I've been on the Residence Life staff so I know that I'm a little biased but I've enjoyed my experience in on campus housing. The people I live with are really genuine and socially it's been a plus. If you're willing to be patient the living conditions are not terrible at all and I've also learned a lot about responsibility since I came here.
College Sophomore,5,People from everywhere; international students
College Sophomore,5,"Great education program, profs are excellent"
College Freshman,5,There is a huge diversity on Greenville Campus. For the most part I believe that Greenville is open to all types of people.
College Freshman,5,There are always eyes watching. The prohibitions on drugs and alcohol use is very strict and there are major consequences for breaking this rule.
College Sophomore,5,they helped me a whole lot!!!
College Sophomore,5,Greenville is a very friendly town! Never have to look far for a friend or help if needed.
College Sophomore,5,Illinois weather is really unpredictable. Rain or snow normally do not put a halt on anything going on at school though. 
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone has the opportunity to get to know new people. We do not have a huge campus, so chances are if you are going some where on campus, the space will be fairly small and you will be able to meet someone new. "
College Sophomore,5,"I love my advisor. He is so helpful with whatever it is I may need help with; he also genuinely cares about me and what is happening in my life. We are not pushed to be big CEOs of companies or to become the next Steve Jobs, but rather encouraged to do what makes us happy, what God wants us to do, and to do what we can to positively impact the lives of others. "
Recent Alumnus,5,The professors are what made my experience at Greenville College great. They were so knowledgeable in their respective fields and also so personable.
Recent Alumnus,5,There is something very unique about the the faculty at Greenville College. They are all top-notch professors and leaders in their respective fields but exude a genuine interest in the well-being of each student.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I genuinely loved everything about my major at Greenville College- the professors, class variety, curriculum, workload, etc."
College Sophomore,5,It is a drug and alcohol free school. Students are required to commit to abstaining from such things.  Even so there are a very select few who partake but it is really looked down upon by the majority of students.
College Junior,5,The library seems to have a good array of computers and the school as a whole always strives to be on the cutting-edge of technology.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are amazing! I have not a a problem with a single one. Every professor wants every student to succeed. The workload is an average amount. You still have some free time, but if you want to have good grades most of your time has to go towards academics."
College Sophomore,5,"Drugs and alcohol are not talked about much at Greenville. There are a good bit of people that take part in doing those things, but it is not normally on campus. However, I have found a empty bottle of whisky and a bag of weed in the freshman parking lot before. If someone is caught with drugs or alcohol they are normally expelled."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics there are great. The professors really care about each student and there grade. Also, the professors are very good at helping students that need help or refer them to the tutors that can help them."
College Freshman,5,We have over 100 mac desktops on campus. They can switch between windows and apple.
College Freshman,5,"Greenville College academics are very excellent. Being a business management major, our classes are very useful and I learn a lot. The professors teach so well and that is a big factor to learning a lot in class. The classes are not so hard that you will fail, and it is not so easy that you say to yourself, ""I didn't even need to take that class in the first place. I knew that in the first place."" Classes are a mixture and I like that!"
College Sophomore,5,They have a ton of majors to choose from and great programs.
College Sophomore,5,"The financial aid office is a God-send! No matter what you need, they will try and find you money, from somewhere. The school offers to match a donation by your church. It has grants and scholarships based on your ACT/SAT scores, and if you need loans, you are able to stop them for how much you have actually used, instead of the full semester. My first semester, I paid $14. <-- Not a typo. The school worked with me and that's all I needed to pay."
College Freshman,5,"Greenville College and everyone part of the grounds crew and staff work very hard to make the best out of what we have. Most of the buildings on campus have been around for a while, but you wouldn't be able to tell that unless you knew that. Also, the college works very hard to fix things when they are broken, which is a huge plus. Many community members donate old buildings that the college turns into something for the school. For example, our music center is the old Methodist Church."
Recent Alumnus,5,"You will only find drugs at this school if you go off campus. It is a drug & alcohol free school and students are not allowed to use either, but you still find them in off campus housing (not funded by the school)."
College Sophomore,5,"When accidents are reported, ambulance and fire services are located on campus within 5 minutes. Our campus security does a great job of parking mishaps, writing tickets in accordance to where cars should be and where they are located and report accidents as they happen. The campus security makes sure places that should be locked at night are locked to where access is not possible and there has been crime to an extent where campus security has had to step in. Personally, the safety of Greenville College's campus is outstanding and the officers to a great job at what they do."
College Senior,5,"On Top of Technology – Because Greenville College has Digital Media as a major, they have several computer labs that usually only get super crowded during finals. Plus GC has a completely wireless campus! You get Wifi everywhere, in the dorms, in the Dining Commons, on Scott Field, and in all the classrooms. They also have a lot of up-to-date programs for their majors, like the Adobe Creative Design Suite CS5."
College Sophomore,5,"Lifestyle Statement – When you apply for the college you accept the terms of the lifestyle statement.  Greenville College students are not permitted to drink,smoke, swear, do drugs, or have sex on campus because it goes against the Christian values of the college. Besides, the college offers hundreds of ways to have fun without all that stuff."
College Sophomore,5,"New Imacs! The school just purchased brand new iMacs for every computer lab on campus. Before you login you have the option of operating with windows or apple. Because it's a small campus, there's always more than one computer available everywhere. You can only print in the library (or in a dorm if a floormate has a printer), but the library has great hours. On top of all that, the school has full campus wireless coverage for laptops, ipads, and/or phones with wifi, and it's fairly fast too!"
College Sophomore,5,"If You Want to Do It, You Can! The only prerequisite to enter the major that you want is filling out a form to declare it and having the head of the department (of your specific major) sign off on it. After that, you bring it to the office, and your name and major declaration will show up in the system within a couple of days. It's very simple."
Junior,4,"Greenville was the college I was hoping for whenever I graduated high school. It was small and close to home so that I could commute and save money on room and board. Greenville has a lot of programs to choose from and they have a really good pre-med program which I was looking for. Not only that, but I was able to continue my tennis career with a great coach and great teammates. I have had really good professors who want the students to succeed and will even meet up outside of class time in order to help their students. Also I feel really safe on Greenville's  campus. The only reason I did not give Greenville five stars is because they recently cut a lot of programs which forced some of my close friends to transfer and some good professors to be fired."
Sophomore,4,"I really like a lot of different aspects about Greenville University. Some of them being how close everyone is on campus, everyone is always willing to help and support people, the classrooms are smaller so you get a lot of attention from professors. Some things that I don't like about Greenville are that they hold your hand too much. I feel like they smother us because they want what is best, but at the same time I don't feel like a college student but more like a high school student living with their parents."
Freshman,4,"Perfect if you like a small University. Professors really care about you and help you a lot. That said, the university is placed in a quiet town without much to offer. Some people love that, others hate it, depends on you. If you want to focus on your studies it might be perfect for you."
Sophomore,4,Teachers are very personal and are willing to work with you through anything. The culture is a great atmosphere and has taught students to branch out of their comfort zone and make themes out of any situation.
Sophomore,4,Greenville Univeristy is a fantastic school for Christian students looking to further their education. The staff are all extremely helpful and friendly. It is a beautiful campus full of friendly individuals. There are plenty of programs available for all interests.
Sophomore,4,The science department at GU is extremely helpful in preparing students for graduate programs. The labs are thorough and the students get the most out of the hands-on activities in the labs. The science professors do a wonderful job of preparing students for exams and often hold review sessions before each test. I recommend GU for any student pursuing a degree in science.
Senior,4,"Like every school it has it’s ups and downs, but if you’re looking for a place that’ll help you grow, Grenville is for you."
Senior,4,"I like the Christian community we have at school, the chapels in the morning and Vesper worship nights are awesome. All the school staffs are so welcoming and helpful when you need them. The food is very healthy for a school in my opinion. The backroom is amazing we have a lot of talented people who can sing and do other stuff too. People are very friendly and nice. There is a big community of international students. The campus is small but very pretty. The sport teams are very good if you are into sports. The activities are awesome usually there is a lot of free food,games and music playing. We have different association that you can participate such as Mosaic, International Club, and others. We got intramurals activities which are pretty cool too. The dorms are pretty cozy and comfortable. The classes are decently hard depending on the major."
Niche User,4,"Greenville University makes you feel at home. The campus is full of kind-hearted people who are willing to help. While visiting Greenville, the staff and coaches always go the extra step to make you comfortable and will go out of there way to match any need you might have."
Sophomore,4,"Greenville has been a great experience overall. The professors are approachable and really care about my success. There are several opportunities for student involvement in diverse areas like missions, sports and jobs.  

I would like to have better communication from the business office. Sometimes they are slow responding to my inquiries  or  want to pass them off on someone else. For the most part my experience has be excellent. I have made lifetime friends and am building a foundation for what I expect to be a great future."
Junior,4,"Greenville, yes, is in the middle of corn fields in southern Illinois. But our campus contains such diversity that you run into people different than you all the time. Campus activities promote integration of all students, from athletes to bookish types, from African American students to South Korean students.
The one thing that many people are weary about is the lifestyle statement, which prohibits many of the 'typical college' activities (smoking, drinking, sex on campus, etc). As an RA, my interactions with the lifestyle statement have given me a broad perspective of the pros and cons of having such an agreement. As a Christian community I think it is imperative that we hold our students to a wholesome standard. However, for those students who do not practice Christianity, I have seen isolation and exclusion on occasion.
Overall, I love Greenville and am content with my choice for my educational advancement."
Junior,4,I love Greenville University. The word you will hear the most on campus is community and that perfectly suits Greenville. It has quickly became my second home.
Freshman,4,Overall I love Greenville. The kids are friendly the teachers are great and if you are looking for a place that makes you feel at home this is the place to be!
Sophomore,4,"I chose Greenville College because of their Christian affiliation. Ever since I got to campus, my faith has grown and grown. The professors integrate the Bible and their faith into their classes."
Freshman,4,"What stood out most to me in Greenville College was how attent and aware the professors were. They are genuinely interested in their student's education and are always open to receive students during their office hours. Their patience, kindness and energy to answer student's questions whenever they didn't understand class material is truly encouraging. 
Greenville also has a tightly knit community that is always teeming with on campus activities. The town may be small, but the school makes up for it with it's various activities. 
The only drawback is the on campus cafeteria. The food is not always the best, and one can find themselves tired of eating the same thing over and over."
Sophomore,4,"I came from a small school, so Greenville College (GC) seemed a little daunting at first. However, as I progressed through the semesters, I found great friends, teachers, and teammates who I greatly appreciate. The teachers that I have had are great. They know what they are talking about and have experience in their field. In addition, I like the community GC has. It is small enough, so you can know many people but big enough that one may not see everyone everyday. I would like to see a new food provider. The current one has been lacking as of late. Furthermore, I would like to see more classes offered. I say this in reference to the language classes. They only offer French and Spanish, so expanding this area would be great. Also, if they had more diverse classes that would cover General Education requirements, this would make it more interesting to learn basic skills that make us well-rounded individuals."
College Senior,4,"Almost all professors get to know you and are helpful, especially in the music department."
College Senior,4,The upper-class men dorms are great!
College Sophomore,4,"The school has strict rules about drug and alcohol use, so what is being done is kept very quiet."
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe on campus. I never feel as though I need to be walking next to someone I know. It's a quiet campus.
College Junior,4,Many do nt take advantage of the networking that is avalible here at GC it is something some do not know they can use or should use.
College Junior,4,The overall experience has been very well. Like any college there will be some courses and professors that are stinky but if you are willing to put in the study time you will do good.
College Junior,4,The smallness of the school. This allows for greater interaction with other students in different major and classes.
College Junior,4,I feel so at home at my school! The professors are extremely helpful and it is easy to become involved in things that you love.
College Senior,4,Profs are friendly and care!
College Senior,4,"Having a great experiences, socially and educationally.  Really becoming prepared for life after school."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy living on campus.
College Freshman,4,The school is like my second family. Greenville is a very caring school and willing to work with you all the way till you get your job in life! Great college  recommend it to everyone!
College Freshman,4,Personally I do not fret about my safety on campus or even in town.  Greenville is a very safe town and I would feel comfortable walking alone at night.
College Freshman,4,"I love dorm life because I have gotten to know so many girls!  I love spending time with them and doing homework, lounging, playing games, and going to the mall together.  Greenville College really does have an incredible community of people who are so friendly and willing to smile and say hello to everyone."
College Freshman,4,"Greenville College is really amazing at showing support for all the teams and clubs.  Do I think that our facilities are the best?  No.  They are small and hot and old.  However, in the near future I can see updates being made.

I personally do not attend many events simply because I feel the need to spend my time elsewhere.  However, when I do go, it is great fun and the teams are incredible even if we are a D3 school."
College Freshman,4,I'm at one of the best teaching programs in the state so I'm pretty confident in my ability to get a job.
College Freshman,4,Most of my professors have been really caring about my success
College Freshman,4,I love my roommate and the amount of space we have in our room but the social life is lacking considerably.
College Freshman,4,The academics are phenomenal but the social life is greatly lacking and students aren't very friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic program at Greenville is top-notch.  Every coach is invested in all of their athletes. and cares not only for their physical advancement, but their mental, emotional, and spiritual advancement as well.  The athletes here learn not only to grow as athletes, but as teammates, friends, brothers, sisters, Christians, and people.  It's important to note as well that even though the coaches place much emphasis on growth in non-athletic areas, the growth in athletics is very much present.  The coaches push the athletes to their limit, encouraging them to reach their maximum potential."
College Freshman,4,Professors definitely push you to be the best you can be. It is easy to be prepared for tests and quizzes because of all the resources available in the library and the professors are also very helpful.
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere of the dorms is great! It is really hard to not get to know other people or make friends in this environment. People are very open and friendly.
College Freshman,4,"Sports here are awesome. They really help make the campus feel like a community. There are usually good crowds at sporting events, especially when playing rival schools. Students have a lot of fun at these events."
College Freshman,4,I certainly do love my school. I chose it compared to other options. It is a great school with caring professors and faculty. Sometimes I believe that there is a heavy work load but it is very manageable. Professors definitely try their best to prepare you for your field.
College Sophomore,4,"It is better than eating on campus, but costs money that most of us don't have."
College Sophomore,4,there's not a whole lot going on to be worried about
College Sophomore,4,I didn't have to go through a strict application process to get into my program.
College Sophomore,4,I play tennis and I have enjoyed full use of the facilities. Our work out center is pretty nice.
College Sophomore,4,I love most of my classes and all of my professors. The staff is great and they are really invested in both our education and our personal lives.
College Sophomore,4,"Parties on campus are few and far between. The people who want to party find ways to party off campus, but it's pretty under the radar."
College Sophomore,4,"The administration at Greenville College is wonderful. They have some strict policies, but the do a good job of explaining them, and they are open to improving the campus where it is lacking. They really promote student involvement and training student leaders as well."
College Freshman,4,I plan on doing an internship sometime soon with an organization that helps abused women. There are tons of opportunities and internships are highly encouraged.
College Freshman,4,"I am in the Social Work program, and I love it! Mr professors are so motivating and they have done so much in their lives for other people that it inspires me to do more. They make me feel as though I can change the world."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is great! There is definitely enough room and space for both my roommate and I to live well. It is a lot of fun living in a dorm with a bunch of girls, it's like one big sleepover."
College Freshman,4,"While Greenville itself is a very small town, it is not super far from some great stuff. There is a Walmart about thrirty minutes away and a few shopping areas in Litchfield. If you want a big mall you might have to go to Fairview, but it is only about forty-five minutes away. Edwardsville is a touch closer, but it doesn't have as good of a mall. Greenville is quaint and most things are within walking distance, but that is part of its charm!"
College Junior,4,Our school has a greater male student presence than female presence.  Most of our students on campus are athletes or music majors. Many of the girls on campus like to dress up when they go to class. Most of them are judgmental and stuck up. The guys are fun to hang around. There are many opportunities provided by student organizations that allow students to come together and hang out. Greenville can be cliquish though. Not many students hang out with people from other cliques.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Safety does an excellent job at making sure people are safe. I always see them walking around, doing a check at night and I know they go throughout the campus. They take their job very seriously and it is definitely nice to know they're watching out for us."
College Sophomore,4,"I've loved my experience here. I've had really good mentors and the professors are willing to invest in our lives. I've made incredible friends and I've definitely learned who I am as a person because of coming here. While that may change I don't think I would know as much about myself without coming here. It definitely was hard to make friends at first but now that I have, they'll be some of the most valuable in my life."
College Sophomore,4,"There's definitely a lot of social interaction at our school. There's always an event going on and I've met a lot of people through my friends. Sometimes, it feels like you only hang out with those in your major but I've discovered that I've been able to make friends with people in other majors through people I meet on my floor in the dorm and by interacting with people I may have been introduced to briefly."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors here really want to invest in your life. I've asked a lot of them questions about the class afterwards and they're always willing to talk. They believe that we can be the best and want to see us do that. I know where most of my teachers' offices are and I know if I stopped in, they would be completely ok with talking to me."
College Sophomore,4,I am always able to find somewhere to go if I don't want to eat on campus. There's some great fast food chain restaurants but  there's also a good number of small town restaurants and some excellent pizza places.
College Sophomore,4,Education is one the best majors at the school. There is a lot of hands on experience in classrooms and the teachers are really invested in getting to know you. If I've been in a class with a professor they know who I am after that class is over.
College Sophomore,4,"There has been some tension between those who live in town and those who attend the college but that's mostly among the young people. All in all, the townspeople are super sweet and kind and totally loving of college students."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are the best thing to attend on campus
Freshman,2,"School wasn't too bad, but I didn't have any guidance as a freshman from my coaches or advisers. So I ended up taking a 200 level marketing class and failing it. Haha just make sure you know what's going on with you're classes instead of trusting your schedule is how you need it."
Freshman,2,"Greenville is very diverse and open-armed. The few things I didn't like can be fixed. But the location isn't very flattering. There's nothing to do in the town but go eat fast food and stay on campus. I would say the only benefit of Greenville is that they are 35 minutes from St.Louis, so you can escape as much as you need. Its just a little drive. The on campus food is terrible, but if you go to the Student Union you can manage."
Works Here,2,"I worked at GU.  High school athletes are recruited relentlessly to increase enrollment  Here's the deal:  GU is NCAA Division III. If you are a football player, don't expect to play unless you are at the top of 120 players.  You are promised the world - you will be part of a 'family'.  I cannot tell you how any students felt desperately alone. There is nothing to do in Greenville.  Going to Dollar General will be your outing.   The Student Union is awful.
You will be expected to go to chapel regularly (you will be checked).  If you party, it's okay.  Everyone knows most of the students drink, have sex, etc.  The higher ups are in denial - they need warm bodies for enrollment numbers so they don't want to know.
GU is horribly expensive, and *anyone* can get in.  You will be left with tens of thousands of dollars in debt.  Go to a community college and learn a trade in the medical field, etc.  Job demand is high!"
Niche User,2,I loved my instructors and facilitators but that’s about the only thing I liked about the education program at Greenville. They don’t communicate with one another or their students. It’s very frustrating not knowing I have to take certain classes until the last minute.
Graduate Student,2,"I am in an online graduate program.  I find the low level of peer interaction really disappointing.  The LMS is arcane, but the staff are helpful in navigating it.  The professors vary.  My current professor has not answered any of the four e-mails I have sent her.  On one assignment she gave me a very low grade, with no explanation as to why, even though my peers commented very positively about my input.

Some professors realize that all the students in the class are already professionals in the field and adjust their assignments, but some give assignments that do not adjust for this key factor."
College Sophomore,2,The hours for the dinning commons are too short and the union is over priced.
College Sophomore,2,It is really hard to find a resident chaplain when you need one and the CRE is rarely there either.
College Sophomore,2,"Most dorm rooms are very small except for the apartments, which are almost all students who are a part of the worship teams."
College Sophomore,2,"Girls all dress and act similar, and only come to school for their MRS. Most guys are athletes or play some sort of instrument."
College Freshman,2,There really aren't many good places in walking distance.
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot of space or places to have parties, so they are fairly nonexistent on campus. Students must travel to other schools if they want to party."
College Sophomore,2,"Not enough room, strict rules for dorms/off campus"
College Sophomore,2,Few choices; some discounts; cost is decent
College Junior,2,"Most of the students are white Americans. We definitely need more international students and more ethnicities represented. As a Christian school, it predominantly consists of Christians, although there are a few other religions. Political views are fairly widespread. Not sure about sexual orientation, but it isn't talked about much here."
College Freshman,2,There are only certain hours you can use them. and certain majors that get access to them
College Freshman,2,"In winter its very cold. In summer its very hot,"
College Freshman,2,The girls' dorm is the oldest building on campus. All the boys' dorms are fairly new and convenient. There's not even water fountains in our dorm!
College Freshman,2,The campus shuttles only run when there is a special event or sports event going on.
College Freshman,2,"There are very few options for transportation. As far as I know there are no public transits and the service we do have to drive us to the airport or train station is $75 if you cannot find other students that are riding in the same direction. Overall, the transportation options could be improved immensely."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not too many options and pretty much the food is awful. When you find a dish you like, you stick with it.  "
Junior,1,"I am a transfer at Greenville. Don't do it. This college is awful, everyone behaves as if they are part of a cult. No individual thought. I attended for an entire semester and wished I could transfer almost immediately. I am a Christian so I went into it with the thought of it could not be that bad, i was wrong. Everyone there, or at least the mass majority do not want to have any individual thought or concepts beyond what they believe with their faith. As an Art major that I feel is very important, and if you are an Art or Digital Media major the classes they have me in, I feel like I already achieved the skill level I am at before taking these courses and they were a waste of my time, the teachers for the drawing course at least gave no criticism and it was very disheartening toward my feelings about my education."

College Sophomore,1,"It's just a small town, full of old people"
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you're willing to drive 20 minutes to the nearest town for more options, there are really only a few places to eat. And only McDonalds is open late at night"
College Freshman,1,"I went to ONE party, it was my FIRST party, I almost got raped. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
College Freshman,1,"We don't have a Greek life here on campus, but there are tons of clubs and organizations you can join that are very similar to Greek organizations, in that they provide you with a family."
College Junior,1,Greenville does not have a Greek Life on campus. I think adding a Greek Life would help to better the community around school. Greek Life might help things improve.
College Sophomore,1,So strict; alcohol; open dorm hours; parking spots
College Junior,1,"There is nothing to do in Greenville past 4 in the afternoon. Sometimes there are fun campus events, like Blackroom Cafe, but other than that, there's not a lot to choose from."
College Freshman,1,You are not allowed to park off campus. They will find you and they will ticket you.
College Freshman,1,They are all just okay. The town shuts down by 9 pm though.
College Freshman,1,All you do is just declare your major and your in.

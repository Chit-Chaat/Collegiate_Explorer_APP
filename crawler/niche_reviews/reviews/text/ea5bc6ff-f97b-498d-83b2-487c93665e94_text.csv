College Freshman,5,Great Restaurants Around Boston – Boston has some of the best restaurants in the country. Especially in Little Italy.
College Freshman,5,"Boston Is Simply Amazing – Boston is a great city. Many things to do, and the atmosphere of the city is very charming. Tons of colleges nearby, so the population of the city is generally young, therefore there's a lot of energy in the city. A very decent sized city, and very walkable. Public transportation is good, but sometimes not as efficient as expected. Nightlife is great in Boston. Many attractive people, a great city to people watch. Boston Common is a great place to hang out, and enjoy the sun.
The winter weather is pretty severe, and the snow and the wind are some of the cons of Boston."
Junior,4,"I am a current third year undergraduate student at NEC, majoring in classical vocal performance. The school has provided me with copious amounts of knowledge and has helped me grow as a person, musician, and performer. The program is aimed at shaping individuals into well rounded musicians. The outreach program allows students to make their way out into the community, and the environment at the school enables students to dabble into other musical interests outside of their selected majors. There are additional possibilities to minor in different subjects or create your own minor. If courses are not offered at the school, one may take desired courses at nearby universities. As a vocal student, I do wish there were more operatic opportunities, as most of the funding is offered to the graduate program. The new dorm and student life center is incredible and a major upgrade."

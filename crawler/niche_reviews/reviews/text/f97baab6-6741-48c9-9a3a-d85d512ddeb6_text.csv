Junior,5,I will be starting online nursing school in the fall. I’m excited because I heard that they run things very smoothly and that they really care for and take care of their students
Junior,5,"As they have taken over the Portland nursing campus, they have been generous with their time when answering questions. I am beyond excited to be in their accelerated nursing program because I’ve heard such wonderful things."
Senior,5,I took all of my classes online. It has been the best decision I've ever made. Very convenient for my schedule.
Junior,5,"I love Concordia St. Paul because it becomes a home to a variety of different people. I have loved every minute of being in the Concordia family. However, if I were to change something I would add more gathering places around campus. In comparison to other schools, Concordia does not have as large of spaces for people to gather. If people had more spaces, more people could get together. This would create spaces for the community building!"
Senior,5,Excellent! Extremely well organized course outlines and assignments. The assignment instructions and due dates were very clear. Professors were very helpful and understanding.
Senior,5,Their online program is fantastic. Extremely well organized course outlines and assignments. The assignment instructions and due dates were very clear. Professors were very helpful and understanding. I really couldn't have asked for a better school experience. Thank you St Paul for allowing me to get my bachelors while I continued to work full time!
Junior,5,"Concordia University is an outstanding 4-year private college that strives in excellences. Concordia offers a variety of different sports, classes and extracurricular activities.  Concordia is located in St. Paul, and is close to so many different adventures. Concordia is a great school that offers a lot of different opportunities for everyone."
Senior,5,This is a great school to be a part of. The advisers are amazing and they’re willing to do whatever they can to help you out as far as tuition and registration and looking for scholarships. I’ve been with the school for two years and the teachers are amazing and they really do care about you being successful.
Junior,5,The professors are wonderful and the academic advisors are great! The site they use for classes is easy to navigate!
Junior,5,"I started going to school for nursing at a different Concordia. Then, after two terms and getting accepted into the program, we find out that after 150 years of being accredited, they were shutting down so all the students would have to find another school to go to and another program to apply for. Concordia St. Paul was my angel and offered to take me into their accelerated program. I am happy to say that I will be starting in the summer and they've made everything through the transition as smooth as possible. Everyone has been amazing."
Niche User,5,The staff so far have been super inviting and helpful with any questions that I have had. Being able to know someone is always there to ask has been super encouraging in the choosing process!
Freshman,5,"Concordia is a very small university that has people always willing to help. They are always there to listen to you and direct you to help, if they don't have the ability. The instructor at Concordia are very kind and never made the students feel offended if they miss a class or assignment."
Freshman,5,"It has the small town feel for city kids, but a big city feel for small town kids. It's unique in that it's not hard to find out who everyone is, and at the same time I'm able to meet new people everyday! The staff and faculty are the nicest people I know. They know their field well and that want you to succeed."
Junior,5,Concordia St. Paul is a great school that provides many opportunities to get students engaged with each other.
Senior,5,The people that work there and that guide the student through the entrance process are so professional and knowledgeable. It has been a wonderful experience. I recommend this university!
Junior,5,I love this school it give me the opportunity to play football and get my education. It is a little expensive but is in a big city with an opportunity. It is very easy to find a job on campus or around campus.
Freshman,5,"I would say the diversity is a really good place for students who are more of color and doesn't discriminate those who are of color, the community is welcoming and welcomes each and everyone to come to this university, it may not be much but it's . good university made of good people with good professors"
Graduate Student,5,"I have really enjoyed my experience with Concordia University, St. Paul. They helped me to choose a career path that was right for me.  There are meany options of classes that will fit your life and busy schedules. Online or on campus. All the professors want you to succeed and are there to help you along your way."
Sophomore,5,Concordia University - St. Paul has been very accommodating to my needs and allowing me to take classes to earn my degree. They work well with Military families and helping everyone earn a degree with  scholarships and discounted prices on classes. The online classes are easy to understand and follow so you don't miss any information.
Junior,5,admissions was very helpful in getting me all of the information I need to finish my application. I had what felt like a personal college coach. getting back into school is scary when you are 24 but with the help of them it made it easier.
Senior,5,"The staff at Concordia St. Paul have been instrumental in my journey through college. The countless hours spent helping me on an individual level have made me grateful - grateful beyond what I can even express. Before attending Concordia, I had no plans of pursuing my Master’s. I felt as though I was not good enough to even consider it as an option. But, through the kindness and encouragement expressed by Concordia’s faculty members, I found it within myself to be able to apply."
Senior,5,"I have just recently started my transition to transfer to the university of Concordia to finish my bachelors degree. Each person I came into contact with were all very helpful. They continually reached out ,answered my questions, and went above and beyond to make sure this school and program would be the best fit for my situation. Needless to say I am now currently enrolled and can not wait to start."
Freshman,5,Overall my expirience working with Concordia has been fenomenal! The counselors help you every step of the way and the resources given to admitted students are easy to manage and understand! The people at Concordia are friendly and accepting.
Junior,5,"My experience with Concordia, Saint Paul has been great. I chose this school because they offer online programs that I was able fit into my work schedule. The teachers have all been great and are very responsive."
Freshman,5,amazing experience has really helped shape me as a person i am ecstatic to be continuing my education here
Sophomore,5,I like how all the classes are small it's great for those who need to be an in smaller classroom. Professors and staff are friendly and always ready to help.
Junior,5,"As a student athlete at Concordia University St. Paul, overall I have had a great experience studying exercise science and working with professors in the department. As an ambitious student they allowed me one on one time with the professors to learn and expand my knowledge which also includes using the new technology that the department had acquired."
Sophomore,5,"They make the onboarding process smooth and painless. As a single parent with a full time job, they kept in touch with me and walked me through every step of the way with patients and willingness to answer my questions and get me ready for classes."
Freshman,5,The teachers are very helpful and want you to succeed. My room mates were matched with my interests and we get along real good. I guess the only thing I would change is the cost of include price of books in the tuition. Paying a hundred dollars for one book is ridiculous. Maybe if they bought back books for someone else to use and refund at least half of cost would help.
Senior,5,I love that there are professors and supporting staff that have immense knowledge for their field of work that they share with the students.
Senior,5,"My experience at Concordia University-St Paul was absolutely rewarding. I learned a lot of information that I will carry into my career. Unfortunately, I did not have enough funds to pay my balance, cover my last class and internship. Therefore I cannot finish my degree plan. If I am picked for this scholarship it will change my life. Concordia has opened my eyes to so much and the professors are phenomenal."
Niche User,5,I have recently committed to Concordia to play softball for the graduating class of 2023. I am excited for the opportunity to major in nursing as a student at Concordia and am in love with the school. After touring about 2 months ago I loves the school as well as the coach and am looking forward to moving in next year for the 2019 fall semester!
Niche User,5,Fast replies when I had questions on my application. Very helpful admissions team. Perfect spot if you want a small college in a big city.
Freshman,5,"So far I love it, the process was smooth. I transferred there and I was literally walked through eery step. Financial aid and class selection! Im excited for whats to come. The staff is welcoming and on top of their stuff!"
Graduate Student,5,This school has a great on-line program for graduate students. You can get your masters degree in 2 1/2 years taking classes at night and never have to go to campus. Their web technology is very reliable and I have never had an issue with connectivity. The graduate professors and professionals in their field with unique experiences and knowledge to share.
Senior,5,"I transferred from another private school in Minnesota and it was the best decision I have ever made.  Concordia University, St. Paul is one of the most welcoming schools I have ever seen.  All of the professors are extremely nice and are more than just a professor, they are a friend.  Everyone is so caring and all individuals on campus matter."
Senior,5,"I take classes entirely online because of my work schedule. using Blackboard for all my courses is very easy to use and if there are any issues, the helpdesk is great support. All of the professors I've had have been great and are pretty flexible. Overall I've had a great experience!"
Junior,5,Concordia is small enough that it allows you get really involved and get to know the staff.  I also love all the professors at Concordia University. I feel like they are always willing to help in whatever way possible.
Graduate Student,5,Great programs to choose from and convenient scheduling for graduate students or students trying to work while continuing their education. The enrollment process was very easy and the staff members were very easy to work with and full of helpful information.
Freshman,5,"Coming out of high school, I had a rocky road with my health. I was intended to continue education at another college but, due to my health, I had to leave. I was in dire need to learn so, I started nursing at Rasmussen College. As I am learning to take care of myself as I grow older, I am taking an interest into Concordia by transferring."
Senior,5,i love concordia because it is a small school where i have excelled at. i have small classes which helps me learn better. it's also easy to make friends here
Alum,5,"I enjoyed all my years getting connected to students and professors.  I was confident in the work I was doing in my classes, and knew that I was getting prepared to enter the real world when I graduated."
Freshman,5,my experience at concordia has been great so far as a freshman their has been so many people who are willing to help you succeed in school. you have to be willing to want to accept this help because with these people by your side anything is possible.
College Senior,5,"I love Concordia University because it really helps students succeed by providing great resource for homework, tutors, and helpful sessions to overview what difficulties are there to overcome."
College Sophomore,5,"The staff member's and professors are very friendly and they are interested in helping you to succeed and graduate. That is the type of school i want to be a part of, verses just thinking I am a dollar sign."
College Freshman,5,Concordia has great professors and a lot of majors
College Freshman,5,This school does a great job of preparing you
College Freshman,5,"Our campus has a 24 hour security escort where if you don't feel safe walking somewhere, you can call the office and they can escort you anywhere. I feel very safe on my campus"
College Freshman,5,Living on Campus has truly changed my life for the better. I have found one of my closest friends through being roommates with her. Everyone else on the floor also get along really well. The cost was amazing and way better than other schools. The social atmosphere was great and the amenities were perfect! There were laundry machines in the bathrooms! It was also very easy to apply for housing and the whole process was great. I wouldn't change a thing.
College Freshman,5,"While athletics are important at Concordia, they are not the most important thing and I think that is wonderful. The athletes and the non athletes all respect and encourage each other. They are all involved on each others activities and support each other greatly. We are a spirited, supportive school and I take great pride in that."
College Freshman,5,"From just the short time being here, I already know that I have picked the very best school for me. The professors care about you and want to help you succeed. The very first day I spent there my music professor came up to me in the hallway and addressed me by name and asked me about a choir audition. My other professors have also asked me what they can do to help me succeed. I wouldn't choose a different college if given the choice because I believe this one is the best for me!"
College Freshman,5,"The professors at Concordia are very relate able, caring, and very smart and willing to help. They know what they are talking about when they teach. The professors are quick to reply to emails in order to help students and they will gladly give of their time to come in and meet with students in order to help them succeed."
College Freshman,5,There are so many internships available and it starts so early. I am a freshman and they have already been advertising to me a ton. It is encouraging to know that there are jobs out there waiting for me.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love living in the dorm that I do. I share a room with someone that I have never met before coming to Concordia and we are best friends now. I love the community feeling and getting to know the people in the dorms around me. The bathrooms and main hall are kept very clean and there are fun places to sit and do homework with everyone. I love it.
College Freshman,5,I would not want to change colleges because we are treated like we are our own person here and Christ is at the center of everything we do. We are more than a number and we have a name here. I am so blessed to attend a college that will help me grow stronger in my life every day.
College Junior,5,someone is always there to help you succeed!
College Freshman,5,Concordia University St Paul is right in the middle of the most diverse place in the state of Minnesota.
College Sophomore,5,the math department is so much fun
College Sophomore,5,"our volly ball team has won 7 years in a row

football sucks but everyone still goes. we had someone recruted and plays in the NFL now

Basketball always fun to go to"
College Sophomore,5,they are always walking around and watching the cameras
Freshman,4,"Professors are engaging and utilizing zoom. Jamboard is a nice whiteboard experience that they utilize too that allows students to engage. Blackboard is a nice website that shows resources, courses, and grades. Online is just as good as in-person here."
Freshman,4,Everyone is chill and welcoming. Someone is always willing to help you and the events hosted here are awesome. They are trying they're best to abide by COVID 19 regulations and I believe they are doing a great job.
Senior,4,"I took all online courses for the last two years of my bachelor's program. I have enjoyed all of my courses, teachers, and classmates. If you want to hop into the workforce while staying in school, online is the perfect option. I am able to have a full schedule at work."
Niche User,4,I just started at this school as we transferred from Concordia University-Portland which shut down for good this spring.  So far they have been accommodating and supportive in our transition.
Senior,4,"I have not started there yet but am transferring, my school Concordia University Portland shut down without warning in March. Thankfully the nursing program was taken over by Concordia St. Paul as part of a teach out plan, the Concordia St. Paul staff have done an excellent job making the transfer process easy. I'm looking forward to staying on track and graduating from CU-St. Paul. Thank you for taking CU-Portland under your wings!"
Senior,4,"I had always heard about wonderful things from Concordia University St. Paul. I didn't know the impact the school would make on me until I was accepted into the nursing program. My first semester I had several procedures to follow up from my cancer that I developed in 2015. It wasn't until my grandmother then father passing (within a week and a half of each other) that I understood that care, and understanding of the professors. I would recommend Concordia to all, it is such a wonderful school, and I feel like I am at home every time I come to campus."
Junior,4,Overall I have really enjoyed my experience so far at Concordia. I love the small class sizes and I love the community. One thing I would say could improve at Concordia would be the limited parking.
Freshman,4,The faculty and staff are great. They provide many resources for students to adjust to the college life and become familiar with the campus. Activities and clubs are hosted throughout the weeks and they offer plenty of chances for students to participate in events.
Freshman,4,"This will be my first year attending Concordia University. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Psychology and upon enrolling at the school, I have had administration reach out to me for guidance and instructions on getting started.
The staff is very personable and friendly and have the students best interest in mind."
Junior,4,"Recently applied to and got accepted to the Management and Leadership program at Concordia. They have been so helpful every step of the way so far, they check in often (but not in an overbearing way), and they give you a lot of information right off the bat. Each member of the Concordia staff that I have come in contact with are easily accessible and easy to work with. Cannot wait to move forward in my educational advancement with this college!"
Sophomore,4,"I love that they are a small, intimate campus where everyone gets to know everyone. I think they could improve the freshmen girls’ dorm."
Freshman,4,I just recently visited this college as an accepted student and this was the best college I've visited so far. The campus was absolutely beautiful and the whole process was easy and efficient.
Junior,4,"Concordia so far has been a positive experience for me. I have met some life long friends and also have received an awesome education. I have found that over the years, the small campus has really given me the opportunity to grow positive and personal relationships with my professors overtime. I would have to say that the dining situation at this institution could use some improvement due to the fact that there is not a large variety and on the weekends there is slim to no choices. The options are also not the healthiest and can make it hard for individuals with intolerances to certain foods."
Freshman,4,So far it has been great. Being able to immerse myself within the campus community and really start to understand what I want to do professionally has been made aware here at CSP
Senior,4,"I am current student at Concordia and I am really happy I chose to go here! I work full-time and am always traveling so I did not think I would be able to get my bachelor's degree. Luckily, I found Concordia! I love their adult online program and I have been doing the best I have ever done in school. My credits from my other colleges were able to transfer over so I only have two years before I graduate. Overall, I have had a great experience at Concordia!"
Junior,4,"They offered an accelerated program at my junior college that I enrolled in which helps with the financial struggles of getting a higher education. Instructors have been really knowledgeable about course material, and had well developed lesson plans for class."
Senior,4,The online school is perfect and very well organized..It works well with my schedule along with my life.Taking one class every 7 weeks have been soothing to my mind
Junior,4,"I love it here at Concordia. The professors are amazing, they want you to strive and are an amazing resource. They catered to my unique degree, which I am very grateful for. The diversity on campus is such an amazing experience. I love our close knit community in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. If there was one thing I would like to see change, it would be an increase in security."
Junior,4,"Concordia is a very fun, friendly campus. The athletes and other students are really welcoming to new transfers like myself. The campus is a small campus. It is easier to relate to your professors and build a one on one relationship with the students. The thing I don't like about is that it is too close to other colleges so it could get crowded on the weekends too"
Niche User,4,"Very good for athletics and academics. A lot of outgoing people and staff. Everyone is friendly and willing to help as well as everything being easily accessible. Great school, nice and small but in the middle of a big city so you get the best of both worlds."
Junior,4,"Concordia is a really fantastic place to be if you're looking to focus on your degree, and receive a quality education. Class sizes are crazy small which is incredibly beneficial for discussions, and it makes lecture much more interactive, which you don't get at every school. If you're looking to party or get that cliche ""college experience"", I wouldn't completely recommend Concordia, considering that it isn't much of a student life environment."
Freshman,4,"Campus feels like home and you always recognize somebody due to the small class sizes. You get connected with your professors who know you on a first name basis, and you aren't just a number in the classroom."
Graduate Student,4,I enjoy the online classes and the weekly interaction.  You have to be motivated on your own and not depend on sitting in a class to learn.
College Sophomore,4,Safety and Security is a top priority
College Sophomore,4,Staff and Professors are awesome and are willing to help
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are great, but for me I am more focused on my studies"
College Freshman,4,We don't have a Greek Life at Concordia and I like it that way. I think that Greek Life splits up and divides the student body and I personally don't like that. We are very much one body at Concordia.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Health area very well setup, but, no one really uses it so wide open for assistance."
College Freshman,4,Tons of different ethnic backgrounds coming to school is a great sign of positivity.
College Freshman,4,"My experience with professors at my school has been profoundly well. Some professors are different than others, which some are very laid back and others gives you last minute homework. The variety of courses that are offered at my school are significantly insurmountable, it is very diverse and tons of options to choose from. The class styles and class size are generally small and does not have a lot of students, the average class size is nearly below 20 students."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms at my school are pretty good, specifically the upperclassmen dorms, and not the freshmen's. The social atmosphere is also great as well, everyone brings a fun vibe. The cost can be a little cheaper, but it's still cheaper than most private universities."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facilities at my school is actually doing great. It is very well based, and almost everyone at school is involved in sports, whether it's team or intramural. And the school spirit isn't much, but when there's  a big event going on at school then most of the students would wear a shirt to represent or even facepaint to show the school's colors."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus because the security here is great. They are always willing, 24/7, to walk you anywhere on campus or to any of the parking lots, etc. You just have to be smart about the choices that you make."
College Freshman,4,"There are some sports that excel more than others and volleyball is one that Concordia does so well in. There is a lot of student involvement, especially at volleyball and football games. The athletes are great and involved in many other things on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"So far I have felt safe. There are times I don't want to walk outside alone, but then I just walk through the tunnels."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I have had amazing professors who care about me as an individual and are willing to help out when needed."
College Sophomore,4,"From what I understand, they help with the job process after graduation."
College Sophomore,4,Its really nice being so close to most things on campus.
College Sophomore,4,This school is much better than the school I went to before. It has better resources and the staff are willing to help me and not brush me aside.
College Freshman,4,"I think what makes Concordia University Saint Paul unique is the diversity. Concordia is so diverse even though it's smaller than other colleges/universities in the area. If I would have to choose or don't choose Concordia, I would choose Concordia. I would choose Concordia because I met so many good people and faculty members."
College Junior,4,"I love the diversity here at my school, and how small it is. I love the staff here, I talk to a lot of staff that are not my professors and they make my college experience enjoyable"
College Junior,4,I enjoy the smaller class sizes! It allows me to have a personal relationship with my professors.
College Senior,4,"I appreciate the small classroom sizes and the cool little community we have here.  But, sometimes I wish there was more undergraduates that attended."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere at Concordia is great, everyone is extremely friendly and can be talked to if needed. My first year here I knew exactly zero people and that changed in the coming years. Everyone was looking to make new bonds, so it was easy to find new people to be around. The first weekend here was meant to welcome all freshmen/transfer students alike creating a fun environment to meet new people."
College Sophomore,4,"Great class sizes, I learn better in smaller class settings. The teachers are all very helpful and willing to help you achieve the best grade you possibly can. I wish the campus was bigger and there were more undergraduate students, but besides that, I love it."
College Freshman,4,"It was great! I like the atmosphere, the environment, the factually, and most of all the classroom sizes and the population of how many students attend to this college."
College Senior,4,It is a great experience.
College Freshman,4,"I was chosen for verification. But once I got my papers in and complete, it was easy."
College Freshman,4,Cost is affordable when compared to the other colleges near by. The living quarters are literally right next to the classrooms.
College Senior,4,My internship was hands on and great experience
College Senior,4,Athletics are given a sense of entitlement that most other students on campus do not receive.
College Senior,4,"Great activities, music, attractions, sporting events, and night life for college students."
College Sophomore,4,"if we dont have it, anouther school does but you still play concordia tution"
College Sophomore,4,"there is always something to do

Small so everyone knows everyone 

sports are my fav to go to"
College Freshman,4,I am actually meeting different connections.....about housing..
College Freshman,4,Football and Volleyball are a very common sport that is played on campus at my school.
College Freshman,4,They want everyone to be safe and have a good time
College Sophomore,4,"The University I attend, I would say, is quite diverse. Many different background and everyone gets along very well."
College Senior,4,"With such a small campus, the weather hardly affects campus experience."
College Senior,4,Saint Paul offers numerous options for any craving that is affordable for college students.
Freshman,2,"Honestly this was one of the worst experiences I've ever had, academic wise, people wise, food wise, the whole ordeal was just awful. I am not coming back."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Go to other schools for student life experience, however, good for academics at CU"
Recent Alumnus,2,"No school spirit...7 time National Champion Volleyball can barely get 30 students to attend!!!

Football can barely get 30 students to attend...

Facilities for student-athletes need major updating...to bad the administration doesn't see athlete's safety and development a priority...Maybe the new AD can make some changes?"
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't really much Greek life on my campus, so I am not really sure"
College Sophomore,2,"small school, so not a lot of options"
Recent Alumnus,2,There was not much variety and the options were not always the best. The take away meals that were separate from the dining commons were great though.
College Senior,2,"There is one computer lab on campus that is unknown to most students. The library has 3 computers, and although students are supplied with laptops, internet access is horrible."
College Senior,2,"Except for volleyball and football, sports are rarely supported by students and there is little school spirit."
College Senior,2,The only time I've seen security is to address a noise complaint in the on-campus apartments.
College Sophomore,2,"Every semester, paying tuition is a struggle. "
College Senior,2,"Nightlife is terrible at Concordia university. Not many people throw house parties. If you are under 21 it is even harder to find something to do. Most people who are ""of age"" end up going downtown to bars and clubs or to the u of M campus where there are some bars to go to."
College Freshman,2,"While there are parking lots available for students, many end up parallel parking along the street.  Parking lots are closed frequently and students are constantly forced to move their cars."
College Junior,2,there is always someone that is in line before you and takes it.
College Freshman,2,There are a number of bars and clubs in the area.  I do not frequent them.
College Freshman,2,Guys & Girls – I am a continuing ed student and the majority of my classes are take online. I have very limited face to face contact with the other students.
College Freshman,2,"I have no direct experience with this issue as I did not require any housing.  As a continuind ed student, this is not an issue."
College Student,2,Well considering that right now I don't drive the parking at the college just scares me because of how filled up it gets in a matter of time.
College Freshman,2,The structure is really old. Not very many good places to just hang out.
College Freshman,2,"I myself, am not a party-goer, so I am not too sure about others. CSP is a small campus, so it's quite quaint most of the time."
College Sophomore,2,Go to the Club. Concordia is not the place you want to go to if you want to party a lot. Not too many people throw parties because of how small the university is. You would rather party at the U of M or hit the clubs downtown.
College Sophomore,1,From my experience I feel that the safety on campus is not the greatest and not all the faculty cares about your safety.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a Greek life on my campus. I wish that we did because I feel that it is a great way to get involved on campus and with the community.
College Sophomore,1,the food is horrible and i always feel sick when i eat there
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at Concordia Saint Paul is nearly impossible because there is no where near enough space for all the students cars. Also, police officers come around frequently and hand out tickets for pathetic reasons."

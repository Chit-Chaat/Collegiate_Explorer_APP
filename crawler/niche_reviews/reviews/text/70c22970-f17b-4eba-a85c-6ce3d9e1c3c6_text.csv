Junior,5,"I LOVE GRACELAND! 
Being an International student, my decision in which college I chose was crucial as it would be my home for the next 4 years. As I am so far away from home (UK), I needed somewhere with a small community that treated me like they were family and that is exactly what Graceland does. Not only are the academics amazing, with small classes and personal relationships with professors, but I know that I am in safe hands. If there is ever a problem or I need help, I know exactly who to contact and have complete faith that whatever I am looking for or need will be found and resolved. 

Graceland ensures that each student has a comfortable and fun life when enrolled as a student. As Lamoni is a small town, people often think that there will be nothing to do but Graceland ensures that that is not the case. 
I have met the most amazing people here and it has changed my life forever. If  I was to go through the recruitment/enrollment process again, I would pick Graceland again."
Junior,5,"Since the Covid outbreak, I completed 2 months of school online and it was great. I was able to learn just as much through the computer screen as I do when I am in a classroom. 
Professors ensured that they did whatever they could to make sure that we were comfortable and understood everything despite the drastic change from in-person classes to zooms.
I didn't feel any kind of stress when learning online as I felt as though my professors had everything worked out and under control."
Sophomore,5,Yes we did have to take classes online and professors were completely chill about assignments which was nice given the whole corona situation.
Freshman,5,Graceland brings togetherness to a whole new level. The university provides the best diversity I've been a part of.
Alum,5,"Graceland is an excellent school where students have incredible opportunities to be involved outside of the classroom. Those opportunities are what helped me get my job today! The culture is so community focused and everyone there wants to help students succeed and exceed their potential. The academics are excellent as well. Many of the faculty are extraordinary in their accomplishments and dedication to students. The experience Graceland offers is unlike anything else, from excellent academic programs, athletic opportunities, honors program, Enactus, student government, and beyond. As long as you are willing to go out and get involved you will have a rich and engaging student experience!"
Alum,5,"There are more activities available than anyone could possibly have time to participate in. If you get involved, you will love it!  Professors actually care about their students. There are lots of opportunities to network and gain leadership skills.  Strong alumni connections can often lead to jobs upon graduation."
Junior,5,"Graceland University has a main campus in Lamoni, IA and then a sister campus in Independence, MO. I am in the BSN-RN program which takes place in the Independence campus. The faculty in both locations are absolutely wonderful to work with. They care about your success and making sure that you always have what you need to be successful! I would not choose a different place to receive my BSN-RN anywhere else! The ratings that I gave are in reference to the sister campus in Independence, Mo"
Junior,5,"Graceland feels like a tightknit family. I've already gotten to know a lot of my professors, and they're incredibly kind and supportive. Graceland has accommodated to everything I've needed and has done everything they can to make sure that I have the best experience possible."
Sophomore,5,"A few reasons why I love Graceland University is because of the community, that sense of instant connection, and also the people (teachers, coaches, students). When first entering the school there was an instant connection that made me feel like I was home even though its in an area total different from where i'm from. It was just an amazing first year and I cant wait to go back into another. One thing I would love to see change and is currently in the making of becoming that change is diversity. Our school is majority caucasians, and just a few colored but it's coming to the works where equality will be held amongst everyone no matter the race, color, or class you are in. And I find that great to see the fact that when theres an issue or a problem that it will immediately be fixed. Which is also why I enjoy myself at Graceland University."
Senior,5,I love the housing system at GU. It becomes you're second family! There are so many events put on by GU that you are always meeting new people when you attend. Also having advisors that I trust and can ask any questions to is a awesome!
Graduate Student,5,Graceland has open doors that I thought were closed.  It is a great school with great professors.  I recommend the school to anyone seeking higher education
Niche User,5,I went to Graceland University for my first college visit. They set the bar pretty high and I have yet to find a school that I feel more comfortable at academically and socially. In the fall 2019 I will be a GU JACKET and I couldn’t be prouder to say that. Graceland gives a very welcoming and homey atmosphere to you as soon as you step foot on campus. I’m from Las Vegas where it’s busy constantly and going to Graceland should be a “cultural shock” but I feel more comfortable there then my actual home.
Sophomore,5,"When it comes to Graceland University there is a lot of things that I personally would like to see be changed. Things like the food served in the commons, certain professors, and some academic changes need upgraded. However, even though it has all of these things that most students complain about, Graceland is a diverse school! People come from all over the world just to go to Graceland and get their degrees! It is beautiful! I love it and would not want to go anywhere else for school!"
Freshman,5,I like how everyone here is respectful and nice to each other. You could count on your friends to be there for you when you might need them the most.
Junior,5,I enjoy the diverse atmosphere at the college for professors and students! There are very small classrooms so you get to know people easily and it makes you feel more comfortable
Junior,5,"Graceland University provides a great atmosphere to pursue a nursing degree. The small class allows for great focus to be put on the professor's ability to connect with each student in the learning environment and clinical environment. Along with a great facility for nursing classes to be held, the school has great opportunities for clinical rotation sites, which is all based on the school's overall expertise. This is a great school to pursue more than just nursing, as the faculty goes above and beyond for their students, and allows for everyone to find their place to fit in."
Junior,5,It is a great small university. There is a wide variety of diversity. Sports is the main thing and house activities. 
Freshman,5,"I personally fell in love with Graceland when I stepped onto the campus for the first time. Graceland has such a family oriented feel to it, just a safe, positive,and  warm atmosphere. I couldn't ask for a better student life; with Graceland being on the smaller end you really feel the sense of community, it is one huge family! Graceland's profferers are one of a kind, they truly want to see you succeed, and they really get to know you, thanks to the awesome student teacher ratio. Overall, Graceland has been outstanding to me, and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else!"
College Junior,5,My school is committed to it's students and is extremely resourceful when it uses alumni. There's always someone to lend a helping hand whenever a student has a need.
College Sophomore,5,This school has an awesome housing system. You can make a lot of friends and participate in so many fun activities.
College Freshman,5,All the teachers love their jobs so its easy for everyone to understand the information.
College Freshman,5,The school is very recognized around the world and highly respected.
College Freshman,5,They work hard to make it easier for you o come to school
College Freshman,5,The dorms are very comfy and filled with all types of people
College Freshman,5,the apartments are very close and very nice.
College Junior,5,"There is a lot of diversity on the Graceland campus, you can find you place in our community."
College Junior,5,"I love Graceland and I could not image myself anywhere else. I absolutely love the students, facility, community, and even my teachers."
College Junior,5,"It is such a small campus, but there are house council positions put in place like COSA that plan activities almost every weekend that keeps you busy enough you don't even realize how small the town really is. Airband in the fall and Final Fling in the spring with lots of fun in between."
College Junior,5,"The Graceland nursing program is one of the BEST in the midwest. The way that it is done, for most of their students, is you spend 1-3 years on the Lamoni,IA campus doing all of you general education classes complete and then you apply for the nursing school in Independence, MO. Only about 80 people are in the program so it is tight but people in the midwest know Graceland nurses."
College Sophomore,5,"The music department at Graceland is like no other. They care so much! They want to see you succeed and be happy. However, they're also wanting you to be challenged regularly and to be held to higher standards then most of the students on campus. If you get caught at a busted party and get in trouble, or get caught cheating on a stupid math quiz, you can be sure they will find out and they will talk to you about it, which isn't pleasant, but you know, it just proves how much they care."
College Sophomore,5,"This is a very diverse campus in ethnicity, economic backgrounds, political beliefs, sexuality and religion. Not everyone is accepting of others views, but they tend to keep their opinions to themselves. Staff, students and faculty all work toward tolerance on this campus."
College Junior,5,I have to drive to school so this really doesn't matter to me.
College Junior,5,The computers/tech support are very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,The student code of conduct is presented in the handbook and at orentation.  Students know this when they apply and when they are accepted.  Does seem to be an issue with compliance.
College Sophomore,5,No problems with parking when I am on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Lots of ethnic resturants and small local dining as well as major chains.
College Sophomore,5,Health and stduent safety are a priority on campus.  Student newletters are posted with health and safety tips on our daily announcements.
College Sophomore,5,Very competitive. GPA was a big factor but so were clinical experiences.  The process is pretty much like elsewhere for nursing programs.
College Sophomore,5,We have very dedicated faculty in nursing.  The selection criteria is high and students come here with real committment.  Ciricuulum is very well organized and the work is gratifying and pertinent.
College Junior,5,I am completely biased to my school. The students in the program have become a close-knit type of family. We pull together to left one another up and encourage one another to continue on. 
College Junior,5,"I immensely enjoy my program. The professor are extremely helpful and available, the staff is available and the students are dependable. What I like most is the hands-on experience I am receiving. "
College Junior,5,"In our program, our meals are catered in. The food is always amazing!"
College Junior,5,"Because we are a small campus or ""sister"" campus to a larger campus we do not have campus housing. "
College Junior,5,The teachers do a great job in distributing the work load and allowing us a reasonable amount of time to complete it. 
College Sophomore,5,you go on lie and declare your major. all you have to do then is sign up for the classes that you need to take.
College Junior,5,we accept anyone and everyone for who they are. We don't go out over our way to exclude someone from anything.
College Senior,5,"Graceland University has one computer lab available for students to use, along with a handful of computers in the library. The number of students at our campus is very small so the avaliable number of computers works out great. The university allows students to print papers at a resonable price. There is wifi through out the entire building. The connection and speed of the wifi is fast and efficient. If our campus comes across any technical problems we have staff that are always avaliable to help."
College Sophomore,5,i love being in the education program at my school.  we do a lot of hands on activities with kids.  we go to different schools.
College Sophomore,5,my major is Education.  as good as our education program is our nursing program is the best!  we have really good connection for internships and job opportunities.
College Junior,5,"Masters level performance is very valued and there are strict policies enforcing our academic work, such as a 0% tolerance of plagiarism."
College Freshman,5,it is very safe and there is a lot to do on campus
College Freshman,5,Varsity sports are extremely important. everyone is involved and are very good. I love it.
College Freshman,5,Graceland offers over 1000 computer on campus that are always available plus they give you money for printing off papers. We also offer a Mac Lab that is open all day and night. Our computer are always up to date too.
College Junior,5,"GU is very diverse. Besides the surplus of international students from around the world, we also have students from all around the United States. In my circle of friends, we have California, Washington DC, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico. There are a lot of Polynesians, Latin Americans, Europeans, Islanders, and many others...Kind of keeps me from being homesick since Im from San Diego and we are known for having so many diverse cultures."
College Freshman,5,Graceland has such a wide variety of majors for every person. no matter what you want to major in we have it.
College Freshman,5,We have a huge social program here that gets everyone involved and pretty much all of the girls here are pretty bomb and they have no problem talking to you. everyone here is extremely nice and love to make new friends .
College Freshman,5,"Varsity sports are huge on Graceland's campus, every time there is a home game you can always expect a great turn out. All of our coaches are amazing and won't cut you or your scholarship if you get hurt. We also have a new weight room and a new workout facility with all of the latest workout equipment."
College Senior,5,Graceland University has a very strict rules on drugs and alcohol. students cannot drink or smoke on school campus.
College Junior,5,Off-Campus dining has a full range from fancy nicer resturaunts to fast food
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is included, everyone feels as if they belong on campus, and if they dont its because they arnt trying, Gaceland builds a strong community through out this system!"
Sophomore,4,"Loved the environment, some professors were kind of rude regarding certain things. The community up there is great and the people on campus make it fun."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman, but so far I love the professors and the performing arts departments. My biggest wish is that they had a swimming pool because our current one is not usable."
Sophomore,4,I like how small it is and how interactive the professors are and how much they care about your success. I wouldn't change anything but its location.
Niche User,4,You'll enjoy Graceland University in small town Lamoni Iowa. There is always something to do and places to go to.
Senior,4,I like the fact that Graceland University is very diverse and also that the classrooms are very small and that the students are very involved with the community in general. I like the Professors and how helpful they are to students and how much effort they put into their daily jobs. The school is very focused on diversity including all types of ethcinity and in general. I love the environments and the sports at Graceland. Being part of a program that cares so much about its community is something amazing about Graceland.
Junior,4,Graceland was been a great two years so far. There are a few things that could be changes but the atmosphere and education program here.
Graduate Student,4,What I like about Graceland University is that they offer online master's programs in the field of nursing. I would like to change how expensive the tuition is.
Graduate Student,4,So far it has been an easy admission and enrollment process. They have been wonderful at getting me all set up to start this spring.
Sophomore,4,Graceland is an amazing school in the fact that they really care about their students feeling welcomed and wanted. The school hosts a lot of events for students so that we can have fun outside of the classroom and so that we can have some stress relievers. The main thing I'd change about the school is that we don't always have  the best resources especially considering the amount we pay to attend the school.
Senior,4,"Graceland University is for those people who want a tight knit college community and where everyone knows everyone. teachers actually know your name and are willing to help you with your problems. They have a diverse range of students and staff and they make you all feel at home. I do not know of any safety issues that I or any body else have experienced while attending Graceland University. The Lamoni community is also supportive of the college and its students. Though it is a small town and does not offer as many accommodations that other college towns may offer, they do their best. I recommend Graceland University to any one that is looking for a small campus where you can make friends, be close with your teachers, and  succeed in your academic adventures."
Alum,4,Graceland is a great place to be at.  Small class size ratio with professor.  Friendly professors and great campus.
Junior,4,I love how each faculty member really cares about their students and wants to see them succeed.  They will answer any question you may have and will do anything in their power to help you succeed.
Senior,4,"Graceland University is a unique Liberal Arts School. We have a focus on stimulating academics and invigorating campus activities.  Professors are easily accessible with regular office hours as well as email communication. We have a great small little community-- professors even will have students over for home-cooked dinner sometimes, especially for international and long-distance students.  We don't have Greek life, but each hall in the residence buildings makes up a House that also incorporates students living off campus. The Houses are a great source of community and activity and we have campus-wide activities that revolve around House competitions throughout the year.
There are few restaurant and shop options, but most students find creative activities to occupy their down time.
We have great class sizes-- few over 30, and some as small as 7 students.  Overall, Graceland has a thriving environment and excited students. There are familiar faces to be seen anywhere on campus."
Senior,4,I like the sense of home at Graceland. The faculty is amazing and everyone is very welcoming. The school is very small and that also allows you to get to know everyone who attends the university as well. The diversity at Graceland is incredible. I have made friends with people from literally all over the world and that allows for growth in different cultures as well. The school is all around amazing and i would definatly  recommend it for anyone wanting to go to a 4 year college.
College Freshman,4,Teachers are very helpful and are committed to my education.
College Junior,4,Our school will hold internship fairs at our school once a semester to help students find the right internships for them to enable getting a job faster and easier out of college. Our school does its best to get students out and working in the field that they have been striving for.
College Junior,4,Our courses here are challenging but help you really learn the material that is needed within the course. The professors are always trying to help if something is not easily understanding for a student. We can easily schedule one on one time with professors to get our work done or even to get help studying for an upcoming exam or test. There are a pretty good variety of courses offered wishing our school for its size. Our class sizes are about 30 students per class on average.
College Junior,4,Our school rarely has any type of safety issues. Our school is in a very small town where everyone knows everyone so we all feel pretty safe here and there are rarely even fights between people. I feel very safe on campus in the day time and even at night.
College Junior,4,I love our campus and our small student classes. It helps to give you more one on one time with professors and extra help when needed. The professors are always there to help when needed during hours and even after hours. They strive to so the best of their abilities in helping us pass our classes. Our school is unique because its not too big of a campus so were like a big family. All Graceland University students get along very well and are very helpful with anything that is needed.  I honestly wouldn't choose this school again though because I would have rather went and played for a division 1 football team.
College Junior,4,I'm never worried about anything happening to me when I walk alone on campus. It's always well lit and semi-busy whenever I'm out and about. The only things I've had stolen are clothes from the laundry rooms.
College Junior,4,"The Graceland Enactus program, something I am involved in, just started a program to help students connect with alumni to help them along their path toward finding a career outside of school. The faculty also helps a student when they are trying to find an internship/career. Since the town is so small, there aren't that many employers that come to Graceland, but we make up for it through Enactus when we put on events and get speakers to come in and provide students with valuable life information to help them. Also, Des Moines is only an hour away and Kansas City is two hours, so we're not completely in the middle of nowhere!"
College Junior,4,I chose Graceland because it was exactly what I was looking for in a school. The major is exactly what I want to do with my life and the people here are absolutely great. They're so friendly and helpful it makes me never want to leave.
College Junior,4,"We don't have greek life, but you're a part of a house. Examples of house names would be Aponivi (mine), Sariah, Orion, Solah, Timona. This system is unique to Graceland Uviversity. Houses do activities together and compete against other houses throughout the schoolyear during Homecoming week and also intramurals."
College Junior,4,"Since this is a small school, the majority of the students are involved in a sport. Athletic events are well attended and supported."
College Freshman,4,I have never heard of any assaults taking place on our campus. I feel this is one of the safest campus' in the country.
College Freshman,4,Everyone I have come across I think have had my success in mind. I think the quality of the courses and the knowledge of the professors  are top notch.
College Freshman,4,I honestly have not experienced this yet but from what I have discussed with others this is a great campus for your future with employers or continuing your education.
College Freshman,4,My school has so many opportunities to become and stay involved. I love the atmosphere and how friendly and helpful everyone seems to be.
College Junior,4,"Honor classes are offered. And by being part of the honor program, the student also gets the opportunity to obtain a $1000 scholarship while being part of a great program."
College Junior,4,The professors are very helpful. They are available during and outside of office hours and have the student's best interest in mind.
College Junior,4,I personally feel very safe on campus. I feel like I can walk around campus at any type without the risk of an assault.
College Junior,4,The athletic facilities are very nice and accessible to both athletes and non-athletes.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is involved in athletics, varsity, ims, or spectators."
College Sophomore,4,There are strict visitation policies but police are lenient on off campus parties.
College Sophomore,4,It's great because you always get to chill with friends and people rarely get in trouble
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the house that im on, and the people that are on it. We do things together like family."
College Freshman,4,We have nurses and athletic trainers
College Freshman,4,The staff at Graceland are amazing!
College Junior,4,"Social interaction is seen and is extremely good, but it is costly to be housed on campus."
College Junior,4,Everyone is energetic and excited about Homecoming Week.
College Junior,4,"Graceland is great about admissions and they have wonderful people who work in admin. If you really want to get in, talk to them. They want to help you."
College Junior,4,"I have always felt safe on the Lamoni campus, even at 2 in the morning."
College Junior,4,"Graceland was founded by members of the Community of Christ church, which is a world church and it brings in lots of different people. There are many international students on campus, but also not just CoC members, the Catholic students are now out numbering the CoC students and other religions are seen on campus."
College Junior,4,"The education I get at Graceland University is great. It is a liberal arts university and although GU is an expensive school. I am learning how to do everything, not just things specific to my field of study. It can be frustrating at times, but it is nice to have a more rounded education."
College Sophomore,4,"The hall directors, assistant hall directors and house presidents care about your well-being and success, just don't piss them off and make their jobs difficult. Only one of the girls dorm buildings has air conditions, unfortunately a majority of the girls live in the un-air-conditioned building. It's somewhat terrible during the early part of the year."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors here care so much, if you're willing to give them the chance. As long as you treat them like humans and give them a little respect, they will have your back. Financially, this school doesn't take care of you completely, that's one thing they REALLY need to work on. Overall, the school had decent academics, good and caring professors and a relatively accepting atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,"Due to the visitation hours, the dorms are pretty secure and safe, the dorm doors lock after 12 AM on weeknights, 2 AM on weekends. Your personal dorm room doors also have keypad locks on them, so nobody's going to be able to break in easily, so long as your door is shut. The campus security also patrols all throughout the night, every single night, which is somewhat comforting, other than the fact that they aren't in anyway trained in security."
College Sophomore,4,"You can almost always find a party or rave on the weekends, don't expect to get your drinks free, always bring a little bit of cash to spend. There used to be a bar, but it got closed down unfortunately, if you want to hit up a good club or bar, I suggest driving north to Des Moines for a night on the town!"
College Sophomore,4,"Winter Term- Every student at this point is required to take two winter term courses, which are outside the normal two semester system. These courses are all about enrichment and focusing on one subject for three weeks. It sounds stressful, but is very fun."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone has a safe and clean place to study or hangout.
College Junior,4,"If we have severe weather of any kind, they cancel school and notify us immediately."
College Junior,4,They have a degree for almost everyone.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is respectful to each other, no matter what."
College Sophomore,4,"Sexual orientation is not varied, but typical two sexes acknowledged.  Beliefs are conservative midwestern and a religiously based college.  this is why I chose it."
Recent Alumnus,4,Security is great. I feel safe
College Junior,4,My school is extremely clean. There is a custodian on hand ever since I have been there. 
College Junior,4,My financial-aid team are great in getting information to me. 
College Junior,4,"In my program there are thirty students. Three are African American, one Samoan, one Hawaaiin, and the rest of the class is Caucasian. "
College Junior,4,The professors are extremely good in helping us learn the curriculum some even encourage us to work together to better understand the work. 
College Junior,4,"Our computer usage is great. Even though we are able to bring our own computers, there is really no need. "
College Freshman,2,"The classes at this school are too easy.  Very little studying is needed to pass these classes, which I feel is unhealthy when looking for a school that will prepare you for your future career.  The school classifies itself as a Liberal Arts school, and they definitely live up to that label.  It felt to me like the school put having fun ahead of doing well in your classes.  Extracurriculars are strongly suggested to the point where you feel peer pressured to participate, even if it means that you won't get your homework/studying done.  This school felt more like a continuous party than a college."
College Junior,2,There aren't many dorm options. The boys dorms is only one building and 4 floors while the girls have 2 separate dorm buildings each having 4 floors. Our boys dorms are pretty run down such as the heating or AC and also the carpets in the halls are stained really bad and the halls usually smell too.
College Sophomore,2,There are no scholarships from this school available to grad students
College Junior,2,"Support and school spirit is seen for every sport. Yet all the money goes to the athletes (football in particular), instead of the academic students who need it more than the athletes."
College Junior,2,We do not have Greek Life at Graceland.
College Sophomore,2,"If you like small towns that consist of one good coffee shop and a pizza hut, then little Lamoni is for you! Personally, I enjoy the small town life and enjoy the quiet atmosphere. Sometimes, you can go a little stir-crazy if you haven't gotten out of town in a long time, nothing a quick trip to the Wal-Mart 20 minutes away can't solve."
College Freshman,2,You can only buy breakfast lunch and dinner at certain times and after that they cut it off. So if you have a class and it goes past lunch you can't get lunch.
College Freshman,2,The campus shuttle is expensive but you need to have a way to get back to campus from the airport because of how rural the campus is. 
College Freshman,2,It's freezing. I am fine with snow. But the wind chill makes your legs and face burn. It's awful. And they don't have many snow days. 
College Freshman,2,I received many scholarships however not any to cover the cost of the school. It upsets me that they aren't really working with me. I am transferring because of it and how I had issues with the student life too. 
College Junior,2,"Lamoni is a small town with a growing potential. The town is open to welcoming new businesses. Lamoni has a movie theater, park, pool, and many locally owned business on main street. Many of the businesses offer students discounts at their stores/restaurants."
College Sophomore,2,"Since i am an education major, we have to do a practicum.  but over the summer i work at a summer program in hawaii called summer fun.  we work with kids and enjoy the summer.  the pay is really good, but the pay is not what im there for.  seeing the kids having fun and enjoying my time while working with kids is just the cherry on top!"
College Sophomore,2,The food is not very good and they charge too much money for it.
College Freshman,2,This is a very small town with not a lot to do and nowhere to go.
College Junior,2,"There is one bar, and there is a club called ""Choices"" for students under 21 or those that do not want to drink.  There really isn't anything else except various student parties."
College Senior,2,Parking on campus is pretty bad. They are in bad condition and lines are faded. Usually full except back spots.
College Freshman,2,"There is usually access to the computers in the labs, but as far as wireless goes, it is awful.  You can rarely count on the wireless to run efficiently, especially in the library!"
College Freshman,2,"There are just a few options off of campus.  There is a Pizza Hut, Pizza Shack, and Subway.  Other than that, not too many options."
College Junior,2,Graceland doesn't win a whole lot of games. I personally don't care for sporting events at Graceland. From what I hear though is it's a lot of losses for Graceland.
College Junior,2,The Greek life is unique in the fact that it's on-campus and pre-deteremined and known as halls. Some halls are closer than others.
Senior,1,"Graceland University might represent the worst investment you could possibly make when it come to deciding on your future. At almost 40,000 dollars per year you would expect, at a minimum, a good quality campus and competent academics. Instead Graceland is a decrepit remnant of the 1950s with accompanying operations withing the administration. The college is ran as if it was still the 18th century, which was made especially evident with the recent data breach that release students Social Security Numbers, emails, addresses, and various other pieces of personally identifiable information to malicious hackers. If you accompany this with poor athletics and academics you can see why attending Graceland has been the worst decision of my life thus far."
Niche User,1,"Most professors were good. One of GU instructors mentioned that she spent 60 hours per week for teaching and grading.  I thought that was exaggerated.  Later, other two instructors said that they taught 5 classes per semester and participated in long meetings each week.  Budget is a major problem.  It appeared that student evaluations do not matter in performance of instructor and faculty reviews, but the university budget is.  The university can remove anyone without proper review, such as an elected and effective vice president and high salary employees, regardless of students’ evaluations and the individual’s performance evaluation.   I did not expect such unethical situations from a Christian University."
College Freshman,1,NA We do not participate in this at my school
College Sophomore,1,"This school costs a lot, because it's private. When they recruit you and promise you all of these scholarships and financial aid, remember that number will likely not go up. They don't tell you that!"
College Freshman,1,"You can't move off campus till you a junior. They do this because they want to charge you extra money to live in a crappy dorm.
They say that it's because it helps you bond with your hall but really if your hall is like my hall you will know how worthless it is to stay on campus. 
Another reason why GU wants to charge you extra for crappy service. "
College Freshman,1,There really isn't anything. We only have house parties because there isn't any bars. GU is supposed to be a dry campus and I went hoping that it would be. I was surprised when there was a bunch of parties. Everyone goes to them and honestly a lot of bad things happen at them. People spike the drinks and everyone gets sick.. it's not what I expected. 
College Freshman,1,If your expecting huge college parties this is not the school
College Sophomore,1,They are not very good and they don't always let people live off campus so they make them live on campus and pay 3500 just for rooms
College Senior,1,"Recently Graceland has made it more difficult to live off campus. With more people living in the dorms, there are less party houses. The only place that isn't someone's house that we can go is ""The Bar"" literally. And it is dingy, gross, and empty on most occasions."
College Senior,1,"Graceland is a dry campus. Any drinking or drunkenness on campus is heavily fined. They do not have coed dorms, and visitation is strictly monitored and enforced."
College Senior,1,"there isn't that much going on for the nightlife at Graceland, and the party scene is not really impressive at all."
College Senior,1,As far as I have been told there is only one scholarship available to students. I wish that there were more academic scholarships available.
College Junior,1,All we have is Gbucks which doesn't last long and limited selections.
College Junior,1,Drugs and alcohol are pretty openly used here and easily accessed.
College Junior,1,The school suffocates us with rules so much that is distracting to our actual education.
College Junior,1,"They're isn't much to do, sometimes when it's nicer outside the community has events but there is no shopping or anything."
College Junior,1,"The computer hardly work, and if they do the internet and printers don't work."
College Sophomore,1,"Dorms Are Acceptable – Dorms are acceptable but its quite small for two students. However, we adjust and find the best way for us to fit into it. The apartments just outside of campus are great but only students above 21 are allowed to stay outside Graceland University."
College Sophomore,1,"Its very strict in Graceland University regarding drinking under 21. There are no bars for students under 21. So, its pretty much nightlife for above 21 students. But students do have nightlife in apartments."

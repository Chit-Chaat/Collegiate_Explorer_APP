Junior,5,"I take classes online and Buena Vista University and I love the setup. The professors are knowledgable in technology, so classes move smoothly. The course material is interesting and informative."
Junior,5,Buena Vista University has an excellent variety of knowledgable professors. You learn as much in an online classroom as you do in a face-to-face class. The instructors are patient and kind. The atmosphere is very welcoming.
Freshman,5,Buena Vista University is a great college to attend. The professors are very friendly and connect well with students. They have a very nice and clean campus. The dorms are about your average dorm and you will feel very safe in them. Campus security is always ready to help whenver.
Freshman,5,My first semester as a first year student at Buena Vista University has been great so far! The faculty and all the staff members are all very welcoming and kind. There are all sorts of resources to help out students and the staff members are always more than willing to help out a student with any question that they may have. The diversity of sports and clubs have helped really me branch out of my comfort zone and allowed me to meet many new people that I would not have met otherwise. I am grateful for this great experience!
Sophomore,5,"I love the small campus and small class sizes, it lets me get to speak with my professors a little more freely."
Senior,5,Buena Vista University is a great family orientated College.  Professors and staff alike want to see you succeed in every aspect.
Junior,5,I am transferring in from another University after my program changed. The admissions rep was incredibly helpful and responsive and had no problems at all with me changing my starting semester.
Sophomore,5,My freshman year at BVU was great. The class size is small enough that you get hands-on experience in the classroom and really connect with your professors.
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman to Buena Vista University and will be attending in the Fall of 2019. I chose the school partly because of softball but the other parts were because of the beautiful campus and because I could see myself their for the next four years of my life. I could see it as my home away from home. The support that is offered there is not even comparable to the other colleges that I looked at. I can't wait to start attending BVU.
Niche User,5,I like how diverse the atmosphere is. I really connect with the people that go to BV and the professors.
Niche User,5,I had a wonderful experience with Buena Vista University when I took a college visit there. Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was productive and fun. It is a smaller school which is what I am personally looking for with small classes. The professors are there for your success and guide you onto the right path for your career goals. The campus is beautiful and I felt I was in a safe environment.
Junior,5,I go to to BVU site on the Ottumwa campus. I really enjoy it and all the staff and students are so pleasant. It is an ideal place to be for the working adult.
Senior,5,I continuously see improvements on campus whether it be from the new renovation or simply making new additions to student life.
Junior,5,"So far I've had a wonderful experience with this school. They have made it a very easy transition from my AA to getting into my Bachelors. I can personally talk to someone on my campus in my little town 5 days a week and they have classes online or in person, which is great for a single, working mom of two. I am excited to graduate and see where my life goes!"
Niche User,5,"It’s small, everyone is nice, campus is gorgeous, and class sizes are about 20kids. I would change that if you are not a freshman you are not requirred to have the meal plan to help cut students costs down."
Freshman,5,I love it here so much! They are so open and welcoming. They have the feel of a small college with all the amazing opportunities of a big college!  This school has helped changed my life for the better and is going to really help me make in the outside world.
Sophomore,5,"In my time at Buena Vista, I have really enjoyed in. There is a great atmosphere on campus, and it is very enjoyable for students. They always have activities, whether it be midnight movies or intramural activities, that are suited for every type of student. As an athlete on campus myself, I have enjoyed all of the sports here on campus, and we have great fan attendance at all of our home games. I feel like the teachers are very good on campus and make sure we get a quality education. Another thing that is nice, is that it is the cheapest division 3 school in the conference, so it is reasonably affordable to attend. Overall, Buena Vista is a great school that I would recommend to others."
Sophomore,5,"The online courses are fast and educational, as well as very appropriatly geared toward my degree. There are many areas available to help should you need it at anytime. The site and the support have been amazing. The cost is very comparable to others and I feel that the education that I am receiving is top of the line."
Junior,5,So far my experience with Buena Vista has been great! I've advanced academically and enjoyed my time.
Freshman,5,"Buena Vista University is very student oriented, they truly have the students interests as top priority."
Freshman,5,I am a incoming freshamn going to Buena Vista univeristy and i will say that based on my visit it has been an excellent suprise it was an excellent visit i got to see the campus see how college was going to be like in a day and i love it
Junior,5,"Buena Vista is a great option for those non-traditional students such as myself. You can take courses online at your own pace and convenience. Every advisor I have spoken with is very knowledgeable and helpful. If they don't know an answer, they will definitely go above and beyond to find it for you."
College Junior,5,So far I love how everything has gone.
College Junior,5,Love that I can get my degree completely online
College Junior,5,Very easy to apply. Advisor was so helpful and friendly.
College Junior,5,So far everyone has been very helpful!
College Senior,5,This school has been a great challenge for me.  I am excited about my classes and the opportunity to learn under some great teachers and professionals in their field.
College Freshman,5,Safety here is great and campus security helps out alot on campus
College Freshman,5,I love living in the dorms. It is close to everything and I can even take tunnels to most of my classes.
College Senior,5,Being at a GPS site it make it convenient for me to attend classes.The course are educational and what I feel are well suited to the different degree offered. The instructor are great. t\They are passionate about the courses they teach and are helpful to the students both in and outside of classes. They make themselves available to the students when necessary.
College Senior,5,Because Buena Vista University offers classes at the local community college for Graduate and professional sites (GPS) it has made it possible for me to continue my education beyond a 2 year degree. I am a non-traditional student (age 52) and so I am not as mobile for  being able to move in order to attend classes on campus. The classes for the most part have been face-to-face which is what I prefer. I am more old school and therefor really don't care for the online classes. I have had to take a couple of online courses and it is difficult for me to grasp some of the material without the normal class discussion. Overall I have had a really great experience attending college classes with Buena Vista University. The instructors are knowledgeable and  make the classes interesting as they are also very passionate about the subjects that they teach.
College Junior,5,Being in a program where I can attend classes at an off campus site has made it easier for me to be able to work toward my bachelors degree. The night classes have been something I have had to get used to. Being accustomed to attending day classes has made it more unique and has been an adjustment  for me. I do like the convenience of attending the night classes because if other obligations and responsibilities I have. I much prefer the face-to-face classes over on-line education.
College Junior,5,"I believe that the most important criteria for entering any university is a good academic history for both grades and attendance.  The process of entering the Human Services program was a smooth transition from the community college to the university. Our community college works with several universities with a program to help more students, especially the non-traditional one to complete their general credits at the community college and accept their Associate Degree as completion of the general education requirements for most bachelor degree programs."
College Junior,5,The most unique opportunity is the fact that I can attend a local community college for face-to-face college courses from a reputable university in order to work toward completing my bachelors degree. Without that opportunity I would not have gone on to a higher education after I completed my associate degree.
College Junior,5,I am unable to comment on the student life on campus because I do not live on campus or near the actual University campus. The local community college that I attend classes at has excellent facilities and activites for students who live both on and/or off campus.
College Junior,5,I have enjoyed the classes I have attended at Buena Vista University because most of the instructors make the classes interesting for both the traditional and non-traditional students. Being able to attend classes at a local campus instead of having to commute or move to the actual campus is convenient for me as I am not able to move like the younger students.
College Junior,5,"I see students with all different ethnicity and find that there isn't any kind of prejudice or problems between the students. Students who are local, out of state and international all attend classes together and make it more interesting because of the different backgrounds they are from. I find going to classes with students who are from other areas of the country and from other countries can only enhance my education. College organizations are available for anyone to join and also help with getting to know other students."
College Junior,5,The campus is safe for students and does not allow alcohol or drugs to be used on the premises. They take complaints seriously and investigate those complaints. They work to make the campus safe for their students and also alert them if a serious crime happens near the campus. Earlier this spring we had a local woman who was shot near the campus. An alert went out to all of the students who attend the college. Another alert was sent when the person suspected of committing that shooting was arrested. Having a system which is able to alert the students of any problems on or near the campus makes us feel much safer. Luckily this is a smaller campus and community where crime is at a low rate.
College Junior,5,The program that Buena Vista University offers makes it possible for more non-traditional students to work toward a higher degree. We can continue to live and work in our community and have the convenience of attending university classes at the local community college. Without this option there are many non-traditional students who would not return to college or go on to earn a higher education degree.
College Junior,5,Having a local location to take college university classes in order to earn my bachelors degree without having to move to where the actual University campus is makes it much more convenient for me. Without this option I would not be able to continue my college education for a higher degree in my field of study.
College Junior,5,"I enjoy the small classes, evening classes, and ability to take classes online and/or face-to-face."
College Sophomore,5,Teachers really do care about how you do.
College Sophomore,5,I do not know of any drugs on campus
College Sophomore,5,"I think one of the biggest things that sets us apart from other school is we are smaller, and even though we are it has the big campus feel to it. the new faces you see almost everyday, to the new organizations and clubs that are popping up from students starting them. the amount of opportunities to get involved are endless. even travel opportunities are manageable for any student that wants to go, regardless of economic backgrounds. "
College Sophomore,5,"the labs are abundant and never are all of them full. printing is reliable and extra paper is always set next to the printer just in case. There are more than one printers in each building, there is even a printer in the dining area so it helps if you need to do work  while you eat.  the network is great, and if something happens we are notified my email from our 2fix.  it is very helpful that the campus provides you with a computer so you don't have to get one yourself. Its helpful because they download everything you will need for each class for you, so you don't have to keep buying or search for certain programs for each class. "
College Junior,5,You are pretty free to do what you want socially at bv. Academic policies are pretty average.
College Junior,5,The cafeteria is open during regular breakfast lunch and dinner hours. There is also restaurants within five to ten miles from campus as well as more than one grocery.
College Junior,5,I have observed them to drive around and look for signs of trouble. They have walked you out if night or crimes have been on a rise in the area. The security have been pleasant to the staff and the students on the campus.
College Junior,5,AS with Iowa Western Community college I have been in a class room with a wide diverse in race and emotional/ physical development. I am proud to be in a place that is so accepting and have made many friends of different race and disabilities. The staff I have dealt with have been very generous and have treated each with the same respect. The staff give a little when needed and for those slackers they do not point them out or treat them different. The staff have been observed to simply state in front of the class as a whole what is expected and it is up to them the ones who know who need to make a change to do it. The bottom line is we pay for it work hard for it. We are all able to succeed.
College Junior,5,All sports are attended by a good crowd with a couple of sports being huge and packed full at every game!
College Freshman,5,"BV is a very diverse campus. We have many different ethnic backgrounds and a lot of of students are international students. Although there is diversity with ethnic backgrounds there is also diversity within each individual person. Each person is unique and brings something different to the table. We each come in with different home environments, social statuses, religious backgrounds, and whatnot."
College Freshman,5,"I love Buena Vista because being on campus, you just feel safe and at home. The doors are all automatically locked to the dorms, which makes one less thing to worry about besides classes!"
College Freshman,5,"Sports at Buena Vista University are pretty big, many of the students go to all of the games, especially basketball."
College Freshman,5,I love that Buena Vista gave everyone their own computer. It was one less thing to buy when getting college things.
College Freshman,5,Buena Vista University has good campus housing and the Resident Advisors are well trained to help out.
College Freshman,5,i got a good amount of financial aid and the admissions counselors helped out a lot. they were there to make the financial aid process easy
College Sophomore,5,"Business School – I knew i wanted to get a degree in business but what aspect, i don't know. but that's okay because the school was very reassuring that i had time to decide and at BVU the business school and teachers are very helpful in getting you the right classes to help you decide and teachers really appreciate their classes and want students to succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"Sports and Recreation – Buena Vista University has recently put in a turf field and lights, so night games and no muddy field is sure a positive. BVU also offers countless intramurals which are fun to play with friends. And last but certainly not least is everything you can do outside of school, BVU is located on a beautiful lake and our outdoor recreation club can help you find what you need for a day of fun at and on the lake."
College Junior,5,"Great Help – All of the staff and faculty of BVU campus is willing to help any student struggling. I began to have struggles my sophomore year; a faculty member and my advisor helped me stay focused during the school year. Some classes may be hard, but there is always classes that you can fly by. Just stay focused"
College Junior,5,"Financiak Aid Process – If I dont have enough money, I can work in the school and get some money and I will pay."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy Buena Vista. I would like to see the dorms and housing to improve. But overall it is a great place to go to college and a great place to meet many great people.
Junior,4,Buena Vista is a very close knitted community. Professors are dedicated to helping you learn and are always available. They really try to make you feel at home here. The school is heavy in volunteering and in club activities so there is something for everyone to do around campus.
Senior,4,"What I like about Buena Vista is the staff putting our class schedule together and if they have a problem or question they always get ahold of me. The college would be better if the student had the same advisor all year around instead of switching, but overall it’s a great school."
Senior,4,I love the small school culture that we have. It is nice to walk across campus and say hi to at least 3-5 people. It is especially nice when you have professors know your name and not feel like a number.
Sophomore,4,So far my years at BV have been wonderful! The experiences that you have make are one in a million. The professors are great and really have your best interest in mind. Classes are fairly easy if you put in the work and effort. BV has a great campus and wonderful resources!
Junior,4,"Buena Vista University is a great institution where the professors know the students by name and the president loves to interact with students. Sometimes during finals week, the president will buy students coffee. BVU has great athletic coaches and athletics is a big driver for new students."
Sophomore,4,"At Buena Vista University, I have experienced the different culture and the student life. The campus is small which helped me find all my classes with no difficulty. With small classes, it helps students and professors get to know each other better and students always can go to professors for help. Buena vista has many was you can get help for classes such as the CAE, which is a study room with tutors and quite rooms. People at BVU want to help you and want you to become successful in life after BVU."
Freshman,4,"Love that it is a small school where the teachers are really here to help you learn. Everything on campus is centrally located and easy to get to. People are friendly and caring and the there are resources for help everywhere, you just have to ask. The food could be better with more variety."
Freshman,4,This school is a great school I just wish they offered more ways to make the school more affordable through financial aid.
Freshman,4,"I love the community.  Everyone has been so helpful and nice.  
I have met a lot of great people.  There are a lot of ways to get involved."
Freshman,4,"BVU is very diverse compared to my high school so that is great! Most professors are pretty good about getting to know your name so classes are easier for both parties. The size of the classes are also generally smaller, which is something I like."
Junior,4,"Sometimes I've gotten the run around from different offices when I need help on something, but I love the education I get here!!!"
Niche User,4,"Most of the professors are great! They offer advice and information to enhance your education. I am able to complete multiple field experiences so I get my foot in the door different places. But when they say this is a school for working adults that is not accurate, many weeks I have 20+ assignments due each week. Also the academic adviser I was assigned dose not respond well to emails and does not tell me about things in advance. Better notification from the adviser, questions answered quicker, and a realistic view of what this college is would be better. The classes are very good, the professors a great, but having so many assignments in one week makes working and going to school very difficult."
Junior,4,"I love how many options you have for online learning. I will be able to graduate with a double major all online which is most convenient for me. I also like that the classes are accelerated, so you have each class done in a two month span."
College Junior,4,don't know much since i'm online
College Senior,4,Great teams and are a great option for events to attend with friends and families.
College Freshman,4,it is easy to get a career at bv or go to graduate school
College Freshman,4,The courses are pretty well but challanging
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy BVU, the teachers are great."
College Junior,4,"Being enrolled in online courses, I am able to communicate with my professors through email anytime I need to reach out to them. They are very quick to respond and help me what any questions I may have."
College Junior,4,"The application process was very easy, and the admissions helped me with whatever I needed help with!"
College Freshman,4,BV helps students find internships that would later help them in their careers and they can also help us get into a graduate school.
College Freshman,4,"The quality of my courses are very good, however, it was very hard for me to get along with some of my professors because I didn't like their teaching styles."
College Freshman,4,I would definitely choose Buena Vista University again if I could everything over. I love the campus because it is easy to get around and it makes me feel at home. I feel that our career center makes Buena Vista unique. My favorite experiences were making new friends and stepping outside of my comfort zone and BV has really helped me do that.
College Junior,4,My school is a small close-knit community where everybody supports each other. Professors are very helpful in achieving your goals. Class sizes are small which means more professor-student interaction.
College Junior,4,"Buena Vista University it the perfect campus for me, it have everything I was looking for. It a small university with lots of opportunity"
College Junior,4,My is very good. I enjoy the teachings and everything so far. I am not disappointed I made this choice.
College Freshman,4,"During our freshman orientation, the currents members really took their time to get to know us and also helped us interact with our future classmates. An example of this is when we did the ""Beaver Games"", we got into teams, played games, and competed against the others. Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait for many more to come."
College Freshman,4,Sports participation not bad for a small school
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is pretty close to everything. Living in Pierce/White makes you close to all the academic buildings.
College Freshman,4,"Great diversity in the town, so lots of Hispanic and Asian influenced food. Prices are good for someone on a budget."
College Sophomore,4,I have met many new friends through living on campus.  The social atmosphere is great.
College Sophomore,4,I am an athlete on the football team. I like the fan support we receive and there is great school spirit and pride.
College Sophomore,4,My workload is somewhat heavy with also participating in football.  I enjoy most of my classes and instructors are helpful if you ask for help.  I am hoping to get a good internship in the future in my area of study.
College Junior,4,"As long as general rules are followed, there usually aren't any problems."
College Junior,4,"Personally, I feel very safe on campus. It is very well lit up at night and campus security does a great job at answering calls day or night."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere for the school of business is very laid back and your professors love to see you around and strike up a conversation. The science studies students though are always worrying about their grades and how difficult it is to pass it seems. Political science students are always complaining about professors it seems, I'm told they're the most stuck up group on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The school of business is super relaxed. All the professors have their offices in the same area so it's super easy to contact them during their office hours. A lot of students just hang out in the school of business and the professors love to see them around and help them out if they have time.
College Sophomore,4,There are security kiosks in parking lots. Security does regular patrols around campus and are easily called for help.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus security are all very helpful and just want to make sure everyone stays safe. That said, drinking and smoking if caught on campus is not tolerated. So either be careful, keep alcohol hidden in your room and take marijuana off campus and keep it in your car."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't noticed much bullying on campus,but that obviously by no means means there isn't any. The international students seem to do pretty well (they do tend to stick to themselves though).  I have friends from all different backgrounds and I feel like everyone is pretty accepting on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I know so many students who are interning over summers, during winter break or interim course. The school provides great opportunities for students who are really motivated."
College Junior,4,The strictness is good the pretty much allow us to be adults.  They do intervene when rules and laws are being broken.
College Junior,4,Most of the dorms have been updated or a fairly new.  All of the dorms are close to class.
College Junior,4,Career services is there to help everyone find an internship.  I'm looking to have an internship but as long a I start looking soon i'm not to worried about finding one.
College Junior,4,I am really happy with my field.  I would do it again if I could.  My career goals are to get into grad school and become a certified athletic trainer.
College Sophomore,4,The education at BVU is really good. The professors are very helpful and insightful.
College Freshman,4,If you need campus security they are there. They answer calls almost immediately.
College Freshman,4,Our teams our of great quality considering the division we are in.
College Freshman,4,I believe the professors in my major are awesome!
College Junior,4,"There is quite a bit of diversity.  There are younger students, but most of the students (in my program) are working adults.  Everyone seems to be very accepting of each other's differences."
College Junior,4,Policies are average.  I do not think they are too lenient or too strict.
College Junior,4,"It was not hard to get into the program, you just had to meet minimum requirements."
College Sophomore,4,On good days you can do actives out on the lake.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of space only had a couple of dings.
College Sophomore,4,"Some party busts, and drug busts."
College Sophomore,4,Really gets you motivated to learn and prepared.
College Sophomore,4,Safe feelings all around campus cops and security.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall pretty reliable, slow at times but decent."
College Sophomore,4,they have helpful tutors for lots of classes
Freshman,2,"As a current student at BV I feel let down, when visiting the college I was promised scholarships to help pay off the expensive tuition, but now i'm paying 50% of tuition which is more than what was told to me. There are only select few or professors who do care about the students' academics but all the others just seem to care about their paychecks. The workers in the kitchen are some of the nicest people on campus, the worst are the workers in the business office who seem to throw their hatred for work onto the students. The university also seems to care about their athletics but to the rest of the students they could care less. Living on campus, everyone gets irritated with everyone because we aren't allowed to live off campus our first year, this makes it hard to those who live in storm lake or for those who want to live in an apartment. Over all Buena Vista has let down a large portion of their students, as well as some professors."
College Sophomore,2,"Think carbs and cardboard chicken. The food is tough and flavored wrong more often than not. The workers are very kind and helpful, which may be the only redeeming factor of the serve. You get a set amount of 'beaver bucks' but then you need to buy more. Nothing is open past midnight. One place is open between 2 and 5 so you better pray your dorm is well stocked."
College Sophomore,2,"The only real shopping you have for clothes is walmart or goodwill (unless you want high end 150$ jeans from buckle). And diversity for grocery shopping is decent (three stores) but still feels lacking. The local attitude is decent, being a small town there isn't much room for trouble. The school is on a lake so basically A+ scenery and plenty of parks along the waters edge."
College Sophomore,2,Switching to our own computers next year. old ones are bad
College Sophomore,2,Very confusing about what steps I need to take
College Sophomore,2,Too cold most of the school year
College Sophomore,2,"I may be biased, as I have eaten the campus food for quite a while, but the food has gone downhill. Often times, we are served mass amounts of carbs rather than having selections of meat, vegetables, or fruit. We have pasta served as a main course multiple nights in a row, little meat, and rather poor selections of fruit and vegetables. There is a humus bar served as a main course during lunch, but few people eat at it. Several students on campus are frustrated with the options."
College Junior,2,The variety is limited and is not always avaliable. 
College Junior,2,I have not done any sort of internship with my school
College Junior,2,"Small town and small town bars, but the bars are across town from campus."
College Sophomore,2,Was told about student loans but not one scholarship
College Junior,2,"i am an accounting major and there are very few options for classes. I pretty much have to take all the classes I am signed up for, not leaving any room for extra ""fun"" classes. Also, they don't offer very many classes like that anyway because it is a class for working adults."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The setting is a small town, thus available housing is minimal. Emphasis has been on providing housing for immigrants, illegal and legal; thus, citizens are often left without housing. Housing is expensive for the size of the town."
College Junior,2,"The parking here is crowded at times. We only have 3 or 4 parking lots. The biggest is between the Social Science and Art building and the gym, but it's not the closest to all the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"APO- a Theater Frat – This is the closest thing we get to Greek life. I kinda wish we had other sororities on campus. I am actually thinking of starting one but maybe when I am a junior or senior here. But its poor. That's something I wanted in a college, but its ok."
College Sophomore,2,There really isnt much choice for off-campus housing. There are a few appartments near by but they are not in the greatest shape and since the town is small it is nearly impossible to find a place not on campus at a resonable rate.
College Senior,1,No Greek life at all.
College Senior,1,"If I could do it over again I would not choose this school or would have transferred when I still had time. The professors are mediocre, the only programs that the school cares about are business, science, and education. The coaching staff and athletic administration have high turn over rates and don't care about their athletes as much as they should. The food is bad and not being able to live off campus for four years is absurd."
College Sophomore,1,we don't have any fraternities on campus that I know of.
College Sophomore,1,there are no Greeks that I know of
College Junior,1,There are no farternity or sorority options at my school
College Junior,1,Long distance transportation is very hard. There is no long distance transportation. Always need to find a friend with a car to give you a ride and you pay for gas or you will have to call a cab which will cost a lot of money.

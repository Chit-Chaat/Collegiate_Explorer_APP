Freshman,5,So far I like everything about Henderson State University. The staff seems like family and have been extremely helpful in assisting me with any and everything
Freshman,5,"I take my first class online beginning July 6, 2020. Overall I have had a great experience in getting admitted & getting set up. I am scheduled to meet with my Reddies advisor this month"
Junior,5,Online classes some of them the professors still try to contribute in online classes. They are willing to meet with you and chat with you and are usually flexible and allow you to ask them questions and they try to teach you the best of there ability due to restrictions of being in class
Junior,5,The university feels like home with the small classes and the teachers know a lot and they care about your education. They are great all of them and will go above and beyond for you to understand if your willing to learn
Junior,5,"I love Henderson State! Campus is beautiful and the campus life is amazing! Our athletics programs are great. The food is awesome, we have chick-fi-la, our very own Reddie Grill, and Starbucks."
Freshman,5,"I loved Henderson State University. I always felt welcome and I knew I was in the right hands. When I was attending, I felt at hone and knew this was where I want to get my education."
Alum,5,"Great art professors. I’ve had a great career in Tallahassee FL, Tulsa OK and Houston TX. After graduating and working in Little Rock for 2 years,  I went  on to graduate School for two graduate degrees and was as prepared as any other students. I have provided art direction on creative project with principled guidance than the people I was advising designers and illustrators from schools with larger reputations than Henderson."
Graduate Student,5,I enjoyed the home feeling of the campus. The professors were hands on. They personally cared about your success.
Freshman,5,"Whenever visiting Henderson for the first time I immediately fell in love with the campus. After attending the college for a semester, I still am in love with the campus. The staff is amazing and overall I have really enjoyed my first semester spent at Henderson."
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about this school! Beautiful scenery, quality education and many amenities on campus."
Freshman,5,I just started school there back in August. So far so good I’m trying to see what the future holds for me there.
Freshman,5,"Henderson State University has a great campus and plenty of resources to help it’s students pass class and reach their goals. HSU offers free tutoring every day mon-fri. Between the  enriching student body and the planning committee there is always something to do, along with a recreational center that has a gym, basketball courts, rock climbing and much more. The students have access to to the Caddo cafeteria that offers a variety of foods of the daily, all the way from pizza and ice cream to Keto  meals and salad, as well there is a chic-fil-a and Starbucks and Reddit grill on campus. HSU is a place that a lot of people can feel safe, ever student must complete safety training."
Freshman,5,This is a great school that offers many fields of study. The professors are great and always willing to help whenever needed. The campus forms are a little dated and need some work but the overall experience has been great.
Senior,5,This university is wonderful. The teachers care! They will take any additional time needed to ensure you understand the content and can do well. I love this school!!!
Freshman,5,I love the small college feel! Also I love that it's know as the school with the heart because of how caring and supportive everyone is!
Sophomore,5,I like meeting new people and the pace of the courses. I also like that most teachers will help you after lecture or schedule a time to help if you don’t understand the material. I wouldn’t change a thing about this school.
Freshman,5,"During my first semester at Henderson, my grades went downhill. I was getting used to being on my own for the first time, and I liked to go out with my friends more than I liked to study. During my second semester, I have done better on studying, but I have been struggling in one class mainly because the material is so hard. What I like about Henderson is that I am on my own and I’m doing good. I also like that the teachers aren’t as bad as everyone made it out to be. My high school English teacher used to tell us things like “no professor will ever give you a study guide”. Most of them will give you a study guide once finals come up. No one is going to remember everything they have went over the entire semester. Something that I would change is the food. You just have the same thing over and over again and it just gets old. Also the fire alarms going off so often. Overall, I have had an amazing first year experience, and I am looking forward to returning in the fall."
Niche User,5,Quality education in a safe environment. Beautiful area of the state. Cost is less than other schools.
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman on campus and I would say that so far I love HSU! GO REDDIES!!!!!!  I do not participate in athletics or parties unless I go to a sports games and the only parties I attend are the campus wide parties and my Chi Alpha parties when we have them.
Senior,5,"I am a returning student.  I enjoyed the social scene; yet, there could be more activities for students due to the small town.  I became a member of a sorority.  I had personal relationships with my professors.  The close-knit campus environment was great, because that gave me an opportunity for excellence as well as growth.  I would add to the campus by improving campus life as well as offering activities for internships and bridging the gap between learning in a classroom and the"
Niche User,5,HSU has many opportunities along with tons of friendly faces. They are always welcoming and try to help you in every way possible. The Henderson State University is beautiful and truly feels like home.
Freshman,5,"The tight knit community at Henderson State University opens quickly to the mirrored kindness of incoming students. The only two things I could see changing is better, required communication from teachers and more student artist involvement in aesthetic renovation to help bring a sense of leaving a mark on the school and having a more colorful, cheerful campus."
Niche User,5,"It is an excellent college to tour. They are so helpful and make the whole experience so welcoming and easy to go through. The campus itself is a nice size, and it is easy to get around and not get lost. The lunch I went to for honors courses was well put together and they made sure all questions about the program where answered thoroughly."

Alum,5,"Henderson State University is a beautiful campus that offers a small town feel with lots of opportunities. In 1987-1991 when I was enrolled their, I felt that there were so tremendous opportunities for young people. And today, the opportunities are endless. From teacher education to nursing to aviation and many other fields, Henderson State University has a diverse curriculum designed to meet the needs of all students. Henderson State University is a very affordable university. The dormitories have improved tremendously and the other facilities are outstanding. The only inconvenience at this university is the parking. Parking is limited, and what is available is sometimes not in the best of places."
Sophomore,5,I love Henderson State University. it’s a very diverse college and everyone is very friendly. Between the teachers and the library everything and everyone is helpful in their own way.
Sophomore,5,I love how small it is. All of my professors were extremely involved and truly cared about my education.
Alum,5,I like that the professors are caring and understanding and are willing to work with students and push students into finding what career is right for them and giving the tools to succeed in that career.

Henderson State University is a safe campus to stay on and family friendly as well. So, are you ready to be a ready?"
Sophomore,5,Henderson is a very diverse campus. I enjoy attending Henderson because the staff and people in general are very welcoming and nice. There are many events and campus activities to be involved in and that makes the experience even more great!!!
Freshman,5,Henderson State University was the best choice for me. I grew up going to big schools and I wanted to go to a small college. I have joined a sorority which has opened many doors for me. I’m on the yearbook staff at hsu also.
Sophomore,5,I love Henderson. The professors are very helpful and here is lots of one on one teaching opportunity. The staff is so helpful and the campus is easy to navigate. There is plenty to do on campus and many things to get involved in! The only thing I would like to see change is getting new restaurants on campus!
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed my time at HSU the second time around more than the first time around. My favorite part was the Showband of Arkansas and the school pride that everyone seemed to have.
Junior,5,Henderson State University had been a great school for me! I love the campus and all of the activities they provide to make you feel more at home while on campus!
Sophomore,5,"I love HSU! It's a very nice school on a very beautiful campus. The professors are very nice and easy to talk to, often times they would email you to be sure that you are on track with your school work. The students at the campus are all very sweet and helpful when it comes to finding my classes or having problems with some of my work. The Staff always made it possible for us to get in contact with them if we needed it, they were always available and easy to talk to. Overall Henderson State University is an awesome school and I would recommend anyone to come to our wonderful campus!"
Senior,5,Nice small campus in a tightly-knitted community. Most of the professors are very helpful and the methodist church does an amaizing job to cater to students. It is affordable with very accomodating payment plans.
Senior,5,Henderson State is a great college that I have felt at home at since I started my junior year. I was first at Pulaski tech and I am loving Henderson way more then I have ever did at Pulaski tech. The staff and teachers are super friendly and fun to learn and grow as a student with.
Niche User,5,"I visited here, and they are a little crowded but they have a sweet staff and they also have amazing majoring courses and its overall a nice school, not too large, just right."
Sophomore,5,Henderson is a great school in a great community. Has a unique rivalry with OBU across the street. People are great!
Sophomore,5,"As a full time sophomore student at Henderson I would have to say that overall ,attending Henderson is an amazing experience for me ,and I wouldn't have it any other way. As a fully diverse college I get to meet new people , make new friends, and learn about other people cultures.in my honest opinion I don't see any chances to be made ,I l]already love the events that are welcoming anyone to attend and join."
College Sophomore,5,the athletics at my school they are very good and the football are the best and the basketball and the volleyball  and track and i love my school cheerleaders and they dance team and prep squad
College Sophomore,5,this school i will be going to when i graduate high school this year because this is a good school for me to be a nurse  at and i will do good at this school and my cousin breanna coakley with to that school and i been wanted to go here for the longest
College Freshman,5,Well most of my classes are about 15-20 people and the professors are great. they are will to help everyone that needs help.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is great these people make you feel at home. The dorm i live in is great everything is as if you was to have your own apartment with no kitchen.
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at school has be great, its better than what i thought college would be like. This school is filled with people who love and care for not only their selves but others as well. I would most likely choose this school again because i love everything about this school."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a second year ,so my experience with being a college is amazing . my professors are amazing ,and they offer office hours so that in case I  come and ask for help . the college offer a great tutoring program for when I am struggling in a subject . they have amazing clubs for anyone to join . the meals are excellent ,and the dorms are very comfortable."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors and classes are great. The professors do care about what they teach and do care that the students completely understand everything. The classes are stressful sometimes but it's college so that is expected. The classes, I feel, are very average size unless it's an upper class and if there are few times to take it."
College Sophomore,5,"I believe for the degrees on campus, that there are many ways to get internships and future jobs from them. For upperclassmen, the school puts on an invent where future employment opputunities can be found."
College Sophomore,5,"Around campus there are button to press the quickly notify the police, these also give off loud noises so anyone is would be around you won't mess with you. The campus police are also right next to campus so the are easily obtainable and the frequently drive around campus. I do feel safer walking in a group, but at night if I am walking to/from the library I do feel scared and uneasy due to the fact that it is dark and I am alone."
College Freshman,5,We have a police station on campus. I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,I love my school. Everyone is very friendly and there is usually plenty to do around campus as well.
College Senior,5,"So what exactly is a Reddie? A Reddie is definitely not your normal mascot. it is a spirit that lives inside each student that has ever walked the campus of HSU. We pride ourselves with our unique spirit. ""Being a Reddie is much much more than athletics,"" Mary Jo Mann, Noted alumna and university historian, said ""It involves a level of pride that could never fit into a silly furry costume"". Mann, A 1979 graduate has been a proud advocate for Henderson by participating in the annual freshmen ""Pine Tree Speech"". The speech is held on the first Monday of the school year and is an invitation for all first-time students to become true Henderson state Reddies. ""Henderson state's music programs are one of the University's shining stars. In fact, many individuals first contact with Henderson is through our band camps, and they remember that experience as adults,"" President Jones Said"
College Senior,5,The Battle of the Rzvine is unlike any college football game. Because Henderson and Ouachita are literally across the street from each other and is the shortest road trip in football history. And is also recognized as the number 1 DII rivalry in the U.S.
College Freshman,5,I love the variety of courses they offer.
College Freshman,5,The university really cares about all of their students.
Freshman,4,"Coming from Hawaii and never being this Far East, I was surprised how nice Arkansas is. The students and teachers here are very polite and kind, and the programs seem to be well run."
Senior,4,"Henderson has been the subject of controversy in 2019, but it has world class scholars and professors along with a strong community and opportunities to better yourself. Everything else is irrelevant—the education and campus spirit is high quality."
Freshman,4,"My first time visiting Henderson, I imminently felt at home. The campus is beautiful and the staff is so friendly. Once I started college in the fall, I began to learn so many new things. The professors push you to the best you can be and expect you to give each class your full attention. Academics is a very important role to Henderson, and I feel confident in completing all four years there."
Niche User,4,"One thing that I loved about Henderson State, was mainly their integrity and culture! Henderson States culture, taught me alot about sticking together, being a family and overall pushing each other to be their best! It was overall, a fantastic experience, with welcome and love overwhelming the atmosphere. If you are looking for a place where you can call a new beginning, and home, Henderson State is the right place for you !"
Junior,4,"I've dreamed about attending Henderson State since I first received a letter from the choral director at the time about how he wanted me to audition for scholarship. And since coming here, I've never once thought about how I could have gone someplace else, because I feel like I belong here. I knew I wanted a small school, somewhere I would know where everything was and could easily find my place. And as soon as I arrived, I found my place in the music and theatre departments. I'm happy here. I feel at home here despite growing up three hours away. Henderson is a wonderful place to be at."
Junior,4,"The application process is fairly easy. The course plan can be difficult to understand and the advisors at some points are not helpful however, they are willing to send you to other people who can be of more help. The professors want to help you and are willing to work with you. The campus is large and can be complicated to navigate however, the staff is extremely friendly and is more than willing to help you find where you need to be. The buildings are clean and the campus is safe. The campus puts on many activities for the students."
Junior,4,"This will be the first semester that I, personally, attend this college but I know tons of students that go there. They say it is amazing in all things. I recently attended orientation on their campus and their faculty was beyond amazing and helpful."
Sophomore,4,Very nice people but does take hard work and the price is a little bit in the high range more than I expected.
Sophomore,4,Henderson is a nice univerisity where it can be easy to get to know your professors and be involved on campus. The food is most of the time all around good.
Freshman,4,"Wonderful campus, great opportunity with a variety of future career development ,  great professional teachers , staff, local campus with easy access to school, grocery stores,"
Sophomore,4,I would like to see better food in the dining hall and a better maintenance crew. Freshman year my window broke in August and after filling out multiple requests it was never fixed. I can walk past my old window and see the duct tape I put there to temporatily fix it.
Freshman,4,Overall Henderson is ok. Not too much partying as the year goes on but it’ll be just fine as far as education and having someone you can ask for help when it comes to anything .
Freshman,4,"Henderson State is a college for many folks. They harbor a wide variety of programs and tailor classes for their students. Although the campus may seem small, students and staff have an enormous personality. There is no spirit like Reddie Spirit."
Junior,4,"Henderson tries to make everyone feel welcome and comfortable. They understand what incoming freshmen are feeling and going through. I appreciated that they go above and beyond to show people around and answer their questions. The campus is beautiful and is constantly being cleaned up and taken care of. Some of the building around campus need to be updated and also I feel like with the growing student population the library needs to be larger. Yes, there are computer labs in most building but the library is one of the central buildings on campus and it is lacking a bit. Saying that, the atmosphere of the college makes up for the few things that need to be updated. Go Reddies!"
Senior,4,"The university show both care of the student and their progress through their college career. They are transparent about the multitude of resources available to their students, and they inform their students on every significance update. I felt important in the university for their conversations with the student body."
Sophomore,4,"This is a very good school, but the only downside is there is nothing around to do the school. I have fun here and there are very good teachers."
Alum,4,I loved how friendly the professors where. They were always available to help and were very supportive. The atmosphere was great and the college offered many student activities to socialize with fellow students.
Niche User,4,"Well, I haven't gotten to actually be a student yet. But Fall 2018. I will be a Freshman. I am very excited! You see, I have dreamed of going to Henderson since I was in the 9th grade. It is honestly my dream school. I went on a tour and instantly fell in love. Being there feels like being at home. If you even remotely interested in attending Henderson, I suggest you take a tour right away! You will not regret it. It is amazing, everyone is so welcoming and helpful! They are very considerate, and will be more than happy to help you in any way they can!"
Freshman,4,Henderson offers awesome classes as well as professors. The campus living is a little different. You either get the best or the worst. The food on campus is great they offer a huge variety as well.
Freshman,4,"Good student support, professors were kind and helpful, costs were very reasonable but too many fees for things I won't use.  Campus resources were excellent."
Sophomore,4,"Henderson State University is a great place to learn, with smaller class sizes and very friendly staff members. I've always been comfortable in my housing, and the campus always looks very nice. 

If there was anything I would change, it would be to have more activities that aren't geared mostly towards greek life."
Sophomore,4,"I like Henderson because it is exactly like my hometown.. everyone knows everybody. I joined a sorority so I made lots of friends. It is an overall great school for people who don't wanna be overwhelmed with people. The class sizes are like a high school size which I loved. But, I would like to see more activities happening around campus so the freshman could experience different things. I would also like to see a variety of food places on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Henderson is a very good school, the people here are really down to earth and all the professors expect u to do is come to class and do your work and you will pass!!"
Junior,4,I love Henderson! I love the English department but wish the faculty overseeing residence life and financial aid were more friendly and personable!
Sophomore,4,"The campus is pretty, the teachers are nice and helpful, but my dorm was a little on the dirtier side."
Junior,4,Henderson University makes college convenient. Not only do they have a campus in Arkadelphia but they also offer certain degree plans in Hot springs at the downtown Landmark building. This makes it easier for some students to attend a university and obtain their bachelor's degree. The only thing I would wish to see change would be better communication with transfer students. There were some issue with transferring my credits and making a schedule but it was all worked out!
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part about Henderson is its size and its location. Not too far from home so I am able to drive back and forth for work. The campus size is not huge but is not tiny either. There are plenty of resources here to help you succeed including the writing center, the resource center, mentors and tutors."
Freshman,4,I've had a fun experience here at Henderson. I like going to frat parties and socializing with my friends but I also stay focused on my education. I honestly wouldn't change a thing .
Senior,4,"Henderson is a great place to get an education! All my professors are extremely helpful because they care about student success. Staff, faculty and students are friendly. Nice atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,my career of school i am trying to be a nurse and be a Rn to and i and i love my school so much
College Sophomore,4,the professors and me going to get along really good and i am going to do all they work and turn it in at all times and i am going to love all my classes
College Sophomore,4,i think the safe way to live on campus is to have security on campus at all times if people try to come to kidnapped people
College Sophomore,4,what's like to live on campus is i would like to experiences that and i would love to live on campus and have a room mate and i would clean my room up everyday
College Sophomore,4,the greek life of my school is they are the best and i love my school so much and  they mean the world to me
College Freshman,4,"I would say that everything is great on campus, you have different varieties of things that you could choose from."
College Freshman,4,there is someone on call every night if anything is to every go wrong
College Freshman,4,There are different Fraternities and sororities on campus. Most of them are friendly and some act as if they are better than others but i guess that's apart of there Greek life. They have a couple of Greek house such as Omega Phi and others
College Freshman,4,So far the athletics are great. Its alot of school spirit and they tend to show it everyday.
College Freshman,4,i like the class size - good teacher to student ratio
College Freshman,4,they have placement services for interns and a large alumni network
College Freshman,4,the campus police are easilyaccessed and on campus
College Freshman,4,"very easy to move in,  close to rec center and all classes and caf,"
College Freshman,4,"good student involvement, athletes help students on move in day, winning football program"
College Freshman,4,"smaller class size, professors go the extra mile to help"
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not in any athletics ,but in my opinion they are really good."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The teachers are great and provide interesting topics in each of their fields of study. They are passionate and willing to help during their office hours and even after sometimes. They have detailed knowledge into relevant, recent research.  I'm glad to have had the professors I have. It was a wonderful opportunity."
College Freshman,4,The classes are great they are small with i like so i can actually learn a lot more.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,there is very good security on campus; it is pretty easy to reach help if needed
College Freshman,4,i was able o get the floor that i wanted and thank god theres an elevator
College Freshman,4,"the school is small enough to not be intimidating, and its hard to get lost in the numbers"
College Sophomore,4,"There are choice of housing around campus, some better than others. But based on needs and wants you can definitely find the right one for you. Smith and Newberry, the oldest housing, definitely need improvements but overall they are good. Others such as the Uni and East/West are new and improved but occasionally have their hiccups because of that reason. Though the cleanliness can be better in all housing, I think if all residents worked to keep things neat and fixed then every Hall on campus would be great choices."
College Sophomore,4,"The teams are pretty strong. I, for one, have not been to a lot of games but the ones I have gone to are really great. The fans are supportive and the school spirit is obvious, especially against ""the school across the street"" Ouachita Baptist University. The facilities work great for everyone on campus, even the nonathletic people. Though the sports is amazing, I do believe that, like most school, the athletics mean more than other groups. But Henderson make sure to publicize other groups as well."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience for Henderson State University is that they are very welcoming and caring. No matter where you came from or who you are the people here welcome you with open arms. They want everyones experience here to be as great as it can be. They also put on great, informational, and fun invents so that Freshman can get to know other people and have a chance to get to know the school. Most professors here honestly care about their students. If you have any questions or want help they are always there. Henderson, not only is a great sized school for me, but the beautiful, caring environment and people here would always cause me to choose this school as my college."
College Freshman,4,"Overall my experience at school has been really good.  It is a small school so it's easier to get to know people and professors.  Also, the teachers do make an effort to make themselves reachable.  One of the things I do not like is that some teachers are very passionate and driven to put that into their students but others not so much."
College Freshman,4,I personally feel safe on campus. I sometimes let my guard down.
College Freshman,4,The professors on this campus are great. They help you a lot. They understand you with you problems.
College Freshman,4,A degree from this school will take you a long way.
College Freshman,4,Greek life on campus throw really good parties if you`re into that. If you aren`t into that it won`t be a problem. They won`t treat you any different.
College Freshman,4,Athletics are pretty good at my school. Last year we beat OBU in the Battle of the Ravine
College Freshman,2,In reality Greek life is a part of the school but they are not active in anyway that is of any consequence that it is difficult to distinguish them from the non-greek.  The only time I have ever been able to distinguish the greeks from the non-greeks is when the sororities or fraternities wear t-shirts with their names on them or they all decide to dress alike in a similar fashion or style.
College Junior,2,Very few fraternities on campus.
College Senior,2,"There are several good things but lately those good things have gotten bad, and the bad has gotten worse.  It seems like the administration doesn't care about students."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life was cool my first year, but the new people over the organizations on campus seem to want to get rid of them."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not really go out much, but based on my friends' comments, most parties will get shutdown."
College Sophomore,2,There's policies in place but not really enforced
College Sophomore,2,"Not great at all, but livable. Nothing to do in this town besides go to Walmart"
College Sophomore,2,it's definitely not the greatest which is why i choose to live off campus
College Freshman,2,There are only like 4 places to eat that are within a few miles of the school.
College Freshman,2,There is no form of drug safety on campus. The campus police are more concerned with parking passes than they are underage drinking or drugs on campus. Most of the professors don't even notice if their students come into class hungover or still high from the Thirsty Thursday events the night before.
College Freshman,2,Off campus restaurants in Arkadelphia do not taste very well.
College Junior,2,very very little parking. have to walk from building to building and closest is about 1/4 mile from dorm
College Freshman,2,I wished my school focused more on Greek life.
College Junior,2,Not a good selection of off campus dining
College Junior,2,You have to provide your own housing
College Freshman,2,We need more food options.
College Freshman,2,we have off campus apartments but they are gross.
College Student,2,"The library has plenty of computers to use. Now when it comes to the wireless internet, well its bad. Sometimes it connects or it kicks you off and some people in the dorm halls are not able to receive wi-fi in their rooms."
College Senior,2,"Until about a year ago, this was a dry county.  So there are three bars.  A country club bar, a sports bar/restuarant, and a restaurant trying to be a beach-themed bar (they have kareoke).  Your best option for enjoying an evening out is finding a bonfire somewhere in the woods.  That is common."
College Senior,2,"For campus housing, you have two options.  A typical dorm (they try to keep the bugs and leaks to a minimum) or the University Apartments ($800/month for the tiny one).  The apartments are beautiful, awesome, but I'm struggling just to pay for classes."
College Senior,2,"So far our football team has gone undefeated.  We also have a rivalry with the school across the highway, OBU.  People get really into the football games and Battle of the Ravine (the game we play against OBU) is like its own little holiday.  There's going to be rides and games and food.  I'm pretty excited."
College Senior,2,"The financial aid department didn't seem to eager to help me.  They made me do all the real work where all they had to do was approve it.  I also did not receive all the aid I was eligible for.  The student loans I received were about $1000 short of what the FAFSA said I could get, which made it impossible for me to get books.  Good incentive to attend class though."
College Senior,2,They're a little behind on somethings.  I have a work-study position in the maintenance department so I know that they are trying.  Right now they just have limited man power.  The air conditioning can be a little spotty.  
College Senior,2,"McDonald's, Sonic, Subway, a couple Mexican places"
College Freshman,2,You mostly see people riding with each other. Buses and trains are not very convenient for students here on campus.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid for me is a big problem because it seems like they don't want to work with me so I can pay off my tuition so applying for scholarships is a big help if I am awarded because it will take a lot of stress off of me.
College Freshman,2,I don't live in the same town as my college but I would say that the houses and apartments surrounding campus is excellent for students.
College Junior,2,"Hard to find a parking place.  Penalty is 20.00 and that is steep in my opinion.  Our parking passes for the whole year are only 30.00.  I feel the violation should be 5.00.  Most college kids don't have that kind of money to pay. That could be what some kids get for the week, in some instances."
College Junior,2,Adding Chick filet helped.  Need lighter options in the beautiful cafeteria... i.e. the salad bar does not have LIGHT dressing. Need healthier foods.... 
College Junior,2,The desks are entirely too small for today's student.  They are almost like elementary desks.
College Junior,2,Arkadelphia is a small town with a small town atomosphere.
College Student,2,"If you are a man and don't have an 'in' into the East or West dorm, you have to live in Newberry Hall.  Newberry is not convenient to anything and you pretty much have to drive to campus if it's a rainy day (and you won't find a place to park).  Newberry is dirty and wifi access is terrible.  I'm pretty sure the same 'substance' has been sitting in one of the toilets on the 8th floor for 2 weeks."
College Sophomore,2,Henderson's food scene has declined a little since we got the new dinning hall. I have personally talked to someone about this and know that the Caddo food will be improving soon.
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman I thought parking was just horrible. Being at HSU as a junior you have learned where else to park, but those parking spots come with a not always so nice walking distance. There are enough parking spots, but you will not always get the good and close ones so it doesn't help in your favor being lazy."
College Sophomore,2,"It rains a lot there, but classes rarely got cancelled. There wasn't a problem with the distance between the dorms and classrooms because our university is small. But, once the weather was good, everybody enjoyed it."
College Sophomore,2,Our school doesn't put a lot of money into Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"It's in a small town with a few ""mom and pop"" joints that are good. Definitely nothing fancy."
College Junior,2,They built a new cafeteria that I have yet to experience.  The school may as well be owned by Aramark.  I feel like the main goal is to make a buck and there's not really any thought to the student's health.
College Junior,2,"There Are Two Races, Basically – There are a few international students, but generally it's Black and White."
College Sophomore,2,"Arkedelphia is a small town, with few options when it comes to off campus living, and when you can find it it's usually expensive and not well kept. However, most apartments are close to campus, and landlords seem to be agreeable about fixing problems."
Senior,1,"The city of Arkadelphia is depressing. Unless you are in sports or greek life, you will find yourself in your room doing nothing when you aren’t in class."
College Sophomore,1,The bathrooms are nasty the beds are little
College Sophomore,1,Smith and Newberry Hall are THE WORST!
College Junior,1,"They have no assitance for transportation, but are good about allowing you to be able to park on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Arkansas weather is bipolar to say the least. One day it snows, one day it is 68 degrees. Weather is pretty unpredictable."
College Sophomore,1,couldn't get any because i'm a grad student starting in the spring
College Freshman,1,Ticketing and fines are to expensive.
College Freshman,1,I am having alot of trouble with my financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"they lost my papers multiple times, which was a real headache"
College Student,1,"Parking is terrible.  If you get a ticket, you have 2 weeks to pay or they add it to your bill at 100%.  That's right, a $10 ticket will cost you $20 if it's not paid in 2 weeks.  A poor struggling college student gets a 100% ""upcharge"" for not having the money within 2 weeks."
College Sophomore,1,The parking is a nightmare on campus. We even gained 2 parking lots over the summer and it is worse this year than it was last year. We have even lost some students.
College Sophomore,1,The freshman dorms aren't good at all. The honors dorms are nice though.
College Sophomore,1,The food is there and is $5 per meal if prepaid.  The food is not amazing.  The cafeteria closes at 7:30 on week nights and 6:30 on weekends.
College Freshman,1,We don't have any public transportation at Henderson State. I think we should have some type of transportation at night just to make sure students get to there rooms safely.
College Sophomore,1,"The food servered the caddo is not too good, i know students that will refuse to eat in the caddo and will go else where to get something to eat."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is not very good in my opinion.  I never know what food is served in the main line, because it is all weird stuff that us college kids do not typically eat.  The campus dining needs more variety in my opinion.  We pay a lot of money to eat there to eat the same basic meal every time."
College Sophomore,1,"There is very little parking space on campus.  You tend to have to walk a good ways to get to your classroom, because there are not many parking lots anymore.  The cops are very good about giving tickets if someone is parked somewhere illegally which is good.  The price of your permit is unreal.  It isn't cheap to have a car on campus per year."
College Freshman,1,"The caddo is horrible, hopefully when they get the new one built it will be better, but I highly doubt it."
College Freshman,1,Football and Mens basketball overshadows every other sport. No one really goes to many others
College Junior,1,The parking has gotten better but it still lacks space.

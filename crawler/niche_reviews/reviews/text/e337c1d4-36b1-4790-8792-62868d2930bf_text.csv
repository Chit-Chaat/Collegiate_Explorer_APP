Alum,5,"This was a wonderful experience. I was able to learn in depth in my field of study, make incredible-lifelong friends, and become prepared for the workplace."
Freshman,5,"Asbury University has been exceptional in all areas! Academics, relationships, schoolwork, and communication are all centered around growing in our knowledge and faith. The professors and even other school staff are never hesitant to reach out and check on the students. I highly recommend this University for everyone who is eager to grow and learn in a compassionate community."
Sophomore,5,I applied and received almost immediate response with information about the university and what they were about.
Junior,5,The couunity life is wonderful. You really feel like you are part of a family.  I have made friends that I know I will keep for life.
Niche User,5,"I have spent several years taking part in Asbury's ImpactU summer camp, which was very beneficial to my growth as an actor and an editor. I enjoyed the professors that I had, and still keep in contact with my friends that go there now!"
Alum,5,"The people is what makes Asbury great. I met so many great friends there, learned a lot, and had a blast. It's such a great, supportive community. The professors there really care about their students. It's located in a beautiful, small, church town. Many fun rural things to do nearby. And if you like big cities, Lexington KY is only about a 20-30 minute drive. I couldn't recommend it more highly if you're looking for a good, Christian, private education."
Junior,5,"The professors truly care about their students. It is a very personalized education and environment. They give you every possible pathway to success. Whether that is the free tutoring or free counseling, there is little room for any student to fail in or outside the classroom."
Niche User,5,"I have grown up around Asbury, and my father is an alum. I have loved all of the experiences I have been blessed with, as a teen, by being involved with the many things that Asbury is."
Niche User,5,"Recently, I embarked on a visit to Asbury University and the experience was wonderful. The admissions office, students, professors, and others are very welcoming and friendly. The Christian atmosphere is present and very well known throughout the community. Would certainly recommend this school to anyone looking for a college."
Sophomore,5,I am an online student just starting Asbury and I feel confident that I will like this school. I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Social Work and hope to find work there after.
Senior,5,"My time here at Asbury has without a doubt been instrumental in shaping me into who I am today. Not only does Asbury challenge students intellectually but they emphasize spiritual growth as well. The teachers and students create an environment that is the embodiment of community. Teachers invest in their students and take the time to get to know us on a more personal level. Students are personable and genuinely want to get to know others. As for what I would like to see change, the hardest part about college here is not having enough time to invest in more people. Between the commitments that come with being a college student and the large number of people you want to get to know, there is not enough time in the day. This is not necessarily a problem, rather it is a struggle that I have come across during my time here. Overall, Asbury’s foundation in Christian morals and values paired with an excellent education and tremendous community have created a place in which I can call home."
Junior,5,Asbury is a great place to safely find yourself. It is a great place to find who you are in your spirituality. Professors are the bread and butter of this campus because they care about you as people as well as students. They invest in you on a spiritual and emotional level as well as an academic level. Great school 10/10 would recommend.
Junior,5,"I have loved my time at Asbury. I have been pushed academically, learned professional skills, made lifelong friends, and most importantly- gained a concept of what is most important for me to pursue in my life. Asbury is small, and does not always have as many funds to throw around as larger schools, but my professors care so much to see me grow and think critically."
Sophomore,5,"One of my favorite aspects of Asbury is the community here. Through Asbury, God has provided me with a diverse group of friends who love me deeply, encourage me to think about the world in different ways, and ask me to become more like Christ. 
I also love the faculty here. Small classes make it possible to get to know each of your professors and for them to know you by ame as well."
Senior,5,Asbury is a great place to be. The academic aspect of Asbury is incredible and the professors are extremely helpful. Asbury's community is extremely welcoming. Throughout my 4 years at Asbury I have never had a bad experience. Throughout my fours years I've been challenged to think critically and definitely expand my way of thinking and adapt to many new great ideas.
Graduate Student,5,This was the absolute best experience! The staff and professors are there to help you academically and spiritually. I would not have chosen any other college for my Bachelors degree. The people that I have met are now apart of my family and friends!
Sophomore,5,"When I started out at Asbury, I was a little nervous going in because I only knew a couple people coming in with me. Once I arrived, I met not only some of my closest friends, but I had faculty around me that supported me in both my academics and my faith. I know that I can count on my professors and other faculty that I have relationships with if I need them for anything. Some of them have welcomed me into their homes, and some of them will answer my questions at 10 o' clock at night. I truly believe that I would not have the same experience if I had gone somewhere else."
Senior,5,"As soon as I came to campus I felt at home. Faculty and staff are welcoming and friendly. There is an atmosphere of true, genuine care for students and for the surrounding community. Professors know students by name and many times I have been asked  what is going on in my life. I definitely feel cared for and well prepared academically."
Freshman,5,"Asbury is very intentional in that it seeks out the incoming students to ensure they are included in the community. I highly recommend this college because it has provided an extremely welcoming, growing, bonding, and friendly experience."
Sophomore,5,"I love Asbury. The community here is just awesome. The people are very friendly, and the education is amazing, just great professors."
Sophomore,5,"Asbury University does not have the most educational resources, but it does provide students with many opportunities to receive direct assistance from professors academically and spiritually."
Junior,5,"Asbury is a great School that offers great opportunities for spiritual, academic, and personal growth. Its atmosphere makes you feel at home."
Freshman,5,"The chapel services are almost always engaging, the people tend to be very accepting and helping. The dorms could use a bit of a renovation but they are decently nice."
Freshman,5,Asbury University is a very diverse school! We have so many different cultures on campus we are always learning. The community is great and the people are so nice!
Senior,5,"I've never felt so at home, accepted, and free to be myself. Asbury not only challenges students with class work intellectually, Asbury also teaches students to think critically about the meaning of life and one's own beliefs. It guided me through the best and hardest of times. I will miss it. I will never regret attending all four years. My only regret will be taking it for granted in year. 
I've made lifelong friends with peers and professors. Almost all of my professors (30 out of 33) were people I could ask to be a mentor about deep issues I was dealing with.  great networking that helps to find jobs after school! Already working full-time the summer after graduation thanks to Asbury networking. I can't say enough about how great Asbury is. God is a part of Asbury and will be close to anyone trying to find him while you go to school here. I've grown spiritually while attending and intellectually. There are school parties almost every weekend and fun things/ events to go to."
Freshman,5,"I loved my Freshman year at Asbury -  small class ratio, size of the campus, and ease of getting around. The Christian atmosphere  presented students with options for friendship, music involvement, peer counseling and missions work.  
  The equine program was professionally instructed.   Equine Management is my minor.  My major is Media Communication.  Great opportunities assisting with student made films.
  Socially,  activities planned throughout the year - from Orientation Week mixers, cultural fair, themed party nights, to Freshman Formal, Jr. Sr. dance, plays, musicals, concerts, and the Highbridge Film Festival.
  There were a few negatives with regard to my Freshman year:  roommate/dorm, AP/Dual Enrollment credit, both of which were easily and quickly resolved, due to the personal size of the campus.  Not much is opened on Sundays in Wilmore, KY.  Nicholasville and Lexington are so close, I was always able to get to where I needed for what I needed."
Freshman,5,"There are specifically 2 things I love most about Asbury University. First and foremost I love how everything is centered around my faith - from my college sport to my school lessons. The second thing I love is the community aspect. Everyone is so kind and loving and everyone is always outside playing games or talking or picnicking. The only thing that could change is the food options in the cafeteria. Other than that, Asbury is a wonderful college."
Sophomore,5,"Asbury is a Christ-centered school with the most caring and loving community I have ever been involved in. As a student, I am blessed to have professors and faculty who invest in me as a whole person, not just my academics."
Alum,5,"Great school for students interested in bettering themselves and continuing their walk with God. I loved the community of friends and professors I built while I was there. I am proud to have a unique, amazing experience at Asbury."
College Freshman,5,It is very nice to live on campus and be close to where you would need to go. The dorms are clean and although slightly small is it cozy and nice to decorate. The cost is slightly high but it is expected being such nice dorms. The housing process was easy and the atmosphere is nice. Everything is very homey in the dorms and I honestly do miss it when I go back to my real home.
College Freshman,5,"Asbury is a wonderful school full of fellowship and smiling faces. This school makes me feel so welcome and safe, and I am very happy with my decision. I would most definitely choose Asbury again, due to the fact that the professors are caring, the staff is genuine, and the students are so reassuring and helpful! My favorite aspect of Asbury would be my liberal arts class, because it opens up a whole bunch of new topics and the professor is by far my favorite. She is so personable and approachable and happy. Our school is unique in the sense that it sincerely is a dry campus, and there are no parties unless they are school sponsored. No one goes against the rules and everything is clean fun. The special events that Asbury offers are awesome as well, whether it be a cook out and worshiping at midnight. I love this school and am so glad I get to be a part of the community."
College Sophomore,5,The whole academic view and foundations of this school is amazing and never seems to fail.
College Sophomore,5,It has been a blessing to be able to learn and be a part of this school and community. If I could choice a different direction to go in my higher education I would still pick Asbury. The community life makes Asbury the best in the area in my opinion. Its small and close nit.
College Senior,5,"The courses offered can at times be limited, but the quality of the courses offered and the professors at the school make up for it."
College Senior,5,I have always felt one hundred percent secure on campus at Asbury.
College Senior,5,Asbury University is a quality school full of faculty and staff who genuinely care.
College Junior,5,I never hear about anyone doing drugs at my school.
College Junior,5,"My overall experience has been wonderful. The teachers and my class mates are helpful and encouraging. The classes are challenging at times, but that is good because I think it is important to be stretched."
College Junior,5,The school is very intentional about safety. I feel completely safe walking around campus by myself.
College Junior,5,Living on campus is great. It makes for short trips to classes and the community you get while living in a dorm is fantastic. The hall's do different events and hang out often. It's a very encouraging atmosphere.
College Sophomore,5,"Wilmore has some drug dealers, but the campus is safe. Security is always willing to come get you if you ever feel unsafe and there is no alcohol on campus, it's not allowed. I have never heard of fights breaking out or violence of any kind on campus."
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are always accommodating. They are great and know what they are talking about hands down.
College Freshman,5,"Asbury is an amazing school!  I am so excited to be going there.  They have a top of the line Equine studies program, the campus is beautiful, I love the location, and I am really excited about the genuine community on campus.  The school seems very Christ-centered and has some really neat programs.  I would pick Asbury all over again because of the quality of the classes in my field of interest, the wonderful fellowship with students and professors, and the awesome campus!"
College Freshman,5,At first never wanted to come here but love it now
College Senior,5,"I have never felt unsafe on campus. There are security officers who patrol campus, and the city of Wilmore is incredibly safe and welcoming to students. The campus is right next to the police and fire department."
College Senior,5,The quality of alumni network is AMAZING. I have an alumni who is my mentor who has helped with getting me internships and research opportunities. It is by far the most beneficial part. Professors actually know you so they can write you real letters of recommendation. The career and calling center is so helpful in finding opportunities and preparing you for your career.
College Senior,5,"Class sizes are perfect. They are small enough that the professor knows your name and cares about your success but large enough that there is a tutor for virtually every class. The professors are top quality and invite students to their houses often for community and fellowship. The class styles are often either lecture or discussion, which has been very beneficial for me. The variety of courses offered is not too extensive, but I have not regretted any of the classes I've taken."
College Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my experience in on-campus living. My hall and it's community was irreplaceable in my life. The cost is amazing, it is actually a great deal to live on campus. The dorm rooms could be bigger, but the bathrooms are so nice and cleaned daily."
College Senior,5,"My professors are caring, responsive, and genuinely want me to succeed. There is a general atmosphere of spiritual vitality and academic excellence on campus, and the community I have received at Asbury is irreplaceable."
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are very good. All of them are very into what they do, and every single one of them cares about the students and our success."
College Freshman,5,"I am an education student, and the program has us working in schools in our first year! Also, our center for career and services is very good and present."
College Freshman,5,My hall is amazing and I really really like my dorm. My roommate is cool and so are the guys on my hall.
College Freshman,5,"I love college. It is so much better than high school. Yes, classes are much more difficult, but everything else is majorly improved. My hall is outstanding, intermurals are a blast, and I just really enjoy it. My hall is definitely the best part. We are all very close, and can talk about anything and everything. Plus, my choir is going to England to be a resident choir in a cathedral! How neat is that?"
College Junior,5,The lack of Greek life is awesome! There is no unnecessary division that's set up by the school and that helps the community atmosphere.
College Sophomore,5,There is just a wonderful community at Asbury. Classes are hard but not too hard & I'm extremely happy I'm here!
College Junior,5,"My school is the best there is. It is currently ranked #1 in the south. My campus has the best family atmosphere, there is always a friendly face, no matter where you go. Adjusting to campus life as a freshman was made easy by our orientation groups and the friends made during those first few weeks are ones that have stayed together. The academics at my school are also fantastic. Professors are always willing to listen and to help guide you with anything you may need. They don't only want to be your professor, they want to be your friend as well. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat."
College Freshman,5,"This is a very community based college. You are invited to the faculty's house! There is a modest dress code, especially for chapel."
College Freshman,5,"It's more suburban like, but there is the Fayette Mall, book stores, movie theaters, and just across the street there are loads of little shops and stores (flowers, dollar store, subway, antiques)."
College Freshman,5,"Parties are not really parties here, more like get-togethers. But the people are great and usually school events have free food. The student centers can be reserved for movie or game nights for a certain group of people."
College Freshman,5,People are extremely friendly. Faculty and staff care about the students and seek to guide them toward success. There multiple opportunities to get involved in service and leadership. The dorms are comfortable and dorm life is relaxed. I honestly have no complaints. Life is good.
Alum,4,It was great! The professors communicate well and genuinely care about their students and course content.
Alum,4,"One of the best things about Asbury is the small class sizes and committed professors. The professors are interested in investing in your life, and helping you achieve your best - beyond just the academics. Small classes mean one-on-on assistance and great discussions!"
Junior,4,"I only took one class online and it was relatively simple, other than the fact that it was only 9 weeks long and I was required to do an extreme amount of reading for it."
Sophomore,4,"Asbury Is a great university, with an experience that you cannot find everywhere. What I liked most is the relationships I have build. One thing I would like to see change is open dorms throughout the week."
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, the second half of my second semester was online. It was on a simple format and for the most part the work was very accomodable."
Sophomore,4,"Great Christian school, professors are helpful and relational. Easy to use online tools for classes and are punctual."
Alum,4,"Asbury is a great school! The academics are great and professors really care about you. There's not always a lot to do in the area if you don't have a car but overall, it's a great school."
Freshman,4,It's starting to feel like home.  Everyone is kind and tries to keep you involved.  The professors all seem engaged and the campus is small enough to be wherever you need to be.
Sophomore,4,"Inclusive community, opportunities for quality time with professors, beautiful campus, small classroom size and lots of things to do to keep busy around campus by getting involved!"
Niche User,4,"Asbury offers a unique experience through a heavily involved community, including clubs as well as several faith-asked opportunities. Being connected here allows students to then impact the world the same way they were impacted here."
Graduate Student,4,"Great school in a nice rural area. If you're looking for a small faith-based university with great professors who will challenge you, you'll find Asbury fits the bill- and doesn't break the bank!"
Junior,4,Asbury is all about what you make it. The academics and spirituality are amazing to experience on a college campus. The increased attention from professors due to smaller class sizes is crucial to the great academic atmosphere. Your personal experience for student and dorm life is really dependent on how much you are willing to put in.
Junior,4,Asbury has allowed me to grow both academically and spiritually. The small school atmosphere lets me have professional relationships with my professors. Asbury is an ever changing campus that continues to grow.
Sophomore,4,"I love the emphasis on spiritual growth that both the students ad the faculty have, and the way professors really work to invest in their students. The overall vibe of the students here are very open and friendly. Academically it is challenging but not discouraging."
Senior,4,I love everything about Asbury University. I am an Equine Major and their Equine department is amazing. I love being apart of a small school and being surrounded by Christians who share my faith.
Sophomore,4,The only downside of Asbury is the drawbacks that come with small schools like not a lot of food options and not as modern features.
Senior,4,I love the community and the people at Asbury. It has helped me grow in multiple aspects of my life.
Sophomore,4,"Asbury is a great university, everybody is friendly, and the professors and staff are very accommodating. The campus is gorgeous; I feel like at home on Asbury's campus. Chapel is such a great experience and the worship bands are wonderful."
Freshman,4,Asbury is a small college and the community is amazing! Some rules should change and the location is not so great though.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Asbury for the most part. It's a safe campus, the professors are invested in your success (they will help you achieve any goal you have) and the study body is just as encouraging.  There are some rules Asbury enforces that aren't always agreeable, and some of their views can be contradictory. But overall, Asbury is a fantastic school and I'm really glad I've attended for as long as I have"
Freshman,4,"Asbury University offers an outstanding atmosphere and sense of security due to the community it withholds. Asbury's faculty pushes the students to think of their values in faith and others when applying their education in everyday life. Asbury teaches and presents lessons that are beyond just academic but are also of wisdom. The close community of Asbury can at times be intimidating to people who are not sound in their faith or themselves. However, Asbury provides the experiences and guidance to help students find themselves, and it challenges the students to explore and strengthen their faith. Asbury offers a great education and experience. The professors are very intelligent and have lots of experience in their fields."
Sophomore,4,The people are friendly and there is always something going on on campus. Great place to get a quality education!
Freshman,4,"Asbury is a very excellent school, I have learned a lot in the short time I have been there and it is very easy to begin school there even if you have been out of high school for a while."
Junior,4,"I has a great atmosphere, it has Southern charm and a very homey feel.  There Equine program, although not the best academically truly is one of the best! they get to know you, you arnt just another student passing through they want to help you succeed and do everything possible to make that happen. The equine program has many different opportunities for you to take part in and really help you once it comes close to graduating to make sure you find and job when you leave"
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at Asbury, but I am already liking it because of the community and just how much the students here are very friendly. Therefore,  even though I am an introvert and i dont have many friends, I am still never eating by myself  or hanging out in my room all the time. The professors are also willing to sacrifice their time to students who need help with school work, so you never have to stress about it. I also like like my dorm because there are so many unique people that are so different from you and you get to share so many stories and meet other people from different grades."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics seem to be a big part of Asbury, but not everything revolves around them. I believe people, seemingly professors are impressed by them. I would love to be a student athlete, but that is almost impossible while working a full time job and having 17 credit hours. As far as I am told our teams perform well, and I have seen that our students largely support them. Our school spirit is high, with students who dress up and everything, and the facilities are very nice. They are advanced and are welcome to all students. Student athletes are required to sit at the front of the class and keep up a good grade point average. I will eventually be a student athlete, and I am excited for the day that I do."
College Sophomore,4,The plan for after graduation is very important and always talked about and reviewed for all students and staff.
College Sophomore,4,This campus feels very safe and secure for all genders.
College Sophomore,4,Its a great environment within the housing. It feels very homey and comfortable.
College Sophomore,4,Sporting events are always a fun and supporting time from and for all the students that play. Sports are apart of this small community as well which makes them so important.
College Senior,4,"I have not been involved in the career center at Asbury, but what I have heard it is very accommodating."
College Senior,4,"There are not as many options as would be like, but the options there are are quality."
College Junior,4,Students are pushed to excel and the Professors are there to challenge and help.
College Junior,4,Asbury has a very diverse campus with people from various parts of the world.
College Junior,4,"Generally, as far as I know, employers love Asbury students. Most of the degrees are very valuable and the students are hard workers."
College Junior,4,"My school has been an exceptional experience so far. It's a small school and the teachers genuinely care for the students and want to help in any way possible. The campus is lovely, especially in the fall and there are many nearby places for hiking and doing other adventurous activities. The community aspect is wonderful. The people are friendly and the school has many activities during the semester to keep one connected. The school is very intentional about having a solid community which is one of my favorite aspects. There are also many wonderful opportunities available that help in expanding one's horizons."
College Sophomore,4,"For girls, Glide-Crawford (GC) is pretty and the hallways are large with a laundry room of about 3 washers and dryers on each floor, but it's old and the walls could use a makeover. Kresge is also old with problems with the wiring and 5 washers and dryers for the whole dorm, but you have 2 kitchens and bathtubs on each floor and for every two rooms there is your own bathroom. Also in Kresge, eight rooms are attached to a unit, an easy relocation for studying and hanging out equipped with tables, chars, and couches."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors remember your name and they're great. They are interested in you as a person as much as they are interested in you as a student. This school is willing to take care of you. However, tuition is high and you must complete a cross-cultural requirement that is very stressful and a lot of work to complete."
College Sophomore,4,I love living in the dorm and the community it creates.
College Freshman,4,could use a update but overall its great
College Freshman,4,school spirit could be better
College Senior,4,"Non-athlete student involvement is often lacking, but many students participate in intramurals and go to the athletic facilities."
College Sophomore,4,The community that Asbury provides makes it the perfect place to go to school.
College Freshman,4,"Our school is relatively small, so a large group of students are involved in sports. Another large group does intermurals. Support for the varsity teams is also pretty good, especially basketball."
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed getting to know my teammates on the volleyball team. We have created memories with each other that I will cherish forever. Not very many people attend our games though, soccer is the main sport that student focus on at Asbury."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy attending chapel three times per week. There are always new guest speakers and they keep you attentive and capable of comprehending the lesson. I love how small the school is, not because I have short walks to class but the fact that my professors care about me and know me personally is extremely important to me. I also enjoy the community aspect that is created from this school, everyone knows everyone. Playing the sport I love is also a plus at this school. I have made close friends on the volleyball team and cherish the memories that w=I have made thus far with them. My roommate keeps me accountable and I trust her with y deepest darkest secrets, we did know each other prior to attending though."
College Junior,4,"Campus housing may not have the newest amenities or bonuses, but it is not particularly annoying. What stands out about housing is encouraging good dorm relationships that have, so far, been some of the most valuable ones I've had."
College Junior,4,"Asbury University may have its quirks, but in one semester it has already become a home for me. What sets it apart is a great community that extends beyond the study body and to the faculty, it is truly a school where everyone feels like family."
College Junior,4,A piano in the men's dorm would be great. There is one in each of the female dorms.
College Junior,4,I may not be able to attend this coming semester because of funds. This is why I am entering this survey.
College Freshman,4,"The professors and administration is very involved in the community in the student life and looks out for the interest of each student they meet. The food services are mediocre for students with food allergies, but the staff at the head of running the cafeteria and bistro are very open to comments and suggestions to anything they can do to possibly improve the experience of the students. The school is very unique considering the emphasis on community and the liberal arts program they have brought in with the Christian aspect of their education. The school, despite its religious beliefs is accepting and advocates love and respect to anyone contrary to the morals and beliefs of the school and most of the student body, which is diverse in beliefs - not just Christian theology, but also religious beliefs and philosophies."
College Freshman,4,"My school is unique because it has a Christ-centered community. The ethnicity aspect of my college is growing and the professors care about every student on campus. If I could do the college decision making process all over again, I would choose this school because Asbury has given me the opportunity to serve others and become a wonderful musician."
College Junior,4,"My school is a small, private, liberal arts institution. While I'm studying education and thus don't have as much time as I would like to explore the variety of classes, I love the emphasis that my school puts on developing the whole person rather than just the future professional."
College Freshman,4,"Asbury University has a great caring community. Even though it is a small university, that is what makes it good, because of the relationship you can make with your professor and also the ability to create deeper friendship with more people."
College Freshman,4,"The cafeteria food is either good or not so much. The Grille is pretty decent, but since it is the only thing open on the weekends I am worried I will get sick of the food. The Hicupp has a lot of great drinks though, milkshakes, smoothies, coffee, tea and they have holiday specials."
College Freshman,4,Wish I knew more options to get scholarship
College Freshman,4,The RA is great in our dorm!
College Freshman,4,GC (Glide-Crawford) is a more elegant type dorm with wide hallways. Kresge is a bit farther away and like a maze but the community units are just outside your room! Easy place to hang out and do whatever in your pjs.
College Freshman,4,There is hardly any real damage done when a crime is committed (Like petty theft).
College Freshman,4,"Every restaurant in town except one is locally owned and most provide fresh, quality, tasty food."
Alum,2,"Generally, classes were ""old-fashioned"" and the only tech involved was PPT. Professors always seemed competent with basics, but I only had one class that I remember using an online platform for assignments. The students in the class weren't extremely invested in it, so the experience wasn't great. I do think that the other disciplines were more tech-savvy than mine."
Junior,2,"Asbury University is a joke. The tuition is $40,000 a year and there is nothing to show for it. If you ask me, a year of attending Asbury is worth a maximum price of $20,000. Asbury provides it's students with some of the lowest speed internet possible and they block a variety of websites, including UrbanDictionary, which makes no sense. They also have very few options for food, even in The Bistro, the supposed restaurant on campus. If I wanted a soggy piece of chicken, I'd go to church and stay afterwards to eat lunch there. Room and Board is $8,000 but again, there's nothing to show for it. There are only 6 washers for like 500 students. The furniture is old, worn, and outdated. The heating and cooling systems are horrible and often times are set to blow hot air when it's hot and cold air when it's cold. Lastly, the professors are alright, but some lack in their abilities to teach, but you can expect that from any University, so that's not an Asbury-specific problem."
Junior,2,"The University looks nice on the out side and the majority of the professors put on a show, but they turn out to be two faced. I had maybe three professors that I really liked and enjoyed their classes. The food is terrible in the cafeteria, and the bistro food is average. I worked in the cafeteria and I was supposed to be trained, but the supervisor never trained me and I got in trouble a lot."
College Sophomore,2,I really wish more focus was put on attending sporting events. The atmosphere a big crowd creates is so much fun.
College Freshman,2,The walls in our dorms are falling apart. The halls are covered in hair because it does not get vacuumed frequently. Our community bathrooms are not very appealing either. The showers have hair in them all the time. The toilets do not flush properly all the time.
College Sophomore,2,"We are not really allowed to live off of campus, so almost everyone lives at school or at home."
College Sophomore,2,They also don't put food labels so it's hard when you have allergies.
College Sophomore,2,"Asbury is a pricey school. They do offer scholarships, but it's really hard for 'average' people to get a significant scholarship. Additionally, Asbury almost always over charges each student and has to do a refund. The overcharging put a lot of stress on my family during my freshman year."
College Sophomore,2,"The food isn't absolutely terrible, but the meal plans are way too expensive for what you get. I also think it's wrong that they require every student to have meal plan of some sort, even if they live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,We have the subway across the street. Other than that there is a small diner and Chinese place to eat. You have to go into Lexington for everything else.
College Freshman,2,"Transportation here is good for those with rides and friends who have rides, but will suck if you don't have a car or friends with cars because it will be very difficult to go around. Most of the big stores where students usually get stuff they really need are not located in the town where the school is located so it is difficult for students who are new to find rides that will take them there. There is a need for transportation for students especially students who are not familiar with the area."
College Freshman,2,"Guys and goes basically relate well and have fun together but most of the guys are more outgoing to mostly girls they know and really shy away from those they don't know. Relationships are just normal nothing over the top because it's a Christian school. The dress code is pretty tight and it is made to help the students stay safe. Social life here is pretty boring, there's mostly nothing to do because everybody is just doing their own thing and if your not asked to hang out your pretty much on your own."
College Junior,2,There were no real options for off campus living. Students are generally required to live on campus unless they are local.
College Sophomore,2,"I received a great deal of financial aid last year, but there were not many opportunities outside of athletics and work study to receive scholarships through the university. On top of that, the bank through which Asbury holds loans and payment plans does not offer deferred payment plans, only several payments per semester. This makes paying whatever is left out-of-pocket difficult. I felt that for $30,000 a year there would be a little more availability to some money."
College Junior,2,"It is pretty terrible. There are quite a bit of options, but the food is not good quality."
College Student,2,"This is a Christian College, where drinking is prohibited.  We have Chapel every Wednesday for entire college student body and faculty.  If you interesteded in obtaining Bible knowledge or going into ministry, Asbury is a good fit."
College Sophomore,2,The computers available on campus are the newes. But wireless internet connection is awful!!!
College Sophomore,2,"Compared to other schools, Asbury is pretty strict.  There is a dress code (that is becoming more lenient), but students are not allowed to wear sweatpants or shorts to class (however, some teachers do not care).  This is because the university wants their students to dress professionally.  Asbury also has a curfew starting at 12 (1am on Friday nights), but you are allowed extensions, so it is not terrible.  However, there is absolutely no drug or alcohol use allowed on campus.  Since this is a Christian school, the university wants the students to keep a high moral standard."
College Junior,2,"Squeezed in the Middle – The rules are quite strict at my school, but that is to be expected at a Christian college such as mine. I think a lot of the rules are pointless, but I choose to obey (most of) them, regardless. Many people have issues with the rules, but they totally knew what they were getting in to when they chose to go to this school. Go to a state school if you don't want as many rules!"
College Junior,2,"Low Profile – To get into a program is simple. All you have to do is go to the registrar's office and sign a form. There is no meeting, or no one on one discussion with someone to determine the right path for you."
Alum,1,"Asbury was the worst experience of my life. The sheltered, 'in the bubble' lifestyle lead many students to pretense and condescension. This attitude was encouraged by the faculty."
College Junior,1,"As far as alcohol goes, we don't really have a party scene at Asbury. But we don't need it to have fun."
College Junior,1,"As far as alcohol goes, there's not a party scene at Asbury. However, there are events going on regularly and the people there have fun without drinking."
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek Life at Asbury University.
College Sophomore,1,"underclassman are in the ""cage"", but its still a five to seven minute walk.. not to bad"
College Sophomore,1,You'll have to do all your looking in Lexington
College Freshman,1,"Wilmore is Dry. If you decide to go to Asbury University, you decide to sign a code of conduct that says you will not drink while in attendance there. This is not a problem for most students or professors."
College Freshman,1,"If you're looking to live off-campus, stay home. Wilmore is a very small town with almost no off campus apartments. Students have to obtain special permission if under 21 to live off campus without their parents."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have Greek Life at Asbury. The only Greek life we have is for Hispanics, African-Americans, and Asians."
College Freshman,1,"I am an african american student here on campus and I've counted, there are about 12 of us in total on campus out of about 1,600 students. That is just not right."
College Senior,1,"At Asbury University, there is no leniency whatsoever. If you partake in alcohol or drugs, you will most likely get kicked out of the school for your first offense."
College Senior,1,"Asbury does not allow the use of drugs on or off campus. However, some people are stupid enough to still do it in their rooms. Asbury really does not enforce it's rules all that much. Mostly because it is easy for some students to hide their drugs and alcohol."
College Senior,1,"Nothing in Wilmore – Occasionally the school will do events on campus and have giant tubs of Ale8one, but if you're looking for bar/club scenes you'd need to go to Lexington away from campus for that."
College Junior,1,"Every year has their designated parking spots according to what parking sticker you have. Unfortunately, there are not enough parking spots, and the only place where there are plenty of spots is a 15 minute walk away from everything. Definitely needs improvement."
College Junior,1,"Ed. Major – Education at Asbury Uni. sucks! Its as hard as getting your doctorates. They have so much criteria it's ridiculous! The advisers and people who are in charge of the education program, not all but most, are very rude and inconsiderate. They will not work with you at all to help you out. Very judgmental, and if they do not like you personally, you have no chance to progress in the major!"

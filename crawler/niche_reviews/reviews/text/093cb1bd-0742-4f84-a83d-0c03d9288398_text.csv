Freshman,5,"I am finishing up my first semester at PMI. I truly believe it is a great school and is constantly challenging us to become better students. If I had to change something I would change Thursday’s to jean day only because we don’t have class on Friday’s, which is currently jean day."
Graduate Student,5,"I am a graduate from PMI. I absolutely loved going here. I did the Respiratory therapy program, and all the instructors are the best. The dream team you would want teaching you. You ask for help and they’re always more than willing to help you. It is definitely not an easy program, you do have to work hard at it, but it is definitely worth the work."
Sophomore,5,"The college is now in the brand new building! State of the art facilities and staff. They have a simulation room for nearly every program on campus! Do you like pets? The Veterinarian program has many visitors that like to wonder the halls and say hello to the students and staff. Small class sizes and one-on-one time with faculty is a great bonus to attending this college. Of course; this is a technical college so it does cost more then usual, but it is worth it in the long run since you are straight to work upon graduation of an accelerated program!"
Freshman,5,"I love the staff that i have worked with, they were welcoming and answered all my questions up front, they were very supportive. My favorite part about the school is how it is hands on and how nice the campus is!"

Freshman,5,"40+ years ago, in the sleepy desert town of Tucson, AZ- my hometown-  Pima Medical Institute opened their first campus.  10+ years later, my mom walked through their doors determined to become a college graduate and medical professional....and succeeded.   30 years later my mom is an accomplished Director of Staffing for a recruiting agency, specializing in national healthcare recruiting.   In my 21 years, after a couple years in community college prerequisites, fitness sciences, nutrition courses, personal training and customer service occupations,combined with my grandfather's quadruple bypass surgery and health issues of family and clients,  I realized my excitement was healthcare.   From the minute I walked into the Administration building, the environment, campus and upbeat positive vibe and energy was as welcoming as my mom had described it from 30 years ago!    I knew instantly Respiratory Therapy was for me.   I am so excited to start classes this fall."

But I do have responsibilities outside of school and I just feel as though the instructors forget that sometimes, because there main goal is for us to do well and become the best RT's for a patients.

The professor for the program is an amazing teacher and makes sure everyone gets a chance to do what is expected and is very good with correcting us if it is needed.

College Junior,4,The tuition is high but I feel like I am getting a quality education.
College Junior,4,The overall experience was good I got through school and got my degree but need to pass my exam and hopefully I get it done.
College Senior,2,After apolying for financial aid they wont give it to us until were about to go to extern. There are things we could have get to help us out. And i feel like that could make my grades better.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like the tuition and financial aid process is a pain, takes a lot of getting used to and time to figure out everything."
College Junior,2,"Not many resources available, no library, no sports.  This school is designed for working students who live independently and have life and family outside of school."
Niche User,1,"Please pay attention to the negative reviews, if you are thinking about attending PMI do not let them talk you into a different program than you want. I came in for phlebotomy and got talked into the medical assistant program. Half of the teachers care, half of the teachers don't. They don't prepare you properly for the certification exam you actually have to take in order to become an MA. There are many 18 year olds, not saying that is a bad thing, but they come into this institute thinking it's high school 2.0, there is no one you can talk to who will listen and care about any problems you have. There were students trying to start physical fights in class. If you are an adult looking to better your lives, look into other places. Shara Heuser, the student services coordinator is terrible at her job and even the career advisers give you false information. Their new campus is very nice, that's about the only good thing I can say about this school."
Freshman,1,"Please DO NOT ATTEND this school,  its a scam. 
They have you sign loan documents saying you need to sign them for they can look for financial aid for you but when they dont find the financial aid your stuck with a $9000 bill. 
For a job at minimum wage its a terrible deal. 
And they know exactly what they are doing and have attorney's waiting to go after you, if you think about not paying it .. 
Rip off please don't do it ..."
College Junior,1,I received one call about my career and that's it.
College Senior,1,"me personally online classes really did not help me, it made me so much more stressed out and i would of rather have a teacher there to help me and teach me then rather i doing it"
College Senior,1,They receive this because I have to pay the loan while I am in school. Its hard to come up with an extra 250 a month for school. Why couldn't I have that loan deferred with my other loans?

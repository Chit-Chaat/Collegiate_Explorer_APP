Freshman,5,"My advisors have been nothing short of amazing and helpful. I am really thankful for Charmaine's help, and it felt like I was talking to a friend the entire time we scheduled out my year. It made things feel so easy. I ended up passing my first semester with a 4.0 GPA and I have never done so well in school in my entire life. My instructors were fantastic and continue to be as I progress through my courses. I haven't been in school in quite a few years and was really doubtful of myself upon returning. It's safe to say, I no longer feel this way."
Freshman,5,"I went back to school for the first time during the 2020 Summer semester, this was the first time I had been in school since 2012. I attended by doing online courses and ended up with a 4.0 GPA and I couldn't be more ecstatic about it. Blackboard is easy to operate and I never seem to have problems with it."
Niche User,5,"I love the online options because they save me time and allow me to work full-time and study on  my own schedule. I don't feel like I'm missing out, because there are plenty of options to interact with other students."
Freshman,5,"I recently finished my first semester at Clark State Community College. I love the flexibility of taking online classes and affordable tuition. Throughout high school I was unsure of what I wanted to major in, so I knew Clark State was the place to start due to their price. Once  I took the leap and met with my College Success Coach, I quickly realized what major best suited my situation and I knew I could stay at Clark State for my entire academic career. So far, this has been a wonderful experience and I hope it stays that way."
Freshman,5,The school itself is beautiful and kept up very nicely. The teachers are available for one on one time and all staff will help with anything.
Freshman,5,I love Clark State. I previously attended Sinclair due to the hype and ended up not liking it there at all. I like small class sizes and to be able to contact my teacher. Clark State provides this for me.
Freshman,5,"The campus is very nice and easy to navigate, like a small community. The resources that they provide outside of schooling such as medical, food, gas money, clothing and mental health services are amazing,"
Sophomore,5,"Clark State is great about working with students to allow them to get a degree in the field they want. The counselors are extremely helpful in the scheduling process and will make sure your schedule is set up for you to achieve your degree by the time you want it if at all possible. Many classes are offered online as well as in-person which allows students the flexibility to control their own learning and learn in the best way possible for each student. The classes are very affordable and they give out as much financial aid as possible. The college has been designed to help students succeed with many private workrooms available, a free tutoring center, and a person who specializes in helping students write speeches and presentations for classes. The college is constantly working to stay relevant and has recently made moves to include 4-year degrees in some fields offered at the college."
Freshman,5,Every time I have had any questions about classes or what is best for me they have helped significantly. They are understanding about a busy schedule involving military life and a family.

The professors and faculty all play a role in my everyday life as I attend the school. My professors are always willing to help in any way whether it's an online class or a traditional class. The faculty will stop whatever they are doing to help you or direct you to the correct area you need to be in. When you walk into the school unsure but end up leaving feeling so accomplished, that's how you know the school is fit for you."

Sophomore,5,"Excellent school. Low tuition rates, making it easy to get through college, or get started on a bachelor's degree, without breaking the bank or needing a ton of loans. If you want to continue and get a bachelor's degree, Clark State has associate's degrees designed specifically for transferring to a four-year college that will knock out virtually all of your ""core"" classes so you can focus on those relevant to your major after transferring. Clark State also has a relationship with Wright State University called the Gateway Program, along with dozens of articulation agreements, that makes it easy to transfer and gives you access to additional scholarships automatically if you complete the associate's degree. Clark State's advisers and professors are very friendly and approachable and are willing to work with you to ensure you get the most out of your education. I have no regrets for choosing to start my education at Clark State."

Junior,5,"One of the best things I love about Clark State Community College is that the school will work with you when it comes to any aspect of your life. If there is a time you cant pay your rent there is a emergency fund that you can apply for. If you need parts for your car to get it started and running again they will assist you with that to make life easy. Also what I love about the school is that they are there for you more than most schools are, when it comes to academics, help, tutoring, anything they always and will always find a way. Clark State does a great job with there students, if I had to pick any community college to attend it would very much be Clark state community college."
Freshman,5,"I have had a pretty good experience! I am recently just restarting my education here. I went for a while but I was not in a good place in life, I was a teenage mom things were hard."

College Sophomore,5,My favorite experience at Clark State Community College was when I first started going to college. When I first started college I liked all of my instructors and I understood all my classes and the work. The college is small and really nice to get around to the classes. I would choose the school again if i would do it all over again because I have had a positive experience at the college all in all.
College Junior,5,It's a great school. The price is cheap and the experience is great!

College Freshman,5,"I think what is unique about Clark State is their class fees, no other school/college/university has that low of cost."
College Freshman,5,"I feel that there are many ups and a few downs about Clark State. Even though it is trouble finding a parking spot, I always know what my classes are about. I do excellent in their courses that I am taking. I love their library, especially when I have to do a research paper. I would choose to go to this school again, because their cost for schools it the lowest. I can graduate with the degree I need and transfer my credits to another College to move on to the higher degree for my major."

College Sophomore,5,"My professors at Clarkstate Community College have always been extremely helpful. If I ever have questions or concerns my professors are always happy to lend a helping hand.

So far, my experience with Clarkstates academics has been pleasurable."
College Sophomore,5,"I use the computer labs at Clarkstate Community College quite often and find everytime that there are plenty of available seats. The internet is always reliable and fast and I have never had any problems with the network being down. Each semester students are given $7.00 towards ink and paper which I find to be more than enough. Overall, my experience with campus resources are great."

Clark State offers evening classes as well as summer classes which will make attending college quite easy for those who work a full-time job.
College Sophomore,5,"I've noticed there is a lot of diversity at Clark State Community College. My classes typically consist of all different ethnicities, religions and ages.

Everyone seems very friendly and eager to learn, yet we are all focused on getting the same thing - a degree!"

College Senior,5,"Old and Young ‚Äì clark state has many different ages from still in high school to 60's. we have people with full time jobs and full time students. there are singles,people with kids, long marrieds,etc."

Niche User,4,"I have been very happy with Clark State. I am getting an involved, quality education for a great price. I love the hands-on opportunities, as well as the caring and well-informed instructors. I also enjoy the variety of class options for adult students."
Freshman,4,"I have taken three online classes at this point. I plan on taking as many online classes as possible, due to health problems. It has been convenient in the aspect of not having to tight schedule to follow. With my health problems I may wake up and be unable to get straight to work on class. This is not a problem with online classes. I can do them whenever I feel up to it. So far all of the professors have been accomodating and answered all of my questions when asked. I would highly recommend online classes to anyone debating taking them."
Freshman,4,I am a nursing student a Clark State. My class are not over crowded and the professors are always willing to help us. The tuition is also affordable and one of the cheapest around. The one thing that I would change is probably having more of the majors available at all campuses.
Sophomore,4,"I like the diversity at Clark State. I enjoy most of my teachers. Clark state has offered a lot of resources for students, and most teachers are pretty flexible when possible. The campus is clean, and the restaurant has good food."
Freshman,4,"Overall my experience at Clark State has been great! I like that it close by and affordable! However I would love to see an expansion of online, night classes, and even degree options. It really has the potential to be so much more!"
Niche User,4,"Clark State has amazing programs for students of all types. It is a great school to get your first two year courses completed. The English and Social Behavior courses have very good teachers to help students learn the materials. Overall, this college is a great choice to earn an Associates' degree and the staff care very much about the students."
Graduate Student,4,Most of the instructors are wonderful. They honestly want us to succeed. Help is always around the corner for someone to just ask. The new change to online testing is confusing and with the instructors not knowing how to help us because they are unfamiliar with it is frustrating.
Niche User,4,"I liked the small class sizes, most of the teachers were excellent teachers. The teachers are very understanding. I had one or two teachers that didn't really know how to teach, and that made my learning experience in that class harder but other than that I have no issues! They offer plenty of courses online if you so choose to learn like that, and they have great on campus classes too!"
Graduate Student,4,The people were great but the education was not the greatest. Not very expensive but still hard to justify that it was non athletically worth the money.
Freshman,4,I just started but I honestly can say the staff cares. Staff is very friendly and welcoming to new students. The professors are all very professial. The campus is in differnt locations in the city though. For me I got my classes I need for a 4 year college out of the way for cheaper.
Sophomore,4,"I took courses here as a high school student and had a great experience. I know Clark State is much cheaper then other schools, and it has a wide variety of college students."
Sophomore,4,Overall it is a nice college. Going through the financial aid process with the college was pretty easy for me. It is easy to register for classes. There is also nice areas to sit and wait for classes and/ or get work done for your classes.
Freshman,4,Small Community College very cheap and nice staff. The drive is a lil far but its the cheapest college around my area.
Sophomore,4,"Clark State is overall a great college. It is in a smaller location for those who don't like big cities.  It's not only for the younger crowd. This is a great school for those who have families as well. It's a great way to complete a class here or there. It is clean and organized. Campus is centrally located around a variety of shops and restaurants. Clark State guarantees a fast way to complete half a 4 year or complete an associate's degree. If you aren't great at school, the classes have a smaller ratio of students to instructor, allowing for more one on one explanation/teaching. It is a good way to complete your schooling without being sucked into the party scene as well. You don't waste money on dorms and extra trivial expenses. You can live at home, work, and save money while in school. I would recommend Clark State Community College to anyone looking to stay focused, complete their goal, and continue a family or job in the mix."
Niche User,4,I am apart of the college credit plus program that clark state has and it's a great way to get credit while still in high school. The techers I've had from clark state are great when you need help and are generally very engaging.
Sophomore,4,"Clark State is great because--and I know how corny this sounds, but it's true--they want you to succeed. College involves a number of complicated processes that you probably aren't familiar with because you've not yet gone to college. Faculty and Staff here genuinely want to help you solve any problems with financial aid, registration, oral reports, or anything of the kind. It's small and the course options can be restrictive, but it's just right for getting your general education requirements done."
Sophomore,4,What I like most is the environment provided by the campus and the culture of the staff. I've never had any trouble receiving help.
Sophomore,4,I love the college. It's small enough to where I can transition eventually to a university. The college is small enough to where the student can have more one-on-one time with the teacher.
Niche User,4,"I love the Beavercreek campus option. The main Springfield campus has also made huge improvements, although some parts of campus are obviously the old buildings added onto."
Junior,4,Great teachers who truly care about you and your education. There are great students who really want to succeed and push each other so they do the best. There are many classes offered online which is great.
Freshman,4,Everyone is very helpful. Always answer phone or calls me right back. Lot of help navigating classes. Great study help and tutoring.
Sophomore,4,"Very casual class setting with knowledgeable professors and instructors.  Lots of campus resources available though the information was not readily available, but instead obtained through word of mouth."
College Sophomore,4,I had a lot of indivivalized help with making sure that all my classes were scheduled correctly and that i had financial aid
College Sophomore,4,The school faculty really do their best to make everything convenient for the students.
College Sophomore,4,Clark State is a great community college that offers a great education to students at a lot lower cost than other schools.
College Student,4,"So far my professors are great! They're very helpful! I love that I can take a self paced math course and that it's offered online. Class sizes are small, which I think benefits us, the students."
College Student,4,Every staff member I've encountered had been great and super helpful! The times classes are offered make it easy to maintain a full time job as well!
College Senior,4,I love the school and enjoy the teachers.

College Sophomore,4,"I am able to take all online classes, which is greatly convenient for my full-time work schedule."
College Senior,4,"Inexpensive, easy to deal with various offices, nice library, nice facilities, easy parking, flexible scheduling, good professors."
College Senior,4,"I've had great professors and instructors. If you're willing to learn and not just slide by, you'll enjoy your classes and have the general knowledge you'll need when entering the workforce later. Registration is simple and offered on-line, by mail, and in-person. The more credit hours you have, the earlier you can register - to help secure spots for people close to graduating. The tutoring has been excellent and offered for free. If you need help with classes - especially math - there is almost always someone available to help."
College Senior,4,"I'm taking an Associate of Science - General Transfer degree with a focus on Business. I go to school full time. If you want to do well, be prepared to study 2 - 3 times the amount of credit hours you take. An example: If you have a course that is 3 credit hours, be prepared to study 6 - 9 hours per week. If you take 12 credit hours total you will need 24 - 36 hours of study time."
College Senior,4,"The financial aid office is extremely helpful but sometimes they believe you know more than you do. The way around this issue is to ask questions until you get the answer you understand - and to ask about next steps. One thing that the financial aid office and other staff members need to offer is automatic scholarship counseling. Most students I've spoken with haven't heard of the Clark State Foundation - which allows you to apply for several scholarships on one application. If you apply to the school, you should be encouraged to fill out the foundation's application. Stop in frequently and ask them if everything is in order on your account."
College Senior,4,I haven't used the service but I see updated job postings and invitations to use the services fairly regularly. I see people talking with the advisers and know a few people who have been placed in jobs with the help of the center.
College Senior,4,"The on-line courses are good at CSCC.

Any on-line course lacks a social aspect that I feel is necessary to make connections and help with the learning process."
College Senior,4,"The library has great resources both on campus and on-line; and is a nice place to study. The staff are always willing to help in anyway they can. There are several activities and clubs and the campus is growing and the administration has allowed for nice spots to socialize, eat, and study."
College Senior,4,"My experience at Clark State has been fabulous. Support of instructors, administration, and staff has been beyond expectations. Almost every department looks to assist a serious student."
College Senior,4,The student body is very diverse.
College Sophomore,4,I love the Student center for people with learning disability. I have some disability
College Junior,4,The people who are in charge of the program is always helpful and is there if I need anything.
College Junior,4,It has been a great experience!!!
College Freshman,4,"I have taken two online courses so far and I love them. I do not have to be at school more then four days a week, I can always get a response back from my teacher."
College Freshman,4,"I love their tutors, they do help a lot when I do not understand my work I was given. I also love their class registration, because I can pick my own classes and times."
College Freshman,4,"I feel at Clark State that people do not judge one another, but help each other out."
College Freshman,4,"I love the library, there are many resources that are there for the students."
College Senior,4,"No school is absolutely perfect, but my current college is my still my first choice to attend."
College Senior,4,The academic flexibility is excellent with various choices to try and benefit student schedules.
College Senior,4,"The online courses are more tough, but is still a good source."

College Junior,4,There is only a few problems but they are very minor.
College Senior,4,they are good working around your work and family life
College Sophomore,4,"Clark State Community College is a small school, so students tend to get more one on one time with the professors which is helpful. Tuition cost is less expensive than larger schools which makes it affordable for most students. I find that by only taking a few classes each semester that I am able to dedicate enough time towards my homework and outside employment. My advisor has informed me that after graduation I will be assisted in finding a job which leaves me with some peace of mind."
Niche User,2,Does not support military veterans.  VA representative and school fail to communicate in a timely manner which resulted in non registration.  Go somewhere and don't waste your valuable benefits at Clark State.
Sophomore,2,"Clark state feels like high school. I have never spoken to an adviser, and I have barely had any communication with teachers. I almost get the feeling that students are being set up to fail."
College Sophomore,2,The person I have been talking is not very friendly or help full it is like she does not care
College Junior,2,It seems as if they put all their money into the main entrance and left the rest of the school to be old
College Junior,2,I could never find my counselor so I only had access to a general advisor who didn't know a whole lot about my major
College Senior,2,"The network is usually reliable, with update notifications being given well in advance if it will be unavailable. The computer labs are not very helpful, however, as they are unusable when you have specific software for classes that is supposed to be available, but nobody knows the password to access it, from the teachers to the department head."
College Freshman,2,"I think our school needs to be a little more helping and pay more attention to the students. I am a freshman so I am used to our high school advisors helping us then and there, not telling us to call this person, that person or go here and there. They would help us on the spot and we wouldn't have to ask many many times. As for paying attention to students, I would be in class and be asking for help or asking a question and the teacher would be paying attention to certain students because they ""needed more help"". I do no think the class is that big that the teacher could not take her time to answer my question(class size would be about the size of my college class)."
College Student,2,Compter Network Needs Improvement ‚Äì The computer network needs an update. The wireless access in the building is very poor. Your lucky to even pick up the weakest signal if any. This is definitely an area that should be improved.
College Freshman,2,"Some people are nice, there is a considerable number that are quite unfreindly."
College Sophomore,1,The Financial aid dept. Will send me a letter a week before the semester starts and they will not return your emails or phone calls.
College Freshman,1,Nobody is super helpful. Clark State sucks. That is why I'm transferring.

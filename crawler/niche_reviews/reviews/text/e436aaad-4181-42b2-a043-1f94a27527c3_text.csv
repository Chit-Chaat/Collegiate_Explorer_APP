Freshman,5,"I love Elmira College. If looking for a close knit community, this is a wonderful school. The clubs are easily one of the best parts. Since campus is so small, you are guaranteed to be able to be involved. Professors are readily available to meet with students who are struggling. The entire staff of Elmira College is among the most friendly and helpful."
Senior,5,Excellent college with a great history. The professors all attempt to make sure you get an education while making sure you have ample time to absorb the information. The small school atmosphere gives the professors a chance to learn your name and have personal conversations with each and every student that makes the opening attempt. If there is a club you want to join or form. feel free to make it. If you have trouble with a class don't hesitate to ask for help.if the person you ask can't help you they will show you to someone who can because it is a small school. In the small school community everyone knows every one and everyone tries to help everyone.
Freshman,5,"When I visited Elmira everyone was very welcoming and friendly. The people are so nice and it's easy to make friends. The food is also pretty decent for what I've tried so far. The dorms are very nice and roomy, I can't wait to move in. The campus is so pretty and really good for instagram pictures. I would definitely recommend looking into."
Alum,5,"Elmira College offered me the opportunity to complete my undergraduate degree in nursing. The nursing program was phenomenal...experienced and very student-teacher friendly. I had the pleasure of taking electives in other departments at Elmira College as well. My Public Speaking class was so well taught that I got over my fear of speaking in public! World Religions course was very interesting...I learned about a whole host of religions and people around the world. This experience opened my eyes to others and in doing so, developed a respect for people different from myself. 

Elmira College is a beautiful campus and easy to navigate. I enjoyed my experience there, and it changed my life."
Freshman,5,"Small College staff who are always friendly and willing to help when needed. Always looks out for us and our best interests. Hosts several events to keep us busy, food is great. Definately a warm welcoming environment can't say enough good things about it. Can't see my self going anywhere else but EC! Go Soaring Eagles!!!!"
Senior,5,This is a great small college with a community atmosphere! you get to know your professors and make some really good friends!
Junior,5,"Love the small school with smaller classes and ot is important to me to havedirect professor contact.
I enjoy the beautiful campus.I am finding great career opportunities from career services department. They are so committed to my success. I like the Starbucks on campus..need that  daily ice coffee! The gym facility is great and not crowded so I can work out when it best fits in my schedule. The new dorms are air-conditioned and very spacious. The campus social life is great and there are student events all the time. I am on the basketball team and I have made so many life long friendships. We travel all the time and even we to Canada. This was an amazing experience for me and my teammates. I can't wait till next year we will be really good with a very mature committed team. Success is in our future"
Junior,5,"Beautiful campus, small classes and wonderful opportunities both in the community and academically. Professors know your name and want you to do well."
Freshman,5,"Elmira’s campus is a very welcoming and safe place. It is really comforting to have campus security there 24/7. Every body from students to faculty are very helpful and friendly and will go out of their own way to help you out. Elmira College has a very home-like feeling to it, everyone feels like family there. It is also very nice to have everything so close on campus... not big at all, so if that is a big factor for you Elmira College is definitely a great choice!"
Alum,5,"As am alumnus about ten years out, I can't speak to the current situation, however I can say that Elmira College prepared me well for graduate school and my future profession. I have been very successful and owe a great deal of  gratitude to EC, my professors and advisors. I was a bright, but unfocused student. The small class sizes and very caring professors helped to ensure that I could not blow off classes and just take the tests. Having met many people over the years who chose one of the many fine SUNY schools, I'd say the biggest difference is that you're not just a number in a lecture hall at EC, and your professors will take an active interest in your education and growth as a student."
Freshman,5,People on campus are very friendly and welcoming. Campus is small so you can really get to know everyone well. It is easy to make friends. I would like campus to relatively stay the same. The food was really great after the change in food choice.
College Freshman,5,I REALLY wanna go to this school I just hope and pray I can afford it.
College Freshman,5,There is always a way to get an internship here. The career center is very helpful and I'm sure I will get a job after college.
College Freshman,5,ELMIRA COLLEGE IS THE PERFECT COLLEGE FOR ME AND THEY HAVE A GREAT NURSING PROGRAM.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Very friendly, helpful, and welcoming. They become your family and friends."
Recent Alumnus,5,"When you apply to Elmira, you are automatically reviewed for the program in which you wish to enter. Therefore, you egin with that program your freshmen year."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are over 35 majors and programs to choose from - students usually double major with minors or even triple major to make themselves as marketable as possible for the same ""cost"" as one program. 100% of our students complete an internship before graduating. Typically 8-200 or more hours. I did 1 term of field work, two terms of student teaching, and 1 term of small and large group tutoring for experience while at EC."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The process was so easy - When you apply to Elmira College, you are automatically reviewed for a scholarship. They tell you your acceptance and scholarship at the same time. Come Jan 1. You complete the FAFSA and then you receive your award letter with additional need-based and gift aid by February 1st. At this point, I had all the information I needed to make a decision (which wasn't even due until May 1st). 

Tips: 

Apply early!  

Ask about other options!  

Apply for private scholarships!"
Recent Alumnus,5,We do not have greek-life.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Everyone is very friendly at Elmira College. Professors, Administrators, and Staff are eager to help you along the way with any questions you may have. They are even there just to chat with! It's a small school with big opportunities. With over 100 clubs and organizations, you're only bored if you mean to be."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are very caring and helpful and always willing to meet with you.  Most of them are really good at getting back to you if you email them.  The curriculum is challenging but not too hard.  The registration process is pretty smooth, but sometimes you get shut out of classes.  If you need a class, most professors will write you in even if the class is already full.  Term III is a really great opportunity to take fun classes or travel abroad for a shorter period of time."
College Sophomore,5,Elmira has really amazing scholarships.  High school valedictorians can get a full-tuition scholarship for all four years and other scholarships are quite large as well.  The college works hard to keep current students at the college even when their financial situation changes.
College Freshman,5,FREE printing! I'm horrible with technology and TEC support has helped me without fail with every issue I have had
College Freshman,5,I have never experienced a situation that has shown me any negativity from this school regarding diversity of an individual or groups 
College Freshman,5,Valedictorians and some Salutatorians get full tuition.
College Freshman,5,"Everything is purple and gold. There are octagons (the school's shape) and irises (the school flower) everywhere as well. The dorms are beautiful and much bigger than a typically room. The work out center is sort of small. The main athletic center is about 15 minutes away from campus. The new president is improving the classroom facilities (without raising tuition) so all classrooms have a blue-ray player and a smartboard. The campus center is always busy, as it houses the dining hall and many rooms and lounges for club meetings. Student Activities and Student Activities Board are always planning events that are fun, but many students chose not to attend, but there are a lot of fun!"
College Junior,5,"You do not have to pay to get a permit and there are plenty of spaces around. You do not need to have a car on campus because there are plenty of places nearby that you can easily walk to. Additionally, tickets/fines are reasonable. I think it is only $25 for a parking violation and if you talk to security you may be able to get the fine removed all together."
College Freshman,5,"being a nursing major in Elmira is very challenging,  basically a student will not have a social life because you have to be on top of everything when it comes to school work. The clinical s are kind of internships because you get to see the things you learn in class being performed on an actual patient."
College Senior,5,"I love the field of Communication Disorders. There are many job opportunities right now and various work settings, including clinics, schools, hospitals, etc.  It is also a dynamic field, so there is much research as well."
College Sophomore,5,parking on campus is free and oly requires you to fill out a form and place a sticker on your car to prove legality of car parking on campus. There are a significant number of parking spaces on campus that accomidate all of the srudents thatneed parking.
College Sophomore,5,"Transportation is very convenieny in the area. Thee is a local bus that stops in the middle of campus every day, each hour. It takes you to the mall and only costs a few bucks to get there and back in one trip. Also, if you need to get to walmart or the other stores in the area of walking distane from walmart, there is a shuttle available. It goes to the mall and walmart a few times a day."
College Senior,5,The Professors Are Amazing – My title says all. The professors are amazing and wonderful. My program is small but I gain all the help I need and they really take an interest in me.
College Senior,5,Plenty of It – There is plenty of parking for Elmira and it is free to bring a car. No fee for permits. Although the fines are high if one does not obey the parking regulations.
College Senior,5,"My Major Is Awesome – My professors are amazing. All of them take an interest in the topics I'm interested in, my classwork, and my ideas. They encourage me to continue my education and think of topics outside of class that would interest me. Going to class is a great experience and I always walk away with new knowledge."
College Senior,5,"Elmira is a private school and tuition is very expensive. However, for those students involved in extracurricular activities and received good grades in High School, scholarships are plentiful and extremely helpful. I did not have to apply for the scholarship Elmira gave me, they rewarded it to me based on my grades and involvement in high school. And, as long as I keep my GPA above a certain score, I am automatically awarded it each year. More importantly, if a student's grades fall and they do not make the required GPA for their scholarship for one semester, they school will automatically give it back to them as soon as the student gets their grades back up."
College Senior,5,"Best Years of my life – Elmira College has given me the opportunity to become such a strong, independent, and motivated individual.  I've been challenged in my classes, learned to write really well, gotten to know a ton of new people, and been taught traditions that I will remember for a lifetime. Club-wise, I've been involved with the same organizations since my freshman year, really strengthening my ties to the college."
College Senior,5,"Traditions Galore! The best thing about Elmira College are the myriad of traditions the school has.  Some have been around since it opened in 1855.  Traditions bring students together and foster a since of community.  Favorites are Holiday Weekend, May Days, Mountain Day, and Midnight Breakfast."
College Freshman,5,"Purple and Gold – Elmira College is the land of purple and gold.  I have never seen a campus that is so dedicated to their school colors before.  Everything is either purple or gold.  The bowling alley is purple and gold, the salt used in the winter is purple, and the sports equipment (balls, pucks...) are purple and gold."
College Freshman,5,"Lack There Of – There is no Greek Life on campus, but our honor societies are named after Greek Life. We try to associate Greek Life with something positive, like honor societies, rather than drinking and partying."
College Freshman,5,"Elmira College has an excellent security staff. Earlier in the year, a part-time commuter was making me feel very uncomfortable. I confronted security about it, as nervous as I was, and they took care of the problem almost immediately, even going so far as to involving some administrators! The school truly has no tolerance for sexual harassment and even though I still see the guy around, he has NEVER given me a problem since! 
Otherwise, the campus is small, beautiful, and pretty safe. Again, keep your doors locked and if you are at the ground level, its a good idea to close and lock the windows when not in the room too (there are known cases of people breaking in and running off with valuables).  It never hurts to be extra careful. The library is ultra safe, my friends and I leave our stuff there all the time when we go to grab some food and what-not."
Sophomore,4,"Online was great, fun, teachers worked with you to make it easier on you. Teachers were understanding and would even offer to do one on one zoom meetings with you! they would also make it easier for you to know exactly what you had to do"
Sophomore,4,"Elmira College was a great place to meet new friends, be on an active and supportive team. the campus is small and so are the class which means you will get all the help you need!"
Senior,4,The college is a good place to receive an education. The college is not located in the best neighborhood but works hard to ensure the safety of its students and faculty. The college offers small class sizes which make it easier to receive help when needed.
Niche User,4,"When I first attended, the welcoming committee was amazing, the whole orientation program was interesting and different. It's a close-knit community, and the staff are very supportive."
Senior,4,The nursing program is great and I love the small classroom size. The res life staff is not the best and the staff turnover rate seems to be very high which is not great. The food is alright.
Sophomore,4,"Elmira is a small school in which many can't quite seem to fit. Many students don't find comfort within the walls of the classrooms at Elmira and feel like they will never quite fit in with their peers. I have personally known multiple people who have left for this very reason, however, I think this school isn't as bad as everyone says that it is. I personally, think I have found a school that suits my personal needs."
Alum,4,The nursing program is superior to other programs.  The staff are extremely knowledgeable and available for the students.  The program is organized and the clinical experience was fantastic.
Niche User,4,The campus is very beautiful and very easy to navigate. Most of the people are every inviting and welcoming. The professor take a big interest in all the student and are very helpful. Elmira is a very great place to be!
Freshman,4,I like to campus and how small it is. I also like the student life and how teadition is an important aspect.
Senior,4,"Elmira College is the third school I've attended. My first institution, I had a rough start. I applied to Elmira because I had some older friends who attended here and they could not praise it enough for its small, tight knit and overall environment that aided to their current success. I had no idea that I would attend Elmira for my nursing degree and excel much more than I did at my previous university. The professors want to see you succeed and are more than willing to help when needed. The closeness of all the people in my program definitely helps me feel confident in my skills, abilities, critical thinking and intelligence. I have met people that will remain in my life following graduation. I have seen and experienced some terrible but also beautiful aspects of health with various patients at various hospital/clinical locations. Elmira has absolutely prepared to enter into a professional nursing position."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman, and the professors are very nice. The food is very good too! The dorms are average, but, the size of them are good."
Senior,4,Elmira allowed me to transfer in a lot of credits and graduate early. They also offer many scholarships and have a beautiful campus. They are making a lot of changes to improve the community.
College Sophomore,4,"Nursing program is HARD. If you are dedicated, you will be okay but really focus and do not take on to much at one time."
College Sophomore,4,Many different classes offered. Most of the classes will be 8ams so get used to waking up early!
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe. I have lived near Elmira for many years and it's honestly not as scary and bad. Yes, there are many shooting and robberies almost every night. They only apply to certain parts of Elmira. Of course, do not walk alone at night as there are creepy people in Elmira. But i feel very safe and secure. People get scared about going out, but there's nothing at all to be scared about."
College Sophomore,4,"Meir and Tompkins is the best for housing. The freshman dorms are AWFUL but i mean most freshman dorms are not the best on campuses wherever you go. Twin Towers is where i'm living and lets just say it can get crazy. Definitely the party scene and its fun if you like long nights, but if you're a nursing major, you better just live in the library since you will need all of the peace you can get. If you're a transfer student, you get the crap of the dorms. For example, they just stick you wherever and switch you like 5 times until you start school. I was first placed in a freshman dorm as a junior and then placed in a great room in Tompkins and then last minute got switched to the towers just a few days before school started. They do not give you any say of where you prefer to live."
College Sophomore,4,I really do like elmira.
College Freshman,4,Hopefully I will be a freshman this year!
College Freshman,4,I don't think there will be a problem with safety
College Freshman,4,I hope I have a roommate that can deal with my craziness.
College Freshman,4,"I got accepted to Elmira and i really hope i can pay to go there it's my dream school but my family and I have to figure out a way to pay 32,400$ a year! God know i don't have that kind of money but i hope i'll be able to attend!"
College Senior,4,I know a lot of people who enjoy their major and some who hate it. High transfer rate freshman year.
College Senior,4,Most people drink but no real pressure if you don't. Lots of non drinking friend groups on campus as well.
College Senior,4,My major allows great diversity and employment.
College Senior,4,I love my professors and major.
College Senior,4,I never had any problems with rooming but I know people who got the worst numbers and lived in crappy housing.
College Senior,4,"Overall EC has been a positive experience. Everyone complains about how bad it is when you're there but it really is a great school for the most part. You'll be in debt, but certain majors really advance your grad school apps."
College Freshman,4,This school is very safe.
College Freshman,4,I love this school I don't want to go anywhere else.
College Freshman,4,I love Elmira College it is a fun place to attend school. The staff here are amazing people.
College Freshman,4,"The people are polite, the faculty is for the most part very kind and understanding. Our school has great safety and security programs in place to keep students safe and in good health. There are a lot of on campus activities going on of every variety, and hundreds of clubs to join and ways to participate."
College Freshman,4,People do drugs but peer pressure is not a issue
College Freshman,4,Secuirty and safety is a important role in every students experience.
College Freshman,4,The internship will help my networking and prepare me to be sucessful in the future
College Senior,4,"Classes are generally small, about the size of the average high school class. Professors are easily accessible and always willing to help, and really care about their subjects and students."
College Senior,4,"Different dorms work for different people. Some are more suited for quiet, studious kids and others are total party dorms. Regardless, though, housekeeping does a great job at keeping them all clean, and all of the dorms are only about a 5 minute walk away from the furthest classroom building. Prices vary by the dorm you're in and the room you have--the most luxurious dorms cost more, but it's worth the price (private bathrooms!!)."
College Senior,4,"Elmira has top-notch sports teams, especially our hockey teams. There's usually a variety of intramural sports available, and an email is sent to the student body weekly showing what sports events are going on that week and when/where, so if you want to go to an event it's not a mystery. Facilities for non-athletic students are also routinely available, with schedules clearly posted in  multiple locations."
College Senior,4,"People complain a lot about Dining Services and the wifi, but any time the administration hears about a problem they almost immediately start working on it, and depending on the issue, solutions are found anywhere between an hour and just a few days. The people working here try their best to make it a good school, and they do well."
College Freshman,4,"Workload is not overly hard, professors are willing to help."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are nicely sized; you get the attention that you need.
College Freshman,4,"The professors are mostly very caring and recognize you by your face; they're always willing to stop and chat. There are many organizations and clubs that you can join on campus that are worth while, and it's nearly impossible to not find a place that you belong on campus. People are very welcoming, and the RAs in my building are extremely caring, helpful, and go out of their way to help."
College Freshman,4,The class size is small and it helps me learn better. Some professors are wonderful but others do not care about their students like they should.
College Freshman,4,I love the school but it is very small. The teachers are nice but they sometimes grade very unfair.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of parties, most of which get stopped."
College Freshman,4,I am pleased with what I am learning at Elmira College and I hope I get to sat for three more years.
College Freshman,4,I fell very safe on this campus and there are a lot of people I can go to if anything does happen.
College Freshman,4,I love my roommate and the halls and bathrooms are always clean. So I am very satisfied with the housing process.
College Freshman,4,I did not really watch many games on campus but a lot of people did go to see them. Whenever I did go to a game the area was clean and pleasant to be in.
College Freshman,4,i play soccer and I love it
College Freshman,4,"Elmira College is a great fit for me. I'm on a sports team playing the sport that I love, I have amazing friends, and I am learning things that will help me when I graduate and finding out what I want to be. There are negatives, the food here is poor and we do have a very small class size which can be a good and a bad thing; small classes but everyone knows everything about everyone. Overall, I am so glad I chose this college and it's a great fit for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Elmira College is a wonderful academic school. The classes are amazing and that is why I am in college, to be prepared for a masters program in Counseling. Like any college it has its downfalls. A class size at elmira is about 300 students. This is small therefore there are minimal extra curricular activities. However, due to this a core class contains an average of 20 people in it. This is wonderful for one on one aid."
College Senior,4,"The atmosphere is so amazing. People on campus, both staff and other students make sure you feel welcomed. I have met so many nice and unique people. It is easy to be yourself and express yourself in whatever way you want."
College Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere at EC!  It is so warm and welcoming that I always feel at home.  I am close with several professors and have met so many wonderful people that I know that I could turn to for help if needed. The small class sizes and campus are great, but it's not so small that I feel like I know everyone because I don't."
College Freshman,4,"Our school isn't strict on much, they have some type of 3 strike policy so it's pretty easy going"
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a student, I worked in Campus Security as both an assistant and an escort. I know Lt and the security officers very well and I know how seriously they take their positions. Security is available 24/7 with 1-3 officers on at a time, with additional officers for big events. They are actively patrolling campus on foot or in their security cart!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Peitros! Peasanos! Horigans! Rounding Third! Bernie Murrays! Specialties to Elmira, New York!"
College Sophomore,4,I have heard many great things. I am a single mom and don't have the time to go and watch them.
College Sophomore,4,I am so happy to be entering into this program. It has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl.
College Sophomore,4,"Aesthetically, it's a truly beautiful campus. There is a lot of green space and even a small pond.  The campus is small, but the buildings are decently spread out.  Students mostly hang out in dorms or on the lawn during the warmer months.  The exercise facilities are ok but often very crowded.  There is a pool to swim in.  The library is quite large and usually quiet.  The campus center houses the rooms used for most club meetings, along with all 4 dining options.  MacKenzie's (one of the dining options) is often utilized for campus events, especially on the weekends.  There are events planned every weekend by SAB."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is very well-maintained and beautiful, especially outside.  Some of the buildings are very old and not in the best shape as a result.  The dorms are not very clean, but are otherwise pretty nice.  Our school is very into school colors (purple and gold), which you will see EVERYWHERE! Even the soap in most of the bathrooms is purple (and the toilet stalls and carpets and doors, etc.).  You will need to own purple clothing if you attend this school."
Freshman,2,It was okay. Didn't really get a chance to meet a lot of people but we were told there would be other activities to help everyone get to know each other since we couldn't do regular festivities.
Freshman,2,This school is a good school. The classes are small and you get a chance to know all your professors and they let you know they are there to help. And there is nothing to do in the surrounding area
Freshman,2,"okay school. Bad housing conditions, lack of diversity. Being an out of state student is hard because they literally charge extra on just about everything. Also  feel very uncomfortable all the time because the majority of this school is white. I tried going to the Latinx club, but no one even spoke Spanish!"
Junior,2,"This place is a complete and utter joke.  There have been three different Presidents in the last 5 years!  There are so many empty dorm rooms that they try to hide them or give them away as singles, and trying to find someone to help you in Residence Life is like trying to find the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.  The classes are okay, but the college is so small that it's impossible for them to offer anything close to the variety that bigger schools can offer.  Finally the city is run down, and frankly dangerous.  Just search for Elmira and Crime ... last month a guy was shot 10 feet from campus, but unless you watch the news you would never know because the college does everything it can to cover up ANY negative news."
College Freshman,2,"Let's just say, I knew I wanted to transfer since the first week of classes."
College Freshman,2,"I had a hard time choosing between ""it's the worst"" and ""it's bad"". It really is not all that great here and what I realized is that they put on a perfect face for college tours and stuff of that sort, but behind the walls everything is trash. It's too expensive and they even raised the tuition to a little over 40k recently. Alot of stuck up people. Parties are actually soooo embarassing. Not to mention so much of the class of 2019 have already transferred out, and I know alot more who are waiting for the end of the school year to leave, including me. There really is not much diversity here at all. Cant wait until June 1 to get out of here."
College Sophomore,2,"Poor accommodation of student ideas, desires, and needs and long distance from my home."
College Sophomore,2,"awful administration, bad food, bad area, too expensive for what you get"
College Freshman,2,"The campus is really small but people still want to party, there isn't a big enough place to have people in the dorms"
College Sophomore,2,"Food on campus isn't the greatest.  There are 4 places to eat.  The dining hall is good for breakfast and usually lunch, but the dinner options aren't very appealing.  1855 has good food, but is more expensive and has a limited menu.  MacKenzie's is more casual with options like chicken wings and pizza.  Lines are usually pretty quick and some of the food is decent.  Simeon's has limited hours and requires reservations.  The food is expensive (but not really that much better), but the more secluded and quiet location is nice for special dinners.  Meal cards can also be used at Sweeny's, a small grocery store-style shop with snack foods, boxed and canned goods, and drinks."
College Freshman,2,"Not much diversity on campus, most people seem to be the same and other than the few international students their isn't a lot of variety of people."
College Freshman,2,"Besides intramural softball, the program is poorly organized and attended. There are a good number of student athletes, but the contests are not well attended. Women's Ice Hockey is nationally ranked."
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot of diversity on campus and very few international students. There are a good number of people with different sexual orientations. Despite the limited diversity, everyone is accepted, and there is no tolerance for hateful comments and actions. Economic background does not play a role whatsoever in the social scene."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is right on the edge of the sketchy part of town. You must be careful walking around campus, but the campus itself is very safe. The college has a community service requirement in an effort to improve its relationship with the surrounding community. A car is needed to get to the mall and other chain stores and restaurants, but everyone is allowed to have a car on campus without an additional fee.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Say for an example you live in Pennsylvania, you have to transfer bus to bus just to get back home from Elmira which runs you about $100+ dollars. The campus is small so there is no need for shuttle buses but the transportation (locally) have random times and its not always helping to people who have classes to get through during the day or night time and its really not safe to walk around Elmira."
College Sophomore,2,They need to update a lot of things and add variety to the food and the gym
College Junior,2,The public bus schedule is convoluted. The long distance bus has no student discount and is relatively expensive for short distance trips of a few hours.
College Senior,2,We don't really need transportation at our school since parking is free. There is a bus that runs back and forth from the mall.
College Freshman,2,Nightlife is basically restricted to campus activities.  The town of Elmira is very small and not a lot of clubs or off campus parties to be found.  Students are encouraged to stay on campus and be involved with school related activities.
College Sophomore,2,In my opinion the Majors  at Elmira College would be better if therewas a larger variety of teacher. I started out as a French Major my freshman year and all of the French classes that I needed to take were taught by the same person. And I also had that same teacher for one of my core classes. That's too many classes with the same person. Especially in one year. I feel like there should be more professors in order to give variety and let students experience different teaching styles.
College Junior,2,the campus is very small and transportation is not needed. every building on campus is located within a 5 minuet walk of my dorm. buses are available for off campus transportation however friends with cars make transportation much easier.
College Freshman,2,"I Guess the Guys Are Attractive – The guys I have met on campus seem friendly and willing to help answer questions, so, in my opinion, they are genuinely well-mannered and also very athletic. The girls on campus and around town seem to think they're attractive, therefore, they must be."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, campus officials are fair and flexible with general student activities, e.g. joking around, mild horseplay, etc. as long as no one gets hurt. However, if someone is using racial slurs, injures another person, or engages in any other activity that could hinder their academic integrity, e.g. plagiarism, drug use, etc., campus officials will quickly take action to resolve these matters. There are emergency call buttons located throughout the campus, many are in and around the dormitories, to alert security of urgent matters that require immediate attention."
College Freshman,2,Network Reliability and Speed – The wireless internet in the library is spotty and the wired internet in the dorm rooms is slow due to the amount of traffic.
College Senior,2,"There is a fair amount of parking considering the amount of cars on campus, however safety is very inadequate. There is little lighting, no blue boxes, and obscure rules about where and when to park that are not clearly defined."
College Senior,2,"For the most part, Elmira College is made up of a mostly white Christian community of students from smaller towns."
College Freshman,2,"Athletic Centers – There are the ""domes"" where most of athletic activity takes place. It is about 15 minutes off campus, so it is a hassle to get there for practice and/or games"
College Freshman,2,The fields are located at an off campus facility which is inconvenient. Lacrosse was a joke the coaches never taught anything and i did not feel as though i got better. I hope all athletics are not like that. The hockey and volleyball games were fun to go to.
College Senior,2,"Little money is spent on the upkeep of existing buildings while a large portion has been funnelled into the new dorm Meier Hall.  Money could have been better spent on getting wireless for all dorms, or hiring an exterminator for the mice problems instead of purchasing ultra-rare purple wood from the Amazon or all of the unnessary lavish expenses made for Meier Hall.  

In addition, the option of living off campus in the surrounding houses (Gold House, Yellow House, Gray House, and Halfway House) was recently taken away, forcing all students to pay full costs of living, an extremely unpopular decision among the students."
College Senior,2,"Most of the building are aesthetically pleasing however, many do not serve their intended purpose.  Due to the increase of student population, there are far too many students for the facilities.  The Dining Hall tends to be generally crowded and ill fitting to handle the lunch rush in an effective manner, the gym only has a handful of machines, leaving people waiting to workout."
College Junior,2,"Tradtions Are Important – Elmira College considers its traditions very important, sometimes a little too important. Practically everything on campus is purple, as the schools colors are purple and gold. It gets annoying after a few years of being around it."
College Senior,2,Theyre Always Different – Every person who gets in trouble receives a different punishment for the same offense.
College Senior,2,Unfair Bias – our teams are perform poorly and too much money goes towards them  getting perks not all the rest of our students are able to get. Our facilities are lacking and you have to travel 20 minutes to be at our old decrepit athletics building.
College Senior,2,The older upperclassman buildings cannot compare to Meier Hall. Too expensive.
College Senior,2,"Elmira is not a booming college town. The college makes it clear they don't want us to travel off campus on weekends or at night. S.A.B. puts a great number of activities on for us to do, but they spend too much money on things that don't matter to us!"
College Senior,2,"Lots of White Students – The only diversity you see on our campus is the color of purple and gold paper we use! If you look at our student body, it is a mostly upper middle class, white, suburban kids."
College Senior,2,All facilities on campus have been getting renovations. The only dorm that is completely up to date is Meier Hall.
College Junior,2,Rain Is a Disaster – Rain turns the campus into a swamp and makes it impossible to get to class without wading through a small lake.
College Senior,2,"Bring Your Car With You – Really, your options are 1)walk 2)bus or taxi 3)pray to God your friend agrees to drive you where you wanna go. You should just avoid option number 2 at all costs. The taxis are so sketchy and just like the bus, completely unreliable. Walking isn't bad, depending where you're going and what time of day it is. Your best bet is to either bring your car with you on campus or have a friend with a car."
College Senior,2,"Failure of Epic Proportions – The food is quite possibly the WORST part about this school. There is some sort of rotation of dishes so the same ""food"" comes around every few weeks. I use the term ""food"" here very loosely because I'm almost certain that it does not even meet my dog's standards of eatable, and she eats out of litter boxes. 
 The actual food area itself is abysmal, as well. There is very little room and during the lunchtime and dinner rushes you could be waiting in line for half an hour before you even get near food. 
 The only place that I don't mind eating is 1855 on the first floor of the Campus Center. The food is usually pretty good; however it lacks variety. 
 Sweeney's is another nice aspect because they carry groceries, such as loaves of bread, pasta, big bags of chips, etc, which is convenient if you don't have a way of getting to a grocery store.
 One thing I wish the meal plan could do is be used at off-campus dining places. People with special dietary needs can use it to buy food at Wegman's, but other than that your meal plan is for on-campus use only."
Junior,1,Res. Life was AWFUL.  The dorms were nice but when I was being stalked and harassed by a fellow student Res. Life said that it was my fault and refused to help me.  They also lied to me and said that there was a non-contact order but such an order was never given.  Also my academic advisor gave me no real guidence and failed to guide me towards classes to help me pick a major.
Freshman,1,"Great professors, who are willing to help. I did well myself, but the grading process is very strict and it makes it a much harder transfer process. The three terms also make it extremely difficult to transfer. Many students are transferring this year; this school is not worth the money. Go to a state school if you want the same experience, with more freedoms, or actually use the money Elmira would cost, for a better school. The sports are lack-luster (serious dual sport athlete) and many lies are produced. The trainers are amazing for the athlete, but the school is cheap enough to make an athlete wait three weeks before getting imaging for an injury (insurance $$). The party scene has been slowly getting shutdown and the bars are the only option at the end of the night; the dorms are made for very quiet pre-gaming. The only reason I would like to stay is because of the people I have met, who share in the misery. I feel i would be more productive elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,Alcohol is constantly present. You always know where the parties are at. Some people don't want to live in certain dorms because they're known for parties.
College Freshman,1,We don't have the option to live off campus unless you are 25 or married.
College Freshman,1,"The food makes so many people sick, the workers aren't sanitary, the workers make me feel uncomfortable eating the food."
College Junior,1,Nothing goes on because so many people have been written up fro noise complaints and alcohol.
College Sophomore,1,"There are VERY few things to do off campus, besides driving 15-20 minutes to go to the mall/watch a movie. There isn't a very big connection between the locals and the students.  The area around the college is pretty sketchy and isn't the safest.  It isn't a good idea to walk off-campus at night.  There are things to do in the greater area, but little public transportation.  Some of the nicer places are Tanglewood (good hiking trails and amazing views), Harris Hill (a small amusement park that looks like it is still the 50s), and Eldridge Park. The locals directly surrounding the college aren't the most trust-worthy, but others within the town are usually very friendly."
College Freshman,1,Unless one has a guardian you are unable to live off campus
College Sophomore,1,"We always have incident reports sent to our emails weeks after the incident saying students have been insulted, touched or have stolen from them. Security does not really walk around at all, they don't even see them during the day as much. My friend works in the security office and she said the securities just play games on the computer."
College Freshman,1,"There is not really alot around town. Elmira is a very small city that is mostly only known for it's prison. There are some really bad areas of town that should be avoided. However, you will find some small family restaurants that end up being really great. Also, there are the basic brand name stores like Wal-mart, Target, Wegmans, Bed Bath and Beyond and some others. There is a small mall, but it is kind of disappointing, it does have a movie theatre though, oh and a tattoo/piercing shop."
College Junior,1,"Social life at Elmira College is so bad it shouldn't even be called a social life. The on campus parties are lame all it is is a bunch of people standing around a room drinking. Depending on which RLC is on duty depends on whether or not the party will go on past 1. Most of us start drinking at nine when we do go out and most of us are in bed by one. That can be a positive for most but going to bed because it's too boring is not a good thing. There is only a few bars around town, literally three, they do not allow underage kids in and they are just bars. There are no clubs or basically anything fun to do."
College Sophomore,1,A ton of white kids. Barely anyone of any other ethncity beside international students
College Junior,1,"Student Demographics Are Not Diverse – Many of the students at EC are generally from the same demographic, and worse, many of these people are not entirely accepting of others. This makes creating a campus community difficult."
College Junior,1,"Only Within 50 Miles – Well elmira college only allows students to live off campus, if:
1. They live within 50 miles of the campus 
2. They have lived with the area for 2 years minimum
This eliminates the option of renting out apartments for students, unless they have family in the area."
Recent Alumnus,1,This is a school for conservatives. We're very cut-off from the community of Elmira (town). Don't come here if you're a free spirit.
Recent Alumnus,1,"NOT ALLOWED – You are not allowed to live off-campus at Elmira College unless your parents live within 50 miles of the school or you are an independent student (i.e.: 25yr old, married, have children)"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not a College Town – The town of Elmira hates our college and doesn't offer any special discounts for students. There are a few decent restaurants in the town, but mostly it's just fast food and chains. I recommend Pietro's, a block from campus, and Beijing Gardens in downtown Elmira for off-campus eats. Since Elmira College requires you to live on-campus and have a full meal plan, eating off-campus isn't cost-effective."
College Senior,1,"We're Not Babies – This school is very strict on stupid things, and being an RA i can see that first hand. I understand that you want to look out for the safety of the students, but really you're going to charge someone $25 for a non used candle in a dorm room? remember the days when smoking in a room was okay?
I know of other schools that are a lot less strict on policies like alcohol and things of that nature."
College Freshman,1,"Elmira is one of the most (if not the most) strict colleges I have seen ever on punishing students.  You have to keep your nose clean or you will get punished.  A little too extreme in all honesty.  Again, it's college.  Let the students live a little."
College Freshman,1,"Living Restrictions Are Ridiculous – Residence Life Coordinators are really strict about Freshmen having to live with someone at all times. If a roommate leaves they are required to find a new one as soon as possible, regardless of the situation. Also, students are not allowed to live with other students from the same high school or town. My theory is: If you get along with the person you want to live with, then what is the problem exactly?? It's up to the student to socialize with others if they so choose, but the college should not force them to."

Freshman,5,"The Community here is absolutely amazing, the people are very friendly, welcoming, and very helpful. The amount of faculty also means you are never short of help and often have very personal relationships with your professors."
Junior,5,The professors did really well with meeting the students needs as we all tried to adjust to the new situation
Sophomore,5,"The teachers are very knowledgeable, the campus is beautiful and it is a very Catholic place. You can pray the rosary at the grotto, go to mass every day as there are many chapels and time choices. There are always activities available on campus. so you don't really need to leave."
Freshman,5,I love Benedictine College for its many opportunities. I have made many friends here. I love the community we all have here with each other. The professors and classmates are great and I am always having fun. I wish the campus food was a little better.
Freshman,5,It is a place where you can get into your catholic faith. The people are very nice. My teacers were great and they really cared about the students.
Sophomore,5,"An overall excellent School, great academics and excellent professors who are invested in each student. Administration can be difficult to work with, residents life office is very bad at their job, which is unacceptable considering it is a resident school, and cafeteria food is awful."
Sophomore,5,The community at Benedictine is absolutely amazing... the professors are willing to help whenever you need and are authentically invested in your education.
Sophomore,5,"Benedictine is incredible! As a student pursuing a degree in science, the basis of liberal arts academics equips me to competently communicate knoweldge and understanding with peers and professionals in my field of study."
Sophomore,5,"Benedictine College is vibrant with the light of Christ while still having strong academics, even in STEM!"
Alum,5,"I am always amazed at how BC isn't ranked higher in every category--Not only did I love my time at Benedictine as a student, as an athlete, and as a Catholic, I can say that it prepared me very well to succeed in graduate (Law) school. You get from Benedictine what you put into it. Do you want college to be easy? Then you can take easy classes. Do you want college to be challenging? It won't be impossible, but it's worth it to take the harder professors and classes. BC's athletics are supurb compared to the other teams we play--the level of coaching staff, the facilities, the teams--everything. I think a good factor to determine whether a college is suceeding or not is by looking at the student participation at campus events. BC often has more fans at away-games than the home team does. That speaks volumes. The professors are wonderful and will work through anything with you--they are at BC because they want to be, not because they have to be. I'm very proud to be a Raven alumn."
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at BC. The campus culture is fantastic, and everyone here is so welcoming, on top of receiving a great education!"
Alum,5,"Benedictine is what you make it. Some of my peers and friends had a poor experience with the academics or the social life – but they also took the ""easy A"" classes that didn't require much effort and therefore didn't teach much, didn't push themselves to take harder but more stimulating classes that could have only earned them a B, and didn't seek out supportive friend groups. In my experience, and those of other friends of mine, most of the professors at Benedictine are happy to teach you as much as you want to know, there are many social opportunities for everyone regardless of whether you're Catholic or from the Midwest or in sports or not, and yes, there are real parties if you know where to look! The monks on campus even brew their own beer. So if you're going to college to get the piece of paper and get out...yes, you can do that at Benedictine. But if you're going to learn as much as possible, then also yes. You can definitely do that."
Senior,5,"I love Benedictine College, from the professors, to the classes, to the vibrant faith life, to the other students. Benedictine - as a liberal arts college - does not merely focus on preparing each student according to a major, but focuses on giving the student the best of everything, including a well-rounded education."
Sophomore,5,"Attending Benedictine College was the best decision I have ever made. The atmosphere around the entire campus is beautiful and it is fully engrossed in the Catholic faith. Everyone is truly looking out to make your experience the best it can be, and it is easy to find a friendly face anywhere on or off campus."
Senior,5,"Benedictine is a place you'll love to call home. The community, education, and general atmosphere is second to none."
Freshman,5,"Benedictine College is a small liberal arts school, with a population of only a couple thousand. The benefits here are amazing, everyone is kind and helpful, and always willing to study with you. Located in the middle of campus is the student success center which is there as a study space or a space that anyone can go to if they need free tutoring!"
Sophomore,5,Benedictine College is a great college for anyone to attend. The atmosphere is very friendly. I would recommend anyone to come here. The professors are determined to teach and help the students with anything and everything.
Sophomore,5,The community is fantastic and there is an effort from the faculty and staff to really know the students.
Freshman,5,"Absolutely amazing school! There are courses for every interest, and you are exposed to so many different courses as a liberal arts college. The pillar of the college are upheld, and even though it may seem strange to live on campus all four years it is a blessing in the long run! Highly recommend Benedictine to everyone!"
Niche User,5,Wonderful college!  God is truly present!  The staff and professors made me feel at home right away.  Have the opportunity to pray with the monks was truly a blessing.  I know that I will grow in my Catholic faith at this college.
Works Here,5,Benedictine College is a wonderful learning environment where the faculty and staff are always willing to help. The campus is beautiful!
Sophomore,5,The people at Benedictine are such kind and loving people.  The community at Benedictine is amazing that is one thing I am going to miss when I graduate is being sounded by such loving people.  The faith life on campus is also great everyone loves Jesus and is not afraid to share their faith.  One thing I wish would change is for our cafeteria to have better food.
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience getting my BA in Journalism & Mass Communications at Benedictine College. The community, spirit, and faith life are outstanding! The people I met here became more than just friends...they are family!"
Alum,5,I graduated from Benedictine and now my daughter goes to school at BC.  She loves it.  The students at this school are genuinely happy and they like their classes and teachers.  Other schools we visited the churches were empty.  This school has two churches and many chapels on campus and they are full every day. They have done so much to the campus.  The new dorms are beautiful.  They are just building a new Science building that will be state-of-the-art.  You can actually get to know your teachers.  Benedictine College is a wonderful place to spend your college years.
Sophomore,5,"Becoming a student at Benedictine College has become a great opportunity. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. The professors do everything in their power to try to help you in class. Whether it is getting help on an upcoming exam, explaining the assignments, or simply giving advice, they always make themselves available. There is always fun activities happening on campus as well. People come together to enjoy sports, holidays, dances, club activities, and many more things! Having the opportunity to study abroad is also a bonus. I love being able to experience all of the Benedictine traditions."
Niche User,5,I think Benedictine is an amazing school that provides multiple opportunities for students to flourish and succeed.
Freshman,5,Benedictine is an amazing school with a great community and awesome professors! It's a small school so it's very easy to get to know people and get involved with things! There are always events going on that are a lot of fun and are also a great way to get to know people! Also the Catholic community here is amazing! Mass and confession at so many times you have to try to miss it!
Freshman,5,Benedictine College is a wonderful small college. It has such a strong and great community. The relationship between the professors and students is exceptional. The classes are small so the professor gets to know every student on a personal level.
College Junior,5,"I cannot imagine myself anywhere other than Benedictine College. It is a place that challenges everyone to be the best versions of themselves. We have great school pride, and our community is truly like family."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Benedictine! Most of the students, faculty, and staff are very friendly and really care about you as a person. The professors push students to learn and critically think about things."
College Junior,5,I had an amazing year i learned alot from all my classes and it was so worth going to school. I would say it was my dream college and one i would never forget the rest of my life. I really liked the music at the school it was so awesome and all my friends i made through different events and all. Its unique because its a liberal arts Catholic College. Because of all the friends i made and how friendly people were and and how fun the classes were.
College Freshman,5,It's a well known school and advisers help alot
College Freshman,5,"I love this school, and almost every aspect"
College Freshman,5,Athletics here are  fun even for non athletes
College Freshman,5,Great relationships w/ students & Professors
College Freshman,5,The campus feels extremely safe and security is constantly monitoring it.
College Freshman,5,The classes and professors are of the highest quality.
College Freshman,5,Studying liberal arts makes one better qualified for any job.
College Sophomore,5,"Benedictine has a large alumni network, and nearly all of the faculty have significant experience outside of the college and help significantly with finding internships and, later, jobs after college."
College Sophomore,5,"Benedictine has been a great fit for me so far! I have had the opportunity to make a wide variety of friends and have so many amazing experiences, all within a strong community of faith."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are interested in you as a person, and the classes are interesting and challenging. The work load is not too bad, and the study spaces are nice. The small class size makes it easy to engage"
College Freshman,5,"a good Engendering program and Faith Family and Friends,"
College Junior,5,"As an engineering major at Benedictine, the future is very bright. The Engineering department has an excellent placements rating withing two years, and is rapidly becoming one of the best engineering programs in the United States."
College Junior,5,"I really enjoy the community and family atmosphere. Everybody is so nice and welcoming to the new students and all of the professors know their students by name instead of a number, and whenever you need help or have questions, they are more than happy to help."
College Junior,5,"Benedictine College has been an amazing experience, so far. I would highly recommend it as a strong candidate to anyone searching for a school that will challenge them to be the best they can be. All of my experiences with the school have been nothing but positive, from the courses to the extracurriculars to the the professors. It's a small school, which makes it perfect to really find your niche and stand out!"
College Sophomore,5,"The best college for growing men and women of faith, scholarship, leadership and service."
College Junior,5,"I am so happy to be attending Benedictine College! Given that I will be an adult when I graduate college, and I was an adolescent when I entered college, I firmly believe Benedictine College is where I will become the kind of adult I want to be. The formation and traditions at Benedictine really foster a great sense of community on campus. 

The curriculum is challenging and even the coaches acknowledge that academics come first. There is also a strong network of alumni who keep in contact with the college so I know I will be able to find a job after I graduate. Employers who currently have Benedictine alumni employed at their company, or attended Benedictine themselves, know the type of person who graduates from Benedictine College. At Benedictine, the focus is not only on forming one's mind but rather the focus is in forming the whole human person."
College Sophomore,5,The BC Teacher Education Department really prepares their students for the field. They get the students in the classroom observing and teaching as soon and as often as they can.
College Sophomore,5,My professors really care and it shows in the content of their lessons. They are great at answering unexpected questions and try to uphold a reasonable work load. They have office hours available and are willing to meet with students for extra help.
College Sophomore,5,I can't imagine going somewhere else. The relationships I have fostered and the knowledge I will leave with will carry me throughout life.
College Sophomore,5,"There is no place I'd rather be. The people here are what make the school: the professors are amazing and are passionate about their subject and their students and the other students build up a community. There is a variety of majors, classes, and class styles. Class sizes are perfect, around 20-30 students."
College Sophomore,5,I've never had a problem with feeling unsafe on campus and I've used the health center a few times and have appreciated it being there.
College Sophomore,5,"Compared to Stuebenville College and other Catholic colleges that I looked at, Benedictine was and probably still is the most affordable with some good scholarship and financial aide opportunities."
College Freshman,5,I love the building I live in. Everyone is friendly and enjoys living there!
College Junior,5,"Truthfully, we don't have a lot of variety in sexual orientation, but that's the way the cookie crumbles. At a Catholic college, it isn't expected. We do have quite a few different political views though, and one can always find a good debate happening in the political department. Acceptance is high too. A main facet of our faith is to love everyone. True, we're college kids and fail sometimes, however the failure is never severe and a lesson is always learned."
College Sophomore,5,"When you think about Catholic relationships, that's my school. Everyone is very courteous to one another, they dress pretty modestly, and mostly you date to marry. But I'm ok with that. It seems more genuine than relationships that the media represents."
College Junior,5,"I love living on campus.  No building is more that 10 minutes (if you walk slow) away from any of your classes.  The dorms are single sex and have visitation rules, but the rules are not overly strict (between 12 pm and 12 am on week days; 12 pm and 1:30 am on weekends); there is still plenty of room to hang out with friends of the other gender.  I am a supporter of the visitation policy, because it makes it easier to make friends with the people in your dorm.  I am able to make close friendships with other girls, without guys being in the way.  In my dorm freshman year there was a chapel, which I could visit 24/7 and which had Eucharistic Adoration during the week.  The staff is friendly - we have great RAs and RDs."
College Junior,5,"Benedictine College does a great job of creating sensible policies to encourage student growth in their residence halls.  Residence Halls are a safe haven for community, rest, and studiousness."
College Freshman,5,"There is strong policy enforcement which hinders some students from using drugs and alcohol, but in all honestly there is no pressure to be involved in the ""party scene"". The school is wonderful at planning alcohol free events."
College Freshman,5,"While the above questions may make the school sound strict, I am confident that all rules are designed for students to have the best experience while here; to keep students safe, healthy, and happy."
Freshman,4,"I didn't take any classes online, but I've heard nothing but good about them! They don't have the community that regular classes do but from an academic standpoint they're still very good."
Junior,4,"Overall Benedictine is great! However, some things I wish had been different was the obvious catering towards athletes simply because they were athletes"
Niche User,4,"I did not take any online classes from this school, but I heard from friends that they were sufficiently well taught."
Freshman,4,Benedictine College is a very prestigious catholic college. Benedictines academics are top-notch and the professors are very helpful.
Freshman,4,Benedictine College is a great community environment. Where ever you go on campus people know your name. You truly get an at-home feeling when you are on campus. The connections that are made with the professors are ones that will help you excel in life when it comes to letters of recommendation for graduate school and beyond. The friends that I have made are now my closest friends. There are such strong bonds that are formed between us because the campus is so small. But it is a good and comfortable small. It is small enough to know everyone but it still feels big walking around campus. Overall it is an amazing school highly recommend.
Freshman,4,I have had an overall very good experience so far at Benedictine College.  My professors have done a good job teaching me the material and helping me when I need it.  I have excelled in my classes and there is a great community here.  The main thing I would like to see changed is the food.
Freshman,4,"As only a freshman, I can only speak from a small pool of experience. But so far the professors seem genuinely interested in students and happy to help. The dining hall food is absolutely atrocious."
Sophomore,4,"Hi, My name is Tj and I'm a Sophmore at Benedictine College. I'm pretty involved on campus and also participate in a varsity sport, football. I think Benedictine provides a great education and many opportunities and majors for any prospective student. Benedictine is also a religious-affiliated school but doesn't push a student to convert in any way or form. The school is very open-minded and gives welcoming arms to all students. Since I've been at benedictine, I've had the chance to create great relationships with friends, teachers, and coaches; relationships that I don't think would compare anywhere else. If a student wants a smaller college community, close relationships with their professors, and a place to grow. Benedictine is the perfect place to stop."
Niche User,4,What I love about Benedictine is that you are given so many oppertunities to grow in the community and it is all up to you to take or waste those opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"I loved the campus very much. The people I met there are fantastic, and you really feel at home when you're there. The academics are good - challenging, but not impossible. I found the professors to be great. They all want you to succeed and are very friendly and willing to help."
Sophomore,4,"Benedictine College provides the ideal Catholic liberal arts college experience but has lots of small annoyances such as expensive tuition, additional fees, strict dorm rules and options, and mediocre to bad food. The professors are great, knowledgeable, and genuinely care for you. The Catholic presence on the campus is genuine but not too oppressive. It is a small campus. The college has a surprisingly big emphasis on sports. Overall a great school."
Senior,4,"Loved everything about my 4 years a Benedictine except the food service and the town location. The environment is great, and the campus is beautiful, made life long friends here and they honestly have a great Business program that I was not expecting from such a small school. Faith life is wonderful and totally accessible, but not forced down your throat."
Junior,4,"Good looking campus with new buildings. Has a super-friendly atmosphere, though you'll have to make your own friends (if that makes sense). Tuition is expensive--that's the con."
Freshman,4,"Benedictine College is a good small school that has a great community and has a strong Catholic atmosphere. I like the relationship between the students and faculty and that every teacher knows their students. The one thing that is not as good is the price. Benedictine is very expensive and most people should expect to acquire a lot of debt by the time they are done with college. Overall though, the college has a beautiful campus and I would definitely recommend attending if you have the financial means and don't mind being surrounded by  a lot of Catholic cultures."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the sense of community that the give provides through events presented by college and the living environments. Not only is there a good community here but the people here are really welcoming and kind. People will hold doors for one another, use manners, and want to get to know strangers. The down side at this school is that the food is not the best and there are a lot of religious people here who do seem to judge."
Senior,4,Benedictine College is a place where faith and learning are the fundamentals of their teachings. The faith is showed by almost everyone on campus from the monks who live in the abbey to the professors teaching all of the classes. The campus is beautiful and has a wide variety of aesthetically pleasing attributes as well as almost always having activities on campus for everyone to participate in.
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus, wonderful faith-life integrated in the education, hopeful to be a student there soon!"
Freshman,4,"I Love Benedictine College. There are many positives and negatives throughout the campus but the experience here is unlike any other. There is never a day that goes by, or even really an hour, that you do not see happy people and smiling faces ready to talk. Yes, there are a lot of Friday night Parties. Yes, Whiskey Wednesday's are a thing. The people at Benedictine College though are unbeatable. Anyone that goes here will truly be touched"
Freshman,4,"Benedictine College is a great experience for me. I love the community and faith there. It's a small community, so I get to know people as well as the professors get to know students better. I can ask professors questions and get a lot of help from them. They know our names well, and it truly feels like a family. I have made great friends there who have supported me a lot. And the faith is so strong that I have grown up  so much spiritually."
College Junior,4,"Professors really care about students, and classes are small that there is plenty of one on one opportunities with professors."
College Junior,4,Athletic programs greatly add to the community and the environment of the school but don't provide much excitement and entertainment.
College Junior,4,Athletes have a huge role on campus and are just as involved and dedicated as other students. They help the whole school get excited about supporting our teams.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at BC are great and they truly care about the education we are receiving. Class sizes are very small and personal, and the professors are very knowledgeable about the subjects they teach."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel really safe on campus and I'm fine walking across campus alone at night. There have been a couple lockdowns due to a shooting in town and a threat, but the res life staff did a good job to make sure we were safe, and the issues were resolved quickly."
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part you are required to live on campus since we are a residential college. I feel like there are a decent amount of living options available, but only if room draw works in your favor. Some of the buildings are a little old and run down, but nothing you can't live with (except the flooding in first floor McDonald). The sense of community you get from living on campus is great and I would take that over a nice off campus apartment any day (not that they have those in Atchison)."
College Sophomore,4,"I would definitely recommend living on campus at least one year for the experience of community, which includes fun, faith, and scholarship.  If you're in a nice dorm with a good roommate and most of the other residents are solid, then you will have a good experience.  I lived in the dorm last year and it was good because I became independent, was able to participate in the activities sponsored by the Resident Assistants (RAs), and become part of a great community of girls!  Now I would like to have my family living close so that I could live with them and commute because I love my family and it would be cheaper.  But that not being the case, I'm looking forward to being back in the dorm, building new friendships and enjoying fun, faith, and scholarship with other girls my age.  Our RAs were always helpful and cared about us."
College Sophomore,4,"I would rate Benedictine College in Atchison, KS. as a great school because of the experience I've had with my professors and the Catholic opportunities on campus.  My professors are always willing and eager to help me if I have a problem and they care about my long-term career goals and offer helpful advice in obtaining them.  The best part about Benedictine are the opportunities/means offered to grow in my Catholic Faith.  Having a chapel in my dorm where I can stop in and visit Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament frequently throughout the day is really great, it has really helped me grow in love with Him and strengthened my faith.  Also, the multiple opportunities offered to attend Holy Mass is great because it enables me to go every day because I can always work my schedule around a Mass time."
College Junior,4,I would say the students careers have gone up there is a lot of students i have meet studying the same thing. There is a lot of alumni who work on campus and are very helpful when you need something. There are lots of ways on campus to intern for jobs at different places out side of college life.
College Junior,4,I had a wonderful experience with my professors they were great and i learned so much from them i would have never learned. I really liked all my classes i took especially my music classes i had the most fun in those because i love to sing and i love the music program alot its absolutely amazing.
College Junior,4,I feel like the safety on campus is tight we have a security guard who goes around very night and makes sure everyone is safe. When there comes a problem on campus like criminals running around there security are right there to make sure we are all safe and out of harm.
College Junior,4,I would say i really liked the dorms on campus especially living in them it was great the girls were one big family to me i never felt home sick and i really liked how we had a chapel in the basement the best thing ever and i also liked how there was daily mass offered in the chapel everyday too. The cost of the dorms is not to bad its a decent amount but overal the dorm life was the best life i could of asked for as a freshmen.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of Geeks at my school because the classes are some what hard and there are a lot of students who spend there days studying all day and so they come out of college super smart. Geek life is the same as normal life on campus i would say. There is not much difference between geek life and non geek life on campus. The housing is for everyone on campus and off campus.
College Junior,4,The athletics are fun to be around and good people. There team performance is outstanding and when they play they are wonderful to watch and also to be in the sport is a lot of Faith and fun. The school spirit is big when it comes to some of our big games of that season.
College Freshman,4,"Very safe, but the food is bad"
College Freshman,4,BC security is great and very active on campus.
College Freshman,4,"If you graduate from BC, it looks very good in the catholic atmosphere around the country."
College Freshman,4,BC sports and their facilities are amazing!
College Sophomore,4,Feel super safe on campus. But maybe overly protective. If you are even seen with a drunk girl you will likely be questioned heavily and possibly kicked out. The title IX videos are a bit over the top. Speak more about abstinence rather then safety.
College Senior,4,"Not a huge issue with drugs on campus. It's college, so it happens. But in general it is a drug-free campus. We're in Kansas, not Colorado."
College Senior,4,"Professors generally care about the students, and because the typical class is around 20-25 students it is easy to gain meaningful access to the teachers. Since it is a liberal arts school, there are a wide variety of classes and courses you can take. Depending on the major and professor, courses can be easy or difficult. It's best just to ask students or look at RateMyProfessor.com."
College Senior,4,"Benedictine is a very safe campus. Even though it has grown, it has also updated its social media and text message-based alert systems, and has hired more security staff."
College Senior,4,"Housing is great depending on where you live. The freshman men's dorms are crappy but that's par for the course at any school. McDonald Hall for sophomore girls is old and St. Joe's Hall for men is old as well. However, the other 12 or so dorms are all new and very well-kept up. They have all the modern amenities and some even look like fancy hotels. Overall, housing is very good at BC. If you don't like the prices, or just want more freedom, you can always apply for off-campus housing and deal with a landlord yourself."
College Senior,4,"I think the best aspect is that Benedictine is part of a community. There are definitely different groups on campus but in general it is small enough that it feels like a community. It's unique because it is big enough to have separate groups of friends, but at the same time there's lots of overlap. There's always a variety of school events on the weekend, and if you like to drink and party you can go to off campus house to do so."
College Senior,4,"BC has a lot of school spirit. They do a pretty good job of reminding the average student when games are and what times. School spirit can be very high, especially if it's a big game or versus a big rival (Baker U comes to mind).  Teams are very average. A few have made the national tournament recently. Women's bball got to the final four this year (2016)."
College Freshman,4,I really haven't participated in any varsity or intermural sports so I cannot fully answer this question. However there seems to be great school spirit.
College Freshman,4,"The classes are interesting, rewarding,and better than I ever expected . The professors are all wonderful,. I have met some of the most amazing, inspiring, and strongly Catholic people attending the college. I also love all of the on campus activities and events. Overall I would highly recommend this college to anyone. The only negative thing I could say about the college is that I strongly disagree with their dorm visitation policy (allowing members of the opposite sex in rooms until midnight with the door closed) and think that it is a danger to the faith which is in so many ways promoted, respected, and lived on the campus."
College Freshman,4,There are not many programs in the country that offer a Theater Arts Management degree. I believe it will be very easy for me to find a job after college.
College Freshman,4,My school has a huge staircase that connects the academic buildings with the dorms that sucks.
College Junior,4,"The requirements for getting offcampus are stupid,  meal plans are not worth your money, and tuition keeps going up a ton every year.  Courses are difficult and professors require a lot.  The community is small but comprised of very solid people.  Now if only the joke of a football program would stop taking all the money and give some of the scholarship money they give to the 200 freshmen they recruit every year to students who have more potential for success, then we would be cooking with gas."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is a generally safe place. The only times when you need to be careful is while off-campus, though even this depends on what part of town you are in."
College Sophomore,4,"As a Liberal Arts college, you are required to take a wide variety of courses across the various disciplines. This enhances the academic experience by giving each student a wide base of knowledge across multiple fields. The class sizes are relatively small and all of the faculty truly care about the students, and will generally do whatever they can if help is needed."
College Sophomore,4,"I live in Guadalupe Hall and it is great. The building is only a few years old, and so it is extremely nice."
College Sophomore,4,"The facilities are great. Intramurals are also a huge part of campus life, with several different sports going on at any given time."
College Freshman,4,"I generally feel very safe on campus. The security personnel are very kind and helpful, and faculty will help you if they are available."
College Freshman,4,"This school is well regarded, and people are happy to hire those who graduate from it"
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is stellar, and the teams are very good. Athletes are not snobby, and participate in all activities. The games are fun and have lots of support"
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are engaging and helpful. The campus is absolutely beautiful, and the academics and faith life live up to their reputation. The town is very small though, and the food is not good"
College Junior,4,Every professor I have taken a class from will go out of his way to make sure his students can succeed.
College Junior,4,"As a former varsity athlete at Benedictine, and a current participant in intramurals, I have been very pleased with the way athletic programs help build the community, but do not overshadow it."
College Junior,4,Benedictine College provides and excellent overall experience for students who are willing to make an effort.   It is hard to be an unsuccessful student if you manage your time well and make academics a priority.
Alum,2,If you don’t major in Theology chances are you won’t get along with your RAs. Also there is a curfew in place for opposite sexes to exit the others dorms. They eliminated yoga for being to “eastern”
Niche User,2,"I think Benedictine is a very mediocre education for what you are paying, hence my decision to find a better option with a greater education."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is forced 3-4 years. First year dorms are terrible. Mold in the bathroom, wood degrading, floors covered. Other dorms are new but so far from campus. Food plans are also forced for everybody. RA's are there to police for alcohol and loudness. RA jobs are to screw people over, rather than help them."
College Sophomore,2,"Everybody is quite fake. Small and rumor filled. Felt like I was in high school again. Very immature people that claim to be religious, yet are not very helpful to their neighbor and very prejudice. Other than the school the town was very cool, but small. People of Atchison are pretty chill."
College Sophomore,2,"Female sports are decent, but nobody really cares. 

Football team has over 200 kids on their team and it's purpose is to create a larger enrollment rather than win games.

Facilities suck, they have a new rec center but is still sub par in size and equipment. School spirit is fake and only for football in the first quarter when everybody is still trashed."
College Junior,2,The security guards and faculty would bust you for not combing your hair if it were illegal.
College Junior,2,Trying to make a small Catholic school a sports powerhouse is unrealistic.
College Senior,2,"teachers are scared to teach the subject due to over sensitivity of the students. Anything that is somewhat not with or against the churches teachings is forgotten about in all subjects. there is no Woman's history month and no Women's studies class... there is way too much that each subject misses due to its nature, because it is too explicit. too many students are sheltered and the teachers do not help with worldly exposure at all. just about the only subject that they teach very well here is theology and it is not worldly study of theology or worldly religious, it is one sided catholic theology!!! teachers are mostly one sided on many topics and are extremely pushy towards the catholic religion!"
College Senior,2,Small town. almost too small. there is not much in atchison. not too many grocery stores. the ones they have here are pretty bad and there are not that many options. walmart is pretty limited as well.
College Senior,2,MEH not worth the money! parents love this place. It is super religious. There are way too many homeschoolers and teachers are too scared to teach their subjects!
College Senior,2,the health department is seldom available at any convenient times. i have also been turned away. we were promised healthcare here and i have not received any. I had to go to the hospitals family clinic to be treated for illness both times i needed some sort of prescription.
College Senior,2,there is not very many options off campus so if you go here get used to the horrible cafeteria food!
College Senior,2,you will never go out to meet people. it is the same people at the parties all the time. it is usually just a place to get drunk. and parties do not happen on campus.. i am truly wondering why that is an option. if they are on campus it is not a party.
College Senior,2,"sometimes I just want to say that they are doing their job. The RAs or at least the ones in the female dorms are looking for trouble and are very nosy. They treat everyone like a criminal. You are treated as if guilty before it is proven. The rules are very strict. The school is a wet campus but the rules are so strict that the campus is still not treated like a wet campus. The visitation rules are way over the top. There is no one of the opposite sex in your dorm from 12am to 11:59am. This rule is very strictly enforced and there is much shame associated with even a small slip up. Everyone in authority then assumes that something dirty was happening. There is also a huge stigma around sex in general around the entire campus even though it happens. Bodies are shameful as well. Way too much in the media, tv, websites, movies, the plays that the college puts on itself the content is strictly monitered or blocked due to ""explicit"" nature.  Come On We Are All Adults!"
College Senior,2,"The food is really really really really really bad quality. You are forced to pay for a meal plan. You cannot serve yourself in the cafeteria. While you are being served certain proportions of food they judge how much they serve you based on your size. The food gets very old after a while and there are few options. the rotation of food is very basic and not varied at all. It is sad that they throw away so much food. some entire servings of meat are almost entirely fat. Everything is over cooked, under cooked and soaked in water or grease."
College Senior,2,I'm sooo sorry to say this but this school has tiny dorms. You pay a lot to go to this school and the dorms inside and out do not show for this. compared to my high school dorm my college dorm at BC was TERRIBLE!!!! You do not get what you pay for at all!
College Freshman,2,"You have Paoluccis, an Italian restaurant, and two sports bars, in Atchison. Being in the midwest, even in a very small city, fast food is big options include McDonalds, Long John Silvers, Dairy Queen, Taco Bell/KFC, Sonic, and Subway.  For more options drive the 25 or so minutes to St. Joseph or hour to Kansas City."
College Freshman,2,"Like any college you will be able to get away with a few things in dorms, but the opposite sex is not allowed in dorms from noon to midnight. You get what you expect coming to small, private, liberal, arts college."
College Freshman,2,"Not the worst, most weekends there will be a few off campus parties, but beware its the same people every party, every year. Parties here are usually small and are manly used as a place to get inebriated, not to hook up or meet new people. Most parties will get shut down by the police before midnight, especially the decent ones. Notable exceptions to a tame party scene are Toga Tuesday, and Springfest, both fun events where it feels like the entire school parties throughout the day and in the surrounding neighborhood and houses."
College Freshman,2,"Its serviceable but compared to other schools I have been to the variety is bad, quality is not good, being healthy is somewhat difficult. MCI, the schools restaurant is improving but the cafeteria has long lines, and is very slow."
College Junior,2,"Students are encouraged to stay on campus for their entire college career. It has its pros and cons, but the gist is that you can either wait in trepidation to get off campus, or be happy with one of the on campus apartments. Hopefully you can find three other students you like well enough to cook for."
College Sophomore,2,Basically have a car or know someone with a car or walk wherever you want to go.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like I am one of the few students in a lower economic status. Because the school is so expensive, only students with a lot of money or students on athletic scholarship can afford to come here. If it weren't for student athletes, we would have almost no ethnic heritage diversity. But this is because a Catholic Liberal Arts college attracts a very particular kind of student."
College Sophomore,2,"The school keeps 80% of student on campus, so it is difficult to live in an off-campus house."
College Sophomore,2,This is a very expensive school to attend. I need more financial aid. I worked two jobs this semester and took 18 credits because it is so expensive to go here. I could use some more scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,"Most students use personal laptops, so labs are not entirely necessary. However, the wifi is very unreliable, though we pay 250$ for it a semester."
College Sophomore,2,"The night life is basically parties at off-campus houses. Dorms hold campus-wide events on some Friday nights, but those end by 10pm."
College Sophomore,2,hardly no transportation provided by the school
College Sophomore,2,Not the best off campus housing at all
College Freshman,2,"Except for the three restaurants (Peppermill, Maria's, Willie's), basically just fast food."
College Freshman,2,"With a few exceptions, the only male black students at BC are football or basketball players."
College Freshman,2,"Atchison is very small. It has two bars...

The only place parties can occur is off-campus houses."
College Freshman,2,The school does not allow enough off-campus living.
College Junior,2,Atchison is a great small town but like any other small town it lacks places to eat.  I would stick to Willie's and Snowball maybe Maria's if you want Mexican.
College Freshman,2,"Good fast food availability, but not convenient to campus."
College Freshman,2,"Most live on campus, ease of use and access keep people here."
College Freshman,2,"Not old enough to drink legally, and not really my thing. Rather do activities closer to campus with friends, other students."
College Senior,2,"The main cafeteria deserves an F, but overall i give it C- due to the several other locations that serve edible food with the by and large best place to eat on campus is the monte casino inn"
College Senior,2,"Off campus housing is available but due to the college's practice of only giving out spots once everything on campus is filled up, good luck actually getting off campus"
College Junior,2,Its hard to get of campus and the college is very strict about keeping students on campus.
Freshman,1,Very unprofessional RAs and administration when dealing with situations. They are more concerned about money than student safety. They do not investigate situations properly. Wouldn't dare return to this school. Worst experience ever.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life except for the kids who proclaim themselves as a frat. Just throwing parties and trying to be too cool.
College Senior,1,Tthere is no greek life at BC I feel like I missed out on having this as an option in college. I didn't realize that there was no greek life here when I applied because I didnt even care to look. however the option of taking part in greek life is something I wish I experienced!
College Freshman,1,It is almost impossible to get wireless internet on campus.  Some rooms have plug in internet and some do not.  I wish there were printers in more than just one location.
College Sophomore,1,We need a new catering company. Aramark is not cutting it.
College Sophomore,1,This school does not offer Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,Poor town and pretty ugly
College Sophomore,1,too hard to get off campus
College Sophomore,1,Some of the policies are no good at all.
College Sophomore,1,"Being in the little town of Atchison there is very few options of off-campus dining options, mainly fast food and a few sit down restaurants but not much."
College Freshman,1,I go to Benedictine DESPITE Atchison
College Sophomore,1,The majority are Catholic home schoolers with conservative tendencies given this their mostly white and privileged. Athletes make up the majority of our ethnic diversity and there are few you voice a difference of opinion. With that being said there are plenty who live of the fringe of the social norm and I have yet to see any issues that arise from their very observable presence. Though the campus as a whole is conservative Catholic they do practice the acceptance of others that they preach.
College Sophomore,1,"Its a small school and a small town. The down town area is 7 blocks away and the campus is all in easy walking distance. With the town being so small though you may want to travel to Kansas City or St. Joseph for your more specific needs, which are bot about 30 minutes away."
College Freshman,1,There is not much diversity. I am probably the most diverse person there
College Senior,1,"There are not enough computers for student use at the computer labs of Benedictine College. The labs are in use during class hours, which is the time when the computers are most needed. The computers are not the fastest, and sometimes lag or freeze. Printing is ok, but I haven't been impressed, sometimes my papers come out with blotches of ink. Printing in color is not as easy as it should be, and the college doesn't provide a direct service for that."
College Junior,1,"The off dining options in Atchison are fairly awful. There is not much to choose from. I'd say the best one is McDonalds. It's the only one you can count on to be the cleanest. Most of the other restaurants cannot even pass their health codes like Taco Bell/KFC and Sonic. The people at the Dairy Queen are slow and very rude. The Chinese is a little unclean but good. The locally owned restaurants are good. The bars like Meullers, Willie's and the Pub are great. Not many of the restaurants have student discounts. Snow ball does. I thought I heard something about Pizza Hut having one too but I'm not sure."
College Freshman,1,"... It's a town of 10,000 people and it's a small college. There is nothing to do here other than go out and party. And even that is the lamest thing to do."
College Junior,1,Little to No Open Labs – departments have labs but if you're undecided good luck getting a computer in the library oh and not all departments have computer labs
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife in Atchison itself is very limited.  The town is quite small, and there are only a few bars, though they are close to campus.  The only place where people can party is in the off-campus houses rented by students."

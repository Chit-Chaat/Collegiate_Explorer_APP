Freshman,5,Online academics are very easy some teachers are very willing and able to accommodate your needs. Which makes it 10 times better than when we first started online classes.
Freshman,5,It is everything I thought of and more. It is the best experience I’ve had in any school. I came from LBCC and tried to do the classic school but it wasn’t for me and I have a passion for cooking.
Freshman,5,"It’s a bit difficult, but once you grasp the curriculum it is easy. It’s all culinary base. All the math and writing is culinary focused."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID, my spring classes were moved online. The professors tried their best to get acclimated to being online, and they were absolutely great/helpful."
Alum,5,"What I learned from the CIA I would not have gotten anywhere else in the concentration I did there. The school has some of industries leading chefs and offers a world class learning experience.  The quality of education here is excellent, if you have the fortitude to withstand the demands of this industry.  The culinary opportunities here are endless."
Sophomore,5,The Culinary Institute of America is amazing. I have felt so welcomed and made so many great friends. The chefs and professors are amazing at what they do and have provided me with the best education that I could possible get. I am so glad to be a part of the CIA community.
Niche User,5,"The campus was beautiful, large, and friendly. With several different restaurants that students work in, which is amazing! However, the student numbers are low compared to the size of campus."
Junior,5,The experiences here have put me on a path I could not even see before I started here. The lessons and relationships to last a lifetime.  My new family
Freshman,5,"I am currently an accepted student for this following September 2020. I recently visited the campus and it was beautiful. There was so much culture and knowledge hidden in plain sight. Fellow interested students and I, received a tour by a current student. This tour was everything I needed to make my decision on investing in this education. The only thing I would change is, the price. It is not affordable for low income students."
Niche User,5,"When I went for a visit at the Culinary Institute of America it was perfect. It has sports, living, and of course a big choice of food to choose from. Although it's in New York I believe it would be an awesome experience and way to get away from home."
Niche User,5,We have made two visits this past year and both were exceptional. The campus is very clean and staff has been extremely professional and helpful. We had a tour of the campus both times and our tour guides were very welcoming and knowledgeable about the campus and what the school has to offer. We experienced a cooking demonstration both times and the staff made our visit fun and informative.
Freshman,5,I like the fact that the Culinary Institute of America guarantees you a stable job after graduating as good connections are made via the school.
Niche User,5,"All the administrative people care about you. If you need help with something, they are for you to help you"
Alum,5,"Best training I could have hoped.  Instructors were top notch, helpful and concerned about passing along knowledge that only experience can provide.  When we left for the last-time one of our chef instructors Nick DeMayo, told us ""you now have the basics to survive in the field of culinary arts, so forget everything you learned because  you haven't seen anything as yet about the workings of a real kitchen"".  We all soon learned that he spoke the truth!  The one star ratings were given as they weren't even available sorry"
Niche User,5,I loved the classes and the scenery. The professors knew how to connect with each and every student to give them the best learning experience they could ask for. I love the Culinary Arts Program as well.
Freshman,5,the culinary institute of america is a great school. i am not began the college yet but i heard it is amazing. i cant wait to join the college
Freshman,5,My experience at the CIA was one that I will remember forever. All of my chefs and professors were very entertaining. I also really liked the meal plan at the egg and all of the healthy choices available.
Freshman,5,"My experience has been excellent, the food plan is amazing, and the student housing rocks, I do not have any complaints."
Freshman,5,Overall my experience with the culinary institute of America is something I could have never dreamt of. I am currently finishing up my first semester and it's really hard but absolutely worth it.
Graduate Student,5,I just enrolled with The Culinary Institute of America. The admissions advisor has been very helpful in getting me started. I will officially start school the last week of August 2019.
Freshman,5,The things I like about Cia is that there are friendly people there and everything seems to be clean and organized class sizes are good and dorms look clean. Staff and students are nice and are very welcoming.
Senior,5,"Gorgeous campus, amazing food, great professors, ninety minutes from Manhattan, NY.  Learned so much, not only about how to work in a professional kitchen but also how to run a business."
Sophomore,5,"It is the best culinary school you can find. It has a lot of people from many different place and countries, there people totally new to culinary while some are already professional."
Sophomore,5,I love everything in CIA. There is no counterpart for the CIA. This is the best culinary school than any others.
Sophomore,5,"There’s nothing to change about the culinary institute of America. Meeting people from around the world and from around America is the best part, creating amazing relationships with not only my classmates but all of my instructors. Having the ability to learn from Master Bakers is amazing, who can ever get to say that when earning my degree in baking and pastry I’d be able to say that all of my pastry chefs are all master bakers, now that is rare. This school is a well respected institute for everything they offer, and I can’t wait to graduate and say that I’m an alumni of the Culinary institute of America I have so much pride in saying that I’m student, and I’ll always have that pride of saying I went to this amazing school!"
Graduate Student,5,The Culinary Institute of America is the best culinary college in the world. I've grown into who I want to be at this school and I am forever grateful for that transformation and ongoing growth.
Sophomore,5,"This is the dream place of those who truly love food and are passionate about the culinary world. The education and rigorous training is unmatched, the exposure in the field and opportunities as a student reaches all corners of the world and begin to professionally build you from day 1, and its prestige and global recognition goes undefeated. Only the best make it through."
Graduate Student,5,"I really love it! Everything is do professional, the faculty, the facilities, the genuine help to help you to succeed in your career."
Works Here,5,"a fantastic college with a broad spectrum of fields relating to all things culinary. Besides an associate, bachelors and masters degree, the school offers a variety of classes for professionals as well as food enthusiasts.
the CIA's Consulting Department offers plenty opportunities for work study"
Sophomore,5,"I like how willing the staff is to help and give out their personal tips and tricks. It doesn’t matter if they’re your current instructor, or one you’ve never met, they always try their hardest to help. Students are provided with incredible opportunities to meet and network with outside chefs and industry professionals."
Alum,5,"The Culinary Institute was an awesome school. Instructors work very closely with students, and materials and equipment was always available. Staff was friendly and helpful. Environment was fun and safe. (I attended San Antonio campus)"
Alum,5,The world's best culinary and baking education. This college produces some of the finest chefs in the world!
Sophomore,5,I love the Culinary Institute of America. I learned more in 2 semesters here than I have at any other school in my lifetime. This school has definitely fueled my fiery passion for cooking. It’s challenging but I love it!
Sophomore,5,"The professor's are extremely knowledgeable. They always have an answer for your questions, and if they don't they will find one. There is so much to learn about both culinary and pastry making."
Freshman,5,As a second semester student of the CIA San Antonio Texas I have to say that is a unique experience. The San Antonio campus financially has been super supportive and has great chef instructors and staff team. I love the way that the school bridges the culinary experience between the education and the real experience outside in the hospitality industry. I love my school amd whoever wants to pursue the dream of attending culinary school I truly recommend the San Antonio campus.
Alum,5,"No other Culinary program is better than the CIA, by far the best, I tried many others before finally having the opportunity to experience it myself!"
Sophomore,5,"The CIA gives me a hands on learning experience that goes above and beyond what I could ever have expected from a culinary school. The teachers are incredible, and they are the best of the best in their field. I never could have hoped to learn from such supportive and knowledgeable staff anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,The education is amazing! Very hard but worth it. Amazing chef instructors. Classes are designed around your major and every class taken is applicable to everyday life
Sophomore,5,So far I have loved learning from the amazing teachers at the CIA in San Antonio. I am a balk and pastry arts student and all of my chef are certified master bakers and it is such an honor to be able to learn from them.
Freshman,5,"I'm a first semester student at the CIA and my experience has already earned me a job at Bouchon Bakery, leadership opportunities, and lifelong relationships. If you are unsure that this is the place for you, it most likely will prove to be when you give it a shot."
Senior,5,"Loved going here, there are some issues however, the Greystone campus is really outdated and the kitchens are falling apart. Also the whole second floor is used for events and they have boot camps for paying customers in the same kitchen as students."
Freshman,5,"The Culinary Institute of America not only is the premier culinary college, it has the history and alumni to solidify this claim. Only having attended this school for under one semester, I have already learned so much about this industry. I truly believe that, through the lessons and connections we obtain at the CIA, every student here will be set up for nothing less than success."
Alum,5,"The education, professors, campus, networking, reputation, and community. It's more than what I ever expected when I decided to attend culinary school. I like that it's grown to become more of a culinary university than just a technical school. You can now get your master's degree there and I'm hoping one day that the CIA offers a Ph.D. program."
Alum,5,"At the CIA you learn how to manage your kitchen, yourself, and your audience. To go to a culinary school to learn how to cook is not the CIA’s objective. Their objective is to mold your talent and allow it to flourish, to expand you’re knowledge of the Culinary arts and make you question it for the better. At the CIA it goes beyond cooking, we learn that our guests matter and they are what drives us to be better."
Freshman,5,"Being a student at CIA has been nothing less than a privilege. Everyday going into school and meeting the best of the best instructors who are full of immense knowledge. 
The kitchens are great and well equipped with everything needed for success."
Alum,5,Attending the CIA more than prepared me for a career in the F&B industry. The instructors are extremely knowledge and share their real life experiences with the students. Campus is beautiful and the dining options on campus exceed any I have seen elsewhere.
Works Here,5,"The CIA is an awesome place to work.  Not only are you surrounded by people dedicated to food, everyone is dedicated to making each student the best possible chef or baker they could be."
Freshman,5,The Culinary Institute of America is the place to go for culinary arts. The chef instructors are truly one of a kind. They now how the industry works and the standards necessary to succeed. Most are graduates which makes them keen to what us as students are experiencing.
Alum,5,"It is a fantastic school for those who love food and want to meet others that do as well. This school has definitely already opened up so many doors in the culinary world surpassing every goal that I had ever made leaving me to wonder, what's next?"
Works Here,5,The CIA is the premiere culinary college in the United States. They take their mission extremely seriously and provide the higest level of training and academics.
Niche User,5,"Innovative programs like the Masters in food Business and the Manager in Training, the partnership with Harvard University and more!"
Alum,5,"I attended CIA as a start to my second career after the Air Force. I love that the school is so veteran friendly, and the education I received there was second to none."
Works Here,5,No other place will offer the amount of expertise than the CIA. Students are taught by experts in the field who not only have real world life experience but a passion for food.
Sophomore,5,Our campus teaches us classic French cooking techniques while also allowing us to be creative and preparing us to go out into the field. We have courses where we prepare a meal for everyone on campus as well as 2 semesters doing field work. The first one is at a site of our chosing and the second is working at the school's restaurant with a chef instructor.
Senior,5,I am attending the campus in San Antonio for the Associates degree in Baking and Pastry. All of my classes have taught me so much and in such a well thought out curriculum. After going here I know I have the base knowledge and more to be able to start my career right. The Chefs and staff were all dedicated to helping each student grow to the best of their abilities. I cannot speak for the hyde park location but the San Antonio campus is definitely a great place to start your culinary or pastry journey!
Works Here,5,"I've worked with The Culinary Institute of America for over five years and have seen many students graduate and become the chefs, restaurant owners, and front of house managers that they always dreamed of becoming. Some have gone to work for renowned chefs around the nation or have opened their own local businesses, but have been able to do because of the training they received from our amazing faculty. The truth is that only one school can provide the academics and hands-on training needed to succeed in the culinary world and that is The Culinary Institute of America!"
Senior,5,"I have been here for 3 + years. I have enjoyed my experience and the student life involvement, and club activites. 
The classes are educational, hands on, and fast paced. That is a benefit but can also be a downfall, as for lack of time to go really in depth and hit on key points, or specific points that some chefs have time to focus on and others do not.
overall, a vaulable education."
Sophomore,5,"The Culinary is more than what you make of it. You have excellent accomplished Chefs, intelligent professors, and culinary focused peers. Everything around you is about good food. While the dorms could be much better and class sizes a bit smaller, it provides an environment that is unrivaled. You can become a sponge for knowledge and skill. I’ve seen myself improve faster than I thought possible as a student. If you’re serious about food, this institute is for you."
Works Here,5,"The CIA is the best Culinary school in the country! If you are looking to enter the culinary field, it will provide an excellent place to start and return on investment in the time spent at the school."
Sophomore,5,"This school teaches me more than a career path, something I will forever hold on too. From the realistic ways the kitchens are run by the Chefs to the amazing food at The Egg (our school's cafeteria), this is the best school to prepare each and every student for their future career."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love attending here! The environment and people are great. The only thing that isn't so great is the financial aspect.
Freshman,4,Overall a good school I haven’t taken any of the actual lab classes but from the academic classes I can say that it is a good school the campus is safe and the students are very kind p
Junior,4,What I love about The Culinary Institute of America is that there are so many connections that you make at the school. You connect with peers and chefs that will guide you in the future to get a job in the industry. You start off with the fundamentals and then build off of the fundamentals having fun along the way. I worked in the industry before coming to the CIA and that helped me make the decision that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. You will never stop learning and growing!
Freshman,4,"Would like the egg to have good food like the restaurants on campus. We pay a lot for our food plans, no one should get sick from the food."
Freshman,4,There is a wonderful campus with good food made by the students. Many people come to visit on a daily whether to eat at one of the restaurants on campus or to get some baked goods out of the apple pie bakery. The dorms are nice and clean. The only areas for smoking are in the gazebos located all over campus. Gas stations and food off campus just minutes away. Everyone is fun and keeps a welcoming demeanor.
Works Here,4,"As staff we are very student focus, the value of a CIA degree is priceless. The campus in Hyde Park is amazing and having visited the campuses in CA and TX each has something unique to offer the student."
Junior,4,"The location is nice, program layout is organized. There is a lot to do on campus and it is very eventful. I would like to see more vegan options/dietary options throughout the restaurants, Roth dining, and the egg. The academic advisors I feel need to be more informative and on the same page about requirements for academic classes."
Junior,4,Every 3 weeks you change kitchens. This gets you prepared to walk into any kitchen with confidence that you can produce
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the freedom and creativity that I’m allowed to have. So many different point of views from so many different chefs.
Sophomore,4,"People like me crave for the same thing - to talk about cooking everyday. But unless and until you are surrounded by the people with same interests, no one wants to here about cooking or new flavors in general public. So, this is the best place for a culinary student. Classes are strict for sure but it only increases the bar for us as graduates and allows us to go in top restaurants and work. The chefs here are renowned, which acts as a bonus to learning. You not only learn through the curriculum but just by talking to them. If you come on the campus, One thing which noticeable is the greenery as there is a honey bee farm and a lot of community gardens growing herbs and greens all around the campus. I would personally say as an international student, that I get to learn a lot not just about french or american cuisine but about other cuisines as well as so many international students from around the world are here."
Sophomore,4,This school kills you... but it’s worth it. The chefs have incredible backgrounds and provide you with the best culinary education.
Works Here,4,"* Small campus setting, 
*loads of one-on-one faculty experience, 
*beautiful campus on the Hudson River, 
*hub for innovation in food service and hospitality."
Sophomore,4,"Great school to make connections. Like any other, it’s not perfect but they try their best to make sure all students are comfortable, safe, and happy."
Works Here,4,"I work at the college's Hyde Park campus and can honestly say being able to see first-hand what the students do every day is amazing! They're training under certified chefs, being mentored by industry experts, and are learning how to run their own business from concept to production in our Innovation Kitchen. What other college is doing all of that? #onlyatCIA"
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere on campus, the countless opportunities we are given, and the friendliness of everyone here. We have great Chefs and professors and standards are kept high. There are basketball courts, a swimming pool, weight room, cardio room, studio, tennis courts, game room, soccer and baseball field, trees perfect for hammocking, and many activities. I love the area, the Hudson Valley, which is beautiful with many fun opportunities. I also love that I have met so many people here from all over the world. It is very interesting to live with so many different people, most of whom are awesome. I’ve met my best friends here, and it is great being around so many friends who are more like you and have a passion for being in the kitchen. The curriculum is demanding and time-consuming, but it prepares you for a great career. There is also always many opportunities to get help."
Sophomore,4,"The coursework, while a bit heavy, is definitely valuable, and the professors/chef instructors truly want to see you succeed. The food occasionally varies in quality but is fairly good overall (the production kitchens and cafe are always a little better than the cafeteria). The attendance policy is a little strict, though, so skipping class is an awful idea."
Sophomore,4,"The Chefs put a lot of work into the students, and genuinely care for them. certain changes could be made to meal plans, and the communication of the school to the students. Overall, the students that care about their profession and work as a team, are what make this school the best culinary college."
Works Here,4,The Culinary is beautiful. I enjoy working here at the Culinary and enjoy walking around the campus grounds during my lunch break. The is always something going on at the campus and the hustle and bustle of the everyday is great.
Freshman,4,"My experience has very good. The staff and upper classmen have been great on welcoming me aboard and making me feel wanted,sence of belonging. The campus is beautiful and just happy to be in aplace that's warming comfortable and safe."
Alum,4,"The CIA is a pretty chill university. Very hard if you are coming in to pursue a culinary or baking career path if you do not have any type of training beforehand. It's a lot of work too, but it takes a lot more work after graduation."
Alum,4,I liked that you learn so much at school. However I did not like that you could only miss 2 days or you failed the class and if you missed one day you dropped a letter grade.
Alum,4,Great professors and great environment to surround yourself with culinary experiences. Small campus is both a blessing and a curse. Wish COA was slightly lower. Would also say it's important to keep in mind your degree doesn't transfer anywhere but Cornell so you have to be sure that's the path you want to take.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve got mixed feelings about the school. On the one hand, I won’t struggle to find  job in the sector of the industry that I want to be in. Nor will I want for connections, due to the size of the alumni network and how widespread the network is.
However there’s aspects of the school that irk me. The lack of communication between different areas of administration and staff is astounding. Personally, I experienced this firsthand when applying for Bachelors classes. I spoke to my advisor about testing out of a class, and she assured me that I’d be able to register for the rest of my classes. However, when I tried to register, I found a series of hoops I now had to jump through that hadn’t been communicated. Hoops that could have been avoided if my advisor had talked to the person in charge of class registration. Or communicated to me so I could avoid them."
Niche User,4,The Culinary Institute of America offers amazing chef training with a supportive community of both students and professors.
Sophomore,4,"I love the Culinary institute, my professors make learning so much fun for myself and others I attend the school with. I am currently in the San Antonio campus. I think what the school can really work on is having more activities at this campus. The campus in New York has so much to do there and I think consistency within the campuses is well needed."
Freshman,4,"Culinary Institute of America is a premier culinary school with an excellent campus and strong community that wishes to revolutionize food. The faculty are helpful and friendly. Though the area is quite desolate, it's only an 1 1/2 hour drive to New York City!"
Sophomore,4,Culinary institute of America is a good school to go to. The campus is beautiful and the experience and training I am learning for my career is intense. I am learning a lot. I am using my skills on my externship in baking and pastry in a real business in Virginia. What I would like to see improved at this college would be an up grade on the dorms. The way they charge you for meal plans.
Freshman,4,"I love being apart of The CIA. There have been plenty of opportunities for me to thrive and learn as much as I can about the culinary industry. My student life experience is continuously getting better, I have a fantastic time meeting people and connecting with foreign students! The CIA is a major benefactor of diversity, and it definitely shows. This school has always been my dream school, and I could not believe that I actually had the ability to pursue such an incredible education."
Freshman,4,I feel the Culinary institute of America is a great school to learn and experience very valuable lessons for one to be successful in the culinary and hospitality industry.
Freshman,4,"I am starting my first year at this school in January and I have to say that I am very excited. I have visited this Institute over the summer and I was very impressed. Everything that I would do in this schools relates to my major, which is Baking & Pastry Arts. For example, my math class would be about measuring flour or sugar or using an alternate measuring system if I don't have 1 cup. Furthermore, the campus is very nice and elegant. You very comfortable and very safe in the environment around you. The classes are amazing and the instructors are very professional and willing to help. The college has a lot of internships where you go to a hotel or a bakery and work there to build your profile. Overall, this institute does a very good job at getting you out and having true love for your major."
Junior,4,The CIA is a great choice of a school but it takes a lot of discipline and hard work to be successful. You get exactly what you put in
Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman here at the CIA, but I already feel at home. The work is fast paced, we have the best teachers in the world and everyone here is welcoming and ready to assist."
Sophomore,4,"This year I will be graduating with my Associate's Degree in Baking and Pastry. Going to this school has always been my dream for as long as I can remember. After getting accepted into the school I was extremely excited. I can honestly say I am very happy with the education I have received. I can say that after going here I have decided to move my career into a different path,  still planning on working with food but adding in my love for human science. Instead of becoming a pastry chef I will become a Dietitian. After we had gone through our externship (which happens between year 1 and year 2) I had realized that this might not be the exact life I want to live for myself no matter how much I love it. I would highly recommend going here if you have a passion for culinary or baking and pastry. The Chefs love their jobs, which makes you not only love the class but fall in love with the career you want to do. You never actually work a day in your life if you love what you are doing."
Junior,4,"The CIA is an amazing culinary school, the chefs who work there are very good and willing to help all students. When it comes to studies outside the culinary side the professors are very good, however sometimes they focus to much on culinary instead of general school knowledge."
College Freshman,4,"Keeps you busy, opens many great oppertunities"
College Senior,4,"Chefs are amazing and knowledgeable, they love teaching and make classes exciting and fun. Professors in academic classes are not as great, many dont seem as though they carfe, and dont do enough to help their students understand the things they are learning."
College Senior,4,"I feel as though i am prepaired for any sort of work i want to go into. the extrnship was rough, and the restaurants dont treat you as though you have the experiance that you do, i think the externship should be changed so that each student should be working on an actual station, not just as prep cooks, because many have forgotten their training after externship. the job fairs are amazing and help a lot with looking for a job."
College Senior,4,"Going through the associates degree program was stressful, over whelming and amazing. Chefs push you to your limits and then over them by 100 miles. If you arent sure about a life in the culinary field, dont waste your time applying. Teachers and chefs were so amazing. administration is aweful, they forgot about me my last six weeks, i didnt get my diploma on time, and they didnt even know i was graduating. Emails take about a month to be responded to, and voice mails are never responded to."
College Freshman,4,Management is probably the hardest but it can be a very fufulling for those who know that's what they want to do in life
College Freshman,4,It's very hard and you will have a lot of work ahead of you but the education is fantastic and very useful for your future career goals
College Senior,4,It's great because my experience was great but I would have liked to have had a better schedule that would allow me to work during the week. Transferring credits was easy.
College Senior,4,I haven't had that much experience with post-grad services since I haven't graduated from my bachelor's degree.
College Senior,4,"I think student career prospects are great but we also have to do our own work and find a great place to work and advance in. The alumni network only really exists in the Hyde Park, NY campus and not that much in the San Antonio one. The quality of employers was good although I think some bakeries or other small cafes and businesses could be added to make it even better. We had career fairs at school so that was a good place to talk to employers."
College Senior,4,"Class sizes are good overall, though with 16 class start dates annually the down season classes can have a different educational experience."
College Senior,4,"My situation is different than most. I came to The CIA with just short of a decade worth of experience. I think this had its advantages and disadvantages. On the pro-side, I knew the pace that is required and the attitude that is necessary. On the con-side, I had bad habits, and breaking bad habits is much harder then building good ones."
College Senior,4,"'The Culinary' is a very unique place. One where there is plenty of opportunity, where new doors open every day. Focus, determination, teamwork, and communication are the most important skills here."
College Senior,4,The school is very helpful in planning your future career
College Senior,4,The curriculum is challenging and fast paced they have condensed a lot of knowledge into three week classes
College Senior,4,The school works hard to help place students in jobs both on campus and after graduation career fairs provide great opportunities
College Senior,4,The work is hard and many leave or feel overwhelmed but if you're passionate you know you wouldn't hit any other way
College Senior,4,It is true preparation for the real world and builds you connections that can make your career the culinary institution will open doors for you all you need is to keep them open
College Senior,4,"The school makes your schedule everyone has the same it is just split into four different times you have am 1, am 2, then you have pm 1, and pm 2. So most people have the mornings off and the others the nights which ever one you have you can make your schedule around the times you have available."
College Senior,4,We do not have online classes.
College Senior,4,After grating you can apply for a M.I.T which means manager in training to become a chef at school or to have the experience of a manager for the real hard kitchens out in the world.
College Senior,4,The school has on and off campus jobs they can help you look for jobs if you do not want to work for the school. Once you are an alumni they can still help you look for a job if you can not find one in your profession. The degree from my house is very helpful and valuable for big companies.
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at the C.I.A was a wonder journey. I have meat a lot of people with the same passion as me, we all worked together in groups for projects or assignments. The teachers are always their for you when you need help they will never turn their backs on someone in need of help."
Recent Alumnus,4,"All the professors are experts at what they are teaching, and they are just as passionate as the students about the classes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Theres dozens of career paths for graduates. Its not a food field, its a hospitality field. You can work as a chef or waiter, business owner, hotel manager, consultant, private cook, Research and development."
Recent Alumnus,4,"You learn more than just the food, you learn about the regions, and the people and how it all relates to one another."
Recent Alumnus,4,I wish I put more effort into it in the beginning to have gotten the most out of it.
Alum,2,"My experience at the Culinary Institute of America was an interesting one.  On one hand the school offers many opportunity for development in the culinary field and on the other the mental torment one experiences going there may prove to be too much for some.  When I started I went during the time when industry experience was required, however when I returned from my externship the school had begun excepting students with zero experience.  Those students struggled, because they weren't prepared for the environment. There is an disturbing feeling on gets from the registrars office and their 5 week line up to throw students who have fallen behind in an extremely difficult study.  I loved the school, however, the behavior of office staff and non-chef staff is disgusting.  It's one thing to be yelled at by a chef, its completely another coming from a business office.  Staff there is just disrespectful and disconnected to where their money comes from...the students."
Freshman,2,"The school struggles over whether it is a 4 year college or a trade school.  It portrays itself as having a rich social environment with clubs and activities.  the truth is that clubs hardly meet and there is little to do on or near the campus.  Not sure why clubs don't meet on the weekends when more students are available to participate. Dorms are typical and upperclassman space is very nice.  Caliber of teaching in academic classes varies.  Some instructors are solid.  Others can't understand how to give an exam on material they cover in the course. Chefs vary from helpful to abusive, which was expected. Seek out Johnson and Wales for a more well-rounded education.  Drexel University also has a culinary program."
Junior,2,"College only cares about making money to overpay their lackluster staff.  Student Housing is lacking,  food service is poor at best, and the answer from staff is always too bad."
College Senior,2,"rescheduling classes causes your graduation date to change, missing three classes is a fail in the class. Not fair, needs to be changed"
College Freshman,2,Missing three classes automatically fails you for that course
College Junior,2,They do not refund for transferred credit
College Sophomore,2,"I heard the schedule is very strict and is like traditional high school, but thats how you train a chef to be the best chef. You have to instill getting up early and knowing how to properly execute techniques without being slow, messy, or sloppy."
College Senior,2,There is no flexibility on the schedule. The classes are set and the schedule is either AM or PM
College Senior,2,It is hard to get financial aid if you are an international student. I would say almost impossible.
College Sophomore,2,Very little financial aid help
College Junior,2,Although we have computer labs all across campus the biggest issue is the wireless network. It's awful. It's constantly crashing or it's extremely slow or just won't work at all which is inconvenient when you have homework to do but can't do it because the internet won't work.
College Junior,2,Because of the accelerated curriculum at CIA and it's strict attendance policy I find it very difficult to find the time around my classes to do things personally. Like go to the doctor. Missing one class can drop you down one letter grade.
College Junior,2,"The wireless network is very unstable specially in the dorm building i reside in, and some computers sometimes do not work properly because the internet is unstable and some programs such as microsoft office does not work properly."
College Senior,2,I can say that I am receiving an amazing education but the tuition is extremely expensive and it is very hard to get the best out of school knowing i will have major loans to pay off in my future. 
College Sophomore,2,"The campus could definitely improve on computer networks. The wireless access on our laptops is very spotty depending on where you live on campus and when many students are using the network everything is very slow. As for computer labs there is one in the library that is very quiet which is good, but the printing cost is so high. The amount of recipes we are expected to print out turns out to be a lot of money for a student."
College Senior,2,The Computer Network is always having trouble. The internet is on and off and it is hard to get wifi in every corner of campus. And they could use an update on software.
College Junior,2,"Wireless access is only available on the top level of the building, due to the building being an ex-winery with very thick walls. The computer lab is just adequate, so during the periods before morning and evening classes, it can be extremely crowded. The single printer can also make things very difficult if someone decides to print more than a few pages at a time."
College Senior,2,"School Is Main Focus. Your schedule changes frequently so it is hard to maintain a work schedule. Also you may have classes in the morning or night or middle of the day. There is no other class options so you can't just change to fit your schedule. You may also have weekend classes. 
The school doesn't transfer many credits, especially for the associates program."
College Senior,2,"3 Types – type #1 are here on their dime to learn
type #2 are only here because they ""like food"" and thought easy way out of college on daddy's dime
type #3 people who don't know what they want in life"
College Junior,2,It is hard to get the School to do their part in helping the student look for alternatives to pay and no help during the process!
Niche User,1,"$ is the main focus, get students in & forget that they need an education.I have heard so many stories of verbal abuse from instructors the mentality is""we are training you for the real world"" WHAT?If anyone spoke to me like that ""in the real world"" I would make sure that person would be fired!No person should think that is normal!too fast paced to learn.The wines class is a joke.Everyone knows this class is flawed & they continue the same plan!It is broken, FIX it! A school should help students succeed,not fail.at 80k to attend,I expect WIFI that works, printers that work (students are required to email &print assignments), tolerable food-even on the weekends-& support staff that actually supports.They set students up to fail.I would NOT recommend this school.They are just after your $ the prestige they once had is gone"
Senior,1,"Not worth the money for a poor education. Very little involvement on the part of the chefs, as well as poorly run programs on part of the administration with poor communication."
Freshman,1,This school is not run properly. The administration neglects to tell you important information before you get to campus. It's a horrible environment that's but for you not to succeed.
College Junior,1,There are no online courses.
College Senior,1,"It is very difficult to attend doctor appointments, or any kind of appointment at all. It is always a major issue with my personal life. I have lost money and important meetings. It took me 6 months to get a driving license because I wasnt able to set an appointment.that fitted my shedule, and skipping a class is not an option because one absense equals one full grade."
College Freshman,1,I have not had any experience with online courses
College Senior,1,threre is no academic flexibility as a first year associates student. all the classes you take are chosen for you.
College Senior,1,the class registration process is annoying and they have yet to set up the system properly
College Freshman,1,Wifi stinks - computer printers aren't accessible
College Senior,1,We have class every day and missing class is not accepted and are means for expelling. We have no say in what classes to pick. 
College Senior,1,My school does not offer online courses. It is a hands on experience the peer-to-peer interaction is very positive. every student in my school is working through the same workload and can offer advice or relate to any issue I am having. The Student center is ran by peers that have all received A's and can help me succeed. My school provides a mentorship program that allows me to work with a Chef as my advisor.
College Senior,1,Their is no flexibility. You etither go to classes or you fail out and you will not be able to graduate with the same people you started with.
College Freshman,1,There is zero flexibility in the classes that you will have to take.
College Senior,1,"Our financial system is pretty awkward compare to what we pay for the school. It is right that school needs the money to operate the school. However, when lots of student(include me) see the all the aspect of our Institute, it spends money in really wrong way. Our school rarely invest money for students' welfare. Moreover, as they change their policy to increase the tuition fee annually, something needs to be changed but we never felt and saw. Furthermore, our financial system is limited to specific student(not related to educational grade but ethnicity/international student), and amount of money is very low. Education is good but not worthy to tuition fee. So, I gave D grade to our school."
College Senior,1,The Network Is Horrible – The school requires all personal computers to have a wireless access card for the network. There are several computer labs here on campus which are very out dated. The schools server blocks most web sites. I have noticed random files on my computer that seem to have gotten here due to the server. The wireless network is very slow and often doesn't work.

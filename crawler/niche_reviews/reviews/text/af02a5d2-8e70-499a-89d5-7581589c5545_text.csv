Freshman,5,"I'm really enjoying my experience at Bismarck State College so far. The professors always strive to provide the best education for their students, and with the smaller class sizes, we get more opportunities to speak with our professors one-on-one. Along with a fantastic educational experience, Bismarck State College offers many clubs and activities for students to participate in. Overall, student life at this college is very fun and rewarding- I am looking forward to the years I will spend here!"
Freshman,5,Much cheaper than a normal 4 year college so you save a large amount of money. Smaller class sizes are nice too.
Freshman,5,Online classes are great and good way to get the general classes out of the way without having to waste your time in classes you took in High school basically.
Freshman,5,I love the small community feel and that you can walk anywhere and see someone you know. Bismarck State College is just incredible with great professors and programs to learn from. It is a great college to start at.
Sophomore,5,"It offers  variety of programs. Facilities are like State of Art especially Science of Energy ,and Academic staff ,and all surroundings are the best.
Great to be in BSC,with so many friends from previously  High School ."
Sophomore,5,"My experience in BSC was one of the best. The people are nice, teachers are wonderful, a bunch of activities for people. I wouldn't change a thing."
Freshman,5,They have helped me from the second I transferred and have helped me ever since. I could not ask for any better teachers and friends by my side to help me along in my future. It advances me in every way possible and it will help me greatly in the future. I love every aspect here and the environment is amazing.
Sophomore,5,"Bismarck has always been my first choice when it comes to college. I didn't attend my first year, but I always knew that I would be welcomed back no matter what. Everyone is extremely friendly and the campus offers a variety of activities to choose from. The only thing I wish that they had was football. I can't wait to start the year with continuing my major in journalism."
Freshman,5,I love it they care deeply about your education. I love this college and they are very nice some classes are hardly but really nice too I love it
Junior,5,"BSC is an amazing college, and extremely affordable. After receiving a Bachelor's Degree from a different school, I  decided to pursue a different career. BSC had open arms and embraced that I   am a non traditional student. I  love all of my professors and courses and cannot wait for the future."
Sophomore,5,I am a BSC Dakota Nursing Program student. I am very impressed by how hard these instructors work and how much my love for nursing has grown. BSC is helping me achieve my nursing degree. All the instructors are great communicators and helpful. They help the students achieve their goals every day.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Bismarck State College has been very beneficial. The campus is beautiful, well kept, and the environment is very friendly and welcoming. A variety of classes are available and I succeed in the smaller class sizes. It is nice to be able to make a more personal connection with the other students and with the professors. One thing I really like it how affordable the tuition is. The one thing I would  like to see improved is for the library to have longer hours and to be open later at night."
Sophomore,5,"Bismarck State College is a friendly college that is smaller, but offers everything you can imagine.  You will enjoy smaller class sizes, and very friendly staff.  You will get treated with respect and dignity.  I highly recommend this college."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is friendly, and the professors are great. Their teaching style fits to work for every one and are always helping their students. The campus is the perfect size for me and there is always something going on."
College Senior,5,There are several courses to choose from for any career choice. The instructors and career counselors work very well one on one with the students to make sure they are enrolled in the correct courses at the correct time.
College Senior,5,This school is recognized as having an outstanding academic curriculum which is highly valued by many different employers in the area.
College Senior,5,"The school really works with students to accommodate virtually any schedule, whether it be evening, early morning or Saturday morning classes and many of the courses are also available online."
College Senior,5,"Well first and foremost online classes are so convenient as they can be accessed any time at all as long as there is an internet connection, I've even used my smartphone. However it takes a lot of self discipline as unless there are direct questions asked to the instructor you sometimes don't hear from the instructor for several days."
College Senior,5,Both instructors and career counselors work with graduating students to find a job in the chosen career field including interview tips.
College Senior,5,"The professors were always actively engaged with the students, checking how the course is going, reminders of when assignments are due and up comping quizzes and tests. They always have open door policies for contacting them with any questions regarding the course, whether it be office hours, online via email or chat, or sometimes even calling them at home."
College Senior,5,"I have hands on learning not just through classroom instruction, but through internships as well. All classes are applicable to my chosen career field so I can get real world knowledge."
College Senior,5,"This is a great school because it is technically a 2 year Community College so the class sizes are not overloaded, which also keeps the cost quite low and the teachers/professors actually know their students by name, yet it is possible to get a four year degree due to the school's degree completion programs with other 4 year schools, either in class or online."
College Senior,5,The teachers are great and the class size on average is small.
College Senior,5,"BSC is a great college to go and get your generals or your entire degree. The people are great, and the class size is awesome. The environment is friendly and the intermural activities are fun as well. When you come to bsc you don't get the big school feel but they have the highest enrollment in the state so you get to know a lot of people. Overall a great place to go to school."
College Junior,5,My college and class scheduling has allowed me to continue most of my past requirements outside of school. I have been able to keep my part time job and remain a leader at my church's youth group. I have been able to keep up with most of my friends and my life has not been uprooted. I actually feel less hassled this past year in college than I did in high school.
College Junior,5,"I have only taken one online course, and that was last semester. The course was interesting, dealing with fantasy and science fiction literature. The books we discussed were immersive and many great discussions were brought up through other participants in the class. My professor also replied back to any questions quickly and efficiently. The work load did get in the way sometimes, but was not overly taxing. I was able to finish the class with an A and learned a lot from the two genres we studied."
College Junior,5,"I really enjoy the size of all my classes, which lean towards the small size. An average class has between twenty to thirty people. This size lets me feel more comfortable and allows me to be more one on one with the teacher. An example of this is my Biology class. My professor answers all of the questions I have, and if he does not know what it is he is willing to look up the subject to give me an accurate answer.

I have had no problems with my professors and it gives me relief that all of them are willing to help if I am stuck or confused on a subject. My least favorite subject is math, however, I have been doing better in it than I had in high school. My professor has been able to explain any questions or miscommunication I have with the material."
College Junior,5,"My major is biology, while I am also planning on minoring in education. Biology is my favorite science subject and I really enjoy the curriculum and how the professors teach. They encourage on asking questions and will assist in delving deeper into questions an individual may have. One job opportunity that the Biology department has is a work study, where a student sets up labs and learns the ins and outs of how a biology lab works. The work load is average and I have never felt too overwhelmed or short on time for any of our assignments or projects."
College Sophomore,5,They really want me to succeed.
College Sophomore,5,I get to weld everyday and it's awesome.
College Junior,5,The professors are understanding and helpful with any problem that someone might be having.
College Senior,5,"Everyone is super nice and helpful students, staff, faculty, everyone! School is very well kept up, all courses are very good, well taught courses"
College Senior,5,"This school is in the perfect place. It has an amazing view of the river, and it isn't very far from where I live. I am able to stay at home and be able to get to school and save some money on room & board! The staff is very nice and helpful! I honestly wouldn't pick a different school to go to."
College Junior,5,There are plenty of computer labs with the availability to print in black and white or color.  There are also copy machines readily available.
College Junior,5,"Resources at BSC are endless, especially for our campus to be small. We have two athletic centers, both open until about 11 pm. Offering workout classes, pools, you name it, they have it. Also our student union runs the campus activities lately and they make it very known when something is going on, so hopefully everyone who would like to does participate. Our general campus is pretty close together and I love that. Easy walks to find everyone/ anything you need."
College Junior,5,"My flexibility is amazing. I think it has a lot to do with the relationships from students to teachers. We are very close knit, they notice if your missing. Also many teachers make it hard for to do badly. Professors here are not afraid to admit they are human, have lives and families. I am able to go to school full time, play a college sport and work on the side. I love it!"
College Senior,5,Everything is great and fantastic at my school and love everybody that i fun into there!!
College Senior,5,they were very helpful and fast at what was needed to be done!
College Senior,5,they are very clean and actually talk to you and are not rude as well so its a very pleasant place to be!
College Senior,5,very helpful staff and friendly and clean environment!
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience with Bismarck State College is going well so far, I've had only a few issues regarding the online materials. We use a program called Blackboard Collaborate- an application in which students can access their courses virtually. Assignments, quizzes, exams, and learning material are listed. It is very easy to navigate, however, there have been a few technical issues regarding the live sessions, like losing connection or not being able to hear/see the professor. Besides that, it seems to be working great!"
Freshman,4,"Because of Covid, I have the option to take all of my classes online and watch a live or recorded lecture. I like this option because I don't live on campus and most days I only have one class a day, so being able to attend my classes from home is saving me money on gas."
Freshman,4,"I like how understanding the teachers are, and that there are plenty of opportunities to get help with assignments. Especially with Covid and everything being so different and a learning experience, the teachers are doing a really good job of working with the guidelines and making sure everyone is safe."
Freshman,4,There are good facilities and the professors are great and communicate well with students. I would recommend this university.
Freshman,4,In the situation caused by covid 19 the online experience was as good as it could have been in the short notice circumstances.
Sophomore,4,"If you call you will get bounced around from person to person. I think they make all teachers do advising and some are horrible at it. I had one teacher tell me, "" I didnt sign up for this"". I had to switch advisors. Ever since then it's been easier. Make sure you have information of who to contact regarding your education path before starting here."
Sophomore,4,Bismarck State College is a very affordable college for someone who is looking to start with the basics and get their associate's degree. I was able to complete my degree and work at the same time to get myself through college. I am grateful for being able to have a community college in my town that offers online and on campus classes to pursue my degree.
Alum,4,Had a great experience. Graduated a few years ago and have been working in my dream profession since. They adequately prepared me for chosen career path.
Sophomore,4,"I would give this college a 4 out of 5 stars. I love this campus it is small and built around community. The teachers are very compassionate about teaching and getting students to learn. Also since this college is smaller, class sizes are smaller which give more one on one time, which is super great. The only downside about BSC is that there is not a good athletic atmosphere. There are athletics but very minimal, so this takes away from the college sports experience. But apart from that, this college has so much to offer."
Freshman,4,Bismarck State College is a great school for the trades. They have some great networking and connections with Industry related fields.
Freshman,4,just attended registration they were so nice and made the experience worry free for a new student. small campus setting
Sophomore,4,"Bismarck state college is great overall, campus is fairly new compared to other colleges, professors could be good or bad depending on who you choose, some are tough, some are good at teaching, some don't even seem to know what they are teaching. there isnt much when it comes to social life, and the food is OK, a step up from high school food, its a community college after all"
Sophomore,4,This school has an overall good rating because it provides good education with low school costs. The classrooms are a good size which provides more teacher and student 1 on 1.
Freshman,4,Super great people and teachers. I went there one semester and loved it super great and welcoming people.
Sophomore,4,"Affordable education and awesome facilities at a great price! After one year at Bismarck State, I have been pleased with the experience. Qualified professors and outstanding facilities with state-of-the-art technology for my major."
Sophomore,4,All of the online classes I have taken so far have been completely amazing! The professors are extremely helpful and provide good content for learning.
Freshman,4,"One thing that was done for freshman students was giving time to meet new people. I enjoyed it. There are a few on campus place to hang out with friends. Unfortunately, being mainly a 2 year college there are not many clubs."
Freshman,4,"I take most of my classes from BSC online, but go on campus often to meet with professors. They are always available and very flexible with my schedule. I feel safety could be higher, but altogether this is a great two year college."
College Junior,4,"Online classes are much different than classes in a classroom. Classes are more fast paced and I can do my assignments when I have time or when my schedule allows. I do feel more comfortable asking the teacher questions because then I don't have to worry about looking like an idiot in front of the entire class. I don't like that it is faster paced because I feel like all I am ever doing is trying to get homework done for this class. I get more homework in my online class than I do in any of my other classes. I feel like I can't really have much of a social life because most of my free time is spent on my computer trying to complete things before they are due. It isn't the end of the world though, I am managing and I am doing just fine. I am finally figuring out how finish my assignments a few days before the due date so i can have at least one day a week where I can breathe a little."
College Junior,4,I would definitely need to look into these questions more
College Junior,4,"My courses aren't horrible. They're not too hard but they're also not too easy. All of my professors are nice and the homework load isn't too bad. We have a variety of courses ranging from career and technical, energy, to art-visual. My graphic design classes don't have too many people in it, maybe around ten. My English class is closer to fifteen, we also sit in desks that are arranged in a giant circle so we get to awkwardly stare at each other."
College Junior,4,"BSC is pretty cheap compared to the other schools in North Dakota. The teachers here are really nice and they seem to care about their students. There is free ice cream in Wednesdays and Fridays in the cafeteria, and sometimes there are other special events involving food including: Kuchen for Oktober fest, free brownies, and during the warmer months, someone will grill hot dogs for everyone. 

I just wish I would have waited a year before entering school so I could have really thought about what I wanted to study in college."
College Sophomore,4,I like the wide variety of options I have to choose from for classes.
College Sophomore,4,I have really enjoyed the college experience so far at BSC.   It has been an easy transition from high school
Recent Alumnus,4,They are flexible and work with you when you have the time. My advisor took extra time out of her day to help me set up a schedule that works for me and my work schedule.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My advisor is awesome and has helped me with every step of the process, she is also going to be one of my professors and she seems to understand that life happens and is forgiving and flexible with her students."
College Freshman,4,I like that the classes are small and they offer a lot of things.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy studying something I am interested and passionate about.
College Freshman,4,"It's nice that the classes are small, rather than huge like at universities."
College Junior,4,"I have enjoyed meeting new people of different backgrounds and getting to know them and their stories. I also enjoy what is taught, more than I did in high school. In high school I did not feel challenged, while in college I have been able to learn many new things and to be challenged. We also get free ice cream on Wednesdays and Fridays, so that is great."
College Junior,4,They have good career plans and internships.
College Junior,4,It is an easy going college and they really respect you as a student.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are very helpful and they truly care about each individual person and we get to know them as muc as they get to know us.
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are small so there is always enough 1 on 1 time with the teachers. I have really likes all of my teachers so far and would reccomend any of them!
College Sophomore,4,Scheduling my classes on my own is great.
College Sophomore,4,They try to help you the best they can.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are nice and want to help you learn.
College Sophomore,4,They help you learn and know how to have fun!
College Senior,4,Good teacher to student ratio
College Senior,4,Typical students are hard working and focused. There is some diversity also.
College Senior,4,It is a very simple process and the financial aid help desk is amazing!
College Senior,4,"I feel like the workload is fair, the professors are great, and the curriculum and class registration are easy to follow"
College Senior,4,There are many resources available for student use and many activities for students to enjoy.
College Junior,4,Its very affordable and is worth every penny!
College Junior,4,"I havent had much of an opportunity to check the career services out, but from what services I have had, they are great!"
College Junior,4,"I love the majority of my professors!  They are kind, polite, and very helpful and flexible.  The curriculum is awesome and class registration is made super easy!  Sometimes I get a bigger workload, but thats just because of the classes I am taking!"
College Junior,4,"I have a lot of fun in my classes, the teachers and other students are great, and I love the campus!  I never get lost!"
College Junior,4,There is a lot of diversity in students and a lot of opportunities to meet new people!
College Junior,4,The classes are fairly flexible and the professors are great!
College Senior,4,"They have two pools, a decent athletic center, good size gyms, and a rec room that is a fun environment. and their library is awesome!!!"
College Senior,4,"I can always get on my laptop and look up all my stuff, and the connection is quick and simple, but best of all free!!"
College Senior,4,"im only in one class at the moment, from 7 am to 2 pm. then I have 3 hours to go to work, so its ok."
College Senior,4,the counselor I went to really helped me sort out my interests so I could change my major. 
College Senior,4,My online classes fit perfectly into what's going on in my life right now. I'm glad they were available to take online.
College Junior,4,"They have an amazing new Aquatic Center which includes many exercise classes, huge swimming pool, weight room, etc. The library is of good size and staff is very willing to help. Computer access is very easy."
College Junior,4,"You are given a fair time amount to complete all assignments. All my instructors have been very helpful in any questions I have had or clarification I have need in any assignments they are very workable if you are still not understanding the topic I they try to provide extra resources. I feel to be successful in an online class organization is the most important, as long as you are aware of the deadlines and devote your time you will be happy with your grade if you do your best."
College Senior,4,Computer network is always well connected. There are more than enough labs with sufficient printing capabilities. The only issue I have is that the library charges 10 cents per page and doesn't allow two-sided printing.
College Senior,4,Computer Network Has Not Failed Me Yet in My on-Line Classes – The school network has consistently delivered the material I've needed.  The only problem with is is that some of the material seems a little outdated more in the video than in the actual material.
College Senior,4,Electric Power Technology Is a Very Specific Subject – So far my experience has been very positive - This is my first experience with on-line classes but the professors and classmates have been great to work with. The class load is demanding but rewarding to be learning a whole new area of my field.
College Sophomore,4,"Small Size – Campus is small, yet has everything you need close by, on campus. Allows you to develope close friends and not have long campus walks to get somewhere."
College Sophomore,2,Some are difficult to use.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is sort of like a glorified high school. The teachers expect very little out of most of their students, and there is little or no value put on good grades in the school. There are some students that care about their grades, but most just want to pass with a C if they're lucky.  "
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few hardworking students, but the majority of students only want to pass under the radar and pass with a C if  possible. They don't really care if they pass their classes, as long as they get their degree and leave school."
College Senior,2,"I do not like the class I am in, im in auto collision and of course im a girl and found out my teacher is kind of sexist. and I get headaches from everything in their, I just don't like the environment as much as I did in highschool."
College Senior,2,"Athletic center is the former armory. It is old and outdated. The music center is possibly going to be changed and made bigger (which it needs). The library has its problems, but it has been there forever. It is not dark and smelly, but bright and welcoming."
College Junior,1,The facilities are old the only highlight is the wellness center

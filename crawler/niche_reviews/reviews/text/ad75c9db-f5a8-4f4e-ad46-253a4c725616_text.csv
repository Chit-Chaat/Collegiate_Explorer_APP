Senior,5,"I like the fast track program of completing any degree.  I also, like the way they help me set up a payment plan to finance my degree to finish. They also, have many great resources and plans to help students prepare for their future careers."
Junior,5,"Soth university is a good school it has a small classroom with professors who are willing to help the students. It does coast a lot of money to attend  south university. However, it will be well worth the time and money."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed my experience at South university, especially the professors and academic advisers. They helped with everything, even when I thought I was going to give up. It really helps when you have supportive people around."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent school with faculty that strives for student success. The overall atmosphere is conducive to learning. There are programs that will suit the needs of all students who enter the doors.
Junior,5,"school is easy to work with, being military it is hard to find schools that understand how it works with military tuition. I recommend fully."
College Senior,5,the staff are amazing and they car about there students
College Sophomore,5,They guide you to your career goals
College Sophomore,5,The professors are helpful and want you succeed
College Sophomore,5,My entire application process was very easy. My admissions representative was very helpful and made me extremely comfortable with my choices for my major.
College Junior,5,"So far any questions that I may have, have been answered beyond my satisfaction. If they do not have the answer they go above and beyond to help me find what ever it is that I may need."
College Freshman,5,It was a great experience.
College Sophomore,5,I think its great. Its work with what you have.
College Sophomore,5,South University has allowed me to be able to juggle taking care of personal life and an education at the same time. The faculty makes finding information easy and provide prompt assistance.
College Junior,5,plenty of computers and printer available. wireless access for students. Library open over the weekend for student use.
College Sophomore,5,"The class registration process was very easy. I just told my administrator which ones I wanted, and she got me in the ones I wanted. They are back to back; just the way I want it."
College Sophomore,5,"I had a terrible experience at Midlands Technical College, so I switched to South University. Ever since then, I have had help with paperwork, I have had tours, I have had people to talk to. My schedule has been set up perfectly. I love it."
College Sophomore,5,Keep up With the Process – Finiancial aid can be very tricky and time consuming. It is important to stay on top of what needs to be done or else your to do list turns in to a rolling snowball. Fininacial aid at South University is helpful but only if you take the time to go and get help and ask questions. Financial aid is not an easy process for any student so keeping up with the paperwork and such is a huge priority. I have made the mistake before and it has really put me in a bind. You will feel much better if you just get all the work done and complete.
College Sophomore,5,Happy and Confident – Ever since I transferred to this school I have made better grades and I have enjoyed every teacher no matter how difficult the course was. The people at South Universtiy Columbia are so helpful. The only thing that I didn't like was financial aid and addmissions. At first everything seemed to be running smoothly but as the weeks went on I began to find out things that I wish I knew before. Mostly financial aid is a hassle because of all the paper work and confussion. I am not involved in any events really because I haven't really heard of any. There are no sports or clubs that I know of. I enjoy the school because I have had past experiences of not having good teachers and that has affected my performance and so far here I really enjoy the ciruculum and their willingness to help.
College Sophomore,5,Career Center – They help students gain the knowledge to find jobs. They make sure they have everything needed to succeed.
College Sophomore,5,Flexiblity of My Classes – My classes are very flexiblity to my everyday life. I have no concerns of how I'm going to make it to class. It is very convenient and the faculty and staf help with everything along the way.
College Junior,5,"Career Center  Most Helpful – After I have graduated, I feel the career Center will be most helpful in finding a job in my field. They offer resume tips and job searches that will be the most asset to me post-graduation. They are also offer several ways in becoming a success in applying jobs for your first interview with an employer."
College Junior,5,They are a accredited school since 1899 and their mission is to educate and help students succeed in life. The online classes are flexible and fit into your daily schedule. They work around your schedule and offer student services and tutoring services when students need help. They are highly educated and great teachers who were once students themselves.
College Sophomore,5,Wow I Was Able to Get the Bachelors in 2 Years – When I was searching for schools I had not even thought about transferring over credit from the community college that I had gone to since I had just taken a lot of general classes in my mission to see what I wanted to do with my life. While talking to the adviser he suggested that they pull the transcript from the other college just to see if anything would transfer.  I was amazed when I found out that they had accepted 60 credits worth of classes. It was a saver with them accepting so many transfer credits like they did.
College Sophomore,5,"South University the Unknown Nugget in Columbia SC – I enjoyed going to South University, I loved how the classes were small and how classes met one day a week it allowed me to complete a bachelors degree in 2 short years. I appreciated how all of the professors knew you.  I enjoyed my first experience with them so much that I have decided to go back and work on the nursing program with them."
College Sophomore,5,"So Far, So Good! I start classes in just under a month but, after a TON of studying and reading about South University and meeting with an admission counselor, I applied (and had the $50 application fee waived!) and was accepted the same day AND was able to get my financial aid package that day as well.  Everyone has been extremely helpful & I can't wait to start classes!"
College Sophomore,5,There are lots off programs that require alot of hands on. And thats good. I like to stay moving and active.
College Sophomore,5,"I attend online classes and I rarely have problems entering the class and if I do all I need to do is call technical support and they more than glad help you find a solution, most of the time there is a note posted ahead of time saying that the campus common will be off because of updates, but they let you know ahead of time which is the right thin to do because that wy the students will prepare in advance."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is best in solving academical problems for students. I consider this school to be a n A+ because the students are smart and goal oriented, the professors are super professional. The academic counsulors are great, they are quick to leasing and try to solve your request as soon as possible. Financial aids is a very smooth process, they walk you step by step on what the student needs to fill out. The class regstration process went smooth as well, I've been going to this school for about a year and a half and I received a call from the academic recruiter asking if everything was going good, she mentioned that she have seen my grades and she encouraged me to continue. Overall this school is more han excellent."
College Junior,5,"Piece of Cake – the online classes are fun and easy, the assigments are well explained"
College Junior,5,"the workload is good, understandable and classmates are fun and we are all in the same boat, and i love the fact that we all get along.."
College Junior,5,"I have tutoring available to me at all times. I can access our online library,OWL--which is Online Writing Lab,Connections-a place to join groups,meet and chat with friends/faculty."
College Junior,5,"I like the convenience of the online class due to my own personal schedule. All of my counselors and instructors are very understanding,caring, and extremely helpful."
College Junior,5,"Very Reasonable – I feel that South University is a very well known Academic Educational Institution with high standards for the academis success of their students. I feel that the money that is being paid to more than worth it. My tuition is paid for with a federal grant and 2 federal loans, but I need extra money for other college expenses, such as software and a computer."
College Student,5,they are very helpful to make sure that the enroollment goes as plan.
College Student,5,"Easy Access – The professors and students are easy to get in touch with, and the connection with the class is smooth and fast.  Navigation is simple and everything can be done from one page.  It's easy to use and easy to learn from."
College Student,5,"Everyone Shows Concern – Everyone on the staff shows interest and concern toward the students' education, and they get very hands-on about helping the student with work and making sure the student understands assignments."
College Sophomore,5,"Student Diversity – The other students that I come in contact with through my online education are other parents, individuals wth careers, as well as younf adults just out of highschool beginning their college journey. Each class is made up of several individuals from across the country from many different walks of life."
College Sophomore,5,"Being enrolled online at South University has enabled me to continue my education while still focused on my career and family. As a single father, my is valuable and limited but South University's flexible online education gives me the opportiunity to reach my goals in education."
College Freshman,5,"Online School 101 – I wasn't sure how online classes would work out, I was a little nervous about finding how to get to everything for the classroom, such as textbook, lectures, ect, but I was wrong.  Not only did the counsler call me almost every day leading up to the start of class to make sure I had everything needed for starting school.  She then led me through where to sign in to class and where to find my lectures and discussion areas.  The first class you take is to help you learn how to use the resources they have available to you.  It is a nice class to ease yourself back into the swing of school.  It also made it very easy to learn how to take an online class."
College Sophomore,5,South Univeristy Staff – the staff at south university is so helpfull and stay with you every step of the way. they make every step of the way nice and easy.
Graduate Student,4,"I received my Associate Degree in Allied Health/Science in 2013. The online classes were manageable. I was able to work, attend to the needs of my family, all while attending online, evening classes.  One of the most rewarding opportunities South University offered involved attending the graduation ceremony in Savannah, GA. I met other graduates and their families. After speaking with one Registered Nurse, I was inspired and led onto my journey to obtaining my BSN."
Senior,4,I like that the teachers work with you.  They want you to learn and to succeed! Their are labs and study groups and library resources that assist in making learning easier. This learning experience is much better than USC's .
Graduate Student,4,"I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with South University. Even though one of the classes was hard, the professor stuck with me and wanted to see me succeed. There goal is to make each student a success story. I would love for tuition to go down but I doubt that will happen and even though that probably won't change, I will continue my studies and graduate with my graduates degree in nursing (FNP)! Each professor brings their own unique experience along with their teaching style and I love it! South University-Columbia campus is the place to be!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at South has been great so far. I was skeptical at first, but my professors have been good, the curriculum is solid, and there are so many resources available to help you succeed. I do wish the financial aid department had better communication skills. The cost is outrageous...BUT I am happy here for now."
Sophomore,4,"South University is a really amazing school and everyone is so friendly there. My professors always try to help out when they can, which I really appreciate. I graduated high school early so it has it's ups and downs. I'm glad I get to finish school early but I missed all of the end of the year senior fun. In the end I'll learn get to be a physician so it's ok."
Niche User,4,"It is a nice campus. Faculty are willing to see you succeed, from my experience. Classes are flexible with my schedule as well."

College Senior,4,the teachers are very caring and involved with the students concerns. Classes are small which helps make the experience more personal.
College Senior,4,"South University-Columbia has a great reputation in the hospitals around the area, with the BSN graduates they produce."
College Senior,4,"The BSN program has a large workload and is very difficult topic, but the teachers are more than willing to help and really care about the students."
College Senior,4,South University - Columbia has been a great school for me. The staff really cares about its students and it helps that the classes are small.
College Sophomore,4,Perfectly fit into my schedule
College Sophomore,4,I wouldn't trade schools for anything in the world
College Sophomore,4,"the teachers on campus are great. I would recommend anyone to attend South if it was affordable,"
College Sophomore,4,The cost of tuition is very expensive.
College Sophomore,4,"Since this my first time in this field, it is exciting, yet tasking. "

"
College Sophomore,4,Best instructors willing to help anytime
College Sophomore,4,"I just started here at SU, but from the professors i have, their pretty hands-on which is a plus for me so i think ill do pretty well this quarter. Compared to the previous schools i attended its by far the best as of this point."
College Junior,4,I had an issue getting my classes on campus. It's easy for universities to offer online classes.
College Junior,4,Workload- I have always taken 18-20 credits. registration is quick and easy.
College Junior,4,They help! but self help is the best help!!
College Junior,4,"I hate online classes. I do not learn anything from them. They are convenient for working professionals which I am, a registered nurse, but I like my instructor to be in person. It's easy to make an A+ in online classes! All you do is follow the rubric."
College Junior,4,"Most of the professors are very involved with their students, as far as the classes that I have taken. I can't say for any of the other academics in the school. But as far as the Health Science and Medical Assisting program go, most of the professors were pretty great. As long as you are honest and respectful toward them, they will give you the same honesty and respect right back. If not, you will see a teacher that truly does not care if you fail."
College Junior,4,"The computer labs are usually available, as long as you come by before or after class times. Other than that, it's pretty good."
College Senior,4,The school is very flexible when it came down to my schedule and my needs. I can not speak for anyone else but I was able to finish a couple courses that were not originally offered during a specific term. The director of my degree program made an exception in my case and those of a couple of other students with the Dean's permission of course.
College Senior,4,The student body is made up mostly of women since it is a nursing school. For the most  part the student body consists of various individuals from all walks of like trying to further their career in order to better themselves.
College Sophomore,4,I take online courses.  So I cannot really answer this.
College Sophomore,4,I am a new student enrolled at South University.  So far the staff has been very good with anwering questions and providing  resources.  I yet have no  complaints.
College Freshman,4,I find I am learning. The curriculum is challenging enough.
College Freshman,4,"Everyone, even Albert Einstein has(d) room for improvement."
College Junior,4,"The school does supply computers, printers, reliable internet."
College Junior,4,I have not made very many friends at this school. The interaction with my classmates has been very limited. I normally talk with the people around me and everyone has been very friendly and helpful. Most of them are adults with full-time jobs and families.
College Junior,4,"I am currently in the process of changing from a health science major to a nursing major. The experience I have with the health science program has been nothing but positive. The instructors are helpful, the workload is moderate, and the curriculum is straightforward. Help is always there if you need it."
College Junior,4,"I entered this school as a health science major. My goal was to eventually change over to the nursing program. The basic classes I have taken seemed pretty simple. They required a small amount of time and effort in comparison to other classes I have taken at other colleges. The professors were very nice and helpful. They seem proud of you when you do a good job and want to see their students succeed. Class registration process is hassle free. There are extra study sessions and help available if you need it for your classes. So far, this school has been great. I am actually about to start my nursing clinicals in April."
College Junior,4,The campus is great but the online classes are much harder than campus classes. All of my credits transferred from a previous college that I attended.
College Junior,4,I chose South University because of the flexibility of the class schedules. I am able to work fulltime and go to school after I get off of work. They also have online and Saturday classes.
College Junior,4,The tuition and financial aid at South University was easy to apply for. I was able to get enough financial aid to cover the cost of my classes.
College Sophomore,4,"Thus far, the financial aid process has been a bump-free road"
College Senior,4,"Very convince for the working adult. Once you get use to how things work and flow, you can easily navigate yourself to a passing grade."
College Senior,4,Pleased With Choice – I really like my school and plan on going back for my other degrees.
College Sophomore,4,"As a student, who prefers classroom instruction, the last thing that i ever wanted to do was take an online course. My reasons for the opposition was that I did not believe that I was computer savy and I did not think that I had the discipline necessary for taking online courses. South University's tutorial introduction to online courses, in addition to an adjustment with study time, provided me with the preparation needed for success."
College Sophomore,4,"I came to this school one day to obtain information regarding the Nursing Program. I was so impressed with the efficiency of the University that by the end of the day, I had enrolled, had my classes scheduled for the next quarter, and had my financial aid/payment plan set up. My only regret was that I did not come here sooner. The only problem that I have is that this school does not provide certificates acknowledging students who made the Dean's/President's List which is a big accomplishment."
College Sophomore,4,There is always someone who can help you with finding a job whether in school or about to graduate they help prepare you for the real world
College Sophomore,4,Student Diversity – Mostly adults that go South University (columbia sc) campus. Alot of career driven and motivated students. Focused on accomplishing there degree as quickly as possible.
College Sophomore,4,Computer Labs – There is always someone there to assist you and the environment is conducive for concentrating and studying
College Sophomore,2,My past experience with online classes was the worst. Its hard to speak with someone at the time of need. 
College Sophomore,2,"The resource are pretty okay. The library is less technology and more books which is a down side but the computers are always available. Athletics, im not sure if they have any."
College Junior,2,The only Resources that are readily available is the library and computer rooms. The student center is quite small and the campus activities aren't that interesting.
College Sophomore,2,"It's a good school. I am attending online and the classes are easy to access. It's a lot of work, and the classes are chosen according to my major, which i don't like"
College Sophomore,2,"SU Tuition – The people at the financial aid office really help you, however, the tuition is totally unreasonable. Going up again this fall."
College Freshman,2,Job Prospects – There are job prospects but there isn't a guarantee for a job
College Junior,2,"School Flexibility – Being that it is a small school, they don't offer many choices with class times, which is a little bit of disappointment"
College Junior,2,"I was barred from using Career Service as I was an employee of a sister school when attending. I can tell you the career service section of the school where I worked was okay if you were completely new to job searching but did not provide services beyond resume correction, beginner job searching, etc. No leads were provided beyond what the student could find on their own. Most of these services could be performed by the student if they'd ever visited careerbuilder or similar sites or googled ""job interview strategies""."
College Freshman,2,South University – I really don't know.  I am an online student.  But those that I do have contact with are great.
College Sophomore,2,Started Off Well Now Seems Like ........ Rhymes With Well! The start of it was good financial aid was in place and everything was rolling. A year being enrolled now there are always problems with my financial aid which i never had in the pass and a lot of my credits they wouldnt except. I feel like im trapped here so I might as well get it done and get out of there quick!!!!!
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid at South is easy to btain, however I do not like the fact that they are now charging us digital book fees whether we like it or not. This forces the student to pay for a book that he or she will or will not use. This should be left up to the student's decision on whether they want to purchse these digital books because some people, like me need a book in hand."
College Sophomore,2,Professors Don't Grade Work Faast Enough – I wish that my professors would grade the work at the end of the week and not the following. I hate waiting for a week just to know my grades. I have a 4.0 GPA to keep up and having my grades would really help.
College Senior,1,Some teacher didn't give reason why the to points off even if you e-mail them to ask why
College Junior,1,My tuition is to much and there's no type of scholarship or grants to help you at all.
College Senior,1,"If post grad services exist at South in Columbia, SC. They have hiddeen them well."
College Senior,1,"For PROFIT – The folks in financial aid get bonuses to get people signed up. They will basically tell you whatever to get you a loan and get you enrolled. Also the department is a mess, I have repeatedly said I do not want any additional funds above the cost of classes. I end up returning checks to get credit at least twice a year because they don't listen! Also their classes are more expensive than other colleges/universities offering the same program or better. I say better because they are NOT CACREP certified - something that would have been good to know going in. CACREP is needed if you plan to work in the federal  gov't. system which had been my original plan. Now I am too far in to change schools."
College Freshman,1,"Online Education Scam Artisits. Having been a highest honors and President's list student for over three years at campus schools (with no financial help from parents, grandparents etc.), I feel that I had a pretty good handle on the cost of attending school.
I saw a huge ""red flag"" in their requirement to apply for student loans before application for attendance can be completed; but having moved to no-where North Dakota, I was desparate to continue my education. I was then handed one shotty excuse for a class after another for two quarters. I maintained my 4.0 GPA, but was not actually learning . . . anything. 
I believe the positive reviews on this site have been written by people with no experiance to quality formal education, and likely people who have not yet seen the gross difference in what they were told they would be paying, and what they are actually being charged; quietly in the form of student loans that they were told would not be charged without prior consent.
The school's policy to have students apply for student loans ""just in case they need it"" under the premise that it will not be accessed by the school is outright fraudulent but due to very careful wording they are still within legal limits.
DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL if you have any concern for your future finanices, they will rob you blind. It took me two quarters to see what what happening, and I stay on top of my credit and finances and those two quarters were enough for the school to rack up over 12k on my student loans."

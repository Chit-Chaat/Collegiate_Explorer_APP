Niche User,5,Kalamazoo was a great place to be the environment was awesome. A the people including the professors were very nice and helpful. The sports were also good. Everyone showed up to support. All in all this is a great school
Niche User,5,Taking online during covid was different but the professors were great with help and understood a lot.
Niche User,5,great college and you will feel at home with the staff and the students. the proximity to downtown will make the experience even better with all the activities and opportunities it offers.
Sophomore,5,"I have had the experience of a lifetime so far at Kalamazoo College. I love every aspect of life at K. Everything is top notch whether it be athletics, professors, or student life. I could not have made a better choice coming to K."
Freshman,5,"Though a college with a small campus, Kalamazoo College is large in academic excellence. It fosters a strong relationship between students and professors as opposed to larger colleges. Overall, Kalamazoo College is a great college to be if you want to excel in today's world. It's awesome!"
Niche User,5,"The thing about Kalamazoo College is that it has a little something for everyone. There is never a dull moment at this school. The atmosphere is a blessing in itself. The food is something else as well, you can tell that they really care about what does into the mouths of the students. They also very much care about education, with many options and all are good."
Freshman,5,"I love my college so far. I made a huge decision to travel across the country for education, and it hasn't failed me. I feel very at home here and the students are very friendly."
Sophomore,5,"Very inclusive, and the professors really want you to succeed. There are a lot of opportunities to further your education. Also, the study abroad program is great!"
Niche User,5,I honestly love this school because of all the opportunities it has been able to provide to a very close friend of mine.He always talks about how the teachers at the school tend to actually care about the individual.
Senior,5,Kalamazoo College is a small school with a diverse and career-focused environment. Its open curriculum prepares students for a variety of workplaces and graduate programs. Every term at K makes you better-prepared for success.
Sophomore,5,"Kalamazoo College, through its unique programs, and small school atmosphere, has allowed me to challenge myself academically, and put myself out in the world. The students, professors, and resources at the school are reliable, and help me get through my studies. I am an incoming Sophomore at Kalamazoo College, and I look forward to the upcoming school year."
Niche User,5,"Kalamazoo College is small but very beautiful. The K-Plan is a unique and engaging curriculum that reminds me of an Ivy League.  The faculty and students are attentive and caring. Although it is a small college, Western Michigan University is next door, so there is no lack of college parties or experiences. There are many diverse and intellectual students here, and no one I know of regrets choosing K College."
Freshman,5,"The academics, housing, teachers, students, and diversity is beyond amazing at this school. The food in the cafeteria is okay, but that's what food on West Main and Roadhouse $3 Tender Tuesdays are for! The party scene has also gotten a lot better in the past few years due to more diversity and intercultural individuals coming to campus. People really look out for each other out here, everyone is super nice, but because we really are a community, everyone knows everyone and that can cause drama at times. Otherwise, AMAZING school."
Alum,5,"I really grew as a person at Kalamazoo, both academically and generally as a person. Moreover, I formed many life-long connections with my peers. I think this is a college that particularly benefits intellectually gifted young people who are still trying to find their path in the world. My only complaint is that the town can seem awfully isolated sometimes."
Junior,5,Everything is good. Except that it should provide more scholarships to hard working and genuine students.
Alum,5,"Kalamazoo College was a great place to learn and grow as a young person.  The small campus atmosphere offered lots of room to think and grow, and I appreciated the professors who were very dedicated to teaching and spending time with the students.  The international experience was also vital to my learning."
Freshman,5,Kalamazoo College is both big and small. You are always changing classes and meeting new people and professors every trimester. I love Kalamazoo College.
Freshman,5,I love the small classrooms where I get individualized attention from all of my professors.  I'm very glad I decided on this school.  It offers me an excellent education and has afforded me many opportunity for complex learning.
Alum,5,Amazing university with a diverse student body and staff. K's Center for Civic Engagement teams up with local organizations to improve the greater Kalamazoo Community in various ways. Excellent selection of study abroad programs. Needs a new pool!
Niche User,5,It seems like a really interesting school that is very ends on an intuitive. Every one that I met there were very welcoming and made me feel like I was valued as a student. 
College Junior,5,"All of my professors have been helpful for my pursuit towards my computer science and psychology degrees. I noticed that they do not want to see you fail, so when you meet them halfway and talk to them, they will be of tremendous help. Some professors are also passionate about some of the student social movements and will be supportive in that manor. I love them."
College Freshman,5,"People say that with a degree from K, my work applications will stand out and I could get into the Graduate school of my choice."
College Sophomore,5,Kalamazoo has been an amazing experience both academically and socially as part of he swim team and as a biology student
College Freshman,5,It was very easy to go through the housing process. The housing committee really listened to the applications and paired roommates who get along quite nicely.
College Freshman,5,"Some really nice places nearby. Crow's Nest is a favorite... also Water Street Coffee, Zazio's, Food Dance, and many more."
College Freshman,5,"K College made sure that coming here was possible for me. I got a pretty huge scholarship-- I don't get any need-based aid, but my merit scholarship covers a pretty huge percentage of tuition. Contact the Financial Aid Office and Admissions Office--honestly, they are super approachable and here to help."
College Freshman,5,"The food here is honestly really good. They rotate the choices out a lot, have lots of vegan/vegetarian options, great salad bar with all sorts of dressings and toppings, really good pizza...they try, they really try. Sometimes it gets old, sure, but it's good food for a cafeteria, and the staff really takes your comments to heart."
College Senior,5,The English Department is the greatest department of the college in my opinion. My writing has improved tremendously and I've been introduced to so many theories and schools of thought through the major.
College Senior,5,"K College is the best school in Michigan with U of Michigan in Ann Arbor being its only real competitor. Though we only take three classes per trimester, this is a very tough school. Each trimester is only 10 weeks long so we move very fast. In the fall and winter, we're usually taking finals while most other schools are just getting into mid-terms. Skipping class can be fatal to your grade and is not something that is encouraged. K Students study during most of the week and leave the partying on Friday and Saturday night. Usually on Sundays, K students are back to hitting the books. Popular study areas are the lounges in dorms, Hicks, and the library. The curriculum at K is, in my opinion, the best one out there. The K plan allows you to customize your education and there only a few broad requirements. You have to take a language up to at least the 2 year level, you have to get 5 gym credits, and you have to take a seminar every year. Aside from that, the requirements differ depending on your major."
College Senior,5,"The small class sizes allows students to create personal relationships with the professors here. The profs genuinely care about your well being and that is something I've been consistently reminded of. When I experienced a tragedy recently, I received an outpouring of support from my profs, many who had become mentors and helped me stay afloat even as I was sinking. I came to this school because my high school was fairly small and intimate and I have not been disappointed by how strong the community here is."
College Senior,5,"In my time at K, I've had a total of three internships. One of those internships was in government which not only boosted up my resume but changed my perspective on the world. K is known for being a tough and rigorous school and I've often been told that a 3.5 here is like a 4.0 at other schools. K may not be as well known outside Michigan, but the right people know of it and know its reputation. Graduating with a degree from K will put you in a good spot."
College Freshman,5,"K College is very liberal and very accepting of everyone, except maybe conservatives."
College Freshman,5,"Most of the hard science classes are done in the typical lecture hall type setting, but the other subjects are done in a classroom setting or even in a library lounge area. The professors are very friendly and knowledgeable."
College Freshman,5,"The academics are AMAZING. Super hard (at least for me, and I'm doing a pre-med curriculum) but super rewarding and intellectually stimulating."
College Freshman,5,I'm currently on a pre-med track and there is a lot of support and guidance. We have a Center for Career and Professional Development that provides lots of internship and externship opportunities as well as job fairs.
College Freshman,5,Any complaint of sexual assault of any kind is promptly and thoroughly investigated. We had a mandatory lecture the first week of school that talked about sexual assault and how it is not tolerated in any form on campus.
College Junior,5,"Like I said, work hard and Kalamazoo will reward you with good grades"
College Freshman,5,Tender tuesday at the roadhouse is the only thing I live for
College Freshman,5,This is the only thing K college cares about and they try really damn hard to turn you into a liberal. I don't necessarily agree with a lot of it but they put a lot of effort in this area.
College Freshman,5,Has its perks for living a large room.
College Freshman,5,They are super helpful and are always there for support.
College Freshman,5,Fantastic. Humbled for the awards.
College Sophomore,5,I feel safe leaving my laptop unattended in the library and my dorm unlocked
College Junior,5,"Very academic school. New science building. Very rigorous but rewarding. I study philosophy, and I think the humanities program is great. Very tough, but very rewarding. Most students study abroad, from which I've just returned, and I think it's an essential opportunity to take if available; one of the trademarks of the school."
College Freshman,5,Kalamazoo College gives an enormous amount of money to their students and have many different types of scholarships.
College Sophomore,5,The rules are very reasonable. Because we are a private school we do not have to worry about the police on our campus. Our school is strict about alcohol and drugs but they always allow the student to explain themselves and have a fair chance to not get in trouble. If you don't get caught you are fine. If you do the first time with alcohol you are put on probation which isn't bad.
College Freshman,5,"There are always students at the library either studying or just hanging out. One of the best parts about K is that everywhere you look, you can always find green spaces and squirrels roaming around."
College Freshman,5,Everyone gets some kind of scholarship. K is very generous about helping students financially.
College Freshman,5,"The academic programs here are great! It covers pretty much almost every academic aspect. There is always something for everyone from history to neuroscience. There are really any ugly social scene at K and if there is, no worries, people usually forget about it in a few days. Campus life here is amazing! The dorms are pretty cozy and the RAs try very hard to make everyone feels comfortable. Also, there are all sorts of opportunity that you could check out at K since K is all about helping students find themselves and getting involved as much as possible."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are always willing to help you and get to know you personally. We only take around 3 classes in 10 weeks but the workload is pretty rigor here. Also, although K is a liberal arts college, more than half of the student body started off as a pre-med kid. There are also a lot of courses available although spaces fill up quickly."
College Senior,5,Off campus food will save you because it's very good and affordable.
College Freshman,5,"Kalamazoo College's campus is so small, it's hard to feel afraid or unsafe here. Security is just a phone call or short walk away. You will always receive a notification or email when a crime occurs in the city or neighborhood so students can be careful if/when they go out."
College Freshman,5,Kalamazoo gives you A LOT of money and many students will tell you that's the main reason they are here.
College Senior,5,"Very Diverse – Kalamazoo College has one of the best study abroad programs not just with outgoing students, but with incoming students as well.  They have a lot of diversity in race and country of origin.  One year I lived with a girl from Spain, France, and China all in one suite.  The language programs have students every year help out that are from the countries that speak the languages.  There are still have a lot of white students but they have a ton of others as well."
College Sophomore,5,I honestly don't know anyone who didn't get a scholarship from K.
College Sophomore,5,"Professors Really Care – Every single professor I have had so far, from my Women's History professor to my yoga teacher, has genuinely cared about my well-being and progress as a student. The classes are difficult, generally, but the professors are always available to answer questions. They really make the college feel like a community. For example, I had a professor my very first quarter and I did not do very well in her course, but every time I saw her in passing, she always asked how I was doing and talked to me like I really mattered. They really care here, and it shows."
College Freshman,5,"The college is very small, but it has a beautiful campus. I take philosophy and english classes and they are challenging with very knowledgeable professors. They are always open for office hours and friendly. The school is extremely challenging in the sciences and a lot of people drop their science ambitions within the first tri. Overall a great experience. They have lots of community events and have great internship opportunities."

College Freshman,5,"Since Kalamazoo is a small city and Western Michigan University is also located in Kalamazoo there is literally everything to eat within 15 minutes. Portage, Michigan is also within 20 minutes and there are a lot of different places to eat there also. Between Kalamazoo and Portage you have everything from fast food to expensive good food. There are a number of options for food after 12am including pizza, Jimmy Johns, Menna's Joint and various Asian restaurant that will deliver straight to the dorms on campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Computer Science & Mathematics at Kalamzoo College – My primary Major at K-College is Computer Science. I loved the Computer Science program, and rarely had difficulty with it. The class sizes are small at K-College which means a lot of personalized attention so any time I needed some clarification or help from the professors they were there for me. The professors really want their students to succeed and have a love for teaching which is evident in their helpful attitudes. The head of the Computer Science department, Alyce Brady, has worked as a Software Engineer and is therefore able to bring her knowledge of the industry to the program. I found myself very well prepared for entering the workforce after graduation and have been able to put into practice the techniques I learned at K-College.  Also, my professors were immensely helpful in helping me to find an internship over the summer between my junior and senior years. This internship led to my senior thesis and helped me in my search for employment.  I also had the opportunity to work with one of my professors over the summer as part of a grant that she was given by the college to create a new system for sorting students into their top choices for courses.

As for the Math program at K-College, it is also very good. Professors in the Math department are helpful and have a positive attitude. Although the workload is sometimes pretty heavy, there is always someone to help you if you get stuck - TA, professor, or other students.  Often I would do my homework outside the Math offices and other students would do the same so that we could work together.  It was a great learning experience and had I wanted to pursue Math further I have no doubt I could have done so."
Freshman,4,"Everyone us very kind and there to help. It isn't hard finding someone to connect with. The classes can be stressful and difficult, but the professors are always available to help, and study sessions are common. Overall K college is a very welcoming campus, with only a short walk to downtown Kalamazoo."
Senior,4,"The classes are rigorous, but sometimes professors are unapproachable. The college could do a better job with on-campus housing because the dorms are very old and need renovations."
Freshman,4,"Kalamazoo College has very helpful staff and good professors. The campus is welcoming as a majority white institution can be, and the environment for learning has been great for me. Other of my peers say that some classes are very self taught based."
Freshman,4,"I love the small campus, it really lets you get to know people and because the classes are small you get really connected to professors and feel like they genuinely care about your success"
Senior,4,"This school is dishonest to prospies about how truly stressful it is. Don't come if you don't have your mental health under control, you won't succeed. However, depending on your personal attitude and the dept. you're in, the teachers can be either indifferent or the most caring people you will ever meet in academics. 
I personally am an art major and have found love and acceptance in a great program. K's art program is excellent considering how much less funding that department gets than the rest of the school. Talk to a current student in your intended major before you accept the big scholarship they will most likely give you, it comes with some caveats."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I think that Kalamazoo college is actually very unique. There are a variety of clubs and organizations on campus to choose from. It allows for everyone to be a part of something. Academically, I enjoy being on trimesters and having to take three courses each semester. I also enjoy the fact that the campus is small and that allows me to create a relationship with my professors and makes it easy to reach out and ask for their help. In the last two years the percent of minorities that attend K College have actually increased, and that is something that I hope continues to happen over the coming years."
Sophomore,4,"Kalamazoo College is a very inviting college, that welcomes students from all diversities. We have a very welcoming community and going to college here is nice. The courses on the other hand are very limited and sometimes you can't get into the specific class that you wanted due to limited seats. Although, the professors at Kalamazoo College are very helpful and are more than eager to help you with what you need help with. The campus is very pretty and everything is remotely close since it is a small knitted campus. It is a home to many people and I have been blessed to call it my home as well."
Sophomore,4,"Kalamazoo is a small liberal arts college. The capacity of each class can range from a handful of students to approximately 30 students. The size of the class allows students to build a relationship with professors and receive the help that they need. 
Kalamazoo also has an amazing study abroad program which allows students to travel and grow as individuals.
Aside from the classes the Kalamazoo community is diverse, you'll meet amazing people from across the country and the world. Kalamazoo is great with providing scholarships and grants for students of color making this private institution affordable.
There are also plenty of opportunities to get involved in social justice work with the college and the surrounding community."
Senior,4,"Great campus for connecting with professors as most classes are very small. However, dorms and food aren't great and its very expensive. There are a lot of things that need to change and be updated on campus. The campus is pretty good with lgbtq+ things but needs to get its priorities straight. It tends to favor its image over actions which is frustrating especially when students are protesting for changes almost every year."
Alum,4,"Great academic school, with motivated teachers and a good group of students. Plenty of extracurriculars for many interests. However, if you have a specific plan going out of college that isn't going into academics, science, medical, or non-profit  related field, they were hard pressed to find post-college opportunities for me."
Freshman,4,"Love the community of people, everyone is very accepting and helpful. All classes are pretty small, the largest classes you can take are capped at 36. Professors are passionate and helpful, they actually want to teach rather than just be a successful researcher etc. Being a small school food options are limited, and don't expect a typical wild college experience. Everyone here is pretty studious, with small parties about once a week."
Niche User,4,"I've been on multiple visits here, and the campus has treated me well everytime. The college is the small college feel, with big oppurtunities. The facilities are old and classy but kept up great, and the sports are top notch."
Alum,4,"By far the coolest college experience of any of my friends from high school. The freeform curriculum allows its students to discover what they love and dig deeply into that while also exploring any number of other academic avenues that can fit within the four years. The bulit-in study abroad experience changes lives - it changed mine. I see the world with more understanding eyes because of my time here. Also, the professors really care about who you are as a person and what you're going through. They understand the stresses you're under and want to work with you to achieve."
Freshman,4,"I loved Kalamazoo College. The teachers are willing to help you grow and work with you to get an topic. Yet, the college has a hard time making sure the students that make the school ""diverse"" fit in."
College Junior,4,it has been a great experience
College Junior,4,The NCAA has screwed our athletics at the school. Other than that it has been a life-changing experience.
College Junior,4,"There are several job fairs throughout the school year. Many professors are doing active work and if you talk to them, can network and maybe land an internship in your desired department."
College Junior,4,There are many support groups to provide help and services for students. The school provides a forum to freshmen about the severity of sexual assault and students must finish a sexual assault online workshop
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is pretty good. Depending on the dorm, many have their own unique perks. Trowbridge has most of the freshmen and provide a great social atmosphere, Hoben, another freshmen-only dorm, is the closest to Hicks (which is really the center of campus and so i's close to the cafe and the gym (relatively) and most of the quad-based activities), Harmen, which is both freshmen and upper class have quad-like dorms, which provide community atmosphere and is also in the center of campus, Crissey, an upperclassmen dorm also has a great community atmosphere, but is at the bottom of campus (so great if you want to escape the K bubble) it also has suite-like dorms where many friends live together, and Severn, another upperclassmen suite-like dorm father away from campus, tends to be the quieter of the two dorms, so great for people who enjoy silence. There is a lottery to apply for the suite like dorms for upcoming sophomores and upperclassmen may the odds be ever in your favor."
College Junior,4,I would choose my school because I enjoy having small classes and getting to know my professors on a personal level. I like the opportunities to take leadership roles on campus and to study abroad. I love my friends that I have met there and the food.
College Sophomore,4,Very highly rated school and many job fairs and internships are available
College Sophomore,4,It is a really good school with many opportunities  and lots of diversity
College Sophomore,4,"I have always felt safe on campus, but I stay in a group when it is late at night"
College Sophomore,4,Great teachers and staff. Everyone is friendly and wants to help
College Freshman,4,All the classes I have taken here have been a great experience to learn more about the topic.
College Freshman,4,Lots of international students which is cool as well as racial/ethnic diversity.
College Freshman,4,"I have heard of a few incidents, but have not been personally effected."
College Freshman,4,All the professors I've had have been really great.
College Freshman,4,There are special opportunities for first and second-year students to lower competition for inter/externships.
College Sophomore,4,"I wish there was an it's good choice. The professors I've had have mostly been good to great, but some of the visiting and newer profs don't understand K's scheduling or work load. Most people have had good relationships with profs, and enjoy their classes. By sophomore year, when we have to declare majors, most people know what they want to do, and you start seeing them more regularly in your classes. Classes are small, so profs notice when you are missing, and they do try to reach out to you if you miss too many. But it's super easy to talk to professors, and form close relationships, and get invited to TA or do research. Man classes,  in the humanities at least, are discussion based, weaved in with some lectures and movies. Service learning is a big thing here, and you may have to do some volunteer service for classes. There are a lot of cool classes, but they fill up fast, because of the small cap size."
College Sophomore,4,"K pioneered the 'externship' program, where you go live and intern with an alumni to find out what they're job and life are really like. It's cool, but some are super competitive. The CCPD tries to get and many people involved as possible, and they are a good resource for helping you apply to internships and externships, even if they aren't through the school."
College Freshman,4,"Professors all work hard to get the information to us. If we have questions beyond their knowldge, they go out of their way to find the answer and help us out."
College Freshman,4,Security is always on the line if we need someone to walk with. They are very nice and friendly to those in need.
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities to meet alumni and reach out to the K communiy.
College Freshman,4,"The security crew is really great at K. We can call them 24 hours a day, and they are available to help with really anything. One night I had to walk in the dark by myself and I asked a security staff member to accompany me and he did so happily."
College Freshman,4,"I had on professor who was extremely unorganized and difficult to get a straight answer from. I had another professor who was hilarious, and great at teaching. I experienced success in his class and I also learned a lot. The last professor I had was extremely liberal and was a really easy grader--the class was not challenging. She just assigned a LOT of busywork."
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience at K has been very challenging. I get a very large workload and time management has been essential. It's manageable but I've had to work really hard to make it manageable. Also, the campus is very liberal. One thing that's been difficult for me is registering for classes. We register online, on our own. And, upperclassmen get first pick at the classes and by the time freshmen get to their registration time most classes are filled. Overall, though, K is a really great school. They help their students out a lot and really want us to be successful."
College Freshman,4,"I love that my school  has really small class sizes. It is so nice to know everyone and have my professors know me. Also the school has a good balance of school, athletics, and partying."
College Freshman,4,There are very good housing options close to campus.
College Freshman,4,There are lots of different restaurants around Kalamazoo that are great options. Students are given a fairly good discount.
College Freshman,4,"The campus isn't as strict as others are, however they are pretty strict about noise levels in the dorms and the use of alcohol in the dorms. They aren't very strict about smoking around campus, which is hard to enforce but it would be nice if there were more places that were smoke free."
College Freshman,4,It was a very smooth process and there were always people willing to help and answer questions from the financial aid office.
College Freshman,4,Very fun! The party scene is a good way to relax and have fun and that's good to have when all week it's been nonstop work and stress. It allows people the chance to unwind and have a good time with friends.
College Junior,4,I am currently looking for a place to live off campus and was pleasantly surprised at how many different choices I have so close to campus.
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of different varieties of options at many different prices, and there are often student discounts."
College Junior,4,"They really do try very hard to give as much as they can to students, but there have been a couple of cases where friends of mine have had to transfer because they couldn't afford it anymore, and the school couldn't give them anymore money."
College Sophomore,4,"There are some really good options in the area around campus. Some are more expensive than others, but most are decently priced."
College Sophomore,4,"Except for the honor code, the administration does not place any particularly harsh restrictions on anything."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are extremely close to the class buildings, and people are generally pretty social with each other because of the lack of student population. The housing lottery process can be a bit of a hassle but everything usually turns out fine. The overall amenities in the dorms are not too awful; the heat can be wonky sometimes but it is not a huge deal."
College Freshman,4,"Honestly, it's a D3 small liberal arts school. If you want a Big 10 sports environment, go somewhere else. If you want amazing academics and a great campus life, come to K. People are supportive of athletes, though."
College Freshman,4,"Parties here are a lot of fun. If you're super into the big school frat party scene, K probably isn't for you (although you can go to Western's parties) but if you want to drink and smoke weed and dance with lots of people you know, K has some solid parties. You do have to go off-campus for parties...our on-campus alcohol policy is absolutely archaic and pretty terrible, but most off-campus houses that host parties are pretty close by. There is almost always something happening on Friday and Saturday nights, and occasionally during the week. Plus 30/30 in the spring, where there is a big party every day for a month."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms here are quite nice for a small liberal arts school. You aren't going to have the ridiculously fancy state school suites, but if you come here you are coming for academics anyways, not for housing. A lot of the rooms are really big, even in the first year halls, and it's pretty easy to get a single if you want. I recommend writing on your housing form that you want to request a suite-style room in Trowbridge."
College Senior,4,Student life is pretty good. I've heard a lot of students who live off campus express sadness that they lose touch with such a good student experience on campus.
College Senior,4,"My freshman year, I hated K. I felt like I had been misled about how close the community is and wanted to leave. But I came back because of good profs and mentors who showed they genuinely cared about me. My sophomore year things improved more and continued to improved junior and senior year. K is a very tough school. The stress culture is a little ubiquitous and it seems people try to outdo each other with how busy they are. But this school offers a great education and when I hear about the experiences of some of my friends and relatives who go to big state schools, the difference is striking. K is truly unique and though it's very expensive, it's worth it. K has forced me to grow as a person and care more about contributing to positive change around."
College Senior,4,Off-campus options are pretty decent and a lot of restaurants downtown offer a student discount. You can order pizza from Papa Johns at almost any time of the day if you need to eat late at night and the local places are pretty sweet.
College Freshman,4,K College is really generous with its financial aid packages but I definitely needed to make up a fairly large portion of tuition through scholarships and student loans.
College Freshman,4,"Kalamazoo College is very liberal, so protests and demonstrations are common. Lots of activism here. New student organizations pop up every week it seems like. Alcohol use in dorms is prohibited and that is enforced fairly strictly."
College Junior,4,"Work hard, and Kalamazoo will reward you. Blow school off and college will be a nightmare"
College Freshman,4,"Nice campus, stuff to do, small so you don't have to walk a ton."
College Freshman,4,Parties usually happen on Saturdays at various houses.
Senior,2,"The college is good, but the trimesters create a stress culture. Other than after graduation opportunities K has little to offer especially to POC students. The school is no where near as diverse as advertised. Athletics are laughable at best. The academic standards make it hard to retain good athletes. The best thing about K is having Western right next door."
Freshman,2,"This school is mostly white upper-class Michiganders. Athletics aren't very competitive, and the professors are generally invested in your success. But, the parties aren't safe or very enjoyable, Kalamazoo is too much of a hassle to actually explore, and introverts,  don't bother, most social events are in large groups and you'll feel very anxious and uncomfortable. Stacks is good food in a jam, caf is fairly average, food surrounding campus is just okay. A lot of clubs and potential interests, but you won't have time due to a heavy workload. Get a dorm in Harmon, has the most room. Girl and guys, be careful. People here are very sensitive and take a small advance as something much more than what it is. Additionally, people here get offended very easily and any side other than a liberal one isn't respected. People are willfully ignorant and want their worldview reinforced."
College Freshman,2,"My dorm room is TINY, but I think that my roommate and I got one of the smallest options on campus. We were randomly put into this room and we hate it, because we have peers with larger rooms, suite style, and a bathroom shared with one other room. Her and I have a tiny room and use a community bathroom that usually isn't wonderfully cleaned."
College Freshman,2,"Mixed bag. The administration is super accessible, which is amazing. You can have anyone stay over in any dorm you want any time without checking in. Honor code is big here. The big problem is our alcohol policy-- it is absolutely horrendous and forces students to binge drink off campus. It is dangerous and I really hope that they can address this issue someday soon."
College Senior,2,"The sad thing is we just got rid of a dining provider that was worst than the current one, but the current one still isn't that great. They do try though, bless their hearts. They just aren't that great. When we have Visit the Zoo programs where prospective students and their families visit campus it seems like dining services put in a little more effort. And Cafsgiving is legendary. But unfortunately, as of late, good caf days have been too few."
College Junior,2,"You have to take care of yourself first, admin will through you under the bus"
College Junior,2,Most parties are held in someone's basement and the music is usually top 40
College Junior,2,Midwestern small town equals little to no diversity
College Freshman,2,"Football games draw a nice crowd, but a lot of basketball games are over break when everyone is gone so not much there."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Racially close to none, mostly liberals"
Recent Alumnus,2,Go to a different school if you like sports
Recent Alumnus,2,They have a stick up their butt most of the time.
College Junior,2,Kalamazoo College requires you to live in the dorms until spring of your junior year. Its very inconvenient as well as over priced compared to off campus housing.
College Sophomore,2,"Mediocre Athletic Support – Our sports aren't that great overall. However, our Tennis and Swimming team does extremely well. Because we are an academic school, fan support isn't too great but during homecoming week, school spirit is at it's height."
College Sophomore,2,"They Try – Sodexo is the company that provides the food in the cafeteria in Hicks. They try really hard to make the food diverse and gluten-free, vegetarian, etc, but it usually is disappointing, especially closer to breaks and summer. When you're sick of the caf, you can get a sub or a wrap at Stacks. Personally, I love Stacks, but I know people who don't."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Very Racially/Politically Diverse – K College is very white, but is making a strong effort to be more diverse, through various outreach programs. The students really try to dismantle racism, through seminars and CAT, the Black Student Organization performance, but we have a long way to go. The economic background, however, is very diverse. Politically, K is overwhelmingly liberal, and often students forget that not everyone thinks like them. However, K is extremely accepting, especially of all sexual orientations, as evidenced by Crystal Ball, a dance in which the students cross-dress. The student support for such events is great."
College Junior,2,"Students Are Fine, Administration Needs Help – I may not be the most impartial observer in the matter of student housing. While living on campus, my suite was broken into, and while nothing was stolen, the common area was vandalized. When one of my suitemates, who I didn't know because of random assignment and never spoke to, found the bathroom, she brought the issue to the administration, and told them I had done it. Rather than looking any further into the matter, I was placed on social probation, and given two weeks to find a new place off campus to live. 

While my experience living in the dorms up until that point had been unremarkable, sometimes frustrating, the way the college decided to deal with the situation was unbelievable. I have no idea if my experience is an isolated incident, or just one more in a long trend. But I, at least, am glad I'm not dealing with their housing department anymore."
College Freshman,2,I got 6 parking tickets within my first tri. Ask for a pamphlet of the parking options of the school.
College Junior,2,"There isn't a lot of attention paid to athletics at K. Those who are involved seem really close and seem to like it; it's kinda obvious who plays sports and who doesn't. But going to sporting events is not big on campus. K students definitely put academics before athletics. We definitely don't have any ""dumb jocks."""
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking in Dorms – It all depends on the RA's. If you're quiet enough and don't get any complaints, you should be fine. Some RA's, however, are crazy when it comes to cracking down on this. Pretty strict policies if you're caught."
College Freshman,1,"Although the campus is becoming diversify, once they bring people of different ethnic and race backgrounds they do not know what to do with them once they are here. Such as not having resources for them.There are many people who are racist to minorities on campus but yet deny that racism exist. Kalamazoo is a predominantly white institution with many privileged students who do not want student of color in this institution."
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have any Greek life on campus, however we are able to join Western Michigan University's Greek life. We also have Living Learning Houses that each have a different theme that is the closest form of Greek life we have."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Difficult – Freshman are not allowed to have parking passes unless they have an off-campus job, ten hours or more a week, although many students get around the rules. There are very few parking lots on campus with very few spots. Street parking fills up right away during classes. Security is really on top of ticketing at night, but the tickets aren't that expensive. All that being said, it's not too bad not having a car on campus. Walgreens is within walking distance."
College Junior,1,"So Strict – Administrators are so strict, to the point that many students think the college takes joy in seeking out students who break rules in order to punish them."

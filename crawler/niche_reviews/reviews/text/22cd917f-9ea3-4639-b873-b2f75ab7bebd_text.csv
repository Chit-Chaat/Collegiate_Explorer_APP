Alum,5,"A truly transformative 4 years in a beautiful location with a wonderful group of brilliant, kind people. The school opened so many doors for me - I am forever grateful."
Alum,5,I found Colby to be extremely supportive with post grad plans and accessing alumni resources. Huge network to rely upon.
Sophomore,5,All my instructors were incredible at understanding the challenges that students like myself had to face with remote-learning and made the transition easy and intuitive.
Sophomore,5,A school with a great community and so much promise — I’ve found a home at Colby and can’t wait to come back in the fall!
Sophomore,5,Wonderful people and faculty and a beautiful campus. I absolutely love everything about Colby! I highly recommend attending
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Colby! It was more than I expected, and I could not be happier with my choice of school!"
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes, nor were they very common at the time I was in college (2003-2008). However, Colby is always at the forefront of educating its students, so I can only imagine in this age of online classes, they must offer the best of that also."
Alum,5,"The 4 years I spent at Colby were some of the best years of my life! I was challenged and pushed to become my best by teachers who went above and beyond. Through Colby's variety of programs and class offerings - in particular, the importance Colby put on studying abroad - my eyes were opened to the whole wide world that awaited me upon graduation, and I couldn't be more grateful!"
Freshman,5,"Amazing people who are there to work and hard and play hard. People are hands-on and it isn’t just about the grades, although everyone strives to do well."
Freshman,5,"Gorgeous campus, welcoming, laid-back people, wonderful professors who really care and fully engage with their students. Classes taught by professors! Great access to the outdoors, to skiing, the coast, the awesome city of Portland. People socialize on campus, but also in local old mill town which is being reinvested in. Overall, A+"
Niche User,5,"It was amazing, Colby College is like a powerhouse that is full of doors with opportunities right behind then, which are in fact really easy to obtain if you have your mindset set on accomplishment."
Freshman,5,Colby is a great place to meet new people. The campus and community is very intimate and friendly. Maine is beautiful all year round. Coming from the Midwest we never get much snow but the northeast gives you a chance to experience some wintry outdoor fun. The professors are all about helping their students. I love the classes and the beautiful campus. I love having best of both worlds beaches and skiing. Simply a great place to go to college.
Alum,5,"A truly exceptional school and I feel very fortunate to have attended it. I found the school community warm, welcoming, academically-driven, and the administration always found ways to support the students' goals."
Sophomore,5,"It’s been absolutely fantastic. Unlike many of my friends at larger schools, I loved every second of being here since the start of freshman year. Since it’s smaller, your education and social life feel more personal. You’re very easily able to meet people and get have a personal connection with professors. Being in a remote location means all social events mainly happen on campus, making events and parties accessible to all students. Since there’s no greek life, sports teams host  the majority of parties that allow anyone to join. Overall it very much feels like home and I am grateful to have such a wonderful college experience thus far."
Freshman,5,"I'm a minority first year student here at Colby -- although at first I was hesitant to come, I have found myself to love it here so far. My professors have all been extremely welcoming and accessible. There are strong support networks for POC and first-gen students. The funding and internship opportunities (through DavisConnects) are endless. I've met some of the most genuine, kind students here. If you are a self-motivated student who is willing to take a chance and take advantage of the resources available to you, you will thrive at Colby."
Niche User,5,"I'm a parent of a rising sophomore who had an extremely positive first year at Colby. I've been really impressed by Colby's commitment to excellence in everything they do. The faculty and staff my son has interacted with so far have all been professional, supportive and highly accessible, more so than one would likely find at a larger university. The campus itself is stunning with Portland, the coast and ski slopes all just an hour away. The college is deep into a record-setting fundraising campaign that is allowing it to offer generous resources to its students including financial aid, paid experiences abroad and a best-in-class athletic center due to open in 2020. There's a dynamism at Colby that's palpable. It may or may not be the best fit for your son or daughter, but I can say without hesitation that it's been a great fit for mine."
Sophomore,5,"I love being at Colby, I am very happy and believe that Colby is a great place to be. I have enjoyed my time on the varsity sports team and that has been beneficial for the social scene. I think that if I was not an athlete the social scene would have been more challenging. The academics are difficult but not impossible and the connections made attending Colby are incredible. My father also attended Colby. I have also had a ton of conversations started just by the fact that I was wearing my Colby gear."
Niche User,5,"Great, small liberal-arts college in Central Maine. The small size allows for everyone to know each other and connect better while surrounded by Maine's amazing Maine."
Alum,5,"A top notch education.  Prepares students to learn over a lifetime in a safe, beautiful and challenging environment."
Junior,5,"At first, I thought Colby might be too far, or isolated, but Instead found the opposite.  Many students are from the DC,  Boston and NYC area and Waterville is right off i95.   Catching a ride from classmates with cars driving to NYC is not too difficult.   My classes are interesting and relevant.   Davis Career Center is a great new resource for Internships and study abroad programs.  Colby commitment comes from admin and students.  Being outgoing, creative and positive pays off in opportunities.  Colby College Museum of Art is largest in Maine and has been written about in NYTimes.  Check it out."
Alum,5,"I am so happy that I chose Colby to be my college. Like every school, Colby has its flaws (i.e., diversity issues, and imperfect dorms), the friendships I have made, the education I have received, and the life experiences I had were absolutely amazing because of Colby. Calling myself an alum makes me proud and the Colby community persists long after your 4 years. 

What made Colby so great for me were its talented professors, who would form friendships with students and bend over backwards to help you learn. Also, at Colby, you can make it what you want: Colby has many wonderful opportunities for students (accessibly study abroad, unique on-campus jobs, surrounding wildlife, research, etc.). The amazing education added onto the many unique experiences make Colby unique."
Freshman,5,"Exceptional college with a great community. Though in the middle of nowhere, Maine is absolutely beautiful and there are tons of things to do."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Colby. I am a member of the Women's Soccer team and am currently pursuing a Biology/Pre-Health major with the aspiration of going to medical school. Colby has provided me so many great resources, not just academically, but also in terms of networking, and helping me create my future beyond Colby. The student body is incredibly diverse and everyone is super friendly. Colby is also a really active school. The Outing Club is super popular, there is so much local outdoor recreation. There's a college ski pass to Sugarloaf, Loon, and Sunday River for the winter. I am also a Colby Cares About Kids Mentor which is a really cool volunteering program a Colby. Colby students are matched with a student (usually low-income) in the local Waterville area school district. There are so many ways to get involved inside and outside of Colby. It really is a school that is what you make of it."
Alum,5,"Colby College offers a unique place to study closely with your professors. Professors are readily accessible and even go out of their way to spend time with you.

While Colby is not located near a major city, for those that attend there that is actually one of the major drawing points. Colby is surrounded by beautiful lakes, mountains - and with a short drive - one can make it to the ocean as well. Ever been to Acadia National Park...? Colby is the perfect place for an outdoor enthusiast.

Important to note as well: Colby's name resonates well with employers, especially on the East Coast."
Freshman,5,"Colby College is simply amazing. Work hard play hard. Everyone wants do as good as possible in school, but nobody is competing. School is chilled and people are amazing. Student body is pretty diverse, even though it can be grater."
College Sophomore,5,"Courses and professors at this school are amazing. You will be challenged, but you will also learn a tremendous amount. Professors are highly qualified and are really passionate about their subjects. Class sizes are small and there are a variety of courses offered."
College Sophomore,5,Alumni network is amazing. Career center is great. The value of a degree from here is priceless.
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is safe overall. Security is always around and easily accessible. Campus crime, such as stealing, is rare. People don't usually lock their dorm doors, and often leave they're backpacks around with no fear. I feel very safe on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Although the school has its flaws (as does every other college), the pros are far more abundant than the cons. Beautiful campus with awesome people, faculty and professors. Social life is really fun and abundant. People here work hard, play hard, and love the outdoors."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics are fantastic. Professors are always willing to help you with any questions you have. You can always find help with class material at office hours, tutoring sessions and TA meetings."
College Sophomore,5,Colby has a fantastic alumni network that helps students navigate their career path post-graduation.
College Junior,5,"Professors are engaged, excited and really care about students. I've learned to think in new ways I never thought I could since I got here. Also, professors are willing to adjust their curriculum schedules to make sure everyone is getting the most out of each class. You can tell they really love what they do and they want to make it amazing for the students."
College Junior,5,"Colby is a name that gets ""oohs"", ""aaaahs"", ""wow""s and jobs"
College Junior,5,"Devoted, enthusiastic, incredible professors that really help you to think in ways you never thought you could. Super friendly atmosphere amongst students. Several major ""types"" of kids: poly-sci/business/science-orientated athletes; crunchy, outdoorsy hippies; eccentric arts kids; super-students. Very white, accepts a LOT of Maine/New England kids and public-school kids (how I got in). Incredible, expansive campus with an hundred-acre arboretum makes the school feel like its own world (as opposed to feeling like going to school in a city park). Three dining halls with different/distinct food options, and unlimited meal swipes make life so much easier."
College Junior,5,"Overall, I love Colby. Like all schools, Colby has its weaknesses and imperfections but it is not hard to be grateful for all the resources Colby provides. The professors are all amazing, and there is a great sense of community. Though the student body can seem homogenous at times (white, rich, athletic), I have found that there are some really cool and unique people here, you just have to search a little harder. Regardless, everyone has a cool story and is extremely smart and friendly."
College Junior,5,"I love Colby, its community, and all the resources it offers."
College Freshman,5,"Teachers are all amazing people.Courses are hard but really satisfying, and the small class size is really nice."
College Freshman,5,It's a gorgeous campus with very involved classroom settings. Great extracurriculars and community feel
College Freshman,5,"School has been outstanding so far. The Maine weather is definitely tough, but otherwise absolutely everything else about this place has been perfect."
College Junior,5,"If you're into strong academics, Colby is the place to be. Apart from all the majors, smart and supportive professors and study abroad options, It offers a unique environment for students to participate in research. As a liberal arts college with professors committed only on undergraduates, Colby offers incredible scholarship opportunities for those into basic research.  This point, I believe, is what makes Colby even more desirable than big research universities. Professors have no PhD students, postdocs etc. to distract them so undergraduates can be much more involved in all aspects of research. I would definitely choose Colby again if I could do it all over again."
Recent Alumnus,5,"As a recent graduate of Colby College, I look back on my past four years in Waterville fondly. For me, the mix of rigorous academics with the tight-knit community was perfect. If I had the opportunity to do it all over again, I would."
College Sophomore,5,"Not only is Colby College a small, safe environment, it offers me everything I didn't even know I wanted. While academics are great with small classes and friendly professors, the overall tone of the campus is what makes it special. Everyone is happy and approachable, making college feel like a home. Colby's size would seem too small, to some, but it actually fosters a tight knit community with amazing opportunities for everyone. Finally, its Maine setting allows for wonderful outdoor experiences that I didn't even know I wanted to have. I am so glad I ended up at Colby and would never go anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,I really enjoy living on campus at Colby.  I am extremely close to all of my classes and dining halls (about five minutes maximum) and I absolutely love the roommate I was randomly placed with.  Campus Life does a great job of random roommate placement for first-years.
College Freshman,5,"If it weren't for the aid I had received, I wouldn't have been able to afford Colby."
College Freshman,5,Our new president is a boss. He's one of the nicest and most sociable guys I've ever met and most everyone in Administration is super kind and helpful.
College Freshman,5,"Tons of spots all around campus. It's extremely convenient because most schools have to move their cars for snowstorms; however, security simply plows around the cars and is easy to move."
College Freshman,5,"People love to complain about the food but honestly it's great. Compared to other colleges, we have great quality meals. We have four potential places to go for a meal that all have their own unique style and ingredients, which makes for great variety."
College Freshman,5,"Campus housing obviously varies but in relation to other colleges it's great. Rooms are typically spacious and clean, and students keep them well-organized. Dorms are all relatively new and have all the essentials as well as nice, clean bathrooms."
College Senior,5,Teachers are amazing here.  They truly go above and beyond the call of duty.
College Senior,5,"The liberal arts programs are great.  The majors are a little light in req. classes, but it allows for students to explore and create their own majors."
College Senior,5,"Really chill admin. in terms of this stuff, but Security are a bunch of dicks.  They hire off-duty Waterville officers, who HATE Colby kids.  Leads to a lovely time."
College Junior,5,Colby is a very safe place.  Everyone has too much to lose to act out of line and everybody respects each other
College Freshman,5,"Really great! Professors are awesome, class selection isn't too stressful, and everybody is truly accommodating and friendly."
College Freshman,5,Getting into a major is easy and most faculty are very helpful
College Freshman,5,"Professors are wonderful!

Make sure when picking classes though you research them on RatemyProfessor.com"
College Freshman,5,Everything is laid out. There are different options and mixtures.
College Freshman,5,"It's Maine. Research where you are going to be living for the next four years of your life. I'm from a town in New York that is an hour from Canada, the winters in Maine are nothing compared to those however, there will be snow, there is ice and it will reach -12 degrees every once in a while. If you want sun and heat, don't go here."
College Freshman,5,"I work in the ITS department as a student worker. Technology-wise, you need it we have it."
College Freshman,5,"I personally could not be more satisfied. The people here are great, the academics are challenging, and I am lucky that I like the cold. I chose this school specifically because it was a small liberal arts college with a charming atmosphere, great academics, and it is absolutely worth my seven hour drive from home. "
College Freshman,5,"Guys and girls at Colby are awesome. This doesn't mean of course that 100% of the Colby population is going to greet everyone with enthusiastic open arms and what not, but overall, the atmosphere at Colby is incredibly comfortable. COOT (Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips) really gave people the opportunity to meet and create close friendships from day one of freshman year. The type of people you find at Colby are very diverse, yet they get together incredibly well. Some are more athletic, others more creative, musical. It is very easy to talk to someone to get to know them. I have heard of past diversity issues at Colby and people feeling excluded because of the party scene. As an international student who is latino, I have to say that I have found no problem in adapting to life at Colby. For those who do not like to party, they can easily choose the substance-free dorms to live in, which are always quiet and cozy. People at Colby do not peer pressure. You can very realistically go to a party and not drink without being judged. Another thing about the people at the college is that they are dynamic and interesting. Planning ski trips and other fun activities on and off campus is very easy because a large number of people want to take part. In general, people at Colby, in my opinion, are the best. "
Sophomore,4,Only took online classes because of COVID. They are were fine—as expected for the circumstances. Teachers and students did their best and we finished the semester.
Sophomore,4,Colby is a great school—isolated but they try really hard and everyone works together. Lot's of skiing and outdoor activities which is awesome! Teachers really care about you and your learning.
Sophomore,4,The online experience was very well organized and easy to manage. THe professors were extremely helpful and accomodating.
Sophomore,4,"All of my professors did a very good job transitioning to online learning and were very understanding of any technical mishaps I had. However, I feel like I learn much more when I am in a classroom setting than in an online setting."
Sophomore,4,"Overall I've had a very good experience at Colby. It took a little bit for me to find ""my people"", but I have found many great people here and many clubs to be a part of. One thing about Colby that is not so great is the housing. There are some really nice dorms, but there are also some that are notorious for not being that great. I have been lucky and gotten good housing for the most part, but there are not quite enough dorms for the number of students there are and many of my friends have been in forced triple rooms, or have otherwise been unhappy with their experience with the room draw."
Sophomore,4,It has been ok but not great. I just wish some of my teachers were more accessible and taught more instead of forcing us to teach ourselves.
Sophomore,4,"The professors care deeply about students' personal and academic well-being, and the CS department in particular is very friendly and welcoming to those new to programming."
Alum,4,"While the social scene is certainly different for everyone, as the classroom, my experience of the teaching at Colby was phenomenal. The creative writing and cinema studies departments and professors made my experience. Follow the teaching and syllabi that excite you, and you cannot help but be inspired.

Waterville is overlooked by many but is an amazing community worth getting to know, and the beauty of the surrounding area is unparalleled. The Colby Hume Center is a delight on warm fall days."
Freshman,4,I am a first year at Colby College and this school really suits me. All the students are very involved in clubs and it easy to be apart of them. I love that the majority of college students are Colby are outdoorsy. The dinning hall staff are very accomodating and kind. The head chef always says hi. All of my classes are relativley small which I love. All of my professors I have had refer to me by my first name inside and outside of class. The only downfall of Colby is that it is far away from home.
Sophomore,4,Colby provides students with rigorous academics but also a vibrant student life that makes the campus scene fun and engaging.
Alum,4,"When I reflect on my time at Colby, I am grateful for the small liberal arts experience; the feeling of community, small class sizes with professors who knew your name, and free printing. I am now pursuing post-graduate studies at a big University and the resources available to students, professor expertise, and quality of coursework is inferior to Colby in almost every way. Colby students are friendly, extremely intelligent, and well-rounded. Most of my friends volunteered, had an on-campus job or worked in a lab, and actively participated in campus clubs. The Colby bubble can become a little suffocating, as it is easy to not leave campus for weeks, but I am honestly sad I will never be in such a tight-knit community of similar-minded peers again. Colby is not perfect by all means, but it's a damn good school. If you choose to go to Colby, go in with an open mind, positive attitude, and readiness to introduce yourself to a million people."
Freshman,4,"Colby College has very strong academics and close ties between students and faculty. Good study abroad programs and funding. The biggest downside is the location, as Waterville has very little to offer in terms of life off campus and academic internships of job opportunities."
Freshman,4,"I am in love with the school. As a first year student I feel like the students, the staff, and everyone on the campus is just very nice and welcoming. They have so many great opportunities for every student, even freshman. I wouldn't think of a better school to go to."
Senior,4,I really enjoyed the social environment at Colby.  It is a small school so you can really build strong relationships with groups of friends and I truly found a family in the ultimate frisbee team.  With campus up on Mayflower hill you have privacy from the town which is very nice yet it is right next to town if you ever wanted to escape campus real easily.
Senior,4,Colby College has provided me with a lot of opportunities that I would not have been able to experience elsewhere. It has been an incredibly transformative experience for me from my experiences with professors to the tight knit community that so many people have worked to create.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is great. About 95% of the students live on campus. Dorms for the most part are really nice, clean and good to live in. Social atmosphere is definitely bigger in some dorms, but it varies from year to year depending usually on what teams live where. Although the senior apartments are always the hot spot on the weekends. Housing process could be a lot better, but it's not bad."
College Sophomore,4,"Student involvement in varsity athletics is huge, with about a third of the school involved in them. As a whole, the campus is pretty fit and active.Team performance varies by team, but winning programs here are on the rise. The plans for an entirely new athletic center have been confirmed, and it will be completed in the next few years. The baseball and softball fields were just redone, boasted turf fields and heated dugouts - the best baseball/softball facilities in the NESCAC. Fan support could be better, but overall it's pretty good. School spirit is definitely high."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is relatively safe. Campus security is often available to assist you if you call them. Additionally, personal belongings are often safe on campus and I've never heard about possessions being stole."
College Sophomore,4,"I've really enjoyed my experience on campus. My professors have been amazing. All of my classes are small and I love my class material, though the workload can become difficult during midterms. Overall, I'm glad I chose Colby."
College Junior,4,I live in chem free and I love it
College Sophomore,4,The substance free housing is excellent
College Sophomore,4,Colby is a very athletic campus
College Sophomore,4,I love challenging myself here.
College Junior,4,"Overall, I feel very safe on this campus. I sometimes feel that the campus is a bit dark at night and could use more lighting on Miller lawn! Theft is seldom a problem (but does exist) and most of my friends feel comfortable leaving their doors unlocked or computers in the library during meals. I mean, we leave our backpacks outside of dining halls and save our seats with our keys, wallets, and phones!"
College Junior,4,"Most of Colby's dorms are relatively small (no dorms have more than 4 floors and few have more than 150 residents). All the dorms are incredibly unique and it is baffling how diverse the quality of the different dorms is. Nicest dorm: AMS, worst dorm: Heights. The dorms are generally pretty clean with the exception of the weekends (barf and beer cans). Really though, the people you live with/near define your dorm experience."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus but I know that there is a lot of people on campus who don't.
College Freshman,4,"Teachers always have research projects open, as well as a great ability to help find jobs for students."
College Freshman,4,"As part of the Frisbee team, which is a club sport, I can agree that club sports get overwhelmed by Varsity sports. I expected that though."
College Freshman,4,"Colby is a great school, there's no way around that. Everyone here is really nice, and the teachers are great."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall I have grown a lot at Colby. The professors are caring and passionate about their subject. Housing is manageable for the most part. The clubs, while typical, are where you find those gems of people. My classes have been engaging, appropriately sized, and challenging without being too overwhelming."
College Sophomore,4,"It's great for the business (economics/financial) and government majors out there, but there are very few networking opportunities for the ""soft"" majors like anthropology or women's studies."
College Sophomore,4,"Colby was a wonderful choice for me. While it lacks in activism and current event programming, the school has incredible professors and a variety of interesting and relevant classes."
Recent Alumnus,4,President David Greene and Colby's administration are putting an emphasis on improving Colby's athletics.  In one year they have made very important steps in their first year.
College Sophomore,4,"My choice to attend Colby College has been awesome. The school has been everything I thought it would be. From an academic standpoint, I enjoy my classes and the professors are so helpful and looking to help the students succeed."
College Freshman,4,The ability to choose between three dining halls and The Spa allows for great variety of meals.
College Freshman,4,I can always find something that I want to eat.
College Freshman,4,"When I had roommate issues, the Campus Life office really helped me out! Moving in and out of dorms was a breeze for me!"
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot more options just in Waterville than there are in my hometown. I was able to try Thai food for the first time at Colby (Thai Bistro, and they deliver!), I got bubble tea at Selah Tea, and the other day I took one of my friends out to eat for her birthday. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and close proximity of restaurants, and I was able to get some really good discounts at a surprising number of places in Waterville for Date Week."
College Sophomore,4,"All dorms are co-ed and inter-grade. Many dorms are recently renovated or in the process of being renovated. There are many specialty options like Chem-Free, Quiet, Wellness Housing (generally for athletes- quiet on Friday nights), and Eco-Friendly. The worst dorms are Hillside and Heights, but even those aren't that bad. Freshman and sophomores generally live in doubles or triples. Juniors and Seniors tend to live in larger suites and the senior apartments."
College Sophomore,4,"Everything on campus feels very laid back. Academically, there are small classes so you get to know your professors pretty well. Strictness obviously depends on individual professors, but for the most part they are very understanding if you are up front with them about issues. Socially, strictness is also very laid back. The only times security really steps in are if people are publicly getting sick or serving as a hazard to themselves/others, or if someone in a dorm complains about noise."
College Sophomore,4,"I have never felt at all unsafe on campus. I can walk anywhere on campus at any hour by myself without feeling threatened (apart from being scared of the dark). People leave backpacks with laptops and valuables unattended outside dining halls or in the library and I have heard of very few incidents of theft. The only campus crime is stupid and petty. For example, many people think it's funny to break exit signs in dorms on the weekend."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had an internship yet, but I don't know of anyone who's had problems looking for them. Many of my friends have taken internships either in the summer or for the month of January during our JanPlan. Next summer, I plan to find an internship in Environmental Sustainability that will probably pay from $3000 to $5000 by networking with some of my friends who are upperclassmen."
College Senior,4,"If they don't have a major, their more than happy to help you make your own."
College Senior,4,"Lots of good looking girls, but a lot of them are not great people and tend to hangout with the underground frats."
College Junior,4,Campus security does a fair job.  People will recieve citations if they are obnoxiously drunk in front of security but nothing too major.  Most of the legal trouble students get in are from the local police departments that break up off campus parties
College Junior,4,Colby accomodates everyones financial needs.
College Junior,4,Academics are challenging and vary depeding upon your major.  Professors are usually on your side and want you to succeed and you will most likely get a grade parallel to the amount of work you put in.
College Junior,4,There are a wide variety of majors offered.  There could be a few more minors but the amount of majors reflects the size of the school.
College Junior,4,Colby has a very tight knit community.  You rarely see anyone who you havent met or seen before.  It is very cliquey so this could be a good thig or bad thing.  Most people like Colby.  It is challenging but everyone seems to be hard working and intelligent so if you want to surround yourself with smart successful people this is the place for you.
College Junior,4,"Overall, I really love Colby.  It's a really beautiful place with a lot of very passionate interesting students and staff."
College Junior,4,"I work in the Costume Shop for the Theater and Dance Department, it's a great place, but not a lot of hours to be had."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I am happy with Colby. I have learned a lot about myself and other people. The professors and classes are Colby's best aspect. 

Would I go to Colby again if I had the chance? Probably not. By learning more about myself, I discovered Colby is actually not really the school for me, but had I not gone to Colby, I may have never learned the things I did. So to sum up, I don't regret my decision. 

I also have a different experience than most students as I am from a different location than your standard Colby student, causing some stereotyping on me and feeling like I don't fit in. However, I am learning and am making the best of the situation."
College Freshman,4,"I think every students views their workload differently. Personally, it's easier than my high school. However, it is not too easy. I like it because I still have free time to participate in outside activities while still doing well in my classes! Some students complain about their workload though, and some majors are more demanding than others. It really depends on you personally and what you end up majoring in!"
College Freshman,4,"Professors are genuinely interested about their students and seem willing to bend over backwards for them. 

My program seems great so far!"
College Freshman,4,"Overall, dorms at Colby are pretty good! There are some bad ones, but most have their pros and cons"
College Freshman,4,"There are some really good restaurants in Waterville! Pad Thai is common with Colby students. If you want a nice (but expensive) dinner, go to 18 Below! Also Selah Tea and Holy Cannoli are delicious too!"
College Freshman,4,"There are plenty of computer labs and they have a variety of computers to choose from! Most students own a laptop as it is just convenient. However, I know a few individuals who do not and only use computer labs and are perfectly happy! Most students own Macs, but don't feel pressured to buy one if you'd prefer a PC. 

The tech support is okay. It's mostly run by students who don't know how to fix a number of problems, so that can be annoying at times."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of diversity on campus. Colby has a large international population, some seem to stick together but some branch out and are really awesome to meet. 

Colby is very liberal and being conservative might be tough as all of the speakers just seem to confirm, not challenge, the average Colby student's beliefs. However it's not too big of a deal, people seem to want to listen to different stuff and are accepting. 

There's a pretty big lack of diversity in terms of US origin."
College Freshman,4,The Colby Art Museum and the arboretum.
College Freshman,4,"Make sure you have a car with either FRONT WHEEL DRIVE or FOUR WHEEL DRIVE. GET SNOW TIRES. It isn't Boston. It's Maine. There is snow here. Realize that. You will get stuck and have a bad day if you do not have these options. Also buy a shovel and either salt or kitty litter. Keep them in your car. Start up your car when it's cold just for 10 minutes so your battery doesn't died. Keep your area clean. The plow does not help you get out, instead it will trap you into your spot."
Freshman,2,"Welcome to the land of the rich, white kids from Boston area private schools. If you don't fit in with that crowd, then you best look elsewhere."
College Senior,2,Admin. sucks.  Sports and Teachers are the school's only saving graces.
College Senior,2,The school has no connections.  Practically impossible to get a government internship.
College Junior,2,There are very little attractions in the Waterville area which is why everything for the most part stays on campus
College Junior,2,The Colby teams are currently sub-par.  They have been improving over the past few years but are still around or below a .500 win percentage.  Many athletes have problems with their athletic director as she seems not to care or show up to many of the games and this may reflect the lack of success of the teams.  People at Colby would definatley feel better about themselves if their teams won championships more frequently.  The Athletic center also could use a tune up
College Junior,2,A large amount of the population are white-upper class students from some of the top New England Prep Schools
College Junior,2,It's something that really is not advised.  It's hard to do things on campus because you need a car and it's impossible to go to an on-campus party.  It's generally not easy and most people don't do it.
College Freshman,2,"Many Colby students think Colby is very safe since we're up on a hill away from town. However, the campus is poorly lit, making it tough to walk back to your dorm when there's nothing but black ice. Also anybody can just walk on campus, so students should be more aware. 

Colby also does not follow the blue light policy correctly (supposed to see one in every direction). I have felt uncomfortable walking around certain parts of campus alone with the lack of these (especially by the gym).

Colby's security seems very nice and willing to help, but every time I have attempted to meet with somebody, they seem like they're never there and can be difficult to access

A lot of students leave laptops and cellphones around, but I have had things stolen out of my dorm room that is typically locked. So there are thieves on campus (as they are everywhere)"
College Freshman,2,"It could just be me, I'm used to cooking my own meals, knowing what I put in it and going grocery shopping. 

Also plates, cups and silverware are not always clean which just grosses me out."
College Freshman,2,Waterville isn't exactly a fabulous city and is not economically stable to offer good rates.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't worry much about the transportation because Waterville is so boring and the lack of off campus housing means you don't really have a reason to leave except to go to Wal-Mart.
College Freshman,2,"Let's face it, there is nothing around Waterville, or even in Augusta. It's just so much better to live on campus, near classes. Life at Colby is at Colby and not anywhere else."
College Freshman,2,It's a blizzard out here - a five-month long blizzard.
College Freshman,2,"The Jitney runs into town, but it is late more often then not."
College Freshman,2,The campus has an average drug and alcohol usage. It is not openly visible which students are or are not drinking or doing drugs and the campus security constantly walks around campus to make sure no one is breaking the law of underage drinking.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Colby is mostly white, upper middle class, straight, and democrat, and most of all - extroverted!  It is very unacceptable to fall into any minority, but especially to be someone who doesn't want to get involved with everything."
College Freshman,2,"Every Weekend Is the Same – If you love to get shwasty with several friends cramped in your dorm room every single weekend-Thursday, Friday, Saturday-then you will love the nightlife. Every weekend consists of pregaming in someone's dorm room and then walking around outside as everyone you know texts everyone they know trying to find the next party. Lame."
College Sophomore,2,"Waterville Is Very Average – There's a late-night pizza place (open til 2 a.m. and delivers!) and a slew of chain stores like Tim Hortons, Friendly's, Starbucks, etc. Nothing particularly stands out."
College Senior,2,"Gym Is Too Crowded – The gym is too crowded, and it is really small. There really should be a separate gym for athletes and non-athletes since the needs differ so much. It's also frustrating to be a female athlete lifting a lot of weights next to tiny girls who are exercising with two-pound weights or on ellipticals for two hours straight."
College Freshman,2,"Whitey Mcwhiterton – The class of 2014 is supposedly the most diverse ever, but Colby just attracts rich, white suburbanites. That's just how it is. There are exceptions, but it's still pretty extreme."
College Junior,1,"We don't have an official Greek life, which is wonderful. We do, however, have underground frats and sororities. Though they are talked about, they are not too relevant and seldom affect the social scene. Mostly, frat guys consist of rich white guys who want to say they're in a frat."
College Freshman,1,Colby got rid of greek life for a reason. It SUCKS.
College Senior,1,There is so very little to do in Waterville.  You have to drive 1-1.5 hours to find anything.
College Junior,1,Underground frat stars are full of themselves
College Freshman,1,Most everyone drinks. If you don't drink you are automatically written off.
College Freshman,1,"In real life if you are underage and drinking you get in trouble by law enforcement. If you break something, you get fined and arrested. If you're an ass you get punched. Colby doesn't teach you about real life. 

Also Hillside is riot-proof. There is a reason for that."
College Freshman,1,"Most buildings are getting renovated. Tour guides are instructed to only show the best dorms and buildings. So, while looking walking remember that. Frat Row dorms are the best and newly renovated. Height and Hillside are seen as the worst on campus. 

Dorm damage is high here because people break things while drunk so there is little value. Also, there is little strictness. We have CA's which are different from RA's. Community Advisers can not get you in trouble. They are there only to make you feel better and to promote safety and community. They are like a built in best friend. Literally, you can drink with them too. 


THE BEST PLACES ON COLBY COLLEGE'S CAMPUS ARE:

1) THE ART MUSEUM

2) COLBY'S ARBORETUM"
College Freshman,1,"On the weekends:

* The Jitney (student transportation) is behind schedule. 

* Parties happen (with tons of drinking)

* The school sponsored events are rarely attended. 

The options you have are 1) drink alcohol, 2) drink alcohol or 3) study in your room/try to sleep/watch netflix or movies."
College Freshman,1,"People go out only because the on campus nightlife is non existent, but don't expect much."
College Freshman,1,"Colby tries pretty hard in getting diversity on campus, it's not that you won't meet any diverse people, but there are some, especially in the Pugh Center which is the multicultural building here on campus. Colby also has a lot of international students who are pretty awesome to meet. There are a lot of other groups here on campus that represent diversity, but it can be a little hard to be accepted because of the majority of white students here. But that shouldn't scare students to come to our school."
College Sophomore,1,"If you're under 21, there are sweaty, gross, slimy parties with the underclassmen who really just want to hook up with as many people as possible. If that's your thing, cool. It's not mine."
College Senior,1,Social Scene – People like to go out but our college makes it so restrictive and taboo that if I knew the administration was so overly strict and unrealistic I would have gone to another NESCAC school in a heartbeat.
College Senior,1,It's Freezing – It's freezing and there is not enough sun.
Recent Alumnus,1,Absolutely Dreadful – The nearest airport is 1 1/2 hours away. The most convenient option is bringing your own car and calling a cab.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Secrets Frats and Sororites Do Exist! Since they are ""secret,"" they have no obligations to the community, but to throw parties and drink. Many of the administration belonged to them, before they were officially abolished in the '80s. They don't contribute to creating a cohesive, welcome campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Like any liberal arts colleges, Colby has a lot of upper-middle class, white, preppy students from schools most people could never dream of. Their very presence manifests a culture alienating to anyone not from this background. As friendly as they are, the ethnic, sexual, economic minorities will be the ""others"" of Colby College. We have a very friendly atmosphere. Everyone is very polite, but it's hard to get past that surface. If you belong to a sexual minority and you are outspoken about it, you will not feel welcome. Among students with political opinions, we are liberal. The entire campus is more apathetic than political though."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A Big Fat F – The town is very dead, and most of the places in Waterville are not within walking distances anyway. There are no other colleges nearby. The place where you will meet most Bowdoin or Bates students is the Portland airport, and the most frequent form of interaction with the people of Waterville is ordering pizza from Waterville House of Pizza. I have nothing against the residents of Waterville, but it is very difficult to meet them. The town-gown relation is not as strained as Colby students may think. Colby is a very affluent college in a poor town, but we do try to reach out to the town through programs like CCAK and other volunteering programs. I have not encountered any hostility from Waterville residents yet."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Compared to other colleges with similar academic reputation, Colby strongly lacks diversity partly because it is located in Maine, the whitest state in the country. Colby claims that 16 percent of the student body are international students, but this figure includes dual citizens and permanent residents. An average Colby student lives 20 minutes outside of Boston and went to a prep school. The wealth on this campus can be overwhelming at times. Colby aggressively recruits Posse scholars and UWC students, who are probably responsible for at least half of the non-white students on campus."

Freshman,5,"My overall experience here at Augsburg is so far amazing. I have made connections with people, build friendships, I have great professors, and most importantly, I'm doing great academically. Even though the pandemic has limited my college experience this school year, I'm still thriving. One thing I love about Augsburg University is the diversity . I see people of all backgrounds, shapes, colors and that makes me proud as I am a person of color. I've always wanted to go to a college that provided diversity and that's why Augsburg is the right fit for me."
Freshman,5,"Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the majority of my academic classes are virtual exceptions of my leadership course and General Chemistry lab. As much as it's hard to learn online, especially being a STEM major, Augsburg makes it easy and comfortable for us. Since Augsburg is a private college, there are only 20-30 students in each class, making it easier to connect with your professors. Also, all the professors have office hours to help students out with any problem they have about the lesson they taught or future exams that they are worried about. I was nervous to start my first year of college online. I thought that school would be impossible, and I would most likely fail, but I'm fortunate to have supporting friends, family, and teachers right beside at all times."
Freshman,5,I have only registered and been on campus a couple of times. Offices and departments do a wonderful job of explaining opportunities and experiences.
Sophomore,5,Something I like about Augsburg is how diversity it is. Something else’s I really liked about Augsburg is how it is in a city and everything is just right there for you which means you don’t have to do long distances when you need something l.
Sophomore,5,No I did not take online classes all my class are in class. I think online classes are so rotting you can also get it from anywhere else in the inter are and it can be wast of money so I just like being in class and learning because I do good at being in classes
Junior,5,Augsburg’s online experience which is about fostering other forms of essential academics into the student’s learning because the school sets a platform of diverse curriculum. I believe they build a a strong academic foundation in order to thrive and succeed in higher learning which is why this particular school is great for all students.
Freshman,5,I like Augsburg because everyone can be themselves there and they are also very open and caring if you are in need of help and support. They also have a very convinient campus located in Minneapolis close to everything. They got really good sports team and the over all school spirit is great. Professors are really good too and very caring. The classes are smaller so all your professors knows you by name which makes it way easier to have a conversation with them
Niche User,5,"What got me interested in the first place, was the feeling I got when I was on campus during my first visit. The environment was relaxing and I felt comfortable."
Freshman,5,Nice diverse school. Tuition could be to expensive. If you like a small school that isn’t to big. Augsburg is a perfect fit for you.
Freshman,5,The one thing i liked from Augsburg is that the student to professor ratio is really small which makes it easier to ask any questions you have to your instructor at anytime with out making a schedule or anything. I am currently satisfied with my school so i have nothing in my mind that i believe should be changed.
Freshman,5,"I honestly love the size of not only the campus, but then classrooms also. It is In fact a small school, but you get a really great education and experience. The diversity here at Augsburg has gotten much better. The Professors are very passionate about what they are teaching. I honestly believe Augsburg is one of the best universities in Minnesota."
Niche User,5,"When I went on a tour at Augsburg, I felt welcomed and that is what I look for in a college. I really like how diverse their students are and they include everyone. Overall, it was a great experience and the atmosphere was pretty awesome."
Niche User,5,"The thing I loved most about Augsburg university is its diversity. its rare to see such a great institution in the middle of the metropolitan city. An amazing campus, best professors, many different majors and minors to choose from, all of the helpful faculties, and whatnot. I don't think any other university in the city can rival with the quality of Augsburg University . Its simply the best."
Freshman,5,Im a music business/music performance major and I ADORE the entire department. They really care about the students and that we perfect our craft.
Freshman,5,"What I love about Augsburg University is how much the professors care for your well being. Every single professor have right now generally cares about how I'm doing and how my journey towards a four year degree is progressing. The diversity is amazing here. There are so many people of all different races, religions, cultures, sexual orientations, shapes, sizes, ect. Even though we are all different, every single one of us fits in and accepts each other for who we are. We don't judge based on appearance or identity, but rather your actions and who you are as a person. Augsburg feels like a second home to me. It's a place where I can finally say I fit in and belong. 
The education here is absolutely out of this world. I am challenged, but the professors make those challenges achievable and make me feel like I do almost anything as long as I put my mind to it."
Freshman,5,"Augsburg University has always been my first college choice out of high school. When I was in AVID, we toured Augsburg University and I fell in love with it. The atomosphere was amazing and i knew since then augsburg was the match."
Freshman,5,Augsburg is a school that is diverse in thought and in background. The faculty is amazing and very helpful and genuinely care about you and your future. The advisors here are amazing and exhaust every avenue to help you get what you want whether it be an internship or just a job in general. Augsburg is a school that is invested in their students.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus size, Its in a large city so its very close to a lot of things yet the size of the campus is medium with a typical class size around 30 this school is perfect for my needs of being able to connect with professors for questions and communicate easily on campus with everyone."
Graduate Student,5,Augsburg works hard and is committed to helping each and every one of their students. They enjoy hiring professors that will make a lifelong difference in their students' lives and future careers.
Junior,5,"I love it! I have really enjoyed my experience at Augsburg so far. The professors are amazing and you can tell they really care about their students. The professors I've had so far are so willing to work with me and give me advice, they really push you to be the best version of yourself."
Senior,5,"When I busted Augsburg University during a college visit the community was very connected, seemed like they were a big family. That is something that was unique compared to the other college I visited."
Freshman,5,"I love the community at Augsburg. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. I also love the professors I have and how I am able to personally connect with them rather than being in a room full of 100 students I don't even know the names of. Something I would like to change is the food and the required meal plan for individuals living on campus. The food is not very good and is very expensive. If I am living in a building that has a full kitchen I would enjoy making meals for myself that are enjoyable and healthy rather than paying $4,000 for food I wouldn't enjoy."
Alum,5,"As a mixed black woman coming from a suburban very white sheltered/close-minded city, arriving to Augsburg college was like a breath of fresh air. I loved how accepting and diverse was. I finally felt free to be myself and it felt great to be around more people who shared similar experiences as me. I was able to learn more about the LGBTQ+ community as well during my stay the school. I was involved in various student clubs at Augsburg as well as the University of Minnesota since the schools were so close by. Most of the teachers were accommodating and kind and were comfortable around POC students. I loved the location, too. One drawback is I didn't necessarily feel as pushed academically as I did in the rigorous high achieving school district I went to in middle and high school. Sometimes I felt teachers were too lenient."
Junior,5,"As a nontraditional student coming back after 10 years out of school, I love Augsburg. Great instructors, great small-school feel in the heart of downtown Minneapolis."

Junior,5,Augsburg is a very welcoming and diverse University. Students and faculty are friendly and helpful. Classes are challenging but not hard and Augsburg offers a large variety of ways for student involvement.
Senior,5,The professors and students in my majors. They're definitely the reason I've stayed with the school and my major for so long. The professors are all knowledgeable in their fields and really care for you. They are the school's most valuable asset. In my major there is a professor who is practically there all day helping students with any questions they have. I couldn't ask for better professors!
Freshman,5,Augsburg is a small school but makes up for it in how enjoyable its is to attend here everyone is nice and the professors are there to help you pass. Each class has 20-35 students so its easy to pay attention and ask questions in class. they have great facilities for sports and other recreational things they have a student lounge with comfortable chairs. the school is really diverse so what ever you are you probably not the only one in the class at all times.
Freshman,5,"i love augsburg, it has been a great experience and i find that the enviorment and culture is great. i love the experience and the food, and the people are just so nice because of minnesota nice. i cant wait for sophmore year at augsburg university."
Freshman,5,"Overall as a first year student I've enjoyed the classes, the diversity in this school is amazing, everyone is really kind, and the professors are great. The only thing that I would change about this university  would be to have bigger events. If you ever need help in your classes your professors are always available either through email or in person which is great!"
Senior,5,"campus is  very small and easy to navigate.  Professors actually care if you learn and pass the class, they arent just trying to get paid."
Sophomore,5,"I like the small class sizes and how professors are easy to talk with before or after. I like how the professors are genuinely interested in their students and want to see them succeed. I also like that they have a Disability Services because they provide myself, among other students, with software and services to assist with my academic experience. 

However, I do wish professors had multiple office hour sessions or were willing to meet outside of class. I wish the services, such as the writing or math lab, were open more frequently. Their hours typically conflict with my class schedule."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Augsburg. Their in the city, great food, and very nice professors. Augsburg is overall a great school and I'm happy that I go here."
Freshman,5,"Augsburg is very diverse university and the students, teachers  and staff are supportive and give their students and faculty  the quality education they need for their future career."
Freshman,5,"One thing I really love about Augsburg College, or now called Augsburg University, is that it is very opening to all people, regardless of one's background features. You can attend Augsburg University no matter who you are, whether your gender is different from others, your sexual orientation is not straight, and it is very diverse."
Sophomore,5,The moment I step on campus it feels like home.  The atmosphere held by the students and faculty is so welcoming that you truly feel like you can get to know anyone.  The one criticism I have is that the campus isn't large and can definitely be a hassle to park near campus.  I love Augsburg and feel like I have grown as person because of the people I have met and the experience's I have had.
Junior,5,"It's a great college in an urban setting in Minneapolis, MN. This college offers great programs for students and has created an atmosphere that is welcoming to everyone."
Niche User,5,I really like this college. It's really organized and formalized. I really like the way that they have a place for mailbox and letters and stuff for the students.
College Junior,5,Augsburg College is what I would tell a lot of people about the experience. Very fulfilling.
College Freshman,5,Campus is very safe. Maybe a few spots on the edge of campus are a little sketchy but overall the security with using DPS is very helpful and safe.
College Freshman,5,Getting to know your professors is easy. Small class sizes make it easier to make friends.
College Senior,5,"I've yet to really take a class where the professor ""taught us to the test"" or mostly stuck to the class' textbook. Most of the professors that I've taken classes from all supplement the textbook's chapters with their own lessons from their experiences in the field."
College Senior,5,The school's career center is great and often holds events to help students with their career planning or job searching no matter where they are on these paths. A particularly useful service that they offer is weekly drop-in resume reviews where students can drop into the center at any time during business hours to have a worker review their resume.
College Freshman,5,It;s the best ideas I love to support this community
College Freshman,5,It's the best working here thank you for having me
College Freshman,5,really like working encouraging this school
College Freshman,5,"everyone is so friendly, it really feels like a community"
College Sophomore,5,Augsburg is a great diverse college that offers one of the best music therapy programs in the nation.
College Junior,5,This is one of the best Religious schools in the USA
College Freshman,5,"There are countless options for off-campus dining. There are many places of different ethnic varieties and also many cafes. I love going out to eat because its close, cheap and delicious. A few of the places give student discounts but not all of them."
College Sophomore,5,I love the program that I am in. The Facilities are great. I get 1-on-1 time with my professors and with my faculty advisor.
College Sophomore,5,"It is very nice to be in  small classes we can really get a direct contact with the professor, and a better understanding of things if they become confusing. There is a lot of different courses to choose from. It's very wide. As an art major , i am just exploring from theater art, make up for the scene , to ceramics and graphic design and a lot more. I am very satisfied with all go the classes that i have taken so far. Other students from others majors seem fulfilled as well. We all feel very well challenged."
College Sophomore,5,"Augsburg has amazing student diversity, in every area from race, religion, sexual orientation, hobbies, habits, and economic status. The diversity found at Augsburg is by far my favorite thing about Augsburg, you can find just about every variation of people right on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Minneapolis is a constantly evolving area, Minneapolis has many attractions that are promoted throughout the college campus like an event at the Mall of America, and a great clinic (only a short light rail ride away), the Mill city Museum, and a ton of cultural and different lifestyle (that target different ethnic eaters, vegetarians, out of state and southern eaters, and just average every day foods) restaurants close to the campus."
College Freshman,5,Since we're only a quick walk to the light rail that takes you as far as the Target Center or the Mall of America the transportation that Augsburg is great. It' fairly easy to request a ride to and from the light rail. There's also the new light rail that will also be easy to access.
College Freshman,5,"I'm currently a biology major but I'm thinking of switching to either chemistry or physics. Either way I decide to go, I'll still be connected to the professors that I've had so far since the science community is so close. There's a whole program dedicated towards helping students with research and internships."
College Freshman,5,They afford alot of scholarship
College Freshman,5,Good I guess its a college campus
College Freshman,5,just got into it so cant really answer
College Junior,5,Minneapolis has an abundance of attractions and entertainment
Alum,4,"I graduated in 1977 and went on to graduate school, U of M and U of Florida.   It prepared me well.  Can't complain.  I do notice that the school has gone very liberal and I have grown conservative.  I do not donate much to it for that reason."
Sophomore,4,"I personally found it a little bit difficult going from a in-person class environment to an online environment. Being able to communicate this to your professors helps a lot, this allows the professor to understand what is happening and how to help in order to further improve your college education."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at Augsburg Univesity because the college is not that large of a University. This is helpful when it comes to communicating with your professor it allows the professor and student one-on-one time. I also enjoy how the professors are willing to assist the students.
Freshman,4,It’s very good college for those considering a small school. The professors will have more time to focus on you as a student and the betterment of your education. Some professors are very overwhelming but most of the faculty there are very helpful. The campus is in the middle of a big city so there are a lot of options to explore when there is downtime.
Freshman,4,"Essentially, I liked it because it’s very small (28-30 a class) and it provided me with a lot of financial aid. They are welcoming of diversity (most diverse in MN) and the campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,4,Augsburg is school that promotes inclusiveness and community building. Also teachers are very supportive and empathetic to each students unique circumstances. I am proud to say that I am an Auggie.
Sophomore,4,"Augsburg University provided the tools and support for us students to succeed during the trying time of COVID-19. Teachers were helpful and extremely supportive. While the work load was overwhelming at times, teachers were extremely understanding and sympathetic of students unique circumstances. Some draw backs to online learning however were that at time there were some technical issues that interferes with being able to contact teachers and also to catch up we were assigned a lot of work at once which was very overwhelming. But again teachers were supportive of this and always were there to help. Overall while the online learning experience was not ideal, Augsburg made me feel less stressed about school."
Freshman,4,I have not experienced any online learning through Augsburg. I have learned about different opportunities and policies put in place to make it a great experience.
Freshman,4,My time at Augsburg University has been the best school experience I have ever had.  The relationships that I have made with my professors and my peers have made all the difference for me.  Community and growth are the two words that come to mind when I think about Augsburg.
Senior,4,"Great Univsersity, love the amount of individual attention. The school could use more parking, and I wish it was in a better location."
Freshman,4,"good. Wish there was more diversity lol, but thats what we get for being a private college. The campus is good, glad its a small campus. The food in the commons (cafeteria) isnt the best but its alright."
Senior,4,There are a lot of student orgs to get involved and the professors are pretty great. There are many opportunities to find community. Augsburg is near both the blue and green lines and several buses run near by so transportation is very convenient. The student body is willing to advocate for themselves and one another. If you end up having trouble in any way there is likely someone on campus that can help you.
Freshman,4,"It feels like a home, and I like how it is a small environment but you still see people around. Overall it is a nice place, the buildings are nice but the dorms and food are terrible."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are amazing! The school is small compared to the university of Minnesota but if you're looking for a personal experience with professors then its the perfect place. So many amazing clubs, and many on campus jobs. If you live on campus is not all that great especially if you live in Urness Hall."
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity here at Augsburg! It has a friendly atmosphere and professors are very understanding and they want to help you as much as possible. Only thing I would change is parking. The campus is small so parking is very hard to find.
Freshman,4,"I'm currently a first year at Augsburg and haven't necessary explored every corner of the campus. I am aware of many of their positive opportunities which is something you can learn in a simple tour of the school. Its a really comfortable atmosphere. There's a large range of diversity so I doesn't feel like another year in your typical high school. The professors are really open-minded and flexible. The only reason I'm giving this university four stars is because I haven't had a first hand experience with their many opportunities and clubs however, I am proud to say that I'm an Agguie!"
Freshman,4,"Augsburg is a very diverse school in the center of Minneapolis. It's near downtown and easy to get to places since it's by the train station. It's a really good college. It's small and easy to get to classes. After getting shown around, it's a really nice community with a lot of welcoming smiles as well."
Sophomore,4,"Starting in the fall of 2019 I will be in my second year at Augsburg. Augsburg has a very small campus and certainly isn't known for there parties however it is a very close community with a lot to offer. It is well known for being an art school excelling in music and as I have come to find out they are very good for those looking into an education major. The staff their is mostly very friendly and work hard to give each student a fulfilling college experience no matter your economic status. Augsburg is not known for athletics and being a swimmer, it can be difficult since they don't have a pool. Even so there are a lot of different teams there and they will be glad to take on new members."
Freshman,4,"So far this experience as a first year has been very unique. Of course there were different obstacles that I needed to learn in order to find my way around campus for classes, clubs, and any other activity that is going around."
Junior,4,"I'm only going onto my third year at Augsburg but my experience so far has been good. If you are looking for small classroom sizes, easy connectivity with professors and students around you, it is a good option for those interested in these criteria's. Along with it being a private school, they offer a lot of scholarships for students of color and first-generation students. A bonus is that it is near downtown Minneapolis!"
Sophomore,4,It is a great school if you love small campuses. The number of students in your classroom is small which makes great personal connections.  I love it at Augsburg. Networking is easy to do there and people help you a long the way the whole time. I also play lacrosse there and the facility's and trainers are amazing! I have only lived in the freshmen dorms and they could have been better but cant complain to much it was a place to live.
Sophomore,4,I transfered to Augsburg in the spring at first I wasn't expecting anything great just the usual old core classes will not be beneficial to me. I learned very interesting things along the way professors there were great.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy going to Augsburg, I like the small class sizes, and the campus is all on one block so everything is very close. It's in the middle of the city which also really cool. Most professors here really know what they're talking about and are willing to help out when you don't understand something."
Freshman,4,I like the people at Augsburg.  Very diverse and well connected to Minneapolis. Great activities to do while you are on campus.
Junior,4,"The school is amazing and the classes are great. All of my professors have been available to answer any questions I have outside of class, which I found to be really helpful. The main thing that would make Augsburg better would be if the tuition cost were lower."
Freshman,4,"I choose Augsburg for their Step-Up program, a sober living community for students in recovery who are attending school."
Niche User,4,I like how diverse Augsburg University is. I also like the opportunities I would get here rather than attending a technical college.
Freshman,4,"Great college. Everyone is friendly, there are plenty of extracurriculars, and the teachers are generally supportive."
Niche User,4,"I really like Augsburg mostly because of the location and the academics. Minneapolis is a wonderful place full of diversity and new things to do. Along with this, Augsburg is a great school."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this college is amazing when it comes to academic advising. You are always arms away from getting the right kind of guidance whether that is towards internships, degree progression, or even towards your major! I give it four stars because the tuition is still a little too high and loans aren’t exactly something I would like to pay off in thirty years. I love the diversity on the campus because they welcome everyone with kindness and equality."
Graduate Student,4,Augsburg College is very accommodating to students who have various disabilities. Specialists work hard to ensure student success despite their difficulties.
Freshman,4,"It’s down in the city, so there is always something to do. They are modernizing everything there so it is very nice."
Freshman,4,"The campus location is in a perfect location of Minneapolis, since it is very close to the light rail, and many other forms of transportation. The professors care about you as an individual, since class sizes are very small,  and they care about their work. The students are very friendly and there are many opportunities to get involved in the school."
Niche User,4,I like Augsburg because it's a four year university that is medium sized. It provides majors in Social Work and Psychology which I am interested into. It's location is good because it's far away from home but not too far away. Augsburg is very diverse and I feel that I will really like Augsburg!
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled here, and it is a great experience. I appreciate the diversity of the student body and the various involvement opportunities around campus. The recently constructed building is beautiful. I am somewhat disappointed in the food service of the college."
Sophomore,4,"Very friendly school. Right in downtown Minneapolis, 15 minutes away from St. Paul. Recently became a Univerity. The school is very expensive but will help you get scholarships to help py."
Freshman,4,"Augsburg University (formally known as Augsburg College as of 2017) is a wonderful school. I couldn't have asked to attend a better school. The professors that I've had so far and the friends that I've made are truly amazing people. Both students and professors are dedicated to seeing you succeed. I've made connections with some of the professors I've had and I still come to them for help or advice within my major. The campus is a bit on the small side compared to other schools like the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, but that is just fine with me. Being in a smaller school helps one connect with the people in their environment better. The campus is like a melting pot of different cultures and it really celebrates the individuality of each student. Augsburg is the type of school that strives to include everyone, and that's a lesson I learned within the first few weeks of my Freshman year. The people are so nice and welcoming. Augsburg feels like my home away from home."
Sophomore,4,"A great welcoming college. There's lots of diversity and everyone looks out for each other. Security is right nearby you if you need them making it a safe environment. It's a small college, but has large diversity."
Senior,4,"Augsburg has the best professors who are engaging with their subjects and seem to really care about their students. 

The on-campus activity scene seems to be lacking, though."
Sophomore,4,"Augsburg college was my first choice of college. The benefit of the college was that it was near my house and was also situated in Minneapolis and a stone throw from Saint Paul. There is no lack of activities and food to find around the campus, as well as being next to the U of M campus. One thing I was looking for in college was small classes. My largest class was of about 35, my smallest being about 13, which allowed you to get closer to the adjuncts and the professors. The professors really care about you and want to see you succeed, many having dependable office hours so you can have a chance to get help if you need it or even just needing someone to talk to."
Freshman,4,"The community is really close, the are open to a diverse student population. The teachers are very helpful and have many office hours or offer other options for extra help with the class."
Freshman,4,"I have completed a semester at Augsburg College. The students are very friendly and  easy to talk to. The professors are always ready to answer questions and help students  during their office hours. There are tutors and SI sessions available to students who need help in their studies. Augsburg has also variety of non academic activities like, athletics and clubs. I am looking forward to my remaining time in Augsburg College."
College Sophomore,4,"Augsburg College is probably one of the most diverse institutions I will ever attend in my life. I learned so much about the culture of my friends and the culture of Minneapolis itself. At Augsburg, there is a good concentration of both white Minnesotans/Wisconsinites and Somalian Americans. It was interesting to see the dynamic between these different groups (being an outsider of sorts). I learned a lot about Islam and Somali culture–it was an experience I did not take for granted. Augsburg is also very LGBTQIA+ friendly and expressed support for their Black students in a time of racial tension and police brutality. Even though Augsburg wasn't the choice for me in all other respects, this was one huge plus."
College Freshman,4,"No drugs, alcohol is pretty normal as it is at all schools."
College Freshman,4,I loved living on campus. flex points are the best perks and sky ways are great as well.
College Junior,4,Small school environment gives you a feeling of satisfaction and the facilities are small but quite effective.
College Freshman,4,Advisors definitely help support you in the career field you wanna go into. They help you find a lot of jobs for after graduation.
College Freshman,4,Great place to live other than DPS being strict and residence life holds back opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"It's a great school with a great facility, a little bit of lack of cleanliness."
College Freshman,4,It's a great experience to get to know the professors one on one and the student body is great!
College Sophomore,4,Athletes support each other a lot.
College Junior,4,"Augsurg college is one of the most diverse private institutions in the US which I love. There's a lot of financial help when it comes to people of color. The school is advocate for LGBTQIA rights. The school overall is politically aware and willing to change for the better. I feel like my voice is heard at this school even being a person of color. Sure, there could be a more diverse faculty, but we are slowly in the process of having our voices heard on the matter. The living conditions aren't the best and there's a need for renovations. It's not fair to be paying so much money for such adequate conditions.  Heaters break, mattresses are uncomfortable. The dorms are very old school. Overall, the education at Augsburg is great, but there are some things that need to change that I know will make it better."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy both varsity and intramural athletics.
College Senior,4,"What I really love about my school is its small size. Classes are small enough, ranging anywhere to five in a few of my advanced French classes to 25 in the pre-requiste classes, that you really to get the know the people in your classes as well as the professor as cliche as that sounds."
College Freshman,4,I love being this Wonderful community
College Junior,4,"I love the community at Augsburg. The diversity both racially and culturally have been a welcomed change. I was not sure I wanted to be at a smaller school, but found that it is a great fit for me. My school is unique in the fact that it is right in the heart of Minneapolis, and I am steps, or rides away from wherever I need to be. If I had to go through the college process again, I wouldn't change a thing. I have made amazing friends that will be apart of my life forever and have been able to still watch my younger brother grow up as he is 6 years younger than I am. I didn't want to be in another state and miss going to some of his sporting events, or only get home a couple times a year. Overall, my time has gone by quickly as I am about to finish the first semester of my Junior year :)"
College Freshman,4,"I attend Augsburg College and after coming from a high school that felt like a large family, I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of what the atmosphere on campus would be like. Well I can safely say that this place has a real sense of community since it's such a small school and I like that very much. The only thing that could be better would be the dorms that the freshmen are stuck in. With no AC or any kind of kitchen, at times it feels that I would be more comfortable sleeping outside."
College Sophomore,4,Class schedules are easy to work out and admissions staff have been helpful
College Senior,4,"Great diversity of people, not of opinion/thoughts"
Recent Alumnus,4,I really like the small town feel the school has right in the middle of a big city. It also offers small class sizes which is amazing!
Freshman,2,"I chose to attend Augsburg because I felt it was a great school that cared about its students. I also chose Augsburg because it is a diverse school. My biggest issue with Augsburg is the cost. Since the cost is too much to bare, I couldn't live in the dorms. I currently commute from an area 30 minutes away but is longer with traffic. I wish there were scholarships available for housing."
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no air conditional in Mortenson or Urness.
College Freshman,2,I don't go to party's here.
College Freshman,2,"Since other schools are close by, I tend to go there."
College Freshman,2,"I know it's harsh to stereotype, but the neighborhood surrounding Augsburg is not considered the safest. It is best for people, especially female-identified individuals, to stay in groups when going off campus, especially over the bridge to the University of Minnesota."
College Sophomore,2,"I will preface this by saying that after living on campus for two years, I've had roommates that were kind of not the best people, and that made my living experience kind of not the best. The freshmen dorm, Urness Hall, is fairly cramped and spartan, with minimally furnished communal bathrooms and lounge areas. Mortensen, the tallest building on the Augsburg campus (it's the one with the Augsburg College sign on it) is barely any better. I don't think either building has had any major updates or renovations since at least the late 80s. Mortensen in particular has bad lighting. Also, the elevators in both buildings seem to break fairly frequently, and it can take the repairmen up to a week to fix the things. I can recall at least once when both elevators in Urness broke for over a week during my freshmen year. Incredibly annoying. I lived in Luther Hall over the summer, and that is definitely a bid more upscale and aesthetically pleasing than either Mort or Urness. While I haven't actually lived in Anderson Hall, I do know a number of people who currently reside there and I am in the building making fairly frequent visits. That is a nice space for communal living if you want to live with a number of people in a townhouse or floor house. Again, somewhat overpriced. Finally, there is Oren Gateway Center, or OGC. OGC is the most recent housing complex and it typically houses students in the STEPup program, people that are recovering from addictions. OGC is the most expensive housing option, but I have heard that it's a very nice place to live. It is totally substance free, and it is designed like many high priced apartments are."
College Sophomore,2,THERE IS NO GREEK LIFE AT AUGSBURG. HOW CAN I ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST HERE??????
College Sophomore,2,The meals in the caf are sickening most of the time. Smells putrid as well. They occasionally have decent food. Plus the fact that it's about $20+ per meal is insane. That is way too much for a meal plan that not many people want. I also think that students should get refunded for the meals they didn't use!
College Senior,2,I actually find this school to be kind of racist to my kind because of some of the past/recent experiences i had to go through.
College Senior,2,I barely got any money Fafsa wise since i've been here
College Senior,2,"Besides nabo, the cafeteria is by far horrible"
College Freshman,2,"The freshman dorms are all dry, meaning anyone caught with alcohol gets fined."
College Freshman,2,"It is very difficult to get financial aid as a white, middle class, male."
College Freshman,2,"The food at the cafeteria is pretty bad. They drench everything in oil, and it all is very unhealthy."
College Freshman,2,"It took a few attempts to get the applications right because of my divorced parents. It was very confusing and the people were not very helpful. They made it seem super simple but we didn't understand. Also they told me how much money I would get and qualify for, and I did not get what they said."
College Freshman,2,"One of the only options we have for off-campus living that is a good distance from campus is in a bad area. There is quite a bit of crime in that area, I know because we get crime alerts sent to our emails. It seems to be pretty available and it has a pool, but it is almost more expensive than it would be to live on campus. Also, this year they had a cockroach infestation in the building. I have many friends that live there that tell me about all the roaches in the cupboards and couches etc. The parking lot is very tiny, it fits maybe 8-10 cars. The school doesn't offer any help for finding housing off-campus, it is all up to us to figure out."
College Sophomore,2,I am still trying to find about $4000 to cover the rest for this semester. I was able to get 2 scholarships and a grant that I have never gotten before. That was pretty awesome.
College Junior,2,Many students think drinking is the only way to hang out with other students. It is especially bad when it comes to athletes. Some of them don't even follow the 48 hour rule before a game.
College Junior,2,"There is so much campus crime, I never want to leave my room when it is dark out. Even if I am still in the dorms building. There has been too much crime for me to feel safe. During my freshman year, I would receive an email about campus security thefts and alerts... I ended up getting an email every other week on just how there was a theft in the music building with an apple computer being stolen. In between the repetitive thefts, there were people held at gunpoint in the park right outside my dorm building late at night."
College Freshman,2,During school hours it's obviously bad. We have a small campus so it's hard to fit all faculty and student cars on campus. When most faculty and commuting students go home though it's pretty available.
College Senior,2,Very few parking spaces for both on campus and off campus.
College Freshman,2,"I dont eat in the dining hall, theres only two resturants on campus "
College Freshman,2,you have to keep checking in or theyll forget about you or they might not start because they think that you didnt send something in but u did and they just didnt check
College Senior,2,A good variety and a lot of people participate in them.
College Senior,2,The school is nice but I transferred from a nicer school so I have a biased opinion on how it could be.
College Senior,2,"The campus safety guys are really great, it's just that the overall neighborhood is not safe if you're alone or at night. A lot of crime happens in this area, but that's to be expected so close to downtown in a large city."
College Senior,2,"The security guys are very helpful when you're out at night and need a ride somewhere, and were very nice when helping me after my bike was stolen."
College Senior,2,People look like every other 20-something around the cities.
College Freshman,2,"I love being a music therapy major. However, it requires a lot of effort, time, energy, etc. It is one of the heavy majors offered, greater even than pre-med. So it is a lot of work. The job opportunities are becoming more and more popular, and my professor has said that the internship opportunities are usually easy for students to receive."
College Freshman,2,"It does an ""ok"" job of spreading the ""wealth"""
College Junior,2,"Right next door there is Jimmy Johns, Bruegger Bagels, and Starbucks - the only choices within a quick walking distance.  Inside the school they already have a bagel shop and a small café type but the hours and selections are not all that."
College Freshman,2,You don't get caught for anything unless you're stupid and are clearly under the influence. Safety can be annoying but usually if you don't cause trouble they won't bother you.
College Freshman,2,The food is not bad at first. But after a while you get tired of eating the same food day to day.
College Sophomore,2,Its cold in the winters and gets very hot during the summer.
College Sophomore,2,"Augsburg is fairly liberal. I know someone who did a works study for the department of public safety and got caught at a party, drinking under age. He received a fair amount of discipline, but still kept his work study and has even found a better job within the school."
College Junior,2,I have no income and I still couldn't get financial aid with my 3.8 undergrad GPA. Nice graduate program but the college is located in a bad neighborhood. Already had my bike stolen.
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs and Alcohol Are Fairly Common – Usage of drugs and alcohol is fairly common, however peer pressure is not. The students that use drugs and alcohol mostly had experience with them before coming to college. Drug policy is well enforced, and few students manage to use drugs and alcohol without being caught at least once."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Great – Overall, scholarshiops are hard to come by at Augsburg. The college doesn't inform many students of scholarships available unless you the idea onto them. Getting specifics is even tougher, they'd rather direct to a not very helpful blog link on their page then show themselves."
College Senior,2,"ACTC Bus to and from Other Schools – This is the only provided campus transportation. It allows students to travel to other schools in the metro area. Few students use this bus, except those who take classes at other schools. Every student receives a charge for this bus every year. One year I saw the bus hit a parked car and drive off."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Augsburg does not offer off-campus housing for its' students. However, there is a lot of cheap off-campus housing available to students if they only look for it."
Junior,1,"I feel that Augsburg as a college institution is engaged in student’s learning in order to foster a strong academic foundation. As a school, I believe it lacks acceptance from students with learning obstacles who do not get the opportunity of higher learning. The staff faculty lack acceptance of students with disabilities because of the students academic background. Yet they said we are diverse and acceptable of all students."
College Sophomore,1,"There are maybe a handful of parties hosted by the athletic teams once in a while, with designated ""party houses"" (aka, essentially shacks that try to hold hundreds of people at once). It was always hot and cramped inside these parties, with drunk people shouting and falling everywhere. Not a fun scene for an introvert, and even boring for an extrovert because you can't talk over the loud music and other noise. I never really liked them."
College Freshman,1,"I wish we had Greek life, the school is just too small."
College Sophomore,1,Pfft hahah party? At Augsburg? That's a joke right? When there are parties here they are boring and not and my fun for people looking for an actual good time.
College Senior,1,"If you are a graduate student, don't even think you're getting a scholarship even if you are broke. Loans loans loans."
College Freshman,1,there is no greek life
College Senior,1,"It's Minnesota, so there really isn't that nice of weather."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is hectic. Parking fills up quickly even if you have a campus permit. Even if you are a resident, the parking lots are quite small and inconvenient where walking is quite a ways out. This makes the permit price less worth it because it does not gaurantee a spot."
College Junior,1,WEC student activities are horrible; WEC senate is disorganized and does not do a good job making decisions or promoting the program.  There are very few things that students do consistently besides class.
College Junior,1,"If you commute, unless you get to campus by 7am you can forget about finding a spot for commuting students to park."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is my only complaint about Augsburg. Finding a place to park for commuters is a nightmare. The only designated spots are scattered around campus streets. There are only a few small lots nested within the campus that hold about 50 cars or so at most. The one big lot is at the back end of the campus.
College Freshman,1,"It is highly recommended that one does not use a car on campus, as one does not require it. The college is very connected and the area is easy to explore on foot or by bus. Permit costs are expensive and limited; parking spaces are hard to find...it is much more convenient if one does not drive at all."
College Junior,1,"Although Public Safety tries to be around, I have still gotten my bicycle stolen while it was locked on campus. There are frequent emails sent out regarding vehicle theft and rape. Very bad neighborhood for an otherwise flawless college."
College Junior,1,Very scary neighborhood with rampant crime and several hobos that reside too close to campus.
College Junior,1,"Very few options around campus, except one Jimmy Johns."
College Senior,1,"There are several computer labs about campus. However, not enough for the demand. The internet is typically slow and the printers always seem to be broken. It's very frustrating trying to use the computers on campus. It is nice that the school provides unlimited paper access throughout the year. I would suggest new printers, especially color printers. Access to working color printers would really help students excel in the arts."
College Freshman,1,"Drinking and Smoking – Personally, for myself, I see a large amount of students drinking and a fair amount of students smoking weed.  Since we are a city school both alcohol and marijuana are easily available and it isn't uncommon to know someone you participates in either activity."
College Sophomore,1,"Cannot Adapt – Sometimes seen in bad light. Unfair, strict and rude."
College Junior,1,"Bad Food Bad Prices – Extremely expensive food and not very satisfactory, not alot of options for point use."
College Junior,1,Hallways Can Use Some Rugs – its been raining these past severals day. In many of classes I hear my classmates talking about how embarassed they were when they got in the building and slipped there. Not only were they physically hurt but aside from that they felt they've lost their dignity

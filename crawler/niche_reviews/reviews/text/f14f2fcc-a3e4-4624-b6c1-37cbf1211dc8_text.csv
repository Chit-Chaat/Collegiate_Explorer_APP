Graduate Student,5,"So far all of my professors have been wonderful, great attention to detail and they are always willing to help and walk you through the process"
Niche User,5,When I did a shadow day at Notre Dame of Maryland University I loved how the classes were organized and learn all about the campus. This made me apply to this college and now I am joining Notre Dame as a freshman in Fall 2020.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the small campus,it makes me feel safe and at home. They are very welcoming and help transition you into being in college. I would like to see the food changed."
Freshman,5,This university is my new home and starting point towards a life of continuous success and new beginnings. From the day I stepped foot on campus I felt welcomed and loved by the staff and students whom have become more of a family than everyday peers. I really appreciate everyone here and the resources provided to better help me obtain my education while staying in touch with who I am and balancing self education with self care.
Freshman,5,This will my first semester attending. I have tour the campus. I have everything to meet my needs in place. The admissions department were great in getting me enroll. I received scholarship to continue my education. I’m so proud and honor to attend this school.
Sophomore,5,I loved my experience at Notre Dame. Everyone is friendly and the professors care and want you to pass
Freshman,5,"My Overall review of the campus at Notre Dame of Maryland University ,Is an excellent fit for students all over the world that is looking for something diverse.It is a private,Catholic University located in Baltimore Maryland .The Admissions is fairly competitive. It is also an all girls school that has recently somewhat allowed boys on the campus . The school is a great opportunity too become the best scholar their is also show off your athletic skills . The staff is absolutely incredible they are very generous , kind hearted  and always greeting you with a smile ."
Sophomore,5,"Notre Dame is Maryland is the most diverse institution, with such amazing opportunities to offer. To be a Notre Dame woman is a woman with gratitude, hard working, and kindness in her heart. The school instills sisterhood in everyone. However, some things I would like to change is opening more opportunities up to the Pre-med majors, it seems to be that nursing and pharmacy are the two dominated majors."
Sophomore,5,"I have only been to this college for one year after transferring from another 4 year university, and I absolutely love it. Even when I was doing my original college search, and NDMU came up, I could not help but continuously look at the schools website. I fell in love with it before I even applied. The professors here are trained to teach classes as large as 25 students, and even classes as small as 3 students. The academic curriculums are rigorous, however all professors here will go out of their way to help you succeed throughout your 4 years here. All are ensured by both students and faculty are welcomed; our motto is ""You Belong Here!"" To those looking to apply to any colleges this year, or even transferring, apply here. Take it from a transfer student who hailed all the way from Connecticut. You will not be sorry that you applied"
Junior,5,I love NDM! transferring was the best decision ever. I love how staff helps you all the time and they make sure students understand everything in class. I like that the class is small and in this way professors can help better.
Freshman,5,"When I first visited the school I fell in love with it, I knew that if I went to school  I would be able to succeed in my academics. There are so many activities that can be done on and off campus. On top of that Baltimore is right down the street with so many opputrintes. It's a great school I think for people that are introverts like me since it's small but it stands out in its own way. I have decided to accept in attending to the college as a freshman in the fall of 2018 of all the other colleges that I applied because the school represents who I am of all the times I've visited I have connected. Notre Dame of Maryland University will always be a second home to me."
Alum,5,It was a great experience to get an education with other women. The culture is strong and it makes me proud to be a Notre Dame woman.  They offer a wide variety of majors but have an extraordinary nursing and science department. All the staff are friendly and want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,I liked the diversity.  I liked my experience on campus because all the students and faculty were amazing. I love the fact that the women are so unique in their own way. I would like to see the change in the party scene.
Alum,5,My experience at Notre Dame of MD University was extremely positive. The professors truly want to see you succeed so they are very helpful and patient. The campus is beautiful! The people are very friendly. The cost is about the average mark for an excellent college education. Its easy to find with directions. I received my BSN through this school and it was the best decision I ever made!
Senior,5,"I am a student in the CAUS (College of Undergraduate Adult Studies). I am an Elementary Education major, who has had nothing but positive experiences with my professors. The classes are so knowledgeable and understandable. I will graduate from this university with the knowledge I need to become a great educator."
College Freshman,5,My professors are very helpful and my classes are at a reasonable size to focus more.
College Freshman,5,It is very easy to get a job on campus due to its limited population.
College Freshman,5,Best sports teams I had ever seen.
College Freshman,5,I love this college because the staff are terrific. Also everyone is very helpful and understanding.
College Sophomore,5,"Alumni network = active and strong

Internship/ job prospects = likely after college

Employers recruiting on campus = high quality

Career Center = phenomenal"
College Junior,5,"If you get hungry late at night, there are plenty of places that will deliver to the dorms."
College Junior,5,I love the campus ensured safety on campus. It makes me feel safe and secured.
College Junior,5,The financial advisors make sure that you get as much money as possible to stay and continue to get your education. They are very helpful and the make the process very easy.
College Sophomore,5,"It's Baltimore, what else can I say? There are so many options for fun and activities in any direction.  Orioles baseball, Ravens football, the Towson mall-Baltimore has it all."
College Sophomore,5,"Applying was super easy, and when I decided to try and apply for the nursing program, they gave me a road map listing out what I still was missing and how to go about filling in those gaps.  NDM makes it super easy to map out your college career once you have declared your major."
College Sophomore,5,"While I have not really looked into Greek life at NDM, I did hear a lot about it during my orientation weekend.  Most of the sororities on campus are devoted to academics and community service.  I really changed my perception on Greek life.  For those who haven't been around it before, all you tend to think of is parties and mischevous behavior, however the ones at NDM seem amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"The university itself has been around for quite sometime, so some areas can still seem quite ""dated,"" so to speak.  The university is however updating and enhancing the facilities on campus.  When I had visited they had recently finished renovating the gymnasium, as well as updating the science labs.  Some classrooms I visited still had the ""old school"" feel to them, however I feel like it added serious character to the university.  I was very impressed overall with everything."
College Junior,5,The professors are the best part of the whole school.
College Junior,5,Baltimore is the best city to live in on the planet!
College Junior,5,"There is anything you could ever want, all very close to campus."
College Junior,5,Notre Dame set me up to work in a middle school in Harford County and I absolutely loved it!!
College Junior,5,I wouldn't take back a second of the time I spent in the Math program and the Education program.
College Junior,5,Collegetown shuttle is SO EASY to use.
College Junior,5,"Our campus is so diverse, everyone is accepted."
College Freshman,5,lots of things and places to go
College Freshman,5,There is an Honors Code that all students must abide by. There is an honor board that all students must report to in the case of a violation of university rules. I think this is a great idea.
College Junior,5,"The IT department is great.  They responding quickly to virus and spam attacks.  They immediately send notifications to faculty, staff and students when there are IT system threats."
College Sophomore,5,I would definitely do it all again! I have aspirations of being a international lawyer and this program is definitely helping me achieve that.
College Sophomore,5,I love my major! The teachers have a great span of knowledge and have no problem with giving advice to students.
College Sophomore,5,Notre Dame provides sound connections for students who are going to the political science field. There are many companies that are willing to discuss opportunities with students concerning internships.
College Sophomore,5,"With the International Students Program, I would say that the levels of diversity are very great. Everyone is accepted and treated equally."
College Sophomore,5,The security is amazing! There was once an attack on campus and security immediately placed the whole campus on alert and measures were taken to ensure our safety.
College Sophomore,5,There is a whole bunch of campus strictness! There is never anything that is going wrong on campus. Security has everything being watched and protected. If something ever does go wrong they are on top of things 24/7
College Junior,5,There is plenty of diversity on this campus! I would say at least 45% of the students are women of color.
College Freshman,5,The drugs and Alcohol on this is not notice at all so im not sure if anyone do drugs or alcohol.
College Junior,5,"There are plenty of places to eat around campus.  Off York Rd there is Wendy's, McDonald's, Chipotle, Subway, Panda Express, Chick-fil-a, Five Guys, Towson Diner (open 24 hrs), etc.  Near Towson there is the Mall Food Court as well as the Cheesecake Factory, Friday's, etc.  Down the street from campus on Cold Spring there is Miss Shirley's, Subway, Sghetti Eddie's, etc.  Near Hopkins there is the awesome Paper Moon Diner which stays open very late.  Near the Inner Harbor there is the Rusty Scupper, Hard Rock Cafe, Dick's Last Resort, etc.  Right off the Inner Harbor there is Little Italy with Amicci's, Sabatino's, Vacarro's, etc.  Not too far off there is RA Sushi and plenty of other restaurants like Nacho Mama's in Canton.
Food costs vary from cheap (Wendy's/McDonald's) to a little pricey (Cheesecake Factory/Rusty Scupper).  
RA Sushi offers Happy Hour with plenty of half-priced options."
College Junior,5,Enrolled in a cohot. Everything from the first encounter to registration has been very easy. The process is facilitated by knowledgable staff from the university. Smaller classes are a plus.
College Junior,5,Have Not Been Exposed to Anyone Interested in Drugs – It does not seem that drugs are being used by students at Notre Dame.  There are a fair amount of smokers on campus but most of the social scene seems to resolve around drinking.
College Sophomore,5,"A Whole New World – Stepping onto Notre Dame's campus, you are immediately greeted with many different various ethnic groups and religions. This is surprising for most, because its an all girl's catholic school in the middle of Baltimore, MD. There are many types of students at our school and each is embraced and made to feel as if they belong. This is one of the things I appreciate about Notre Dame."
College Freshman,5,"Best Professors Ever – It doesn't matter which department you will be working with, you will have wonderful professors. I don't think we have a single dud on campus. We have an especially wonderful philosophy department. The professors are available and immensely supportive. The classes tend to be very small, almost always less than twenty people. It is fantastic. Registration is relatively simple and so far I haven't had any problems with getting the classes I need. The work is always challenging, but also manageable."
College Freshman,5,"Education Major – At Notre Dame, we are known for having an amazing Education program.  Sure, I have only been here for almost an entire year, but I can already see how amazing my education will be.  I can volunteer at the on-campus school/day-care and get out into the classroom.  My professor are extremely helpful and have so much knowledge to share with each student.  Since the classes are small, you are able to ask those questions that you might think are silly but you need to know.  My professors are preparing me well along with the required classes I have to take.  I know when I go out into the working world I will be well prepared to teach in any classroom."
College Student,5,My experience with the financial aid process was long and drawn out but was the farthest thing from being stressful. My admissions counslor stayed on top of all the deadlines I had to meet and if she had anything such as scholarships she wanted to proivide for me. Private school give you the most money for going to their institution but reguardless I would recommend to apply to every scholarship you can!
College Student,5,Convenience at Notre Dame – Notre Dame is pretty much close to anything! About 5 mins from my house where I know I can eat at various fast food spots but if you wanna be more classy there are restaurants no more than 10 minutes away from the campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,Didn't really think about drugs or alcohol on campus. There was no visibility at all.
College Sophomore,5,"The library is very accommodating. It has three floors with lots of private study rooms for bigger and smaller groups as people, as well as tons of computers. It also has individual desks for students study at and provides plugs to hook up a computer to. My favorite part of the library are the very comfortable chairs that are placed in front a beautiful view outside. I study here a lot because I find it to be very peaceful and relaxing. This is just some of the great uses the library has to offer!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"At CND one is allowed to embrace all the are and all they want to be. Whatever you can dream of there is somebody there to encourage you and guide you. Be pro-yourself, and everyone around you will want to help you too. Class sizes are ultra small so the professors have time to answer your specific question."
College Junior,5,"Athletic Training Room – The training room on campus is very well kept, clean, and accessible. Every time I go in to see the trainer, she is ready to help and always has the things I need to help me in practice or an upcoming game."
College Junior,5,"Love It! School is awesome... a lot of dedicated, like minded individuals, and an amazing staff!  Everyone is friendly and welcoming and accepting."
College Freshman,5,"Check Out the Corner Carryout – Located about 10 minutes walking distance from the college, on the corner of York Rd & Woodbourne Ave. The Corner Carryout has the best breakfast in the city and mouth-watering lunch & dinner. Very affordable prices for large portions, no student discount needed. Wide variety of foods from salads, grilled sandwiches, fried foods, comfort foods, desserts, etc."
College Junior,5,Honor Code – I really like the fact that this campus has an honor code.
Senior,4,The only reason I picked this school because of the biology Department. The faculty in this department is great. Always willing to help you grow as a scientist.
Senior,4,The online experience is also awesome. The professors are flexible and willing to help. The professors who teach online are also very quick at replying to emails or questions.
Graduate Student,4,"My online classes went really smooth. So far all of my professors have been wonderful, great attention to detail and they are always willing to help and walk you through the process"
Sophomore,4,"It is a small school which give you and your professors the opportunity to know each other one on one. The students, staff, and professors are very kind and helpful. Class offerings are limited, which is hard sometimes to get in the classes you need."
Alum,4,"Notre Dame of Maryland University is an incredibly empowering place to learn. My classes, on average, consisted of about 10 students, which allows for professors to get to know you and give you the attention that you need in order to understand and absorb the materials. I truly felt as though I belonged to a community dedicated to learning and helping others during my time there. The campus is beautiful and although I did not spend all of my time there as a commuter, I enjoyed studying in quiet, scenic places in between classes. Commuting did have its challenges, especially with the necessity of accessing school software and maintaining certain lab hours. Earning my degree was very hard work, but I feel grateful that I was surrounded by strong women who shared my values and supported me.  Notre Dame provided me with lots of opportunities from getting involved in community service, to studying abroad, to gaining experience in the field I plan to work in."
Sophomore,4,Great School! Academics are wonderful but can be more fun. Classes are very small as well as the campus overall. The food and party scene needs a large range of improvement. The campus is very open and earthy.
Alum,4,Loved my all women's educational experience. Enjoyed the small community of powerful women (and men) and the social justice mission of the school. Student life was lacking at times but overall enjoyed my time on campus.
Freshman,4,This school gives their students amazing opportunities to experience hands on work in their future career fields!
Senior,4,I am attending notre dame of Maryland university to obtain my degree in elementary education and early childhood. Notre Dame has been very flexible with my schedule and able to accomidate all my needs. They have also provided me with a plethora of resources as a future teacher by having knowledgeable teachers that are able to give you real life experiences.
Freshman,4,"Notre Dame of Maryland University has been a great experience for me during my freshman year. Being as we are a women’s college, there are a lot of different experiences here than at other universities. Even though we have modern buildings, the dorms here are quite ancient with old wooden doors and floors and so must dust. Despite loving our cafeteria food, it could be better just like most school meals but they do have a large selection of condiments to choose from which allows us to doctor up our food if we don’t like it. But in spite of all of that, the curriculum and professors make up for those things. At Notre Dame, I WANT to go to class because we have very small classes which allow me to always be engaged in the conversations and feel connected to my professors, classmates, and friends because we are around each other so often."
Junior,4,"The small class sizes enable students to form respectable relationships with professors. Professors are well educated in their areas of study and truly care about students' well-being. Classes are interesting and include open discussions on many topics. The downsides are tuition is high, the business office is unorganized and dorms and facilities are outdated."
Graduate Student,4,Excellent  university with supportive graduate instructors. The campus is warm and inviting and the library staff and research specialists are top notch.
College Senior,4,The athletics care about getting their work done.
College Senior,4,It is one of the few all-female university left.
College Sophomore,4,"Courses and professors are overwhelmingly wonderful. Professors are always in touch, and courses are also very accessible online, should one happen to miss a day for a sports game or a UN visit (both of which are excused absences)."
College Sophomore,4,"The school's spirit is not reliant on amazing sweeps of championship games/matches. Instead, we join sports because we enjoy playing them, and we go to home games in all weather to support our friends. This isn't to knock DIII sports in the least; we easily commit 3+ hours a day, 7 days a week for the duration of the season sprinting, lifting and getting better in our sport of choice. Many students are dual- or tri-sport athletes; it's possible to balance academics and athletics here."
College Sophomore,4,"Notre Dame is a wonderful school. It's a very green, woodsy campus, despite its proximity to Baltimore proper. The students and staff are overall extremely outgoing and friendly. The campus mentality is that of a family, tight knit, but inclusive. The academic workload here varies greatly between majors. Notre Dame students are very active in the collegetown community; we have especially good ties with Hopkins and Towson (IMHO). The food is terrible; luckily, there are grocery stores close enough to walk, or bike, to, as a friend does. I am totally biased, but I love this school! Please come here, we'd love to have you. :)"
College Freshman,4,They try their hardest to help everyone they can
College Freshman,4,I don't live on campus but it seems nice
College Freshman,4,We only have one sorority and it's for volunteering and bettering to community
College Freshman,4,I've only heard good things
College Freshman,4,People are very welcoming but it seems like there is a greater focus on money than integrity.
College Sophomore,4,I see that school as very diverse in all areas.
College Sophomore,4,I love the courses offered. I feel they are very relevant to my career option.
College Sophomore,4,My experience has been great this far. I love a challenge. I feel that I have been stretched. Concepts taught to me has been applied to my everyday life. My favorite experience was my civic participation and leadership project.  I would choose this school again and again because of its high standards of learning.
College Sophomore,4,I really like that it is small and close knit. Everyone here is really nice and supportive. The teachers really seem to care about our success and want to help us in any way they can.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I like my school. My school is unique because the teachers, so far are always there to help. I would choose it again because it is great."
College Junior,4,I go to an all women's school that's also small and close-knit. I feel that my professors are more accessible and more student-oriented; they are able to give each student deserved attention they need to succeed in courses. I would choose Notre Dame again because small schools are what I am comfortable with.
College Junior,4,There are plenty of other colleges in the surrounding area to walk to and attend parties.
College Junior,4,"The only issue thus far was with the heat and air conditioning, otherwise living conditions were great."
College Sophomore,4,Baltimore city has a variety of dining options to choose from. There are small local restaurants as well as big chains. No one complains unless they don't have a car.
College Senior,4,There are always options of any type of cuisine.
College Senior,4,Professors are great and want you to be successful.
College Senior,4,You can choose the program you want to join at any point in time.
College Sophomore,4,"While there is a dorm hall that does not have A/C, the campus housing seems amazing.  I was really impressed with the dorm I stayed in during my orientation weekend, especially with it being the older hall.  While the campus seems huge, it's actually very easy to jump across campus with all the short cuts available.  At the end of the day, the campus is much small than it seems."
College Sophomore,4,"During my orientation weekend I was a huge amount of diversity, which was great."
College Sophomore,4,So far I've had nothing but positive experiences with my program.  They work hard to ensure that we stay on a stable path and are able to graduate in a good time.
College Sophomore,4,"I felt very safe while on campus, however I also am very well aware of the fact that it is still Baltimore, and there is still plenty of threats if I were to delve off-campus."
College Sophomore,4,"This university is right in the heart of Baltimore, so dining options are everywhere.  There are several carry out places near-by that several students have recommended, that not only deliver late night, but also deliver right to the dorms.  I am unsure though of any student discounts available, however I would assume being in a college town, there are plenty that offer a discount."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not been able to really have access to such services yet, however the career center appeared to be extremely interested in helping ensure that incoming freshman had all the guidance and information they made need while planning out their future.  I was also very impressed to see so many current students, as well as alumni, working at the university cause they loved it so much."
College Junior,4,There are very strict policies in place.
College Junior,4,Campus safety actually makes me feel safe.
Recent Alumnus,4,I do not know yet
College Sophomore,4,I don't really know  much people that use it so yup.
College Freshman,4,"I personally got a great scholarship, but could always use more.  They are allowing some failing students to keep the same scholarship I have while I am excelling and they are failing..."
College Freshman,4,"I personally love my major, nursing, but I would like to see more health related majors and minors added."
College Freshman,4,"I have not yet started the program, but I love everything I hear about it."
College Freshman,4,The school gives out a lot of scholarships. There is no shortage when it comes to financial aid.
College Freshman,4,There is only one sorority on campus and it is a service sorority.
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot to do around the college. There is the inner harbor downtown, there is shopping in towson, ands there are many places to hang out around campus."
College Freshman,4,they give out a lot of aid and you can get campus jobs
College Freshman,4,there are lots of places to park and its free
College Freshman,4,there are a lt of available sports most people are very nice but the sports are very competitive
College Junior,4,Tons of wonderful off campus restaurants. 
College Junior,4,"Aside from issues with the financial aid department, my college is wonderful.  There are some wonderful annual traditions that really bring the community together.  "
College Junior,4,There are lots of diverse people in my classes
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Marketing Communications major at NDMU. It has a great balance between the business  and communications side of the major. The teachers are great and the advisor, Debbie Calhoun, is the best!"
College Junior,4,The local area is very nice.  It is close to downtown where there are great restaurants and shopping.
College Junior,4,The women's tennis and volleyball team are doing great this year.
College Senior,4,"No matter what season the campus is beautiful.  There are places to sit and congregate across the campus.  If it rains, student find the best spots to hang out in each building.  The climate for snow is moderate and there are some years we receive very little or record amounts, but the campus administration is mindful of safety issue and will cancel classes if need be.  Resident students take those opportunity to sled down a few of our steep hills or to build a mammoth snowman or gator (mascot).  Student Life is always ready with some indoor and outdoor activities."
Sophomore,2,Notre Dame is an okay school but it could be better. The teachers are great and the campus is beautiful. Their financial aid office is terrible. They are inexperienced and unhelpful. The advisors aren't that helpful because they are also teachers. Since they are teachers they don't think of what is best for the student just whats best for their department.
College Junior,2,"If I could do it all over again, I would start researching a major I love and started with that major freshman year instead of switching sophomore year. Now, I am way behind because of the science classes."
College Junior,2,Almost all the teams seem to have horrible losing streaks.
College Junior,2,"Some of the counselors are very helpful and will explain everything to you but others continue to give you the wrong information. The process is even worse. I have lost so much money that I have earned because of a ""special formula"" that is used to calculate my aid."
College Sophomore,2,They don't calculate and keep track of your money. I feel like they're stealing from me.
College Sophomore,2,SAGE Dining SUCKS! I absolutely hate their food.
College Junior,2,The wireless is so hit or miss. My laptop will never connect to the internet.
College Junior,2,More fun is to be had around the city than actually on campus.
College Junior,2,As long as you follow the honor code you won't get in trouble. The main problem is that the honor code was written so long ago that nobody in this day and age wants to follow the codes.
College Freshman,2,"While the dining on campus provides decent morning and afternoon hours, their evening hours are lacking. Most people work and cannot make it to those times and often miss dinner. Not only that, but the food is bad. It's overpriced and all we eat is potatoes. If you have the money, it would be better to get a mini-fridge and just have your own food. However, they make you buy their fridge which, of course, is more expensive. It's a nice college, but be careful of the food."
College Freshman,2,Some Safety issues. Its in a private location. So you really have to travel into the city or neighboring schools to find activities.
College Freshman,2,"We have Doyle Dining Hall and Gator Alley, which are both in the same building.  They offer various items but the food is mediocre. SAGE is the company we have now and they don't understand the meaning of seasoning. Luckily they aren't coming back next year.  If you enjoy eating salad, potatoes, weak paninis, and rice, then you'll love it! If not, invest in plenty of Easy Mac."
College Sophomore,2,FA process is fairly simple. They're good about keeping up with paperwork  in my experience. My only gripe is that most of the (external) scholarships they announce are strictly for Maryland residents. That I am not. So I have to scour the interwebs for more dough.
College Sophomore,2,"Great academics, ultra-blah social scene and campus life (unless you have a car), plenty of spaces to study in."
College Freshman,2,"We have collegetown shuttles that take us to the mall and to DownTown Baltimore but, I feel as though they do not run late enough on the weekends and they do not run very frequent during the weekdays."
College Sophomore,2,"Average Experience, Not really worth all the money they charge – NDM is a decent school. The teachers and classroom environments are great. But I absolutely hated the campus life. Like someone mentioned before me, there isn't one. And I also had my share of uptight roommates, so living on campus wasn't exactly fun for me. Word to the wise: Get an off campus apartment. Save yourself from the crazy expensive room and board package and being around TOO many girls all the time. "
College Junior,2,"In terms of campus ""life"", there really isn't one.NDMU is a strict & catholic institution with many rules/limitations. Their gym, student centers, and commuter lounges are  old, small, and outdated along with just about every building there. Notre dame shares a library with Loyola, so it can take a few minutes to walk there. The school is beautiful ffrom the outside and is considered to be ""Historic"", which explains its lack of modernism"
College Freshman,2,"There's 1 and 1/2 dining halls. The main hall has pretty crummy food but there's other things to try, including a sandwich and salad bar, cereal nook, and rice maker.

The other dining hall is based on a la carte. During lunch time however fast food style of food is served by an understaffed crew. But, honestly, the food in Gator is better than Doyle."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Student's I encountered were mostly teachers or graduate students. There was no social life involved because it was graduate school and everyone had their lives to live off of campus.  As for looks, folks are regular. No one particularly striking or fancy.  Pretty much relaxed."
College Freshman,2,Campus Life – There is literally nothing to do here on the weekends on campus unless you want to go to a viewing of a disney movie or play bingo. The school is great for academics but i don't think i would survive if i didn't have friends at Towson and couldn't go there on the weekends.
Graduate Student,1,"I feel like most of these reviews are false and/or outdated are only from commuters who have no idea how real campus life at this campus is like. I’ve seen everything here from racism to lack of diversity and inclusion, to favoritism of the pharmacy and other schools. The school is in debt and owes a lot of money so they raise the tuition each year and fail to help students to the best of their ability. Students are shunned and over looked at financial aid and help is only given to privileged students who’s parents can pay their tuition by check and rarely to those who need them. Student life is weak and activities are boring. The dining hall has the worst food and is unsanitary. On campus housing is disgusting with outdated laundry facilities and the kitchens are unbearable. Do NOT let the campus tours and get acquainted days fool you."
Works Here,1,"They use Learning House (Kentucky) - look it up for their admissions, you can't actually talk to anyone from NDMU.  The staff at Learning House are untrained, overwhelmed and unprofessional.  Look up the few google reviews - they are all true.  Central administration when contacted did not do anything to rectify the situation."
Alum,1,"This review is of the Entry level BSN nursing program. To be fair, this institution actually has a very good nursing program. The culture of the environment however needs plenty of improvement. This nursing program lacks cultural diversity and sensitivity. The nursing program and it’s educators still caters to the program’s largely Caucasian student population. All of the full time professors that lecture are white with the exception of one Indo-Caribbean professor. This has created an environment of both intentional and unintentional biases, which has also created an open tolerance for racial and ethnic prejudices as well as racial discrimination that should never be acceptable or tolerated in an educational environment. The nursing program would greatly benefit from including an office of Cultural diversity and inclusion to better accommodate and nurture its students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds."
Niche User,1,I hated every second of my time at the school. Dorms are horrible and so are many of the classes. I would recommend not even applying to go there.
Sophomore,1,Student life id usually boring!!! The professors care a lot and would help you better your grades if you go to them. Tuition is ridiculously high and food sucks.
College Sophomore,1,Our campus is the quietest in the freaking nation. Nothing goes on on campus.
College Sophomore,1,there is hardly anywhere to park and there are more commuters then those who live on campus so its always hard to find parking
College Sophomore,1,"My school does not offer any off-campus housing. You either stay on campus or commute. As a past commuter, it is not great. I don't have anywhere quiet to study and when i do i normally don't have the times. I believe that they should offer some possibilities even if they are shared with loyola."
College Freshman,1,"The only guys you see are international students (who are really nice even though English isn't their first language) and the Pharmacy students. I'm pretty sure they're well into their 20s so if thats for you, go for it. Sometimes it feels like an all-girls private school, with petty drama and snobby looks. But it all depends on how outgoing you are. It is possible to have fun and ignore the snitches."
College Freshman,1,"The Health Center is on Loyola's campus and the services they provide are not up to standard at all. It's sad that we pay so much money for scraps then on top of that we have no services on campus. Be careful walking around campus at night time. Always, always, always go places with a group of friends with you to ensure a greater degree of safety."
College Freshman,1,"There really is nothing to do on capus as far as events and if there is something to do 90% of the time you have to come out of pocket to pay for the event, whether it's a mandatory class event or not. Also the security there is very shabby and the campus is unsafely dimly lit at night. Also the faculty and staff is substandard, but most of all the food is absolutely TERRIBLE, the school is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE and SUPER dirty and run down. This school is definately not worth all the money you pay in order to attend."
College Sophomore,1,"Spotty public transportation, even spottier shuttle service."
College Sophomore,1,"Plenty of comfortable places to study (minus the library, Loyola kids always give us weird looks), crappy food. Campus is pretty, but almost no one is interested in the available student life activities. Consensus is, they're BORING. Very strict as far as visitation policies go. No partying on campus, so if you don't have a car, a friend with a car, and/or friends off campus, you will die of boredom."
College Sophomore,1,"you get two options, gator alley which is over priced and mediocre or the cafeteria food which is extremely overly priced and usually nasty. not much variety."
College Sophomore,1,"The Food Sucks. While I am grateful that they want to keep our health in mind, the food is just awful. It wouldn't be as bad if they seasoned it nicely. It lacks flavor to say the least. 

I was actually disappointed to learn that SAGE provides our food. My old job used SAGE for a while and that did not work out. The quality of food does not match the cost! 

The menus are quite repetitive..you'll never fail to see some variation of nachos/tacos a couple times a week, along with undercooked pasta and watery sauce. On many days when the food is inedible, the deli bar, salad bar, dessert bar & soup bar all come in handy. I've had many bowls of cereal for dinner. 

The hours are also inconvenient. Breakfast is over very early (if you don't have early classes), lunch is pretty ok, and dinner is over very early as well. There aren't many options for late-night eating except to order take-out or go on a late-night food run. If you're broke, you'll probably just deal with the late night hunger. Your waistline will thank you, though.

Meal plans all cost the same, but it's up to you how you want to use it. The more meals you have, the less Gator bucks you have to spend at the cafe downstairs."
College Sophomore,1,"It's hard to explain. Campus life is nonexistent, so people leave campus on the weekends. No parties, nothing. Maybe we're afraid to party because nuns live on campus..I don't know. Wait, who am I kidding? Dame is VERY  strict. The director of campus life (a very strict woman) shows up at every event so we can never really have too much fun. Here it's all about not getting caught because while it's hard to so stuff publicly (you have to have all types of permission), it's SUPER easy to do stuff in the privacy of your room. Therefore, I wouldn't know too much about punishments because I have yet to hear about someone getting caught doing something they aren't supposed to!"
College Senior,1,"parking for residents should be guaranteed, but it is not. Also, more buildings means more students, but no parking accommodations have been made to off set this imbalance."
College Junior,1,"NDMU is a historically all women's college.  The university does offer certain academic programs to men.  There are male students in the Adult Undergrad programs, Grad schools including Pharmacy, etc).  Our main college is the Women's College.  Students have a very diverse way of dressing.  While some people come to class everyday dressed professionally others come in sweats.  In the Pharmacy school, professional dress is required."
College Junior,1,"The dining experience is well, interesting.  There are two options available to students which is the Main Dining Hall and Gator Alley.  The main dining hall serves a variety of options.  The food in the dining hall is either hit or miss.  Then Gator Alley, you can purchase sandwhiches, pizza slices, etc.  They accept cash, flex accounts, etc.  Usually the food in Gator is better than the dining hall."
College Sophomore,1,VERY SLOW – THE COMPUTERS ARE EXTREMELY SLOW AND WATCHING VIDEOS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. DOWNLOADING COULD TAKE AGES
College Junior,1,"Not Very Satisfying – I received a good amount of financial aid but i despise dealing with the people in the office. They can be extremely short and rude and they seem to only respect parents but it's the students who deal with them more often. I think it is extremely ridiculous the the the financial aid office and the business office are seperate entities and often have different information. How can I owe one thing when I go to one office but the amount change literally when I cross the hall.There is a lack of emotional connection as well. I understand it is a job but money is a serious is issue for a large amount of college students. I can remember crying because of the bills popping up and the people in the office looking at me as if I'm wasting their time. They definently need a lesson in edicate, respect, and the business and financial aid need to sync their information. They are also world famous for not giving the students notice if they owe money and it causes problems for enroll. You don't find out until you go to register and they say you can't because of balance. They change rules and don't let students know, the whole department needs to be revamped in so many ways I can't even begin to tell you where to start."
College Junior,1,"For resident and commuter students, there's just enough parking. When it comes to events or moving in/out, there's NEVER any parking available!"
College Junior,1,Cost of Learning – the college tuition increases yearly without any new remodeling or extra services so what are we paying for.
College Sophomore,1,Dorm Life – Sucks. Too strict about visitors and overnight visitors. Not that clean or spacious. Paint peeling off walls.
College Sophomore,1,Very Very Strict – Res Life is very strict about guests and don't allow many over night visitors or visitors after certain hours
College Sophomore,1,Very rarely does the cafeteria serve food you can eat without getting sick if you eat at all.
College Senior,1,Althletics? Yea Right! It's an all girl school. I think it's in the lowest division for all sports. No one supports them. There is absolutely no reinforcement of school spirit.
College Senior,1,"The WORST Mistake of My Life! I question every day why I came here. I can't imagine what I was thinking. Quite possibly I just believed all the lies everyone was instructed to tell! Your LIFE is pretty much non-existent when you are living on campus. There is nothing around the area, unless you want to go onto another campus--which isn't welcomed too well. The school is basically 4 buildings, I would of had a more enjoyable time in a community collge. Don't get me wrong, I'm a biological major/ Premed. I kno the importance of studying. But this school provides absolutely no life outside of homework. If you have always been that kind of reserved homework lover with no friends...This place is PERFECT for you. But if you ever ONCE wanted to enjoy your free time, you'll end up depressed and annoyed at everything and everyone. Oh ! and the price listed for tuition is a LIE! THis school is so expensive! For no reason, it doesn't offer anything-- its practically still in the stone ages! Please take my advice, learn from my mistakes. DONT COME HERE save your money."
College Freshman,1,"Overall About Notre Dame – If you are looking for a college experience that is all about school and school work then Notre Dame isn't a terrible choice, but if you want to have any type of life outside of your classes then Notre Dame is not the place to be.  It's so small and only girls, therefore any type of real social life is impossible on our own campus.  Its very service oriented which isnt terrible but occasionally, as a college student, you want to have fun and not save the world.  The school administration is awful and fails to handle any issues presented to it and the students get slighted because of it.  Overall i would never recommend this school to anyone that wanted to enjoy their college years.  I wish I would have never picked this school."
College Freshman,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER – I HATE THIS PLACE! I have never been somewhere where I've felt so eager to leave. Everyday I come to school and count down the minutes until I can go home. The teachers are ridiculously rude and show little to no care, but some show too much. The school accepts people who dont have the correct academic ability to go here and then they end up struggling to an extreme. They do this because no one is interested in this school because they do not let you do anything. Your boyfriends cant come over except for on specific days. And you have no activities for college students after classes. They have bingo and slumber parties. We are not in high school anymore, lets keep it that way."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms for freshman have no air, awful showering facilities and are kept very poorly."
College Freshman,1,Girls Only – There are only girls at the school. Most are not that attractive and interact little to none with boys around the Loyola Campus nearby. Many of the girls keep to themselves and stay in their dorm rooms with nothing to do. They hardly ever go out and are stereotypical and don't talk to commuters. That is why I am going to transfer next year.
College Sophomore,1,Few Blacks or Anything Else – The student body is most (about 85%) white and the rest is other. I know just about every hispanic and black person on campus and most are from Baltimore or near here. I think its's because therer isn't enough funding for minorities and therefore they opt to go to Morgan or Coppin.
College Sophomore,1,"Doyle Dining Is Not Good – The food in Gator Alley is okay, but the food in the dining hall is disgusting.  It tends to be bland and is often either not fully cooked or burnt.  There also are not many choices and if you have any food allergies or other diet restrictions there is sometimes very little, if anything, to eat.  The deserts are usually good though."
College Sophomore,1,"Just a Mess – I recently went to financial aid for additional help with next year and they were very helpful.  This was really the only time that I had a good experience with them.  They lose papers all the time.  My first semester here I accepted my work study but they put the paperwork in the ""to-do"" pile and three months later still had not processed it.  They assumed that I dropped it and therefore I am no longer eligible.  They have many problems with their ""system"".  Some friends have been placed on academic probation who never should have been.  Between them and the business office, it's enough to make you want to jump out a window."
College Senior,1,"Resident ""Labs"" Are a Failure – The one computer lab we have on campus is fairly nice, even though there are only two Macintosh computers there. Surprisingly, printing is free which is a plus. The IT people can not and do not control the noise level in the lab, making it not the best place to get work done. The Mac lab that we have on campus is not open to all students, only students in specific classes, which I find very unfortunate. The ""computer room"" in the Meletia residence hall is atrocious. There are literally three computers in there with no proper seating area. The monitors look like they came from a 1995 garage sale. Internet access is a whole different story. Our wireless networks are unsecure, making anyone who visits our campus able to use any network, including resnet. The wireless speed is as slow as dial-up. The only time it works quickly is literally at 5 a.m. when there are only a couple users in the building. For the amount of money we pay to attend the college, you would think they would at least provide the students, especially residents with high-speed internet and secure networks!"
College Sophomore,1,"Awefully Confusing – The roads are utterly confusing to begin with so when you add the confusing way that the parking works, no one wants to visit/drive on campus. The resident parking is on the other side of campus from the residence halls and residents can't park anywhere near their buildings for any extended period of time. One time I got a parking ticket because I wasn't a ""visitor."" If I'm paying $10,000/year to stay on campus, I should be able to park near my building."
College Sophomore,1,Too Much – There's a lot of drug use going on that people are unaware of.
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have your own car, then you have to depend on the buses or someone else who has a car. The Baltimore shuttle isn't the best, but it works. It's almost always crowded and late. Taxis are really expensive. I guess the city buses are the best option once you get the hang of them. I wouldn't suggest them for a Friday night of partying because Baltimore isn't the safest town at night."
College Junior,1,"An all women's college – As an all women's college, it's really hard for any kind of male to enter into the property without being noticed.  The upperclassmen housing isn't that bad, but still everyone is watching. Sometimes the girls are out to get you more than the RA is. Watch out!"

Sophomore,5,"As a first year student, I didn't really know what to expect, but what I found here I loved. I love the student environment and how it felt more like a family than anything else. The dorms are more like apartments because they're so big. the professors here are amazing, you can really tell that they care and are willing to put in extra time and effort to help students that need it."
College Junior,5,"So far, they're really helpful about getting jobs after school. Companies stop in and give presentations on why they want the students from Morrison, so MIT students are in high demand. They actually have a map (It's old, but still it's something) of where their graduates are working."
College Junior,5,"Everything works great network-wise. Internet runs smooth, never a worry that nothing wont work."
Freshman,4,"My 1st semester  has been a good experience wonderful staff/teachers..
 2 year college, then I will have my associates degree."
College Junior,4,"It was pretty good. The classes I had to take were actually really interesting, and they started doing some new projects in some of the classes. I 3D-printed something and made an aluminum version of it with a cast I made. I was pretty impressed with what I learned. They were the best part. Basically, when you select a major in this school, you go to every class with the same people, so you get to know up to 30 people on a personal basis just from class. I liked it."
College Junior,4,"Most of the teachers (probably 4 out of 5) are pretty good and helpful. I got 1 on 1 help when I needed it because the classes were just in a simple classroom, not a lecture hall. They all pretty much know what they're doing."
College Junior,4,"There's so many different kinds of people going there that it felt like a second high school. Lots of different people, didn't feel like a school of boring clones. I actually got to know almost everyone. Can't really say that everyone every year is going to be friendly, it's just the luck of the draw. My experience was pretty good, made some new friends."
College Junior,4,"Biggest dorm rooms I've seen at a college. Each one is a small apartment with a bathroom, small kitchen, living room, and two bedrooms. The recreation building is pool tables, a TV area with couches and chairs, ping pong, foozeball, air hockey, and darts. They updated recently, so everything is almost new. Studying can happen in several places, though there isn't one special spot for it. Not a bad place to go to school, but it has its ups and downs."
College Junior,1,"Honestly, the education is pretty good. Not as cheap as it could be, but it's a private school, which means no government handouts. The financial aid office doesn't help much. I guess every single other school has the financial aid workers do the loans for you, but these leave you on your own. The billing statements are confusing, the office isn't very organized, and I was blatantly lied to before I went there about some costs. Before I went there, I'd talk to some graduates or people who aren't being paid to show off the school. Get things straight before you're thrown in the deep end."

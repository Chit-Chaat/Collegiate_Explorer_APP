Sophomore,5,"Georgia highlands is a great school to start off at, especially too complete your general studies classes. the class size is small so the professors have more time to talk to each student. it is very affordable."
Freshman,5,The online learning experience is great because you don't have to attend classes on campus. Plus you get the benefit of doing the work when you want to.
Freshman,5,"Georgia Highlands is an amazing college that offers a safe environment for the students. It is a public college in northwest Georgia. It has locations in Rome, Cartersville, Marietta, Dallas, and Douglasville, and serves the northwest parts of Georgia, as well as parts of east Alabama and southeast Tennessee. This College is great for finishing your core classes since the classes are way cheaper than most of the universities. The class room sizes are smaller which helps in everyone learning equally."
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Highlands College is an excellent choice for anyone looking to reduce their education expenses.   Whether you are taking classes on campus or online, the professors and staff are very helpful and knowledgable in their fields."
Sophomore,5,Only problem is parking in Dallas. There’s not many options and you have to walk quite a ways. Cartersville campus is gorgeous. Never been to Rome.
Sophomore,5,Change the parking situation in Dallas at the paulding campus. Also get new people in the financial aid office. The ones in their currently are rude and impatient.
Freshman,5,I love college. It is amazing the staff is so nice and helpful. They really want us to succeed and be successful in the future.
Niche User,5,"Georgia Highlands College is a very good choice when looking for a college, especially if you are still not sure what you want to do. It is very cheap and affordable. There is a student center with a workout gym and a 2 court basketball gym and store, and a few other things. The student center is a very fun and friendly place to hang out at with your friends, or just by yourself if you want. I like that two campuses are very close to me, the Rome and Cartersville campus. The enrollment and application process with Georgia Highlands was a very easy and pleasant process. I like Georgia Highlands College very much."
Junior,5,I've had a great experience with Georgia Highlands! Almost every professor that I've had has been extremely supportive and the entire college staff seems to care about their students.
Sophomore,5,"If you're looking for a college that cares about you and what you want to do in the future then Georgia Highlands College is the right school for you. I've been attending Georgia Highlands for about a year and a half and each professor or dean that I've came in contact with has helped me greatly. They will try their hardest to help you with whatever you need for college. Georgia Highlands always has opportunities for many different things, such as scholarships, how to do taxes, good study tips, and more. 

One thing that I love about Georgia Highlands is the Student Center. The student center is a nice building where they serve delicious food and have events where students can interact with each other to get closer as peers. The student center has a gym inside of it so that you can work out or go watch people play basketball. The school store is located in the student center if you want some GHC merchandise."
Freshman,5,"Personally I think Gerogia Highands is great because it is very diverse. At first I didnt think I would enjoy going to the school, but its been great and the teachers have been phenomenal."
Freshman,5,I am attending Georgia highlands In Dallas Georgia I start class the 13 of this month I am so excited can’t wait
Freshman,5,I love the affordability and local atmosphere of GHC. I love the option of online classes while still having access to all of the schools amenities if I do need to go on campus.  The library and entire campus is always? Very  clean and welcoming. GHC makes it easy to get the same education you would get at a higher level university for a much more affordable price.
Sophomore,5,"For a community college Georgia Highlands is fantastic. They are up and coming as well. Their STEM classe selection is expanding, and I see Georgia Highlands becoming bigger and offering so much more in the future."
Freshman,5,Student goal oriented. Focused on health and wellness. Promotes cardio activity by making buildings a long way away from the parking areas. Overall friendly place.
Alum,5,Georgia highlands college is a great place to start college. It is a small campus but gives you ample opportunity for growth. The teachers are able to get more one on one with their students.
Sophomore,5,Its not a pricy college for starters. I attend the Cartersville campus and it is very amazing. For the low cost it is very nice!
Alum,5,"Georgia Highlands College provides me an opportunity to connect with your teachers when you need help on a specific assignment. Georgia Highlands College also provides me an opportunity to meet new students and make new friends. Georgia Highlands College, in addition, provides me an opportunity to become independent and learn the material by myself so that I could learn at my own pace. 

What I personally like about this school is the way that classes are small. When classes are small, teachers know you more and they feel connected to you. Another thing that I love about this school is the library. The school's library is a great place to study by yourself or a group of classmates."
Freshman,5,"Even though the classes can be small, it ensures that students receive the best one-on-one interactions with professors."
Sophomore,5,Georgia Highlands college is a great school to go to if you want to start at a small school. Their campus is not that big and everyone knows each other. My experience at Georgia Highlands was great. I liked how the professors were always there to help you and they knew you by name. They help you out in any way that they can. Everyone on the campus is so nice. Georgia Highlands has many different activities you can do through out the week. It is free and usually they give prices and your teacher might even give you extra credit for going to it. Overall Georgia Highlands college is a great school to start off at and very affordable.
Sophomore,5,I love this school! The teachers are very helpful and they always try to make you feel important. You aren't just a number to them.
Freshman,5,To me Georgia Highlands is like a second home to me. I feel welcomed each time I walk in my classes. The teachers are very much involved in their students education and make sure to provide us the best sources of learning. My peers are very friendly and everyone helps each other out in the best way possible.
Freshman,5,It's a pretty campus that offers a diverse range of studies. There are online studies you can take as well as going to campus. They are flexible with classes and offer night classes as well.
Alum,5,"I have went to Georgia Highlands for 3 years, it is a great way to start college without braking the bank. I love how there is more than one location and the professors are all very helpful. I would like to see more offerings for higher courses at each location."
Alum,5,Took dual enrollment courses through this college in high school; very helpful and valuable education before moving forward
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Highlands is an awesome school to attend right after high school. In my experience attending this college allowed me to take the classes I needed whilst saving money by commuting. The professors are awesome and truly take the time to help you understand the material. The advisors truly take time to guide you onto the right path. Overall, I'm grateful that I chose Georgia Highlands."
Freshman,5,AMAZING school to attend. I love the professors and their drive to see students succeed is so comforting.  Also I appreciate how GHC has free tutoring for students.
Sophomore,5,"I like that it is smaller than most colleges because I feel that it’s easier to speak with advisors and get help from my professors. If I could change one thing I would want my school to offer 4 year degrees for all majors, not just certain ones."
Sophomore,5,I like being able to go to school and work at the same time. The web-based classes are wonderful to work with.
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Highlands is an excellent choice for those who wish to save money or pursue an Associates Degree. Non-traditional students in particular will enjoy this modern and convenient layout. The professors are both knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach, and the faculty is very helpful. The one thing I would like to see changed is this: I wish the offered more online classes."
Junior,5,The teachers really want their students to succeed. They work with the students to help them achieve the grades that they want.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy how easy the commute to campus. Classes are small so students can easily get help from professors when needed. It is extremely easy to get around campus and the school is extremely clean and the environment is friendly.
Niche User,5,(ROME CAMPUS) Small enough to get to know teachers on a personal level and get extra help when needed!! Lots of events for free food and entertainment. Very friendly cafe staff. It is a commuter college so there are no dorms.
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Highlands College offers a wide variety of degrees and experiences to help students in life. Whether a student plans on transferring or earning an associate's (and now bachelor) degree, this college serves as a great stepping stone to new adventures. There are numerous student organizations and a few honor societies that can better prepare and guide students into being well-round people. It is incredibly affordable and is available to nearly anyone since there are five campus locations as well as distance learning. There is a relatively small student population which helps in providing students with personal connections to professors and each other."
Sophomore,5,"professors are all caring, they really want you to succeed! diversity of students, many clubs to join, i enjoyed my time spent on campus though online was a better fit for me"
Alum,5,"GHC helped me prepare to transfer to a four year college. I was able to earn my degree while getting paid to go to school because it's so cheap. Attending this school helped me save thousands in loans! It's a nice start if you don't mind commuting and you actually learn here. The professors are extremely willing to help, you just have to reach out to them first."
Niche User,5,"Super kind people and a very awesome environment. It's like a huge family! From the admissions office to the lunch lady, there's not one person I don't just love being around!"
Freshman,5,"So far the college is incredible. It is a small environment with huge help and aid around every corner. Professors are extremely personable. The staff is helpful as well. For a for year institute, I have to say I am incredibly impressed."
Sophomore,5,"I have been attending Georgia Highlands college for 2 years now and I would definitely recommend attending this college for multiple reasons. For one this college is cost friendly which can be very beneficial for majority college students. This college also has great professor and classes can be challenging, but professors are wiling to work with you. Overall Georgia  Highlands is a great school to get a feel for college life before transferring to a University."
Freshman,5,I have just started school again after being out of high school for 6 years. The staff made the process super easy and got everything done in under 2 weeks. I would highly recommend this school.
Freshman,5,"I love Georgia Highlands, the multiple campuses has allowed me the opportunity to not only travel but broaden my amount of friends. I am also able to participate in any club I would like and I really like to be involved. Georgia Highlands is a college I highly recommend. I made the  best decision choosing to go here, I could not be happier. Thank you Georgia Highlands!"
Freshman,5,Georgia highlands provides an excellent education for every college student. This community college gets students ready for a 4 year college or graduation from Highlands.
Freshman,5,"Georgia highlands is a very good college after high school, because they have to many programs where we can move on"
Freshman,5,"Georgia Highlands to me is a very standard school, providing the and meeting the basic needs of every student. The professors here at the Douglasville site are helpful, and understanding. Which is great because they take the time to re-teach a portion of the lesson which we did not understand the first time through. Through my experiences here being at this school, there's not a thing I would change about it."
Sophomore,5,"This college will take good care of you. Also, great to do your 2 years of college then to transfer since it will be cheaper!!!!"
Sophomore,5,Georgia Highlands is a great college for students who are looking for affordable education options. Georgia Highlands offers the same academic courses you would receive at 4 year institution for a more affordable price. Georgia Highlands is also a smaller university so you're able to gain more one on one learning from your professors.
Sophomore,5,I love Georgia Highlands. It is an easy going campus where everyone this there to help you succeed. The professors are all willing to help and really want you to do your best. It is a great place to get an education.
Niche User,5,"In my two years attending I've been very pleased with my classes, professors, administrators, campus(es), etc., etc. Everyone I've had dealings with has always been very helpful and pleasant. Both the Rome and Cartersville Campus were always kept clean and in good order with well-designed interiors for student life. As a community college it is very affordable and I feel very fortunate to have attended for two years at such a low cost. I feel as though I've gotten a great deal of bang for my buck along side my education."
Freshman,5,"Every experience I have had with GHC has been positive. From the application process, to the millions of phone calls I made to admissions, to the kindness of the teachers at orientation, and to the level of critical thinking and care teachers put into their courses, I am in love. I recommend GHC to everyone I know, and in fact, my sister will be starting there in the fall! I take all my classes online, so I don't know too much about the on-campus experience, but I do know GHC has won awards for being the best value for a two year degree in the state of Georgia."
Alum,5,"Georgia Highlands is a great school. Teachers are friendly and and make learning a good experience. Since it's a small town, everyone is friends. There are great opportunities for student involvement. GHC really prepares all student for transfer to a 4-year school."
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Highlands College is a great investment and a worthy school. The classes are small and the teachers really care about your education.The teachers and staff are willing to help with nearly every question about the college. People of many ages and different backgrounds attend GHC and there is a present veteran community as well. Overall, I greatly enjoy attending Georgia Highlands and recommend it to anyone who's trying to save some money and still get a good education."
Freshman,5,I like that the college is close to home and affordable. My professor is amazing. He really wants us to learn he's not just there for a paycheck. My class size is small so it makes it easier to have one on one with the teacher. I also like that there are so many class times available for a working mom like myself.
Freshman,5,Over the past semester my experience at Georgia Highlands has been wonderful so glad I decided to pursue my degree at the best school around!!!
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Highlands College is amazing. It is small campus, so majors are limited. The teaching staff, however, are wonderful. I know there are some big lecture classes, but i have never taken one here. All my classes have been around 24 students or less, so teachers get a real chance to know you and help you. Every professor I have had calls me by my first name. My advisors have been extremely helpful with getting financial questions taken care off and assisting me in making sure I am taking the right classes and on the best pathway for my graduation. It is a great way to start your college experience. I would recommend it to anyone starting out.  "
College Sophomore,5,I'm not sure because I haven't tried to transfer
College Sophomore,5,The tutorial center is the best. I go in there even when I don't need help because it is a quiet place to study
College Sophomore,5,Great class sizes. around 25-30 in each class
College Sophomore,5,Georgia Highlands College is Great! Everyone wants you to be successful
College Senior,5,If you go through with the two year degree you will have no problems
College Senior,5,If you go all the way through and get your associates you won't have a problem. If you don't you will most likely need to do some classes over.
Sophomore,4,"The classes are relatively small, so it's easy to follow along.  Most of the professors I've had are easy to manage. The facilities are nice in Paulding and Floyd.  Neither are old and rundown."
Sophomore,4,The online classes are easy to follow.  They give you all the dates and information you need to be successful.
Sophomore,4,the online courses are self taught with the instructor available for questions if you have any. multiple classes are available online and are great for students who work outside of school
Sophomore,4,"I prefer in person classes however, the online experience is adequate.  Some professors are more tech-savy than others but we have all adapted to the online platform."
Sophomore,4,I like that  isvGeorgia Highland College is local and easily accessable to my hometown.  There are 3 locations near me to choose from. I can take classes on two campuses if I need to fit my schedule. It is affordable and a good preparation for any four year degree program.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the online experience is very comperable to in-person classes.  Most professors are extremely helpful and make themselves available throughout the day to answer student questions or provide additional instruction.  The set up of the D2L online learning portal is very intuitive and easy to use."
Niche User,4,I was a dual enrollment student at GHC and I loved it. I love the small class sizes and the extra one on one time with the teachers.
Junior,4,I really love this school. I cannot see myself going anywhere else. I feel as if my education is important and professors want to help you and watch you succeed.
Freshman,4,"Though Georgia Highlands is one of many great community colleges - which tend to be perceived as incomparable to universities, it offers many beneficial opportunities in and outside of the classroom. At an affordable price, one gains the chance to get involved in sports, clubs, more personal engagement in the classroom, and travel."
Freshman,4,Very affordable. Mixed staff some pretty realiable other not so. Building is a bit complicated and there aren't maps readily available.
Niche User,4,"I dual enroll at Georiga Highlands College, and I feel like the safety at the college is very good and there is always campus police nearby. The professors have great methods of teaching and they make sure their students learn the concepts by taking their own office hours out to help students in anything they are struggling in. The information taught to the students is also very useful in everyday life. The campus is big and clean and there are always staff members nearby to aid students in anything they might need help with."
Junior,4,"I enjoy how easy and convenient taking classes is at this school. I've had a fairly good experience with all the professors I've ever had at the school, and never any trouble contacting them. The tuition is obviously cheap, but the quality of the classes is well over the worth."
Sophomore,4,I have attended Georgia highlands for 2 years now. its a great school but I'm ready to move on and transfer to a different school in the fall. the people here are very nice and I've only had one bad experience with a teacher.
Sophomore,4,"I've had a great experience so far. The professors do vary, there are some that take a ton of time out of their day to help you succeed, yet there are also some that give the material and could care less."
Freshman,4,This is a very good college. I really liked how all the staff members are able to communicate with the students whenever they need any help. I wouldn't really change anything about this college
Sophomore,4,GHC is here to help you succeed. They want to make sure you are taking the right courses to finish on time and some times a little early if you take the proper steps. they don't wont you wasting your time taking classes you don't need.
Sophomore,4,I have had very good experiences here with professors that truly help me and prepare me for my future courses. The coursework is adequately challenging and there is a wide variety of courses to choose from for my major. I feel that I will be well prepared with the skills I have acquired here to transfer next Fall.
Freshman,4,"Georgia Highlands is a great college, I feel the teachers are very much hands on. During high school I felt I would be a dropout; but the professors I have had so far really showed me that college isn't as hard as everyone makes it seem. I have encountered a bad teacher but I just overlooked it and was given extra help. Before joining the college I felt I was beyond ready to go off to a huge university until coming to GHC. I noticed when thinking about having hundreds of student with 1 teacher. I think I have made a great decision coming and also saved lots of money."
Freshman,4,Georgia Highlands is a great college for high school graduates to begin because the teachers are more caring and engaged with there students due to the number of students in every classroom. If there is one thing I could change it would probably be making more sports activities.
Sophomore,4,Georgia Highlands is a good school for a beginning College student. The low tuition rate very accommodating to many students. The college is one of Georgia's most affordable in the the state. The commute for me is fairly easy with multiple locations on 5 different location located around North Georgia. Highlands is primarily a 2 year college with 4 year offerings in the fields of dental hygiene and business.
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Highlands college is a great school.  I transferred there from a technical college and I must say, I am moving along well. I learn a lot more at Georgia Highlands and I have a clearer view on my path and I am able to see my progress and it’s a great school. The atmosphere is chilled and I would enjoy between classes sitting outside in the sun. The campus is nice and the libraries and it’s clean everywhere. Tutors are pretty helpful as well as the teachers. I’ll be graduating very soon and I’m happy that I was able to experience a nice college life here."
Junior,4,The smaller lecture settings makes it easier to better understand the material. The use of various office hours and on hand advisors is great for the use of scheduling classes and checking progress.
Freshman,4,The professors are easy to talk to and the classroom sizes are small. It's also very easy to get tutoring. Georgia Highlands will always help you find a way to pay for and pass your classes.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Georgia Highlands is beyond exceptional. The learning that you endure at this school is above great, and the teachers here go far and beyond to make sure you are learning all that you need plus more. When being on campus I feel safe enough to walk around campus to each class even being that I take late classes to fit my day to day life schedule. I also love the diversity on the campus meeting and seeing people of different cultures. The food is also great plus there are other restaurants that are not on campus but a really close."
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Highlands has given me the opportunity to become someone in life. I love the professor because they take there time to get to know their students on a personal level and to guide us to get to where we want. My campus in Marietta, GA is a nice campus if a good student life full of opportunities and activities. What I like interesting is the diversity we have and community around us. There is plenty of help to be received all around over any topic or doubt. I am very thankful for Georgia Highlands College and who I am will always be thanks to being a charger."
Freshman,4,Georgia Highlands College is a great school! GHC has a small classroom size that allows the students to get to know their professor one-on-one. The Cartersville campus new and really nice!
Junior,4,"They have really good professors willing to work with you and a good program. Just be careful if you have an issue with Financial Aid, they don't always work with you."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Georgia Highlands has been an excellent place for me to get my core done before I move on to another university. It is an affordable and still very academically challenging college. I have not had any issues with transferring hours to other colleges. I thoroughly recommend it to people thinking about going with this route. It is worth it."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed that I was able to pay for classes, as it's pretty cheap. The Cartersville campus is very nice."
Sophomore,4,Georgia Highlands is a very good college for people who don't know what degree the want to earn yet or for people who are coming back to school.
Niche User,4,"Overall a great starter school, although I do know people who have gone here and gotten full degrees. Great nursing program."
Sophomore,4,"I liked Georgia Highlands. I took online courses for my 2-year degree in Liberal Arts (general studies) here. The instructors were all helpful, some more than others. For the most part, I found success at this school taking Web based classes. I am now about to graduate!"
Sophomore,4,"I went to the campus in Cartersville which is a really nice campus. The classes aren't too big so you're able to have more interaction with the professor. All of my professors that I've had have been wonderful! If I ever needed extra help, or if I had a misunderstanding, I would either talk to them after class or shoot them a quick email. They were always there for me to clarify information or answer any questions I had. One thing that I don't like is that Cartersville is not an area where there's lots of things to do. I mainly had to stay on campus when I had my break in between classes because it's not a very fun town to be in. But, honestly this campus is great and I love sitting outside to study on nice days. GA highlands is a very easy going school for someone who is looking to further their education and start slowly by easing in to college life at a smaller school."
Junior,4,The main campus is awesome and the staff is really nice. i love going there and wouldn't change a thing.
Freshman,4,"There have been a few professors that I haven't seen eye to eye with or have caused issues with me while I have been in a wheelchair. Other than that, it is a great school to start with with great people."
Sophomore,4,Georgia Highlands College is a great starter school with friendly faculty and staff who are helpful and encouraging.
Sophomore,4,"So far, it's been about what I wanted from a community college. Affordable, within a reasonable distance, and great education. The professors have all been great, with only one or two giving me problems, and the course material has been largely understandable. The only thing that bothers me is that some of the courses required for me to graduate are not offered on campus, requiring me to either sign up for e-core or apply elsewhere as a transient student."
College Sophomore,4,They have a job fair every year
College Sophomore,4,The Career center is very helpful
College Sophomore,4,Great! They offer classes you need at good times for everyone
College Senior,4,Still won't be as good as an actual class but isn't too hard.
College Senior,4,The degree is a two year college intending that you move onto another university afterwards. I highly recumbent Georgia highlands because it allows you to get classes out of the way at a more affordable cost and better your GPA
College Sophomore,4,"The courses I have taken so far as core curriculum, but the professors have made it somewhat interesting. While I already know much of the information being covered, it is still a great review to prepare me for future courses. The classes tend to be small, about 20-30 people, with each table tending to form its own 5 person sub-group. The teachers are friendly and encourage group cooperation. Teachers also tend to be negotiable."
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of federal work study offers on campus. They frequently host job fairs and offer internship opportunities. There is a high concentration on job offers for nurses, and many sponsored booths from schools to which you may transfer after you complete GHC."
College Sophomore,4,"Right now I am undeclared, but intend on becoming an English major. Georgia Highlands College requires several literature courses and language courses in order to graduate as an English major, which means that I have to do a lot of reading and writing. I am able to do my classes in any order, with the exception of doing parts 1 and 2 of a language course."
College Sophomore,4,I love how this school offered joint enrollment. I have been able to complete college credit courses while still in high school. I love how easily accessible this school is to non-traditional students.
College Junior,4,I haven't done alot with my degree yet but the teacher i do have is great and has a lot of experience and knows what hes talking about.
College Junior,4,"Classes are good , only thing is since one man teaches comp science , I have to schedule my whole life around that one class."
College Junior,4,"I never took online courses, but Highlands uses eCore which connects you professors from other universities."
College Junior,4,"Most of the school is geared towards transferring and the nursing program , because that program grants bachelor's degrees. The school does have career fairs(depending on the campus) for jobs in the area."
College Junior,4,"The professors are nice , they teach the material and expect you to learn it, or ask questions if you don't understand. Some will hold your hand , but the rest will leave you behind if you don't ask for help."
College Junior,4,"They do help a lot with transferring to other schools, with schools setting up booths on campus on certain days. They also hold a day where you can get guidance on what schools you want to go to, what are there requirements and what steps you need to take. Because my major is Computer Science , there isn't much for me to get help on , especially since I want to go to Georgia Tech. any other major is fine , but you want to do CompSci , i suggest you do all the requirements and research yourself because although the school will try to help you, they don't really know much about the major. also there is only one  2 Comp science teachers."
College Junior,4,"The teachers really want you to know the material. For the most part , since it's all core classes, you are learning the same things over and over , but once you go into the basics of your major then it starts getting a bit challenging. Some of the teachers came from KSU,GSU, and Georgia Tech , and they want to prepare you for transfer."
College Junior,4,"I'm graduating with my Associate's in Computer Science , all my credits transfer to 4-year universities even Georgia Tech!.

The classes are not that big and the teachers are always there to help out for the most part.

I also liked how they had so many free events with food and prizes on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy doing some online courses and some on campus, depending on the type of class.  I like the online Math class so I can spend as much time as I need to finish my work.  I like taking the Criminal Justice classes on campus to get that interaction with the other students.  The professors online and on campus have all been really good.  I like the interaction on campus with the other students but glad that some are online for the same reason.  The online workload is not overwhelming which I was afraid that it might be."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the political science classes as well as the criminal justice classes.  I think all of my teachers have been very good at the subject they are teaching.  The courses are a lot harder than high school, it seems that there should be a gateway from one to the other.  I enjoy the class sizes and styles of the layout of the classes."
College Sophomore,4,"In the Criminal Justice program, I have some really good teachers.  They go over the information and relate it to the real world which makes it more interesting.  Since we do Semesters at Ga. Highlands, the workload is not too heavy.  The curriculum for the school seems to be average compared to other schools in our area.  The college has a very nice campus inside and outside.  They do have work/study available at the school."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe the teachers are really good at Ga Highlands, the campus is really nice and comfortable.  There are a lot of activities for students to get involved in.  The school is within driving distance of where I live so that makes for an easy commute.  There are a lot of students from my town that attend Ga. Highlands also."
College Freshman,4,"My online class is extremely easy, I honestly think this class I have to take is a complete joke"
College Freshman,4,Overall the professors are understanding and willing to help you
Sophomore,2,"The school is OK, it is only a starter school which is decent for it. The teachers though are rough. I would strongly suggest checking rate my professor because if not it could lead to a failing grade."
College Junior,2,"There is virtually no interaction with any of the instructors that I have had in the past semester that I attended. They also have a major problem with grading assignments in a timely manner unless it is taken care of by a 3rd-party program. There is also an unnecessary ""online class quiz"" you have to take before you can sign up for online classes that are the equivalent of a powerpoint about the topic and a few common sense questions that serve no purpose but to waste your time..."
College Senior,2,i need more options for the schedule
College Senior,2,i havent learned much from any of my teachers except for my political science teacher who i learn something from every class period
College Junior,2,I like Highlands because so far all my teachers seem interested in my assignments and what I have to say. There are a variety of people to talk to and I appreciate the help we get. 
College Junior,2,The general student body on campus mostly consists of freshmen or transfer students. Students attending this community college generally aren't as concerned with their academics as they should be.
College Junior,2,It can be difficult finding the right classes if you are a Computer Science major. They only teach the class required once every school year for a semester and fulfilling the requirement to graduate with a degree in that field can be a hassle.
College Senior,2,I dont think that I am getting the proper education. The teachers seem like they do not want to help you when you have a question.
College Junior,2,I have a very hard time with online classes.  I like to be in a real classroom setting. I am easily distracted and I just do a lot better with the classroom.
College Junior,2,"There really aren't many opportunities that the school offers that sets it apart from other schools. Since the location I am currently attending is in Cartersville, I have to drive 20+ minutes to go one way. Most students who go to Georgia Highlands usually live in Cartersville, so it is much harder for me to find a ride to school."
College Sophomore,2,There are very few computers available for Georgia Highlands students on my campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The resources at the Georgia Highlands campus I attend actually belong to another university. Some things, including the gym, cost extra if highlands students want to use them."
College Junior,2,Awful Academic Advisors – Questions go unanswered. Students are ignored. Orientation was a disaster.
College Junior,2,Not That Great – They don't really even advertise that they have one.  Many post grad students feel left all alone
College Student,2,"Before I enrolled in Georgia Highlands College, it seemed like a really nice school because they offered an array of programs. However, after enrolling, I learned that they have ""satellite campuses"", where you have to attend different classes on different campuses in order to fulfill certain major requirements. This is not always convenient because some campuses are over an hour from where I live and some classes are only available on those campuses."
College Sophomore,2,I feel that I am a much better student in the classroom setting. And if you struggle in a specific subject I suggest a student not taking an online class.
College Sophomore,2,Its Not Great – This school is not as good as people say. I guess for the price it isnt the worst but definitely not good.
College Sophomore,2,Post Grad – there arent any post grad opportunities that i know of
College Sophomore,1,I applied for a loan and did all the work so I could get it approved. I was told it would be 5-7 business days ended up being two months. After I believed I was not going to be able to get classes I called again after multiple times. My loan was just sitting there and no one put it in my account. This could have cost me my semester.
College Senior,1,"no one is involved, its a junior college so why should they be. there isn't any student life"
College Junior,1,The tuition for students is really not bad but I do find it ridiculous because of the laws placed in Georgia that I have to pay three times what a normal student pays for out of state tuition because I am not a permanent resident or citizen. 
College Senior,1,They do not offer that many classes as they do other schools.
College Sophomore,1,The computers in the media center load really slow and sometimes they dont work at all.
College Sophomore,1,I have  had to go through so much just to get just a little. I have yet to receive my refund. The financial aid office isnt worth anything. They have never answered any of my questions!
College Freshman,1,Career service never will give you a direct answer to any one of your questions. I have never received an answer to one of my many questions.
College Freshman,1,"GHC Would Not Be a School I'd Recommend. The staff at GHC are rude, unencouraging, unwilling to answer questions.The staff are very lazy. They wont tell you answer to your own questions. I could not of hand off attend a four year university, so i thought attending a local two year school would be smart. I found out sadly that this is not the way to go."
College Freshman,1,"Classes Are Small and Boring – I am a double major, I want to persue a nursing and communications degree and I am not happy with the way my school goes about helping specific majors. The teachers just aren't interested and the staff only helps when you call non-stop. Its very unprofessional and not tasteful."
College Sophomore,1,Not Great – If you are looking to make friends then dont go to highlands. Everyone just comes to school and leaves. I have only made a couple friends since I have bee here and alot of the other kids are strange.
College Freshman,1,Not an Interesting School – There isn't anything unique at all. Everyday is just calm and boring.

Sophomore,5,"It has a very strong Catholic atmosphere, daily Mass, and Eucharistic adoration. The students are the friendliest you will ever find and are tolerant of you regardless of religion. The current president, Msgr. Shea, has a strong passion for creating the best environment for his students so they can be the best prepared to encounter the world and it's challenges."
Graduate Student,5,The staff is extraordinarily friendly and helpful when it comes to helping and advising students in the steps that are needed for applying and accepting. I was able to speak to a few of my future professors and program directors before accepting a position at school.
Sophomore,5,"I like that it was really easy to apply, the online classes are engaging and the student advisers are great."
Freshman,5,"I liked how small it is. I love the Catholic perspective of the students, except for the ones who aren't entirely into their faith. I want to grow in mine. I also love how the students were very kind when I first checked out the school."
Sophomore,5,The University of Mary is a very friendly campus and it is small enough that you can get to know many of the people. The professors are always willing to help you if you have any question.
Sophomore,5,"University of Mary is an amazing school! The faculty are more than willing to accommodate to people's needs. The facilities are very nice and well-kept. The university sits on top of a hill giving a great view of the valley, city, and Missouri River."
Sophomore,5,"I am about to finish my first year at the University and honestly, it is so life-changing. I have completely opened my eyes to new possibilities and having so many welcoming people in my life. I am originally from a big city, but moving to a small town like Bismarck is truly different. The University has a year-round campus that lets students study through the summer and I am very excited to experience it this summer and hopefully study abroad. I truly recommend the University if you are looking for something small but big at heart."
Sophomore,5,"I love being at the University of Mary because the professors take the time to get to know you! The professors have always taken a time to invest in my life, and keep up with me and how I am doing."
Niche User,5,"My experience with the University of Mary was wonderful. All the people were kind, and the buildings were great."
Senior,5,"Good for foreigners to know more about student and USA life, 
When you still do not know too much about the USA, this should be a good choice for you to know USA society. Less competitor and people so nice around you. A lot of working opportunity in school and school related company."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Mary is the embodiment of the phrase ""knows now bounds"". I've never encountered more willing staff to help you, and I've never met a more welcoming community.  They're innovative and constantly trying to improve life for students by doing things like having a 24 hour open cafeteria!"
Sophomore,5,University of Mary is really great! The staff and professors helped me through a recent medical trauma where I had to leave right before finals week of the spring semester. They worked with my family and I the whole way and let me catch up when I was ready. The student body was helpful during the whole endeavor as well. They were all uplifting and helpful and just great friends and peers! The Benedictine values that the school teaches truly shines through the students and the staff.
Alum,5,"It was tremendous to see how much the professors cared about their students. Every time I needed assistance or was struggling, whether it was inside or outside of a professor's given classes they were always willing to talk or see if there was any way they could help. The campus community was very close-knit and was the catalyst for the change that I experienced that turned everything around for me. I couldn't be more thankful for everything I experienced at UMary."
Alum,5,"The University of Mary really embodies what education is all about. It is a true community where one receives deep intellectual, professional, and character formation. The University's faculty and staff from the top down are all deeply concerned with the success and well-being of the students, and it is evident from the moment one steps on campus.

The mentorship that one is able to receive at the University of Mary is second to none, and I credit the close relationships with faculty and my peers for my professional success. The University of Mary prepared me well for my future after college where I am now surrounded by largely Ivy League alumni who are all amazed when I describe to them my university experience. The University of Mary is truly a first-rate institution."
Alum,5,"A place that truly cares about every aspect of the human person. A place where you know you are loved by the professors, the falculty, the fellow students and most importantly the Lord.  I recieved so much more than just a degree. I recieved a transformed heart with a new love for Mary our most holy Mother."
Alum,5,"The University of Mary prioritizes the formation of the whole person through friendships among faculty and students, challenging academics, and a rich spiritual life. One of my favorite parts about my time as a student was getting to know my professors. They were radically available to their students and took time to get to know me. The administration, faculty, and staff love the students and serve the academic, spiritual, and personal needs of those students. I am so grateful for my education at the University of Mary!"
Senior,5,"As many of us begin looking into our future careers, we are easily tricked into measuring our success by the prestige of what graduate programs we are accepted into or by the financial benefits from the jobs we land. As a social work student, UMary has prepared me to approach my future career by teaching me how to identify what is good, having the desire to receive what is good, and aspire to do what is good. By entering into my career with this attitude, I will be able to battle trials and tribulations with an inner strength motivated by joy and love."
Junior,5,"Everyone is so helpful. They want to see you succeed, so they do everything in their power to assist you accomplish your goals."
Sophomore,5,Very good so far. Staff are really friendly and easy to work with. There are plenty of scholarships thst they offer as well.
Senior,5,I love this school very much. It has helped me become a more virtuous and loving person. There are many supportive people here who desire your good.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the university because all of my professors are ver knowledgeable and have our best interest in mind.
Niche User,5,The University of Mary shows dedication to their students and faculty. They treat one another like a family. The University has many achievable programs and their athletes show great academics as well as students outside of being athletes.
Freshman,5,"I am a person who does not do so much research in something they should. For instance, applying to colleges. When looking at colleges the first one I found was University of Mary. I had no idea what the campus was like, or how could it would get or even the cost of education. Thankfully though the university is advertised as the cheapest private college, so that was good for me. The people here are great and friendly, which is something new to me being from VA. I wish however they could offer a better gym. It's quite small and there isn't that much equipment to use."
Senior,5,The University of Mary is a great place to grow and learn as a student. The small school atmosphere (14:1 student to teacher ratio) is incredible and the faculty and staff are unbelievable. There isn't a more caring and student-centered University in the area. This school cares about the development of the human person not just about the degree you recieve. There are constant improvements being made to make it a better school.
Sophomore,5,I love UMary. I am studying Business in their online degree program and the staff and faculty are so helpful and understanding. My advisor Jennifer is amazingly attentive.  I have a newborn baby and this school has been perfect to help me achieve my goals.  Thank you UMary!!
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the environment about the University. It is a very friendly environment. They have really nice clubs and events that are available for students, so they are not bored in their dorm."
Freshman,5,"The University Of Mary is a catholic based school who’s main goal is to help students achieve their academic excellence. The teachers are great at helping students with any special circumstances they may have. The president of the university is involved with the students, that’s shwls how closely knit the school is with each other and how they want to see you succeed in life"
Junior,5,"The university of Mary is a place where harmony is present at all times. I have never heard anyone arguing or saying bad things to each other. Every one helps you out and you can tell they want to because there is a smile in their faces when they do so. Professors care about us as a students and they will do whatever it takes to help you succeed, apart from that, the sisters here at university of Mary give you that feeling of calm that as a student you will at some point need. Overall, it is just a great place to be, study, compete and strive."
Junior,5,"UMary has become my home. I have made some of my closest and dearest friends there from living with them, studying abroad with them, and eventually being in one of their weddings. It is a place where I can grow in my faith while immersing myself in an open and loving atmosphere where we stand for the dignity of all humans and the right of all human life. I LOVE UMary and will forever call it home."
Freshman,5,Small campus with a wide variety of activities. Professors are friendly and students to staff ratio is smaller which makes it easier to learn and understand the material. Many professors are available in the evenings and some even during the weekends to help you with questions on your assignments or upcoming tests.
College Sophomore,5,All the professors are amazing! They really take time to learn their students and help us succeed. The class sizes are small.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on campus. The crime level is low. I have attended the self defense class.
College Sophomore,5,I have greatly enjoyed living on campus. All the dorms are within walking distance of the buildings and provide plenty of space for social gatherings.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school! It is totally amazing! The professors really care about the students and really want to see us succeed! It is a beautiful campus and the student body is amazing. This school is unique because it is an affordable private school with great programs.
College Freshman,5,This school has a high rating of getting into a career right out of college.
College Freshman,5,Faculty almost all have an open-door policy which allows students to allows have a support group of teachers.
College Freshman,5,I feel totally safe on campus around the students and faculty.
College Freshman,5,This school is amazing because it really teaches you to be a servant of Christ.
College Freshman,5,I love the campus housing for females. I like the suite stile dorms and my roommate and I get along great. It was easy to get into the dorm I wanted as long as you understood the lotery process.
College Sophomore,5,I am not involved in the Athletics area of the school.   I am a special needs teacher major and my schedule is already on overload with that and work.
Sophomore,4,The online learning experience during the pandemic was stressful for everyone at Umary. The professors were so patient and understanding through it all which made the learning a lot less stressful.
Senior,4,"I am not an experienced online learner, but when I need help or have questions the professors respond quickly."
Senior,4,The academic advisors and professors are very responsive when you have questions or need help setting up a degree plan. They have many resources and take time to get you the answers you need.
Sophomore,4,As the coronavirus pandemic arose we had to take our classes online. I took hard classes such as Anatomy and Biochemistry online. I would say that I learned the same amount as I was doing like in person classes. The teachers were very helpful and understanding by increasing the length of time of some assignments and answering questions pretty fast. Some teachers were willing to make Zoom calls to answer your questions or email you about how you were doing. I learned a lot and I was studying hard so I was happy that it didn’t end up being a waste of money.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy studying at the University of Mary. The staff in the school are very polite and kind . The academics are very good and have a lot of quality. I have learned a lot since I started college and I had very understanding teachers who helped me get accustomed to the United States’ education system. The sports overall are not a huge thing because it’s a division II school, but still the teachers are willing to help the athletes in every possible way.  It’s a very religious school, so for people who are not catholic can sometimes feel out of place for having different religious identities. As an international student and being from Mexico I’ve felt very welcomed by the students and never experienced any kind of racism and prejudice. Some of the things that I don’t enjoy from the school is the lack of diversity and international students. As an international student I feel that people who are outside the country always feels very lost. The school overall is pretty good."
Alum,4,"I took some classes online if that was the only way the course could fit in my schedule or if it was only offered online. Also, with COVID, all of my classes got transferred online during second semester of my senior year. I thought all of my professors did a great job at still providing us with a quality education, given the circumstances. We still held class at the same time as before, and we still covered everything we were supposed to in the course."
Alum,4,"UMary has a community second to none. The people there truly make you feel like you are at home. The professors and people at this school care about you as a person, not just a student or athlete. And most importantly, the school prepares you for life outside of school."
Senior,4,The college is small enough to make you feel like you matter but big enough to give you opportunities. The teachers are amazing.
Sophomore,4,"I love my college for its academics and community life, but also for the amazing staff of teachers. It is also more reasonable, financially."
Graduate Student,4,"Not enough can be stated about the wonderful instructors at this college. 
Extraordinary helpful, plus they find unique ways to challenge and inspire students. Not only to perform, but to become better individuals."
Junior,4,"I have completed two years here at the University of Mary and overall, my experience has been amazing. They have wonderful professors who not only truly care about you, but are also some of the most intelligent people in their fields of study. The friends I have made here have impacted my life many times over what I expected when I first applied. I just finished one of their study abroad programs and it also far exceeded my expectations, but the college showed consistency with the amazing professors and the thought and care put forth in the academic program there. Really the only thing that I can complain about is that the college is growing almost faster than the campus can keep up."
Freshman,4,I love the friendly environment. It is a small college so you really get to know the students and professors and everyone is very nice and helpful.
Freshman,4,"It is a relatively small school, with a very friendly community. There is a very strong catholic atmosphere for those who are catholic, but ministry is provided for all faiths. The school is a few miles from Bismarck, so you don't have to deal with any of the problems of living in a city, but it is close enough that you can get there quickly if you need to grab something from the store or if you want to go and hang out with friends. The campus is very safe, and I do not know anyone who has ever found him/herself in a dangerous situation. I am perfectly comfortable walking across campus late at night in complete darkness. Overall, this is a great, affordable, friendly school with a strong catholic community, and I would recommend it to anyone."
Freshman,4,"I was very impressed by the welcoming community when I first came up here to visit last October. I had wanted to go here for a long time, but that visit really pushed me to apply, and I got accepted some time later. Overall, I am very satisfied with my choice."
Senior,4,I am an online learner. The assistance received in restarting classes after not being in college for 5 years was amazing. The instructors and academic advisor are very helpful. The academic program is excellent.
Sophomore,4,If you are looking for a good catholic college the University of Mary is the perfect place for it!!! Even if your not religious you are still most welcome and I don’t think I have come across a person I did not like! Everyone is so friendly and the professional not only cares about your acedemic success but your growth as an individual! It is very easy to get one on one time with a professor because of how small classes are and the professors care for each individual student!! Lastly the University as a 24/7 all you can eat restaurant on campus and the food is delicious!!!!
Niche User,4,"I love that the college offers a Master's program in five years instead of 6. I will be able to take year round classes, which in the long run will really benefit me. I live in Bismarck and will be attending UMary, and I will be living at home, and UMary offers a discount to people who are in state and live at home. I really enjoyed the college, and it is a private college with a low cost."
Freshman,4,Great school and super friendly people on campus. would highly suggest to others. Food is the best because you have a 24/7 café/nest.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see more diversity. In saying this I don't just mean diversity of the student body. I mean much more than that. The things I'd like to see diversity in the most are class/course options, housing opportunities, activities, food, teaching styles/techniques, and academic success options."
Freshman,4,"This university is great! I love how helpful the professors are, they are willing to help you, to make sure you pass your class and they are willing to answer most questions you ask them. The campus is on a hill with a beautiful view that you'll never get tired of. You are required to take atleast 2 theology classes but it's not too bad. I love this school and am thankful that I chose it."
Freshman,4,"In my experience, the University of Mary has good teachers, majors, resources, dorms, and a great sense of community and hostility."
Niche User,4,"The University of Mary is a safe college campus, and allows student flexibility. The classes and professors help develop the student with a close relationship to learning. It is a school that wants you to succeed, not your money. It is a school for everyone."
Senior,4,"What I love most about this college are the teachers. This place has nothing but the best education and teachers running it. All of these teachers love what they are doing and are passionate at what they are doing. Thanks to these teachers I have had the privilege meeting have more than prepared me for the real word and big job opportunities. This university is also very welcoming to everyone. I didn't have the best score before entering college but that didn't matter to them, they knew what I was capable of and didn't look down upon me. Thanks to them and believing in me, I will be either graduating with a 3.0 or close to, they never lost hope in me and they also pushed me to limits I didn't know I was capable of."
Senior,4,"I really love going to this school! The academics are great and is more comfortable due to smaller classroom size. The professors actually want to help you and know you by name. The only thing I think needs work is acceptance of more religious views rather than just Catholicism. I know that I go to a catholic school, but there is no place where you get to learn about other religious views and have a more open mind."
Senior,4,"The campus itself is beautiful, on multiple different places on campus you have an amazing view of the river. The cafe is good newly renovated however they tend to serve the same food week in and week out. They do however have different stations for some variety. The academics and professors are always able to assist and help when needed."
Junior,4,"You will receive an excellent education once you are in your program. I would suggest not going year around campus and stick to the traditional route, no one understands what is going on during the summer."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the University of Mary is a great school. They have a very strong health sciences program. I enjoy most of my professors and I absolutely love my classmates and friends. I am an athlete here and you have to really work hard to manage your time between school and a sport. The professors work hard to connect with you and so does all the staff. Oh! You can't forget the most amazing very that you get over looking the river, and star gazing at night is great. The community of Bismarck is so welcoming and really supportive of the school."
College Freshman,4,"To me, the campus seems to be pretty secure with a crime rate that is extremely low. I think everyone feels pretty safe on campus and there is easy access to security on campus. Overall, the campus is pretty safe."
College Freshman,4,"The social atmosphere of the campus housing is pretty good. There are a variety of different things to do in the dorms. The campus housing is in very close proximity to the buildings where classes are held, which is very convenient. Overall, campus housing is pretty good."
College Freshman,4,"As a baseball player, I feel that the facilities are great and they are being improved even more. The athletics programs are very supportive of each other and I've seen quite a few other athletes at the different events. School spirit and fan support seem to be pretty high, which is good. I'd say athletics is pretty well supported here."
College Freshman,4,"I'd say that so far it's been an overall good experience. The student body is pretty friendly and easy to get along with. It feels like it's pretty easy to meet new people and make new friends here. The classes are pretty demanding, but overall, it's been a good experience."
College Senior,4,"Pros and Cons:

Pros:

The community is very welcoming here, and if you go to various events you will know most of your class by the end of the year. 

The cost is very reasonable for a private school. Yes, there are some fees after tuition, but it's half the cost of most other options."
College Junior,4,Everyone is friendly and so far it has been easy to talk to the instructors regarding expectations and class assignments.
College Junior,4,Campus is well lit and security is around most of the time.
College Sophomore,4,The campus has a great alumni network and a great leadership program that I know will help me find a job.
College Sophomore,4,It is fun to watch! The student body is very supportive and I love going to events and cheering my team mates on.
College Junior,4,The community at the school is great. The advisers are helpful. They have some great programs.
College Freshman,4,I really like all of my classes. The professors are easy to understand and if you have any questions they are ready to help. They are willing to set up meetings at times that work for you. In multiple classes we have had guest speakers from the community come in. That is really nice becasue they are able to explain what that field of work is. Professors are also really helpful if you are looking for internships or jobs to gain experience in your feild. The professors have a lot of connections and many business will inform our professors about internship opertunities before they post the positions so that professors can share that informmation with the students.
College Freshman,4,The Universty of Mary is known for leadership and companies are looking for people that can lead. We have many different events like carreer/internship fairs. The professors are very involved in the community and have connections accross the United States that are helpful in finding jobs and internships. My major actually requires me to do a 40 hour a week/14 week internship my last semester of my senior year and will help me find an intership and will work with the company to make sure I am doing more than running coffee.
College Freshman,4,The professors really care about you and get to know you. They learn your names and know what your intersts are. It is really easy to go talk with them if you are having an issue in class. Everyone on campus is friendly and it is easy to make friends.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at the University of Mary are sub-par. Some of the sports teams are excellent, including track, cross country, and basketball. Football and volleyball are getting better, but the energy at the games is so great, no one cares if tey win or lose."
College Freshman,4,I really like the school in the sense that I feel at home here and everyone is super nice. All my professors are awesome and the Athletic Training program is great! Every program excels in their field and you will graduate feling confident with what you have learned.
College Freshman,4,"Honestly, Bismarck is very safe and we are just outside of Bismarck. The campus is small so there are no phones all over campus, but if you need help it is very close by."
College Freshman,4,I would choose the University of Mary all over again if I had to because it is a perfect environment. The small school community is great and the people here are amazing. Staff is overjoyed to help with any problems and the students here are more than willing to help with anything.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are smaller and more personal.
College Freshman,4,I think that it will be easy to get a job after college. The programs here are good and the career services are very helpful.
College Freshman,4,It's nice to live in the middle of the community. It adds convenience
College Freshman,4,"Our school is the friendliest campus I have ever visited. The overall sense of community on campus is wonderful. You are greeted as you walk to class by professors and students alike. The professors are never too busy to help the students, and truly want them to succeed. It is a great learning environment!"
College Sophomore,4,"I like that my admissions councler is very helpful, and so is the director of the program I chose."
College Freshman,4,"Dorm life is pretty good. The suite style dorms are great since you get your own bathroom. There's better community in Boniface and Boniface West then the newer dorms, but the new dorms are nicer. Considering the cost of apartments in Bismarck, Mary's housing cost is decent. The RAs are awesome!"
College Freshman,4,"The University of Mary is a great school. It's a welcoming community and both students an professors are great to work with. At what other school does the president give lectures to the freshman class for a whole semester and throws a Christmas party at his own home for college students? The campus has a beautiful view, in fact, that was half the reason I came here! Despite the price tag that comes with a private education, attending here has been a worthwhile experience."
College Freshman,4,"Great school, very personable instructors who know what they are doing and care for their students."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus. There is little in the way of crime, and if there is any, it is only petty crime. The school is out of the way, so there is little chance of someone coming onto campus to commit a crime. The security is very helpful and can be seen walking the campus both day and night, making sure everyone is safe."
College Sophomore,4,"Each day there is always a new career person on campus, getting to know the students, and their possible employees. The school is very helpful in finding internships and jobs, and it's main focus is having you ""hire-able"" when you graduate. There is even an entire day where many different businesses come into the school. The career fair is the best place to find new positions and get to know potential bosses."
College Sophomore,4,"Each student is encouraged to attend any of the variety of sports events both on campus and off. The school offers all types of sports. There are new facilities being built this year, and upgrades are happening. The school spirit is very strong, and the student section is always lively. Athletics are seen as an important part of the university life."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone wants to be on campus. Very proud of being a student.
College Sophomore,4,The courses are laid back and will challenge you but will not make you consider not going to class.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is very friendly and very helpful.
College Junior,4,"I have always loved the campus life, particularly when it comes to campus life within the new apartments. The pub right next to the apratments is the perfect distance from campus."
College Junior,4,"It has an excellent study abroad program, and the teachers are very present to the students."
College Freshman,2,The athletics program is poor because the morale is pretty low.
College Junior,2,"The sports teams are not very good. As they do worse, the school spirit goes down. There is not much to cheer for."
College Junior,2,"The teams don't always do very well, so the fans aren't always the most supportive. The new facilities are coming though, and many of the programs are being rejuvinated."
College Senior,2,There are no sororities or frats at umary
College Senior,2,"If you want to have fun you have to hide it from the RA's or just go off campus, because campus is boring"
College Senior,2,They care more about students not having fun than students having fun. The campus is like a glorified high school.
College Senior,2,They do not provide enough housing for the people on campus. Scholarships go out to students for free room and board but are kicked out by their junior or senior year because there is no room.
College Freshman,2,I think they are too strict on things because some times I feel like I'm back in junior high when everything you did was against the rules.
College Freshman,2,The rules they have limit the amount of fun we can have on campus. eithee you get judged or you go off campus. Also the rules that they have make it feel like we are junior high kids who can't handle having fun. Especially at dances.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of on campus parties are very poorly planned. They can not get enough people to show up, and when they do they make to many rules and regulations for anyone to have enough fun to stick around."
College Freshman,2,They are very strict and I feel like they are limiting students abilities to go out and live the college life.
College Freshman,2,North Dakota winters suck. The wind is the worst part because if it wasn't so windy all the time it wouldn't seem so cold.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do unless you are over 21. There are a few restaurants but you end up going to the same ones as most of them seem to be a little spendy.
College Freshman,2,Our wifi is absolutely god awful. It is getting better but you can't rely on it.
College Junior,2,I wouldnt choose this school again. Its way too small and not diverse at all. Theres only white republicans with a few black people. And the city is super boring.
College Freshman,2,"i believe you can find drugs anywhere, it all depends on who you associate yourself with."
College Sophomore,2,"No Where to Go! Because Bismarck is near the oil boom, finding cheap appartments is really hard."
College Sophomore,2,"We are a Catholic based college so a lot of the schools money goes to religion. Nike offered to build us a stadium if the university would pay for half, but our nuns turned their offer down because by having Nike symbols on the stadium it would be like worshiping another God. So this means that our athletic facilities suck. We currently do not have a student center but it is getting built in the next few years. The library is a beautiful building but does not have very many fun reading books at all. Campus activites are terrible. They are all church based so if someone who is not religious came here campus activities would be almost non-existent. Our campus buildings are made out of stone so they are kind of ugly and do not get updated often."
College Freshman,2,"When in Sports – Being in a sport can be a great way to get to know others. However, those who are involved in school atheletics are favored above those who are not."
College Freshman,2,"Chartwells in Bismarck – The University of Mary in Bismarck has delightfully chosen Chartwells to be the chief and only provider of dining services here on campus. I am less than satisfied with their choices of meals, variety of options, and customer service. It is disappointing when the best option for an every day lunch is a cheeseburger and fries."
College Freshman,1,We don't have sororities or fraternities.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Junior,1,Very very very bone dry
College Freshman,1,"The public bus does not come up here and there is no shuttles or school provided transportation. You either need your own car, or you need to hitch a ride with someone going into town."
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing available within 5 miles of campus. Campus is located too far from the city to be included in anything.
Recent Alumnus,1,"NEED WORK – All the dorms and apartments are in need of updating and clean up and 
repair"
Recent Alumnus,1,"It Is OK – It is hard to get real personal help as when trying was told to 
pretty much figure it out.  The advisers I have had contact with were 
useless!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"The rules here are ridiculous. There is a level system here. At level five you are kicked out of school. To recieve a level one you could be in a boys dorm after curfew, be running down the hallways, being too noisy past curfew, leaving garbage outside your door for too long. To get a level two you would have alcohol in your room, be having a party in your room, or staying the night over in a guys or girls room. If you are caught having sex it is an automatic level five."
College Sophomore,1,Overall it is terrible. We have two cafeterias and the menus suck in both usually. South is a little better cause the food is homemade. Prices are ridiculously expensive for what type of food you get.

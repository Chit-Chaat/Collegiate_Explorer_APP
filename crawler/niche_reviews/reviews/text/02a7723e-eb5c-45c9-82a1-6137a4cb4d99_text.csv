Senior,5,"Blue Mountain is a great place to further your education. Small enrollment allows the student to not get lost in the shuffle. Professors are able to form relationships with you and assist you hands on in your learning. I would recommend this college to any prospective students or student-athletes. The only change that I would like to see at Blue Mountain is for more students to enroll and experience it for themselves without writing it off after viewing the very small campus assuming it is of no value to them. Knowledge is power, and I can testify Blue Mountain will definitely offer you the opportunity to further the horizons on your intellect."
Freshman,5,"Blue Mountain is a really small college and I feel in love with it. It's a christian enviroment, and they know their starts my heart. They are not just numbers everyone is friendly, and as soon as you approach the campus they are so welcoming. It's a family enviroment."
Senior,5,I like everything about Blue Mountain. The academics are excellent and so is the life on campus. I am an athlete and every sport supports each other.
College Freshman,5,"Because it is such a small school professors are present to help any student if they need addistance understanding a concept being taught.  Study guides are given in almost any class that needs one, if you study that you can get a pretty easy A"
College Freshman,5,You do not hear of any drug issues at school.  Athletes use because it will affect if they get to play and other students are too busy with academics and extra curricurals to have time for drug abuse
College Freshman,5,My campus is small therefore so are the classes.  I love the small class size.  I have attended a community college during high school and I had a hard time learning in the large class sizes.  Each of the professors are eager to help any of their students who are struggling.  Their office doors are always open to us if we need anything.  The professors each teach differently but with each professor I have found myself eager to learn more about the subject being taught.
College Freshman,5,"This is my freshman year in college.  I have been homeschooled my whole life, and the idea of going to a big state university scared me.  When I found Blue Mountain I fell in love with the homey feel, the wonderful professors, and the beautiful campus.  I have only been there for one semester and I can't imagine leaving."
College Sophomore,5,"We do not have Greek Life, but instead Societies. There are two boys and three girls societies on campus and you chose whichever society you wish to rush. No competition at all."
College Senior,5,Amazing elementary education program. Class sizes are kept small and the instructors are very welcoming and connect with you personally.
College Senior,5,Best college ever been too
College Senior,5,Love parking for my campus house
College Sophomore,5,Its in a dry county.
College Sophomore,5,The school is a drug and alcohol free zone.
College Sophomore,5,Its all just one big family from the staff to the students.
College Junior,5,I am very satisfied with my educational experience at BMC. Very prepared for the field of teaching.
College Junior,5,The BMC elementary education program is the best! The classes definitely ensure you are prepared. 
College Junior,5,We don't have parties or go drinking or anything. We  always hang out on campus and find something  to do that doesn't get us in trouble or puts us in an unsafe situation. My college is fantastic :) there's ALWAYS something to do :)
College Junior,5,"They do not tolerate drugs, alcohol, smoking, PDA, etc. We are a Christian college that sticks to our guns."
College Junior,5,"It is the best, but just like everywhere else, things can happen. We have great security though that we can call at anytime, and they're there to help immediately. It's awesome."
College Junior,5,You don't need a car. It's FANTASTIC! Everything is within walking distance :) you only need a car to drive to Wal-Mart or something :)
College Sophomore,5,The strictness at the school is very acceptable. All of the students act there age as well as respectful of the honor codes in affect.
College Sophomore,5,the Security is all over the campus of Blue Mountain College. The people around here are extremely nice and welcoming of new students as well as helpful. All the the faculty members are happy to meet everyone and make things easier on the new students.
College Junior,5,"Starting out as a Biblical Studies major, I wasn't really sure what to expect. The professors are wonderful and I am learning an incredible amount of knowledge from them. If I could do it all over again, I would pick the same path I am on now. I am planning on working in children's ministry and with my degree and knowledge from Blue Mountain College that is a reachable goal."
College Junior,5,Very strict campus. Underage drinking and drug use are not tolerated. Parties are quickly busted up.
College Sophomore,5,Blue Mountain provides computers for students to use in the Library as well as other places around campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Blue Mountain is very concerned about safety! Each year the staff gives students tips to be safe around campus. There is campus security and if a student is going to stay out past 12, they are to sign out."
College Sophomore,5,"Blue Mountain does a great job at wanting students to get involved in activities going on around campus. There is ALWAYS something going on and to get involved in, it is just whether the student is willing to put forth the effort to join the activity or not. There are plenty of places to have activities and Blue Mountain is a BEAUTIFUL campus."
College Sophomore,5,"The student teaching internship is unpaid, but the commitment is much like a regular paid teacher. I will have to come up with lesson plans and teach some subject areas during the school day."
College Sophomore,5,I am very satisfied with the Elementary Education program at BMC. I feel like I will be very prepared for my career after graduating. The professors are very knowledgable and helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics are a big part of campus life, especially during basketball season."
College Sophomore,5,They are constantly driving around checking on the students.
College Sophomore,5,Elementary Education – One of the best elementary education programs in the state. Very qualified instructors
College Sophomore,5,"Non Existent – At BMC, the party scene and drugs are basically non existent. Most people are good people."
College Sophomore,5,"Elementary Education – The process of getting into my major is somewhat challenging, but since I plan to become a teacher, I feel that the challenge is necessary. All the education instructors are amazing and you have plenty of opportunities to observe in the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,"Has great education majors and programs, but somewhat limited in other areas. Elementary ed is the best!"
College Sophomore,5,"Love the Small Town – There isn't much to do in Blue Mountain, but I personally love the small town and friendly atmosphere! It was one of the things that drew me to this school."
College Sophomore,5,Totally Safe – I never felt unsafe on this very small campus. Campus security is amazing.
College Freshman,5,This college is like no other! It is amazing. Enough said. :)
College Freshman,5,You can always find a parking spot. Most people are like me and park on sunday and don't move until time to leave for the weekend. The campus is so small that you don't have to drive to get to your classes.
College Junior,5,The school is small enough that you don't really need much transportation to get around.
Sophomore,4,I had to take online classes due to Covid-19. It took getting adjusted to the experience. But the professor made it an easy transition.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with Blue Mountain College has been great. I was looking for a small, family, christian based campus and Blue Mountain is just that."
Junior,4,I am very thankful to be at BMC. God has provided everything I need for my college experience at BMC. The professors are very knowledgeable  and adamant about sharing their knowledge with their students. It is not difficult to make friends—everyone pretty much knows each other. It’s been a pretty great experience.
Senior,4,"Like the small campus and knowing almost everyone on campus.
Only had 1 professor that didn't seem to care that most of the class was failing."
Senior,4,"The best thing about BMC is the community. The professors are invested not only in the students' education, but they care for their students' overall well-being. While there are a lot of areas that could use improvement, my experience has been very good. BMC is a very unique place where students are challenged to grow in wisdom and knowledge, but more importantly to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord."
Senior,4,So many changes have been made at BMC since I started in 2014. One thing that hasn't changed is the compassion of the staff. Each professor at Blue Mountain cares about how you do in school and where you're going. I'm a business major and the motto of my advisor (the head of the department) is to chase the knowledge not the grade. He always wants to know that I'm actually learning things instead of memorizing for a test. They've added so many athletic programs. It small and it's an acquired taste but I love it and wouldn't trade schools.
College Freshman,4,We have a diversity of students that attend our college.  Many foreign students that come for the sports and business program.  Different religious or political views do not affect how a student is treated
College Freshman,4,"I feel totally safe while on campus.  We have security driving around 24/7 and they are there to help whenever you need them to.  The main security guard, Ricky, comes to check on any of us hanging out at the SUB late, and drives us back to our dorms after midnight so we don't have to go alone.  Everyone has the campus security number, and it never goes unanswered."
College Freshman,4,"If you major in any kind of teaching degree at school you have a great chance of getting a job.  We are known for our teaching degrees.  Every professor does their absolute best to help you acquire internships and jobs when the time comes.  The alumni is very active on campus, creating improvement projects and helping with fundraising.  I have not had to use the career center as of yet, but have met the woman in charge and she is a wonderful, Godly woman."
College Freshman,4,"Although the campus and it's facilities are old, the college tries to keep everything up to date.  Fixing anything that breaks, and fundraising to make any expensive repairs efficiently.  The aged building give the campus character.  The dorm rooms were clean when I moved in which is not a popular luxury I have found.  The room and board cost is fair and affordable.  One thing I like is that you can pick who your roommate and suitemates will be.  We are a small college so we do not have big arcade rooms, but we have lots of pool tables and ping pong tables to play at."
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is very important at my school.  Every student attends every possible home game and even some away games.  The college has been improving their athletic facilities and are doing a great job so far, still some work to do though."
College Senior,4,The teachers truly care about each student. They want you to succeed and help you strive to do your very best.
College Sophomore,4,"While there are improvements that needs to be made physically at Blue Mountain, my short experience at this college has taught me so much about myself. Most of the faculty are willing to help, eager to inspire, and anxious to further professionalism in their students. If Blue Mountain made some beautification elements, added more efficient academic facilities and technology, and created a less rivalrous atmosphere between contrasting departments. There is no doubt this would be the best institution in the nation. Students care about their community, each other, and campus... And many of the frustrations we have for BMC is because we want to see our institution thrive like we know it has the ability to."
College Sophomore,4,"We pride ourselves on academic excellence, and that is shown through the courses at blue mountain. Many of the classes are on a 5 point grading scale instead of a 10 point grading scale, and require a great deal of writing and studying. The professors are very qualified (even overqualified) and if you pay attention you will learn a lot."
College Sophomore,4,"I transferred late summer for the Fall 2014 term, so I missed the scholarship deadline, but I know many people who are on scholarship at BMC. One good thing about the scholarship program is that BMC gives out more scholarships than Oprah gives out new cars."
College Senior,4,"During basketball season, students are very supportive of the team and the gym is packed on game nights."
College Senior,4,I am an elementary education major. The program really does prepare for you a career as a teacher and ensures this is really what you want as a career as it provides multiple opportunities for observation and teaching experiences. The facilities have recently been redone and are very nice.
College Senior,4,"Easy paperwork to fill out for scholarships, but some scholarships did require some essays or letters of recommendation. Sometimes I did have to keep calling to ensure the funds were applied to my student account, but other than that, I had no issues."
College Senior,4,"For elementary education, students have many opportunities because local schools love BMC grads and know they will be well prepared to do their job well."
College Senior,4,"Very strict policies, but one should know this when coming to Blue Mountain College."
College Senior,4,The financial aid department are great to work with. 
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office is extremely helpful and open everyday. 
College Sophomore,4,No drugs or alcohol allowed. 
College Sophomore,4,The landlords are teachers of the school and keep the prices very high.)
College Sophomore,4,The weather stays on the warmer side but make sure you have rainboots or your shoes will be ruined. 
College Junior,4,Very great Christ oriented student body. Everybody is very encouraging (:
College Junior,4,"No greek life on campus, but BMC does have societies. There are 3 for women and 2 for men. "
College Junior,4,It's great for college students. They have something for everyone.
College Junior,4,"Spots usually fill up quickly, but there are ALWAYS places to park on campus. ALWAYS :)"
College Junior,4,Blue Mountain has all the basic necessities for a college student :) shopping and food.
College Junior,4,We have a computer lab with iMac Apple computers. It's really great.
College Junior,4,"I'm not a sports person, but everyone seems really involved at the games and very supportive of our teams. VERY supportive."
College Junior,4,"The campus is on a hill, and when it rains...need I say more? The rain flows down the hill like a river if it's pouring rain. It's ok though :) activities don't get canceled because of the rain :) the water doesn't accumulate into puddles really."
College Junior,4,No major crimes on campus and I feel very safe when walking on campus. 
College Junior,4,"BMC's small campus and close knit student body make it unique. The college's beliefs still stand strong today, and it is a great environment to further one's relationship with Christ. "
College Junior,4,"I personally did not face challenges getting into the program, but other students face the challenge of passing the Praxis I test. To be admitted, you must score at least a 21 on your ACT or pass the Praxis I. To student teach, you must pass the Praxis II. "
College Junior,4,"Elementary education majors have to be very committed to their major. There are a lot of responsibilities, including making lots of lesson plans and observation hours. "
College Junior,4,"The dorms on campus are great. I love the antique feel they have to them and how they allow you to feel more independent. Stevens is nicer than Whitfield, but both are great dorms."
College Junior,4,"Athletics at BMC are a big deal. Most students attend the games and events on campus. The gym is older, but it isn't a big deal. Intramurals are a lot of fun, and they're a fun way to get involved."
College Junior,4,I'm very satisfied with the education I am getting at BMC. The Elementary Ed program is known for having well prepared teachers and I am confident I can find employment after I graduate thanks to the education BMC provided for me.
College Junior,4,"Usually sunny, but the walk is not far for most classes on rainy days"
College Junior,4,The students participate in most athletics and the facilities are fairly nice. The games are well attended by most students and school spirit is high.
College Junior,4,"Usually sunny on campus, but classes are close if it is rainy."
College Junior,4,"Everyone is always nice and friendly. The dorms are mostly quiet and really cozy. It lets you feel independent. If you want someone in particular as a roommate, you will more than likely get that person as a roommate. If you don't have a preference, they'll match you up with someone that has similar interests as you or a similar major."
College Junior,4,"I received a ton of financial aid from BMC. It was an easy process, but I did stay on top of things, constantly following up with the financial aid office."
College Sophomore,4,There is no public transportation because the campus is so small. Walking is necessary and be ready for hills!
College Sophomore,4,It is a great Christian environment. The people are really kind and the professors genuinely care about the student;s well-being.
College Sophomore,4,"The process of getting into the Education program has some challenging requirements, but overall, a simple process."
College Sophomore,4,"Many students live on campus, but there are apartment options in Ripley."
College Sophomore,4,"BMC doesn't have greek sororities, but they have societies, which are really fun. There's 3 for females and 2 for males. They're a great way to get involved and make friends on campus."
College Sophomore,4,We have a very diverse school and everyone is very accepting of it.
College Sophomore,4,"Wants us to do our best in every aspect, but also can be tough when less than our best is given. The faculty and staff are very dependable and easy to talk to."
College Sophomore,4,Instructors Very Helpful – All of my instructors are very helpful and they are always easy to get in contact with via email.
College Junior,4,Pretty Easy – Becoming an English major wasn't hard. Basically after I took my pre-recs I declared my major and got an acceptance letter that my grades were good enough to get me into the program
College Junior,4,"Decent Group – There aren't any supermodels at BMC, but there is people from all walks of life. Literally every one has a place to fit in at this school. Most of the students are extremely casual and laid back. We are all interested in God, and having fun that still glorifies him."
College Junior,4,Not Fans of Drugs or Alcohol – I feel like there are drugs and alcohol present but the administration keeps it under control. Most of the students don't partake any way.
College Sophomore,4,Almost Perfect – I have never had a reason to feel unsafe at Blue Mountain. There are always 3 to 5 security guards on campus at night and during the day. Students are encouraged to be in the dorms before midnight and if not the doors are locked. The latest time anyone can be out on the campus is @ a.m. Students are also encouraged to walk in groups at night and the administration periodically review safety rules and guidelines.
College Sophomore,4,Not on the Radar – The drug scene at BMC isn't even existent. Most people usually smoke or drink but there are few people doings drug. Drinking and smoking dominate the campus the majority of the time.
College Freshman,4,"There is a building called Gallery which provides a fully functional kitchen, a big screen television, and a small work out facility. The Library is small, but the workers are very friendly and will help you find anything that you might need."
College Freshman,4,"It is almost always sunny. It rains sometimes. When it does rain, it RAINS HARD. Other than that everything it perfectly beautiful outside. :)"
College Sophomore,2,"The dinning hall staff tries really hard to create healthy meals. Notice I said ""tries"". While I appreciate the effort the cafeteria staff puts in to cooking meals, one can only have dry fish and chicken so many nights a week. Because the closest town is 15 minutes away (give or take), many students choose to stay on campus to eat. Ray Dinning Hall is the only meal option, however there has been speculation that in years to come another cafeteria/food option will be available to students and faculty."
College Freshman,2,"Tupelo is an hour away, and there still isn't much to do."
College Sophomore,2,The Secruity doesn't do much and we only have one nurse on staff.
College Junior,2,"No area attractions, but there is a Walmart and fast food restaurants not far from the college to fulfill basic needs. "
College Junior,2,"The campus is in need of improvement in the library. There are not many newer books. Students often hang out in the SUB, parlors, or outside when the weather permits. Many students attend basketball games during the season, and that's always fun. "
College Junior,2,"Not very diverse, but the campus is very accepting of international students. "
College Junior,2,"Typical fast food places like Taco Bell, McDonalds, Subway, and Sonic. Very convenient to campus. "
College Junior,2,"It's best to own your own computer, but the library does have some computers available and you can rent laptops from there."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus isn't the greatest. Spots can be hard to find, so if you find a good one, try to keep it!"
College Sophomore,2,Blue Mountian College needs help with their financial aid process. If you aren't a Southern Baptist you don't get as good of a scholarship as people who are Southern Baptist. They need more scholarship opportunities.
College Freshman,2,"Conservative Equals Okay – Blue Mountain College is a conservative Christian college so it does not do a lot of Greek letter organizations, but the housing for the various societies is just okay.  There is no real difference between those who have pledged and those who have not."
College Freshman,1,Parties don't exactly happen at school.  There are occasional bonfires that happen are off campus and few hear about them unless you are an athlete.  Most of the students who attend school are there for acedemics or sports therfore they are too busy to worry about parties
College Freshman,1,parties dont exactly happen at school.  There are occasional bonfires that happen that are off campus and few hear about them unless you are an athlete.  Most of the students who attend school are there for academics or sports therefore they are too busy to worry about parties.
College Sophomore,1,"Many people either love on campus or commute from home. While there are 4 apartments reserved for college students behind campus, many of them are rented by residents who are not students. There is an apparent village across the street from the campus, but it had a reputation of being very unsafe."
College Junior,1,"Dining hall food is improving this year, but fried chicken is a repetitive dish. There is a pizza bar and salad bar, but sometimes those are not good options either. "
College Sophomore,1,"Although this college has done many things to increase parking availability, the parking is still really bad. We have to drive around until we find a open spot on campus and could take us a while."

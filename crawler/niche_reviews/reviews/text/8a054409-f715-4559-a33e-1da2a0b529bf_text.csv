Niche User,5,"Throughout my application process, the Academy of Art has been the most helpful college from sending me program-specific information to scheduling me a one on one information tour about the school, programs, and financial aid."
Sophomore,5,"With the whole COVID-19, I understand students had to make a switch from on-campus classes to online classes which can be difficult. However, the Academy of Art was prepared for this since their online portal is easy to use and there is a help desk if you have any issues which come in handy. Additionally, there are resources accessible for students to help out with classwork."
Sophomore,5,"The online student portal is super easy to navigate and the professors provide timely feedback to any questions or comments you have about the class. Additionally, you are able to meet new people as an online student which is wonderful since you may be able to work together again in future classes."
Freshman,5,"I am an online only student taking synchronized classes as I could not afford to move from Texas to San Francisco while also being concerned about COVID numbers. The online learning experience for me has been made as simple and clear cut as possible by my professors and I commend them for handling such matters the way they have. Though we are all still learning and adjusting to this new form of education, each of my professors has been stupendously organized with their Zoom meetings and each assignment is always explained in our discussion topics, so I can view the requirements any time without confusion. I feel that I am easily able to follow along and have rarely been confused in the past month I have attended."
Freshman,5,"As an emerging artist, I really wanted to enroll in a school that would guide me on my journey to being successful and cultivate my skills to a professional level as I enter a largely competitive industry. I am so glad I chose the Academy of Art. The entire staff has been nothing short of wonderful, informative and helpful. I could not ask for better individuals to learn from. They are professional and passionate about helping all their students find their place in whatever industry they choose and are never not preforming their duties at their absolute best. I am only a freshman at this point in time but I can already feel that I am much farther along than what I would've been had I chosen to pursue art independently. The knowledge I have gained is invaluable and I can only imagine my progress at the end of the year, let alone as a graduate."
Freshman,5,"A very quick process to start and get enrolled. Within two weeks I was fully enrolled from starting my application, transcripts, and completing my FAFSA."
Freshman,5,AAU has been super friendly to work with. The staff and team is always very communicative and kind as well.

Freshman,5,"The Academy genuinely cares about your success. To them you are not another statistic, you're an investment. They call you every month to see how you are doing and remind you of all the services they offer to help make your experiences easier on you. The professors are always available to help you when you need it."
Freshman,5,"It is pretty simple to navigate. Before you start your first semester, they have you go through a workshop that teaches you how everything works. Ten out of ten would recommend."
Freshman,5,The staff is friendly and efficient. The teachers are always willing to help with whatever you may have problems with. The online portal is very easy to navigate.
Senior,5,The online experience is a lot easier than you would initially expect! As long as you keep yourself accountable and no your limits about course load anyone can be successful!
Freshman,5,"The online experience is amazing and organized. The instructors are very helpful to make sure you know where everything is also if you are new to online classes there are workshops that you can attend to help you understand how to check your grades, how to submit homework/assignments, how to check you student email basically everything you need to know about online classes. They will provide instructions on how things work. Instructors also encourage you to keep doing your work and to see how things are going as if you were in class face to face."
Freshman,5,"My experience overall with my school was amazing not just because I attend the school, but even when you first apply/ sign up they are so kind and caring. They work at the level that you are at to encourage you to achieve the goal that you are trying to reach. Instructors, Mentors,  and Advisors email you and call you to check how you are doing with classes and homework. I have not yet been to the school in person, however I can't wait to attend classes in person."
Freshman,5,The online program is the second best program in the nation. It makes it easy to learn and submit your assignments.

Freshman,5,"Every step of the way from my first phone call they are helpful, knowledgeable and caring.  Getting information when I was researching colleges was easy.  They took the time to get my goals and set a plan that was going to work for me.  Any questions I had or have I can count on them to answer in a timely manner.  The classes I am taking online are  easy to follow through the online portal or app on my phone.  Teachers and assistants are amazing and very hepful.  The content you are learning is useful and easy to digest.  Very pleased with my choice to enroll. Best decision I ever made!!"
Freshman,5,"All my classes are online.  There were tutorials and webinars that help guide you through how the online classes are structured.  The online classes are easy to follow. The work you need to have done weekly, the readings you are required are all loaded up and checked off as you complete.  You can go at your own pace which is nice if you work a full time job and fit your school schedule into your work schedule."

Niche User,5,Most of the discussions that took place were very engaging and appropriate. Most of my professors communicate very well and always give me feedback on my work.
Sophomore,5,AAU has one of the best online learning management platforms  I've ever seen. Very intuitive and personalized yet still connected virtually and seamlessly with the entire school system and campus. I am able to attend art shows virtually and submit work  as if I was in San Fransisco.
Sophomore,5,"Academy of Art has been wonderful. I wanted to go back to college after have 2 children, now in high school, and  finally get my degree. Academy of Art has made that possible with online classes and a robust and streamlined program."
Sophomore,5,I take 100% online courses and I would say that the majority of the time there are no issues with the material and coursework. Sometimes it is hard to get in touch and connect with the instructors in a meaningful way.
Freshman,5,"During my first semester at AAU I have learned so much more than I thought possible. The courses are challenging, but are doable and there is help available at any time. I am very eager to keep learning with AAU."
Freshman,5,I am strictly an online student and it has been a great experience for me. I can reach out for assistance at any time and I love that I can review the courses over and over if I need to. There are also great workshops to check out.

Senior,5,I liked how helpful the online community was. We were all able to support each other even though we've never met or seen each other in person. It was really awesome since we didn't get the on-campus experience.
Alum,5,The online platform that AAU uses is the best I have ever experienced.. They have their own platform and not a generic one that every other school uses like blackboard.. Im currently in another school for my masters that uses Canvas which is good but it can’t touch AAU’s online environment.
Freshman,5,Can’t wait to start fall 2020. Online class will be great. They have been great so far helping me through this process. Great experience so far.
Freshman,5,Can’t wait to start fall 2020. They have been great help so far get ready with financial aid and paperwork.

Freshman,5,Academy of Art University is extremely helpful and helps you grow in the career you like to continue in. they are respectful and considerate for your career.
Sophomore,5,"This institution is nothing but A+ all across the board!!  I have a disability and the staff and students have been 100% on top of making me feel safe and comfortable!

Senior,5,Learning online to be Academy of Art University has been challenging but successful at the same time in the online art history classes the teachers are always available and sometimes you get feedback that you really don’t want since Covid has happened and our normal classes have been moved online or teachers are always available we constantly have check in and we get the appropriate feedback that we need.
Senior,5,The staff is amazing and they actually care about the students. They are always there to give support and encourage us as we get stuck.
Freshman,5,Love this school can't wait to start I love playing video games now I can go to school to develop my own game and they help with getting a job with top gaming companies which is another great thing.i always love video game got my first on at age 18 months and been playing ever since.
Freshman,5,I haven't had a chance to start yet I start in June but Alex my advisor and Alice my financial aid advisor are great
Freshman,5,I appreciated that the school accepted me without having a portfolio or prior experience in my degree type. They really work with you to get all you need for each class and ensure your success
Freshman,5,"Academy of Art University has provided all the information I could and would possibly need in terms of furthering my education with them. I have spoken with many people there and all reviews of the information they have given me, all the calls, and helping me in what would be best in the long run. Although I am taking online courses, the school still makes me feel as if I am there."
Freshman,5,The academy of art University is an amazing school for learning about any type of art. I am doing a BFA in fashion styling. The fashion programme is amazing and is said to be on of the best fashion schools in America. My experience so far has been wonderful.
Freshman,5,Admissions walked me through an on line view of courses & resources. I’m comfortable that I’ll receive an equally good education as if I were physically attending on campus.
Freshman,5,This school is quite amazing actually. I am enrolled in the online Graphic Design major. The classes are very simple to maneuver and the instructors are very helpful. The classes are very interactive and intuitive. I love how you are easily able to communicate with other classmates. Overall love this school.
Niche User,5,"I have been an online student for pre college in academy of art university and so far I’ve had a wonderful experience. They are flexible and they have all the art programs you can think of. You can even specify what classes to go in to help you get to your dream job, and they guarantee you will have a job after you graduate."
Senior,5,"The Academy of Art is a highly prestigious art school that unlike others, accepts everyone if you have the money for it. The classes are often extreme and really push you to your limits in order to achieve professional level work. Sometimes instructors are harsh and often cruel, but others are extremely friendly and supportive. I often have rocky periods due to the workload and stress involved but I do not regret my time at AAU, I can see massive improvements from when I first started and know AAU is preparing me for my future career in the best way."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved every minute of learning so far at AAU. The teachers are quality and have high expectations. It really pushes you to produce quality work at an exceptional level. I've learned so much that I would have never of been able to self teach. I'm strictly an online student but the online learning is so immersive. As a student who has participated in online learning in the past, AAU's online platform has been a great experience."
Freshman,5,"What I like about AAU, is how they keep in touch with you making sure you are on track and getting the help you need. They are kind and positive, when talking to the staff I feel that they are really listening  to my question and taking them seriously. You don't have to wait for a day or two to have someone help you, I feel like I am in capable hands and look forward to attending Academy of Art University."
Sophomore,5,"The online courses are of great learning quality that definitely exceeded my expectations. In general, the modules are informative and provide great real-world examples that assist in completing assignments and contributing to discussion. I would like to see instructors more involved during the modules whether it be through discussion topics or providing feedback."
Sophomore,5,Academy of Art University has been extremely helpful with any questions and necessary guidance. Everyone I have been in contact with has been very friendly and welcoming as a new student.
Freshman,5,Academy of Art was the only school to me that helps me the most. This school has more opportunities to better your future.
Niche User,4,"I've taken some online pre-college classes with the Academy and it's been amazing! The professors are nice, understanding, and most importantly experienced."
Senior,4,The professors are wonderful and the online experience is almost as good as the campus i believe. Art school is definitely expensive but getting the fundamentals and know how are irreplaceable.
Freshman,4,It was very easy applying to the school and the counselors are always there to help with any questions and concerns. The school is very nice and the faculty as well. There is a process to transfer to that school but it doesn’t take long. I was able to sign up for classes easy and quick.
Freshman,4,"My online experience was easier than I thought it was going to be. Request information and I was able to sign up for classes and I was able to get in contact with counselors who guided me and showed me how the semester was going to work online. The reassured that when I take classes online 
I would still learn in full extent and have full feedback from my instructors. Most of the cost of tuition goes down and it costs less to take classes online than in person. The school offers a lot of options for payment and other option for financial aid as well as how your going to take classes and what you would need."
Sophomore,4,"I like the fact that we have online courses available to students. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to attend this school. I think the school as a whole is great and has wonderful opportunities. I look forward to continuing to learn here and get my degree. I just wish the instructors who are assigned to the class were the ones speaking in the videos in the modules to help assess them as teachers instead of having courses already made beforehand."
Graduate Student,4,I think it's one of the best online learning experience in terms of academic and social festivals and shows as well. It's as interactive as on campus.
Graduate Student,4,The adivisor and instructor are very helpful and genuine. I really like the time distribution of a class and involvement of the students and the instructor.
Alum,4,"The online environment is amazing, the best I have experienced. The teachers are hit and miss.. I had some amazing teachers who worked at places like Nike and they were patient and would work with you to get you better.. some teachers are clueless and focused on things that didn’t mater to the overall project.. not to mention I know from experience and with confirmation from others with their Ph.D and knows business and marketing (which we touch upon in classes) that some teachers were dead wrong in with their critiques .. not all teachers, but I had more of these duds than I should have.. I had a few teachers that were really knowledgeable in what they did but they were so proud that they were harsh and even had tones of “your stupid” in their comments.. looking at the ratemyprofessors site helped me with one teacher because I saw it wasn’t just me, she made us all feel stupid and less than."
Freshman,4,What I like about academy of arts university is the opportunity's you get once you start with them..
Freshman,4,the online experience is good for me but I guess it easier for me because I did online high school so it wasn't hard for me to adjust.
Sophomore,4,"I am online... So far the teachers here have been much more helpful, communicative, and less robotic than other online schools have been, but the advisors themselves don't seem to be especially knowledgeable or helpful."
Niche User,4,"I like the Academy of Art university because it gets you ready for your career.
Also its the only art school with a athletic program."
Graduate Student,4,"I haven't started classes yet but the faculty are working artists, the technology is too of the line, the programs seem robust, alumni are very skilled, and their admissions and financial aid people are very helpful. It's also very expensive."
Freshman,4,Teachers are mostly helpful but some are really tough and seem like they don't understand their own assignments.
Junior,4,"i have only looked at the package i have received , and i worried i will not be able attend due to money issues"
Niche User,4,The representatives for the school are very friendly and care a lot about the students they help. Very detailed supply lists and easy ways to get them.
Freshman,4,I would like to see more financial aid help. They have a ton of relevant resources and are very helpful. You never have to be afraid of asking questions
Freshman,4,I have really enjoyed my time at the Academy of Art. I feel like I have grow as an artist and as a person. The staff are amazing at fostering your creative while giving constructive criticism to help you improve you artistic eye.
Niche User,4,Academy of Art is truly an amazing university who takes the time to build connections with there students and help them develop their artistic abilities.
Freshman,4,They have a good arts program for the summer. At first I was scared about doing the program as a junior in high school. But the staff in the admissions office made me very comfortable and reassured me everything would be fine. I met some good friends through the chatroom. My family also liked the program and I am thinking about doing it again over the summer.
Junior,4,very professional. they have me working on a real set with teachers already in then industry or are industry vets
Freshman,4,"As an online student, one of my main concerns was to make sure I still have hands-on experience at school. The curriculum at the Academy of Art has a strong online community and the assignments allow students to venture out into the world to do your classwork."
Senior,4,"I like the teachers and the location of the school, however it is very expensive to live/commute here. There isn't enough financial assistance."
Sophomore,4,I love living in the city there is so many interesting things to do and see. I would however like better options for food at the cafe or more access to a kitchen.
Sophomore,4,"A bit on the pricey side, but since I'm an online student I can't complain about city costs.  I love the online school, and being able to go to school in my own home.  The classes are engaging and you learn something new every time you log on.  The instructors are here to teach you about the industry and to help you succeed however they can."
Freshman,4,I am an online student however the courses provided are very well put together and helpful. I am planning to receive my BFA in motion pictures and television. I would like to attend on campus in the next year or two.
Junior,4,"This school provides its online students with a great staff of student advisors and teachers, and an incredible variety of classes to choose from. I would highly recommend it for students who are interested in using their artistic abilities to develop a career."
Senior,4,"Academy of Art University is a very unique college experience, one of the most unique experiences you will get to experience. The campus is an urban campus, so you are really immersed into the city culture and get to know your way around fairly quickly. 

The university itself has had a very impactful role in my education, in that it focuses directly on the particular major you wish to pursue. From day one, I was immersed into architecture, building models and learning the proper techniques to draft as well as the needed information to fully understand the role an architect plays. 

Along with school I also got the opportunity to play Softball for the school. This gave me a completely different view of the school and gave me the liberty to get to know other athletes who were taking some very interesting majors different from my own."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Academy of Art University, it's been good experience. I really like how you can choose online or on-site classes that fit accordingly to your schedule. The instructors and advisors are really caring and supportive in helping you develop the skills necessary for your major through the whole process."
Freshman,4,I am an online student and have learned a lot from my instructors.  I have received good feedback and positive coaching from them as I improve my skills in my field.
Junior,4,The online classes are flexible. Tuition is expensive and keeps rising. I would like to see it go down.
Freshman,4,"The quality of experience is with the Instructors. They are real executives and real Producers and real Writers. No phony baloney instructors with nothing to prove they have actually worked in films, created them, directed them, wrote the feature or the television show. This semester one of my teachers is Nana Greenwald who worked at Disney as Development Producer, at Industry Entertainment as Executive Producer, at Kopelson Entertainment as Vice President from 1989-95 & 97-2001 as President of Creative Affairs where she produced ""Don't say a Word"" ""A Perfect Murder"" ""Seven"" ""Outbreak"" ""The Fugitive"" ""Falling Down"" and too many films to mention here."
Sophomore,4,I like the student to teacher ratio. All my classes were very small. No more than 15-20 students which allowed me one on one time with my teacher.
Junior,4,"My experience at Academy of Art University has been good so far, the classes have taught me a lot, I have had some really great teachers. I really enjoy that most of the classes I've taken have been hands on and been exactly what the description of the class is. Something that I would like to see a change in is the advisory system, it seems like advisors are constantly leaving and I constantly have a new advisor, every time I talk to my advisor its someone new. It would be nice to have an advisor I can build a relationship with that I can trust. They all recommend different things and are very pushy so when I try to explain that my last advisor recommended something different and I would like to stick with it, they usually tell me that it's not the best idea and to go with something different so I think if they changed that everything would be a lot easier and less frustrating."
Alum,4,The school provides all the necessary resources for opportunities when you graduate. You have mentors when need. There are sports to keep you active. Instructors try their best to help you when you are serious about improvement and success.
Freshman,4,So far it has been fairly good. The classes are smaller than expected but that makes things more personal and allows us to meet and talk to each other better. The professors show a genuine interest in what they teach. The students can be a mixed bag of determination and slackers so that can be difficult to deal with.
Sophomore,4,"It allowed me the flexibility to manage my own time. It was one of the few in the nation that provided the industrial design education fully online. This is great because I can save on housing, transportation, lab fees, etc. The only thing that gets me sometimes is the way different teachers organize the lessons. When student read what is asked of them it may be difficult to understand. We may have to wait for a reply to a question and get an answer a few days later. Although the benefit of online is that everything is recorded and can be looked back on until you graduate (feedback, lessons, clarifications, notes). Most importantly, I am learning something new and it challenges my thinking. Those of you who are straight out of high school and consider going straight to AAU with no experience in arts and design, this will be a huge change. It is advanced and you had better be prepared for more work than you expect and more challenges."
Sophomore,4,"Great School but to expensive for me to attend. Its the only school i found that has actual Online Cinematography classes. Every other school offers ""Film"" studies but you dont create anything, you just critique and watch films. With AAU you are tasked to create things regardless if you are a resident or Online student. But i had to drop out because the cost is too much."
Senior,4,"This school gives every student a real opportunity in world of art. No portfolio was needed to get in.  Academy of Art runs a strong campaign for high school students who have interest in art but don’t know much about it. They offer to lead and help you take your first steps in the world of art. A lot of students drop out and express feeling as if they were robbed. I could see where they’re coming from but I disagree. As a student, responsibility should be taken for big decisions like enrolling into a school. There is no false advertising with this school. They offer what they say they offer and then some. I believe that as long as you have real interest & want to learn more, the Academy helps you start your journey. There is no sense of puffed up pride or exclusivity that comes with the school, they are willing to start you from the ground up and work with you."
Freshman,4,"So far my brief time with Academy of Art has been excellent. They have worked with me and helped me to get stuff done and ready to start college on time and the people are very caring and supportive. So far there is nothing I would want to change about this school, I like it just the way it is."
Junior,4,Being at the academy was good overall but it lacked its own campus which i was highly disappointed because you had to travel distances to get to another building located around the busy streets of san francisco bumping into many homeless and people.
Freshman,4,So far I've only attended The Academy of Arts University online classes for about 2 months now and I honestly only have nice things. The instructors are very attentive making sure you understand the curriculum and will keep you  updated on all assignments and events.
Senior,4,"I like that they are very helpful of getting into my classes and let use most of my transfer credits to fully complete my degree which will be recived this fall.  They have very great core classes and instrutors who are very helpful. There are a couple of things I would complain is that the school charges extra to use the classroom but the tuition would not cover which is reason I decided to do online courses which is more cheaper. Secondly, I wish they would more scholarships for currents students to get rewarded for having good grades. Overall, the school have very great resources for students to use."
Senior,4,The academy of art university Is a Great school for Student that know what they want to do. its a great place to get a good understanding of different art majors and being in the city of San Francisco with the huge artistic population only makes your experience better.
Freshman,4,"The school is great, its a 100%  a art school for artist . the teachers are people that work in their profession at compaines like Disney, Blizzar, etc.and they treat (as well as teach) the students just like a actual day at art studio job  under your major would feel like. You meet all types of people from all over the world, and even have roomates that are different from your major. the campus is spread throughout the city, but luckily there are complentary shuttles that are schuduled every hour to get you to your classes on time. This school is very unqiue, the city is your campus -as well as your teacher- and it will help prepare your for the future  However it is VERY exspensive. If you plan on lving in San fransico it would be wise to save money, have a side job, and/or get tons of finacial aid/scholarships. there are time were art supplies will cost you a arm and a leg. ( even with student discounts)"
Junior,4,"Academy of Art University is a really good school for international students, and it located in wonderful SF. Although there is high tax in SF, weather is very comfort for everyone. In my opinion, professors are really professional in their fields, and all of them are still work vivid in business."
Graduate Student,4,"Well organized and helpful. Once you're in it, they're helpful along the way. There's a very open and accepting community. It's hard work but well worth the time."
Junior,4,"I'm currently a student and I must admit that at first I wasn't a huge fan of the program. I signed up for the Animation (Modeling) path and for the first year I felt like I was lost. But being so close to graduation I understand why I had to take so many fundamental classes and advanced modeling ones later. If you're looking for something easy, this industry isn't for you. I have learned a lot from so many talented artists in the past years and I say the money is worth it, only if you plan to work harder than anyone else. I say the only downfall is that some instructors aren't as experienced and it may affect your passion for your chosen career path, but it is just about knowing who to take certain classes with and talking to the student reps. Everyone says that there are better schools, but I say it's not about the name of the school is what you make out of it. I have seen people succeed, peers, friends, etc. It is possible, just work hard."
Alum,4,"Very creative and talented school. Full of energy and fun people. Extremely talented people. Majority of teachers are very skillful. During my time, they got rid of the career department, so that big disappointment. School admin department and student services not so great. Cost of tuition is expensive. Expensive location. Finding a good paying job after graduation is a challenge. Like the workshops. Getting a mentor - sometimes not. Too many students, chances of being left out is high. Risky degree."
Junior,4,"From day one, you will be able to learn much more than you already knew about your career choices. The instructors are professionals and teachers within their specialized areas."
Sophomore,4,"The tuition is a bit pricey, but the teachers are all industry professionals who know what they're doing and are eager to teach others what they know and how to improve their student's abilities.  I'm an online student, and I can tell you that the online set up is great and easy to use.  You can access everything right from your computer, and getting a hold of your teachers and classmates is right at your fingertips.  Sometimes I wish I could access my classes a bit faster after logging in, but I understand why the site is set up the way it is."
Sophomore,4,"The dorms are a little rough, and they're super strict. My classes and professors really teach and seem to care about the students. I've enjoyed the time I've had here and the athletic program is remarkable as well, with many of the teams being nationally ranked! They're a lot of fun to watch."
Niche User,4,"The staff is nice and very helpful. The facilities are very well spread out and accessible. The props and stages for the acting students are absolutely amazing. The students in general, attending the college, are all very nice and dedicated like myself."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently studying to get a BFA in Animation & VFX. I've liked the experience so far, I wish the class were a little more demanding and that the campus wasn't spread all over the city."
Freshman,4,I’m a fully online Student at the academy. I’ve been in school for a short time there but so far I love it. I love being able to learn around my schedule. And the entire process was quick applying and then getting started. The professors are knowledgeable. And it’s and interesting environment learning with people all over the country.
Freshman,4,"The enrollment process for online is time consuming with all the information that's needed. There is a non refundable enrollment and application fee. I'm excited to start class, I have to purchase art supplies out of pocket. I will receive a refund two weeks after my start date."
Freshman,4,I study online only. The instructors are great a provide lots of feedback. I've had some issues getting a hold of the financial aid department but once I got a hold of them they were very helpful.
Senior,4,"Good school, they do invest in equipment every year. Some mandatory classes they have are unnecessary or not helpful for the specific major."
Junior,4,The school is some of the hardest work I’ve ever had to do in my life and it’s crushing at times. After every semester I can see my progress but it’s cut throat and if you see yourself as an average artist or feel yourself to be even slightly sensitive about your abilities you will break a lot. Your teachers are industry professionals who are in no way shape or form dishonest and are as blunt as can be with critique. You will be tossed into classes with a mix of either people who are prodiges or have 5+ years of experience on you. The work is brutal and requires the utmost dedication or you will fall below satisfactory expectations. I’ve struggled since my second semester and every semester just gets harder and harder.
Freshman,4,"My experience is going well, so far. The classes aren’t as difficult as they may seem, but your passion in whatever you major in will overcome the amount of work you are given. I haven’t really been to a party, but people have told me that the parties are nice! We have food around each building, so it’s different options to choose from. Some of the buildings are super far apart, so catching the shuttle is really a important. The professors are great though! It’s a great school!"
Alum,2,"The online courses are poor.  I took History of Fashion online and it's mostly just reading modules, so you're basically teaching yourself."
Alum,2,"I attended this school from 09'-13' both online and in person.  The school is ridiculously expensive so I would find another school as there are many that would provide the same or maybe better level of education for what you pay. Many of the instructors are good and what you learn is all great stuff...but there's a tendency for them to favor a certain style of work. If you take a look at many of the graduating portfolios, they are pretty much the same. I believe the school just takes advantage of students financially as most the students are international students. Unless you're rich, find another program to join...because you WILL regret it. I know this because myself and every classmate that I had that completed the program or not feels the same way.  The school is not very diverse. A lot of international Asian students and white students. It's a miracle if you see another race there."
Sophomore,2,"I feel like attending this academy was more a waste of money  (financial aid) rather than a waste of time. I have attended this ""university"" for 5 years and have a total of 132 (82 hours with AAU) and I still do not have my BFA and was told I still wouldn't have this for 3 more years. I have learned a lot from classes at this school but I feel like a lot of classes were bogus and just there to be a charge for financial aid.  On top of that I was paying out-of-pocket and again, still got no where. Now that I want to finish my degree at another school, I am out of financial aid."
Junior,2,"I have been taking classes online at AAU for over a year now. I am a graphic design major. A LOT of the work overlaps in the classes, which makes my assignments boring and monotonous.  The online program strikes me  unorganized and unprofessional. For example, I am actually writing this review because I am only 4 weeks into this semester and my professor has already changed 3 times in one class. Last semester, I had an instructor who copy and pasted the same feedback to every student in the class."
Junior,2,"Very poor treatment for the international students. No grants, no scholarship, but you're forced to buy the insurance if you are in F-1 visa or domestic student but athletics. The tuition goes up every single year while nothing getting better."
Niche User,2,"I think that it is a great idea that everyone can be artists etc, but with a 100% acceptance rate, the student body is at very different levels when starting at AAU. I think language and placement tests would be a great thing for AAU to start with."
Sophomore,2,"I would give this school a higher review, however between the cost and amount of time the school offers as for classes, make it rather difficult to continue studying here."
Freshman,2,"Absolutely bad college experience. This ""university"" has poor student body quality and most people cannot graduate within four years of study. Most of the courses have the online version makes the course worthless. You could finish your degree online... Don't waste your money unless you are pretty sure you can graduate from one of its best ranked major. By the way, the school of MPT (film) is poorly managed. Many students drop off school during the first semester. Poor academics. "
College Junior,2,They review your financial aid with you. What they don't review is the charges they will charge for dropping a class for another. They're not on top of the financial aid like they should be.
College Freshman,2,Academy of Art is worth it but extremely expensive
College Freshman,2,Everything is so damn expensive. From charging you for not having the floor nice and sparkly clean to being charged for a refrigerator you never used. Also the tuition fees are more expensive with course fees. They all charge $400-20 depending on the class. For example a computer class such as 3D productions will come with a course fee of $400 same with sculpture $400. Now a liberal arts class like english will be $20. Where does the $20 go to????
College Sophomore,2,"Because AAU is not a traditional campus there are less places to run into classmates, the dorms are not friendly to people who do not live there, and the clubs are hardly active. The student body has rare events and usually poorly advertise them. You mostly meet friends through class that you go to once or twice a week, so much not interaction. Also, because the workload is pretty heavy, there is no such thing as parties, etc. If you are looking for that tradition college experience, you won't find it at AAU."
College Sophomore,2,"Tuition is very expensive and doesn't cover classes, which are also extremely expensive and charged separate. The education is worth the money but at the same time, i'd say the same thing if it were a few thousand dollars less, which would make and my parents much happier. On top of tuition, dorms, meal plans, and classes they try to squeeze out every dime with costs with mac labs and fines with rooms. Financial aid is often given and asked of for probably every student."
College Sophomore,2,"Considering I am in a two-year program, the cost per credit hour is pretty costly. I selected this school because of it's rating and reputation in the field that I am pursuing, but I was hoping there would be more scholarship or funding assistance options through the school. I really want this degree, but as a working adult with LOTS of financial responsibilities, this is proving to be difficult."
College Sophomore,2,"So far, this school does not help with any type of job prospects or internship.  With the internship program, the student is the one that has to locate a company/firm to internship with, not the school.  Thats horrible and it puts more pressure on the student."
College Sophomore,2,The tuition at the academy is very high and some of the courses that are core courses are sometimes unecessary
College Senior,2,fees are way too high!
College Senior,2,"The prices of the academics offered, and tuition is crazy expensive."
College Freshman,2,"I find that the tuition is a lot especially for being an online student. I find that I could be paying the same amount for a dorm, tuition, and attending classes on campus at a different university."
College Sophomore,2,"My credits didn't transfer because the school is so set on their curriculum that no other credits from other schools are good enough. It's another way to get more money out of you. It really sucks. If you come here, make it your first choice and stick with it."
College Junior,2,"Its a private school which means it costs A LOT and the only scholarship program they provide is one in the summer if only you are taking summer classes and have already certain amount of credits. Financial aide doesnt even cover a whole one class, only a third of it."
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of people who perpetuate there own stereotypes at this school ands its VERY uncomforting sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,its very expensive considering you learn very little starting out then get more advanced
College Sophomore,2,"The tuition is extremely high, but the school is great"
College Sophomore,2,they tried to make me retake a class that i recieved an A in
College Sophomore,2,"I am currently trying to transfer to a college that is in my home state, and the problem I am facing is not many places offer classes that would be transferable with ones I have already taken. Which means, right now I have only found colleges that except 3 of the 8 classes I have taken and passed."
College Sophomore,2,"They don't have their own athletic facilities, which is a downside. The library shouldn't be called a library, so if you thought about checking out books to read in your free time, don't bother. There is really little to no school spirit for such a large campus, and student body, there aren't any activities that bring everyone together, and that's another downside to this university."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are in low par condition, four people can end up sharing a room suited for two people at most. The pictures on the website are out of date. The library isn't what you would expect a liberal arts college to have, it was more of a room with a very limited number of computers and a limited collection of textbooks. For someone who would enjoy being able to read anything when they have free time, I was very disappointed. Due to the location of most of the campus buildings, being in downtown San Francisco, there isn't really any green space at all."
College Senior,2,could be a lot better!
College Sophomore,2,"Tuition is expensive. It costs about $40000 to go here if you live in the dorms and there's no financial aid whatsoever for international students which makes no sense considering the fact that this school is largely made up of internationals. We're probably about 70% of the student body if not more.  They've also stopped offering on campus jobs to internationals as well which is ridiculous because we're the ones that aren't allowed to get off campus jobs so we should be first to get on campus jobs but we're not provided that opportunity at all so mostly we pay out of pocket or get a private loan or scholarship. Personally, my parents pay every cent out of pocket and I think that's more than a little unfair. Housing is also pretty overpriced. The academy can afford to charge a little less considering the number of buildings they own and the fact that there's no shortage of students to fill up those buildings. In a city like San Francisco that has been said to be the most expensive city to live and rent in in the states, getting an apartment shouldn't be cheaper than living in the dorms but sadly, it is. I'm currently renting a one bedroom apartment 3 blocks from my old dorm and paying less here splitting rent with my flat mate than I did sharing one room with someone else in the dorm with no kitchen."
College Sophomore,2,"Computer labs are okay, printing cost money and wireless internet connection sucks."
College Freshman,2,The educations are great but too expensive for the housing and I find that its too bad that the tuition keeps rising every year. My only disappointment about this school. It is expensive enough to get supplies for each semester.
College Senior,2,very expensive.cut down buses and use toward class
College Sophomore,2,"I like work with real people and see them, and talk. Online courses it's good idea and I like them somehow but we are not able to work in this same real time, we need to wait for answers."
College Senior,2,Our major is confused about whether they want to be journalism heavy or just multiplatform storytelling in general.
College Senior,2,"Depending on your major you may have computer labs available to you. For the price we pay, they should be available for everyone."
College Senior,2,"The curriculum feels very repetitive. Within the first two years, you've learned almost all you need to know."
College Senior,2,"Our online system needs to be restructured ASAP. I have never had an enjoyable online experience. If you're headed to this school, I recommend you take on campus courses."
College Student,2,They aren't straight forward and the sight they use to show your finance is extremely confusing. Calling admins is not effective at all. They're usually away from the phone and don't answer.
College Junior,2,It is very weak for a school that has so many people in attendance
College Sophomore,2,I can never get any real help in this area
College Freshman,2,"There is not a whole lot of campus life. The campus is spread out throughout the city of San Francisco. There aren't a whole lot of centralized hang out/study spots. The library is decent, but most books can't be checked out. The have to be read in the library."
College Freshman,2,"Where do I even start. This school has basically zero scholarships. You have to rely entirely on federal aid and third-party scholarships. Which sucks because this school is super expensive. That being said, if you end up being successful at your craft, you'll be able to pay it back. But if you can't finish your degree? Then may god help you."
College Junior,2,"Hardly any of my credits transferred, which is a huge inconvenience since I completed 3 years towards my BFA at the San Francisco Art Institute and they only took into consideration my Liberal Arts credits and none of my arts credits of which I had hundreds, so now I need to spend an additional 3-4 years in school to complete my degree. Ridiculous."
College Student,2,There should be more financial aid for military families. The tuition is steep.
College Sophomore,2,"I found out after starting school here that I would not be able to transfer any liberal arts classes from another school if I went in the future. I'm not sure if this is normal. I guess they only transfer credits you've obtained prior to attending school. The teachers and faculty aren't all that flexible, due to their strict policies. "
College Sophomore,2,"Because it's a for-profit art school it is extremely expensive. I'm enjoying my time here, but I'm not sure it's worth the cost. I guess I won't know for sure until I'm done with the program and find out if my school experience will help me land a good job. I'm hoping I can find scholarships to help."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus groups often host their own events but they don't always coordinate with each other which means one doesn't often know about a campus activity or athletic event until the very day of or a few days after when the flyers are finally posted. Certain gyms are closed off in the dorms so that even if you live in the building you can use the facilities. The shuttles are poorly timed. 

However, the student centers are very accommodating and the library is ideal for a quiet and serious work space."
College Sophomore,2,"This grade is based upon the last two semesters i've been at the academy. Prior to these last two semesters, my experience at the academy were awesome. However, I feel that the quality of the school as well as the teaching level, has gone down. The classroom sizes are getting too large, making it difficult to understand demos from knitwear/CDFP instructors. Some instructors, I don't feel have the right amount of knowledge to be teaching at the academy, and are not inspiring. My experience here is just going down and I am looking to transfer out into another college. A college that I can get more out of my learning experience."
College Junior,2,"There are not that many clubs on campus that are beneficial to build a resume, but there are fun ones! The campus is located right in the middle of San Fransisco! There is a lot to see and do in between classes."
College Sophomore,2,"I think AAU has done well with the campus resources. The labs and library are helpful and almost never full. There is always some kind of campus activity going on. The classrooms have what they need. I've been in a few different environments: a fine art room, a drafting room, and a digital room. They all had what we needed. Although, I did hear that the school was cutting the recreational classes and our trips to fund the sports teams..."
College Junior,2,It's disappointing because not all the teachers are dedicated to the classes. I've had teachers who post the same responses and critiques to every single student. It makes you wonder if they even look over your work.
College Junior,2,"Don't go to this school unless you're prepared to spend the rest of your life with an empty wallet and a trail of debt behind you. The tuition is outrageous, 10 grand for ONE semester, not including housing or the materials and books required for classes. It's honestly an exploitation of those who want to pursue art as a career. Though the experience at this school is unlike any other. The teachers are industry professionals and the material you learn is everything you need to learn to have a successful career. Bring down the tuition to an affordable level, and then I'll give the school and A."
College Senior,2,"I like the education that I'm getting,but it's proven to be extremely expensive for me, I am going to keep going for as long as I can get the loans and FAFSA because it's worth it."
College Senior,2,"In a nutshell there are limited resources for online students it seems,but then again I think it depends on what it is your looking for."
College Junior,2,Since the graduation rate is so low for a 4 year plan its very difficult to have financial aid support us due to the fact that we only get so much help. I transferred from a community college and it had only accepted 1 year of classes for from my two year term. Even with help from my community college it is still taking me 6 years to graduate.
College Sophomore,2,"I was really excited to begin online classes, looking forward to the challenges, as well as the not having to worry about parking or traveling across town. Student/Professor interaction is okay but there are areas that need to improve, especially with technical issues that arise, or aren't covered. Registration is easy, but not having a live person to help you pick the right classes can be frustrating, I don't like classes that don't allow you to turn in work late, if you fall behind for any reason catching up can be a real headache."
College Freshman,2,I get a lot of help with my financial aid which is great! But... it is still not enough to pay off being a full time student at my school. The class price are going up year by year! Also I heard the school might not qualify for CAL Grants which could hurt my money situation a lot.
College Freshman,2,"I don't feel that the value of the education is worth the tuition and the supplies. The one thing I hate the most is that unlike most schools, they don't let you use your financial aid to pay for books and supplies out of your student account. You have to wait until you're refunded the extra aid 2 weeks later and for a lot of the art classes, I didn't even use half the supplies or books I was required to buy. They weren't even used in any of the curriculum. There is a big lack of scholarships too, they basically expect you to take out student loans."
College Freshman,2,"The tuition at this school is outrages! It really makes me feel a bit torn becuase I completely love the classes, I love the coursework, I've seen some real improvement in my skill as an artist, but... I have fallen in such a financial hole I pray hard that it's all worth it. The financial aid is barley enough to cover part time classes and this year I've had to pay $842 out of pocket for EACH semester. Becuase the workload can get intense I only have time for a part time job so I really don't have that kind of money :( It's made me start thinking about attending a different school, even, but I haven't found one with the major that I am interested in (illustration)."
Alum,1,"Academy of Art University seemed appealing with promises of networking throughout your schooling experience and counselors there to guide you to success in a competitive industry. In addition, the ability to attend online made it convenient to attend from anywhere, rather than having to relocate. However, they are NOT in it for the student's best interest. They lie about graduation rates, they lie about enrollment. In fact, it came out that admissions held contests of who could enroll the most and win vacations. Their pursuit of profit became evident to me in the fall of 2010. I was due with my first baby and coupled with a full time job, I expressed wanting to take a semester off to figure out how to juggle motherhood and work first, then adding in school in the spring. My advisor assured me I could just do lecture based courses, which I agreed to try. Sure enough, it was too much when baby came. I wanted to simply transfer everything to the next semester but could not without more $"

Alum,1,"Get away!  Don't attend if you enrolled, get your money back.  RUN.  Look at the complaints on the Better Business Bureau website. This place is not accredited.  They will not give you a diploma.  They will take your money!"
Senior,1,"Stop prioritizing profits over the quality of education and maybe the school will improve. Teachers are so unprofessional and disrespectful. They school could really care less if these people can teach before they teach a class. One of my teachers couldn't even figure out how to turn on a computer or tv screen and I had to do it everyday. On top of everything I dislike at this school, they also won't provide you with the resources you need to be successful. I have truly wasted my time and money attending this school. They say they are a respected university, but trust me everyone knows its not or at least no longer is."
Junior,1,"Don't come here.  It used to be a decent school, but no longer is.  The photography department is a joke.  They got rid of most of the full time faculty that actually knew what they were doing and have hired techs and alumni as instructors.  So the people teaching you are people with no teaching experience and minimal real world photography experience.  The education is non-existent.  You'd spend less and learn more going to real photography workshops and watching online tutorials.  If I wasn't already invested more than half way through the BFA program I'd leave.  But trust me when I say it's bad.  Enrollment is so low they are cancelling classes that don't meet a minimum of ten students registered which is very difficult.  That means there are very few options of available onsite classes for third year and upper level students.  Save yourself the cash and headache and avoid AAU at all costs."
Freshman,1,"Don’t take courses online. It’s way too expensive especially since most of this stuff (if not everything) can be taught through YouTube for free or you can use Lynda.com for free if you have a library card. Plus your teachers take a really long time to grade your homework. I’ve completed the homework for the current week and have already posted it and the teacher will critique after the fact. 

The tuition is way too high for this school. Next semester will be close to $1000 per credit. That’s ridiculous if I’m literally teaching myself to do everything with little critique from professors. You might be better off going to a community college that offers the degree of your choice. 

I honestly feel like I put myself in debt for no reason. This is a school for profit, education is secondary to them. Don’t believe the fake reviews on here. Look on a bunch of other college review sites and they’ll tell you the same."
Freshman,1,"All they need and do care about is money. What they do is just stealing people’s money and time. They dont care about educate students. All they do care about is money, money, money,"
Junior,1,"I enjoyed the city and the friends I made. It's quite unique. They have classes others don't which are good, but some have BOGUS YOUTUBABLE curriculums and material that your advisor might recommend. I was told how to shake hands and greet someone, sew a straight 4 inch line on a standard machine, that BOGO is a great way to increase amount of units sold. Triple DUH! SO be absolutely skeptical of your admission/academic advisor. The 2 years I was told I'd finish in became 4. A professor thought I should learn to scrapbook the AAU way. It.was. ridiculous. A passionate teacher would've just helped me get on same pg and on w my life...I should've left but I'd moved to sf. There are countless shared stories similar to this amongst students across majors & have been lawsuits in the past...They're good at their PR. I wish I knew. Fashion students who want a free fashion show, you compete for this incentive and your designs are not completely up to you. Beware"
Alum,1,Graduated in 2013 with BFA in new Game Design Department with loads of student debt and inadequate game development preparation for ever changing game industry. Still no job in game design/development field to this day. Worst financial decision in my life and my parents'.
College Freshman,1,"This school is insanely expensive. If you are paying this much for school, I don't think you should have to pay additional lab fees and whatnot. This is not an ivy league college, yet I'm paying a similar price.."
College Freshman,1,Tuition is horrible and financial aid is not enough especially the situation I'm going through.
College Sophomore,1,"They did not transfer any of my other credits!  I had to retake two classes that I passed with a previous school and the final grading outcome was the same, I PASSED both times.  Both its the point that I have to repay money for two classes that I pass three years ago because this school did not apply those credits."
College Senior,1,"The school cost more than a house does, which is crazy."
College Junior,1,Colleges in general are to expensive. My first contribution to society is paying debt
College Sophomore,1,"The tuition just increased, which means I won't be attending this university any longer. My financial aid had to cover my housing fees, and I ended up trying to pay for the tuition out of pocket. That's not easy, and it is still a headache. There is a reason why there's a 30% graduation rate, even though anyone can get accepted, not everyone can afford the tuition and housing cost plus the cost of living in a city like San Francisco. Personally, several people in my network who just like me were freshmen at this University, can't return because of the cost."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial Aid is absolutely horrible. They refuse to help me an any way, they originally said I would have so much money then took over half of it away. It's so hard paying for this college, so expensive and it sucks when they want to go off your parents income when you're living on your own and have no help from your parents."
College Sophomore,1,"every year our Tuition is going up and our school hasn't any financial aid for international students or any one who can help with financial situation even for citizen is hard to find support from our financial aid department.

I have bad experience with financial department in my school"
College Sophomore,1,my department has one blog and we have there job/internship page but their is no offer only interviews with students their finished interns. After graduation our school don't really support with job finding or intern.
College Senior,1,"Teams have to play all over the Bay Area, no on-campus athletic events"
College Freshman,1,Not everything is accessible unless you're a part of a certain class or group.
College Freshman,1,The Computer lab isn't open to anyone as well as certain books in the library. The projectors are terrible quality. And the Dining is terrible food.
College Sophomore,1,"Receiving financial aid is easy at AAU. Although sometimes they've lost my papers, they do process them very quickly. It's important to ask the questions because no one is going to tell you where you are with your aid. I HIGHLY suggest making scholarship searching and contest entering a part-time job. This school is expensive! I think it's worth it, but try to do anything to keep the cost down. They don't offer any scholarships either other than a portfolio scholarship I think."
College Sophomore,1,"For the most part, any frustrations have been with the administration. It's impossible to transfer credits for one. Also, the school has a tendency to lose paperwork. I had to give verification for my financial aid three times for the same aid year. I've been handed off to a different advisor every semester."
College Freshman,1,"The academic level at this school is nothing short of the word ""poor"" to be very honest. A lot of the Professors are unorganized, unmotivated, and inexperienced in the Motion Picture and Television field. The program is under developed which is the complete opposite from what i was told when i applied for this school (i'm only speaking for the Motion Picture and Television Majors who want to purse acting). I was looking for a full College experience with challenging acting course as well as math, science etc... instead i found myself stuck in elementary level work with teachers who couldn't teach a dog to roll over even if their life depended on it. Your first Semester they put you in this Voice class were you spend most of your time lying on your back/stomach listening to meditation music trying not to fall asleep and doing those horrific waste of time breathing exerciser. Now this wouldn't be such a big problem if A) I didn't care about my career and B) didn't mind spending the load of money it cost to attended this school. There is about 1 and by no exaggeration i mean ONE solid teacher there, but unfortunately everyone who attends that school for acting realizes that same fact and the waiting line for his class is so dam long you'll have to be extremely lucky to get in. (Jim Jarrett) He teaches a completely different method from the rest of the acting teachers and it actually doesn't make you feel like you're wasting your time so, if you're still looking forward to this school and get in his class it will probably the only thing worth your money."
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid people are friendly enough but, I wish they'd offer more scholarships.  The tuition is reasonable but if you have to pay it all out of pocket... it is painful!"
College Freshman,1,It's pretty pricey. I have to work full time just to pay for my tuition with financial aid included!
College Sophomore,1,"They hardly took any of my credits because they want you specifically take their classes, even if they do not apply to your degree. After being in college for two years and transferring, they are having me start from scratch again. Also, class times are limited, which leads to an inflexible work schedule."
College Junior,1,"Our school is filled with people too busy to realize that we have a student body. It's that labor intensive. The teachers expect us to output work at a professional standard, which means about 4-6 hours a day at least. No time for a student body really."
College Senior,1,"Needs Changed – No special rates for senior citizens; most of the financial aid people act like bill collectors, accounts receivable not any better.  They only know about federal loans and offer no assistance for any other types or even give suggestions."
College Senior,1,Online Library – They need to revamp this so it is more useful for online students.  Right now it is more the on campus students then it is for online students.  I don't use it because it is just too much of a hassle.
College Senior,1,"I know so so so so so many people who have been completely f***** over by financial aid. It is hell to deal with them, I don't know anyone who has had a smooth process with loans at this school. I seriously think they pull numbers out of their ass. It is so frustrating, and they are completely unhelpful, even though they may care. This school is really just out for a profit. That definitely reflects in the administration. The money and frustration is worth it though, the teachers really do care, and are generally on your side. I have had so many professors that go out of their way to see to it that students have the opportunity to succeed."
College Freshman,1,"Needs More Financing Options and Scholarships. While the education at AAU is valuable and well worth it is so expensive and so hard to finance. I truly believe that the instructors at Academy of Art University care about their students success and they help to build fantastic portfolios and improve the skills of their students tremendously. It's an amazing school, however financing it seems nearly impossible and the Academy of Art University offers very little assistance by means of scholarships for their students. The scholarships that are available seem to be hard to find and once you find them the deadline has passed. Much more needs to be done for students to get an education....especially if they're working hard."
College Student,1,"Flexible With Classes, Poor in Experience Acknowledgement – I was told by Admissions that some of my prior experience (20 years' worth) would release me from up to 6 credits.  This was confirmed by an online director.  However, this was not the case when I got to the department chair.  The department chair misplaced me because he did not bother to look at my resume or portfolio.  I e-mailed him 3 times with both items and he simply did not want to be bothered.  Finally, I listed highlights of my resume in an e-mail and said that he could not have possibly reviewed the resume or he would have put me in the proper course.  He never admitted his negligence.  I told him that since I am paying for this education, I demand his proper attention to such matters.  He simply sent an e-mail that said I could proceed directly to the next class."
College Sophomore,1,"The teachers are great, the students are wonderful and the location is beautiful but this school is a huge scam created to steal money from kids! I cant even begin to explain just how much of a rip off this school is they over charge you for EVERYTHING so they can put flat screen tv's every where on campus. save your money & choose another school please!!!"
College Student,1,The people that I have dealt with in the financial aid department were the absolute worst. They could literally care less to help you get funding or make sure your classes are taken care of. I have had to email and call them like 4 times in order to get a response. I actually had a financial aid representative tell me after I expressed frustration with getting my grants taken away that if I had gotten it that it wouldn't have covered all of my classes anyway. She was so callous in pointing out that obvious fact. It was like she didn't realize she was talking about an actual person.
College Junior,1,"I'm an online student, paying $2,200 per course - while the online class system is well organized and accessible, the module lecture information is 10 years or more out of date (I'm going for editing, a very technically oriented career - having up-to-date information is crucial). This last week a module actually referred to the new release of Spy Kids (movie released in 2001) and talked about the digital switch over coming up in 2007. Instructors awareness of the outdated info varies, one instructor give extra credit for every bit of wrong or old information in the module lectures, but for that much money, it's not too much to expect that your paying someone to update the damn modules once a year."
College Freshman,1,"I haven't had to transfer any credits, but everyone says its a nightmare. The classes aren't super flexible because you only meet one day per week, which is something I like. Some teachers let you make up class during another class they have."
College Freshman,1,"The first few semesters are terrible. You work with so many people who don't have the talent or drive that you do, and half the teachers don't say anything to them. I have decided to only pursue an AA at this school because I can no longer stand the idiots that encompass this program."
College Senior,1,No- Quality – I was signed to a contract while still in school and the school's officials were very unsupportive of my endeavors.
College Senior,1,"Advisors Are No Help – You need to pick the right teacher. Get to know your seniors and ask them about what classes they are taking, and WHO is teaching and if they are good or not. Advisors are useless. They don't know who's teaching and what the classes are about. If you try to take more than 15 units they will make the process of registration so hard and tell you that you're not going to make it - which is true, if you're not a hardworking student. But if you are, screw them. Go to advisors just when you want to register for classes YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE."

Freshman,5,"I do not take classes online, so I do not feel like I have the right to critique their online teaching abilities"
Sophomore,5,"Indiana Wesleyan really does care for you as a student and a person. They do everything they can to make your learning experience beneficial for you and helpful for your life.

I could never ask for a better school.  I have a great Academic adviser we have an amazing professional relationship.  My teachers, online Chaplain everyone give great Academic and spiritual support.  My teachers pray with me. Most of them are pastors. 1 of them Pastor Rene' not only prayed with me but worked with me to help with assignments gave me extra not just though ADA Department but as an individual after my accident.  The staff went out of their way to make feel like IWU is my College Church family. I have tried other schools 1 closed, 1 scammed me, and the other didn't know what a Christian was even they claimed to be and gave me no help or support.  IWU gives me all I need and more."
Sophomore,5,"I am a Church and Ministry Major only 2 classes away for being a 2nd year student. I am a transfer student from Argosy University they closed so I had to find a new school. I play to be Traveling Evangelist who does outreach ministry.  My Teachers are amazing they are real Christians who deeply care about all the students. I love the flexibility the class work is mostly essays very few tests. I have the ability to work doordash,  go to school make all me dreams come true and go to school.  I write essays,  do discussions,  lots Bible knowledge requested. I personally wish there were more Bible discussions because that is my major. Over all best school I ever went too."
Sophomore,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Indiana Wesleyan University. The professors I have had genuinely care about the students, not just about their grades.  It is a strong Christian university and they show it by the love and care they have for their students. The dorms are excellent - clean, spacious, and homey, and the campus is beautiful and well-maintained."
Freshman,5,Amazing school with the right resources to help students who want to achieve great things!  I am getting a major in Entrepreneurship and Finance.  It is incredible how these caring professors not only educate but mentor you throughout your start of the career.
Freshman,5,I love Indiana Wesleyan University! They definitely do a great job supporting the community and their students.
Junior,5,"The education is fantastic! Professor are always happy to help students understand subjects and talk more in depth about a subject. Opportunities to do research exist too, which I did not expect at a smaller school. I do not think chapel should be required. The community on campus is incredible. Students are friendly and genuinely want to get to know people. The on campus events are great too. Students are adults who should take ownership of their faith whatever that looks like for them. I would also like more on campus apartments, but campus housing is good."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Indiana Wesleyan University has been life changing. The community at IWU is full of encouraging, high-energy, and caring staff and students. Just from my one year there, I can tell I have grown mentally, spiritually, and academically."
Freshman,5,"When you enter the doors of Indiana Wesleyan University, you feel right at home. The Christ-centered atmosphere and community at Indiana Wesleyan make every student feel valued.

The school has an excellent environment for learning and also having fun with your friends. I love the coffee shop on campus and the dorms. There is a lot of life on campus, especially when it is warm out! One thing I would love for IWU to do more of is going out into the community."
Freshman,5,IWU cares a lot for the students and make an excellent effort to make sure they feel welcome and their needs are met
Freshman,5,Indiana wesleyan university is such a great private college. While it dost cost quite a bit you do earn you money's worth in the knowledge you learn.
Freshman,5,"I love Indiana Wesleyan University (IWU) because it is a Christ-centered campus that is close to home. It is a smaller school, but that means there is more opportunity to get to know your professors and peers on a deeper level."
Freshman,5,Indiana Wesleyan is such a beautiful atmosphere. Going to a Christian School has opened my eyes to find my love for God in a whole new way. In each class that I have taken the professors find little ways to always incorporate God into the lesson for a day. Everyone at IWU always has such a loving and compassionate attitude towards one another. The staff will go out of their way to find ways to brighten your day no matter what. You can feel the love of God through the work of his people. Indiana Wesleyan was definitely the best choice for me. IWU also has a fabulous nursing program which made my choice of choosing IWU so much easier. Oh and one of the best parts about IWU would have to be the dorms. The dorms are so much nicer than what I have seen from other colleges. NO COMMUNITY bathrooms!! You only have to share a bathroom with your roommate and 2 others.
Senior,5,"Indiana Wesleyan University, was a perfect fit for me .I decided to continue my education in 2018 , so I can provide a home for my five year old grand son. Providing a safe home and good education for Kyler is at the top of my lists . I was a nurses assistant throughout my work history .I've seen a a share of women that lives are ruined due to domestic violence. My dream is to help as many abused clients that I can . Indiana Wesleyan gives me a complete and top notch education concerning my course studies .But what I love most is the religious influences that help educate me physically, mentally and spiritually. Preparing me for my journey into the future ."
Junior,5,"I love the online adult program. It allowed me to go back to school even though I am a single, working, mother. The professors are easy going and understanding and truly have your best interest at heart."
Niche User,5,I felt very well supported and I enjoyed my time a IWU. The education and professors were very helpful. I felt very prepared when entering the workforce.
Alum,5,Professors are spot on with answers and eager to help when needed. Easy to talk to and understand. Tuition is reasonable for the quality of the education.

Senior,5,Professor that care. Challenging classes. I feel prepared for success! IWU has a great atmosphere and provides students with top tier opportunities.

Their caring personality and well they were just the nicest people assisting me in enrolling and registering.  Very knowledgeable and conveyed all  information effectively and efficiently  and in a  very timely fashion.  Once classes started the instructor was amazing also.  Super nice and seemed very concerned with our experience even though she was thousands of miles away."
Sophomore,5,I love Indiana Wesleyan and the incorporation of Church and school.  I have had nothing but a positive experience since attending.  I would recommend this college to everyone.  I am also learning a lot about how Christ and everyday life is really entwined.  It is very refreshing being able to reference the Bible and God in the discussions and also my class work.
Sophomore,5,"What I really enjoy about attending Indian Wesleyan is that while I am there not only am I earning a degree but I am growing in my faith. Indiana Wesleyan has a beautiful center where there is a variety of different eating places, a coffee shop, as well as several places to quietly work on school work. I would most definitely recommend people to attend IWU because of the awesome academics provided as well as a safe space to live."
Sophomore,5,I have had the best experience with IWU. When my college closed they helped me transition to a new program and help with housing as well.
Sophomore,5,"I love Indiana Wesleyan. The campus is peaceful and beautiful, and the people are amazing. The professors care about more than just your grades, and although courses can be difficult, they want to see you succeed. You might not get along with or agree with every professor, but find one to really connect with and mentor you- you won't regret it!"
Freshman,5,I am very pleased with IWU and I am very excited about attending it in the fall. The campus is beautiful and the staff is very kind to IWU's students.
Sophomore,5,"IWU has become my second home! If you're looking for an authentic school that is Christ-centered, IWU is probably the place for you! The professors care so much for the students and create quality connections with the students."
Junior,5,"I am an online student, I have been in and out of school because I was young when I became a mom.  I am now almost done but I need financial support"
Sophomore,5,"This is where I've found a home! Through the constant community and connection, IWU has helped me establish lifelong relationships and given me job opportunities that I enjoy and have gained experience from."
Freshman,5,"I love the investment that professors have in their students life. I've been invited to Superbowl parties, dinners, monthly lunches, bible studies, and weekend activities by my professors. They consistently invest in their students' lives in and out of the classroom. The party scene at IWU is basically non-existent. We do play a lot of beach volleyball in a sand pit and there are a lot of events held by the Student Activities Council so you don't get too bored in this small town. There are also a lot of volunteer opportunities around the campus, as Grant County has a lot of needs. Overall, I've loved my IWU experience and I would strongly recommend it to prospects."
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my time here at Indiana Wesleyan University. This school has such a great nursing school with professors that really care.
Senior,5,"As a communication major, I have been told repeatedly that my portfolio blows those at state schools out of the water. Every semester I have worked for at least one client. I feel like I am prepared to go into the real world as much as I could be.
My professors care about my education and care that I succeed. They are always willing to help and recommend you to people in your career field."
Alum,5,"Excellent academia, wonderful and caring administrative staff and faculty, many options for on-campus dining and housing, rigorous liberal arts foundations in addition to many program offerings and degree types."
Freshman,5,Personally I really like this School. there are a lot of reasons that I believe that this is a good school. A couple are that here at Indiana Wesleyan University the people are very social. I have friends at other schools that say it is hard to find friends because everyone is so isolated but here everyone is so social. another thing I like are the classes. Most of my classes are pretty small so there is a lot more one on one time with the teacher and it is just a lot more comfortable then being in a big lecture style class. But those are the main reasons that I really like it here and it makes me feel as if I am at home.
Junior,5,"The Nursing program is #1 in Indiana! I would recommend it to anyone!! It is a very Christian-based school (obviously) and it really strengthens your faith over the years you attend. The food is pretty good. Some places are better than other. We have Chick-til-a so that’s bomb. It’s a great friendly, safe, and relaxing environment. McConn is the absolute best, I use all of my money on muffins and coffee there :)"
Niche User,5,I have visited IWU a couple times and each time I went the experience was great.  Meeting the producers are very nice there and are personal and more one on one with students. The campus itself is very nice and the atmosphere is very nice.
Alum,5,I enjoyed my educational opportunities at IWU. They were challenging and thought provoking. I really enjoyed the faith based academic agenda. I am an adult with a fulltime job and 3 children. It was alot of sacrifice and hard work. Still this university was an excellent fit for me and my family.
Junior,5,I like this college because it gives students the opportunity to look at Human Services from a religious stand point as well as God’s view of things.
Niche User,5,"I love Indiana Wesleyan University, I have been on multiple campus visits there and my older sister is currently attending Indiana Wesleyan. I plan on attending Indiana Wesleyan in the fall of 2019."
Junior,5,"Indiana Wesleyan University is a very caring, respectable college filled with educators who are truly there to support their students in success."
Freshman,5,"When it comes down to it, nothing is ever ""perfect"" in the aspect of whether or not it is flawed. However, when it comes to universities, this is about the highest quality thing I can imagine that anyone can experience."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely loved my first semester on campus.  I have grown into a more mature person spiritually in these past four months than ever before.  The athletics are top notch.  The academics definitely provide challenges that will undoubtedly set a student on a good trajectory to stand above others in the job market.  The professors care so incredibly much about the students.  The dorms are markedly better than many other large universities, plus the food is all around solid."
Graduate Student,5,"The instructors and staff have been extrememly supportive and engaging.  The online degree programs cater to working professional adults, where the material is comprehensive providing real life day to day examples of what different areas of study reflect."
Junior,5,Indiana Wesleyan University is a loving student center university that strives to make your education experience the best that it can be. I have loved my time here and I would highly recommend this school.
Alum,5,First visit and we were hooked!  Loved the family feel to the campus and how beautiful the grounds were.  You really felt like they wanted you for more than your tuition.
Junior,5,"I am currently attending Indiana Wesleyan University's adult on-line learning program to pursue my Bachelors degree in Digital Marketing, Branding and Advertising. I began in April after a long process of getting my Associates degree from Ivy Tech. After I finally completed my Associates degree. So far it is amazing. The on-line campus is well organized and most of all the instructors are professional, very helpful and respectful. I love IWU!"
Freshman,5,On move in day there was so many peopke that were very helpful in getting things moved in an ordinary fashion. People are very helpful and willing to help.
Sophomore,5,IWU is a great college that is intentional about being Christ centered. The students and faculty truly care about you and want the best for you. The community atmosphere makes you feel right at home and excited to be there. IWU has changed my life even just after the first year!
Freshman,5,This school is wonderful! Online classes are very informative and helpful for sources. Instructors are very nice. I love the spiritual side to this school. Accepts everyone for who they are. Positive results and environment.
Sophomore,5,"It is a very beautiful campus! All of the staff are very friendly and they love to help their students out with anything they need! I love that the school encourages their students to attend chapel, it helps us get into that routine early in life."
Freshman,4,I never took any online classes from IWU but I assume it was similar to the rest of the education on campus.
Senior,4,"It's been tougher than expected, but rewarding as well. The work is demanding and in-depth. The instructors are tough, but fair. The class is made up of others like me from all over the world. We are in every times zone and climate and I learn from them as well as the professors and the materials. What I love most is they are teaching me to keep learning the Word of God long after I'm out of school."
Senior,4,The professors teaching online were thorough and helped me to learn on my own while also learning the information needed for the courses.
Freshman,4,They have a very informed website and it's easy to get around and if you have questions they are very good with answering you promptly.
Sophomore,4,"The only time I took my courses online was during the COVID 19 pandemic. Since I am an art major it was really hard to continue online, but the teachers worked so hard to make sure that I still grew and learned despite the distance."
Sophomore,4,"The staff and students are all very welcoming and willing to help you whenever you need it, whether it's an academic or professional or personal issue. All of the professors want every one of their students to succeed because that is of the utmost importance. IWU is an expensive school to attend, but the welcoming, encouraging, and inviting atmosphere is worth it."
Sophomore,4,I had to take online classes because of the COVID pandemic and the professors were flexible and the course content was readily available online for us to access.
Freshman,4,"The people are very kind and welcoming to students and visitors on campus. The professors and other staff are more than willing to work with you on specific things you may be struggling with, inside and outside of the classroom. The professors are always there if you need someone to talk to, pray with, etcetera. The whole campus is very inviting."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Indiana Wesleyan has been amazing so far.  It is one of the most personal and Holy Spirit filled places I've ever been, and I feel so loved when I'm on campus.  My favorite parts are the dorm living, the community, the sports, and chapel.  The amazing and unique class material is something to be discussed as well."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Indiana Wesleyan. I am in my 3rd year of my undergrad in social work and so far it has been a pleasant experience. Some classes are more difficult than others, but for the most part I really like my instructors. Know before you start that you cannot just call this in. You will have to work, and read, and write lots of papers and learn, but I believe it is worth it."
Alum,4,IWU has a great community. There are many different degree options to choose from. There are great opportunities to be involved and grow both educationally and spiritually.
Freshman,4,"It has small class sizes that allow me to connect with my professors, and get more in-depth in my classes. It is a small college, that has a loving environment."
Sophomore,4,"Indiana Wesleyan University has been an amazing experience! In just my short years and a half here, I have grown tremendously in my knowledge of God thanks to the classes that are required, and thanks to the professors! The professors at IWU genuinely care for their students and want them to succeed, making the environment great for learning and growing!"
Freshman,4,"Small community to build intimate relationships with. Great place to grow in a spiritual walk while gaining an education. I have been able to expand my horizons of education through the philosophy of liberal arts while staying connected in my major. Could use more engagement activities on campus to make more entertainment, but overall a fun and welcoming environment to learn and grow."
Junior,4,IWU is a great college to attend. All staff members that I have encountered have been super nice and helpful.
Niche User,4,"I loved the professors I got to meet. They made my visit to the University so compelling because they were passionate about their subjects, excited to meet and talk with me, and helpful in giving me the information I needed. The grounds were also very nice; there was lots of vegetation outside and it was neat and nice-looking inside. My experience in chapel was great; I appreciate that those planning my visit made that part of my time at the University. If I could change anything, I would like to have heard more about student bible studies, small groups, and other ministry organizations there."
Junior,4,I love the quality of education I am getting from my professors. I have enjoyed the ratio of students to professors. The community at Indiana Wesleyan is not as accepting as I hoped it would be.
Graduate Student,4,The cost for the undergrad and graduate programs are really affordable and the courses incorporate biblical principles and materials that help you grow in your spiritual walk. The professors care a lot about your success and they go out of their way to help you through the courses.
Freshman,4,"Indiana Wesleyan University is a great school! It is super safe and you feel at home. Lots of activities and gets you involved in the community. The teachers also invest a lot in you. They have good relationships with the students. There are a lot of clubs and groups you can join and it is fun to pick and choose new ones. School spirit is really big at iwu, we love to support and cheer are teams. I think the one thing that helps the university grow is the amount a faith it has, which is a big plus. How we pray for each other and deeply care about the hard things. Iwu is a great big family!"
Niche User,4,I liked that the community there was so welcoming and centered on God.  Everyone there was so welcoming and dedicated to  making sure that every person on campus got what they needed to succeed. They made it easy to make friends and being involved in campus activities.
Senior,4,This is an amazing university! The education department is full of the best professors and content. This university is perfect for someone looking for a Christ-centered community. The food is average for a college but gets to be boring after the first year.
Niche User,4,"IWU is my college choice for Fall 2019. I'm impressed with it's core focus on students and the community.  The staff I met with were very enthusiastic
and it got my attention.  IWU's communication has been better than other colleges I've applied for."
Senior,4,I have really enjoyed the curriculum and the way classes are designed.   There is a lot of critical thinking and sharing of ideas.
Senior,4,I love the housing and the people there just is not a ton to do on weekends. The campus can be boring most of the time.
Junior,4,"I wish I could live off campus or swift my food plan cause I am spending so much money here. But that is the only downside. I love the chapels, dorm community and profs. Honestly, the profs are my fav"
Senior,4,"My favorite part of attending Indiana Wesleyan University is making meaningful connections with professors who care about my future. I certainly feel that some of the professors and mentors I have had at IWU care deeply about my well-being and want me to be successful.

If I could change anything, I would perhaps consider some more food options/food availability (hours) and maybe add something more recreational for students to do. The campus also seems to be sort of sheltered and distanced from the rest of the community."
Freshman,4,"Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana is a beautiful campus filled with caring and kind professors. There is so much to get involved in and everyone seems invested to make sure the students succeed! The dorms are awesome and there is a nice variety of places to eat and activities to do! The buildings are very nice and nothing is too far from each other that you couldn't walk there within 10 minutes. There is really not much I would change at this point except lower tuition prices!"
Senior,4,"I've made the best community of my life. The people and professors I've had the chance to befriend have embraced my values, helped shape them, and live them out similarly.  College has been highly valuable for this reason. I've also enjoyed the education I've received and feel like I've been specifically invested into by the professors and faculty members."
Niche User,4,"I am a dual enrolled student still in high school at IWU. I have had a wonderful experience in class and in the enrollment process. Most are friends since this area is known for its strong cliques and connections people have. Every class I have taken has been in a positive Christ centered environment. I can’t say too much else besides class and the campus since I am still in high school, but the classes and campus are wonderful"
Senior,4,"The school's Division of Natural Sciences is the saving grace of this University. Outside of this education and community experience the school is quite a let down. The people are judgmental, hypocritical, and extremely polarized on almost every topic politically."
Senior,4,Indiana Wesleyan has an awesome academic standard.  It is a great school for adult students who wish to attend online.  I would like to see more diversity in the staff on campus and online.
Freshman,4,"I love the environment of the university. It has always felt like home to me! Like any college, it isn't perfect, but the good outweigh the bad. The professors want to get to know you and as long as you put forth the effort, you can establish great relationships or mentorships with them. The professors all openly talk about their relationships with God and encourage their students in their walks with God as well!"
Junior,4,IWU is a small Christian campus focused on God.  The Professors are genuinely concerned about your education.  The campus is clean and beautiful.  IWU has lots of activities for students to get involved in.
Senior,4,"I honestly do love IWU. This was my first and only choice of college, and I love my degree program. I have been able to excel through my programs thanks to the wonderful assistance of my professors and the staff at the school. My degree program is tiny, but I absolutely adore it. I do have issues with some of the ignorance in the administration, but those I work closely with are wonderful."
Freshman,4,"This school is great! The community is fantastic, it is like a home away from home. The professors care about each student, and they want to make sure that everyone does well. Indiana Wesleyan is a great school, and everyone that goes here is terrific."
Alum,4,"I had an excellent experience at this university during my three and a half years there. I had numerous opportunities to explore my passions and excel in my academics. I was employed in several on-campus positions including Residence Life and had wonderful opportunities in the Psychology department. I did find that some restrictions were a bit drastic compared to the way I was raised and there are some aspects of the campus culture that I could have done without; however, my overall experience was made amazing by my participation in the John Wesley Honors College! I would recommend this university to any student looking to pursue excellence and who doesn't mind a slightly conservative environment."
Freshman,4,Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The professors take time to get to know you personally. The campus has a great spiritual atmosphere and there are lots of opportunities to get involved.
Freshman,4,"I have only been here one semester, and so far have enjoyed it. The people are amazing. However, the only drawbacks are that there are no parties, small campus, and in a rather boring city. I personally really enjoy how spiritually engaging this school is, but it is definitely not for someone whom religion makes them uncomfortable."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience here so far. It is a christian college, so the party scene is not typical of most colleges. The professors thus far have been excellent, and make themselves available to the students. The community is welcoming and the campus is very safe. The only knock I would give it is that the tuition is pretty high."
Graduate Student,4,I love that IWU is a Christian based school and that it offers so much flexibility. IWU is about adult learning and application and while that is different it is nice to apply experiential learning to my courses.
Senior,4,Great place to discover who you are.  IWU provides the tools that you need to reach your optimal potential.
Senior,4,I love that it I can complete most of my courses online and that it is Christian based. The only setback is that it is very expensive.
Freshman,4,"IWU gives you many opportunities to grow in your faith with a community of like-minded individuals. The campus is beautiful and safe, and the dorms are similarly comfortable, but not quite worth the cost. Each professor teaches both the Word and their subject during class, which was very encouraging! Although, Marion, the surrounding town, is very unattractive and rundown and does not offer a lot to do after class."
Graduate Student,4,"Great programs that get you ready, but can be hard to connect when being an online student, but not impossible."
Junior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed attending IWU. The class sizes are small and the professors care very much about your well being. The campus itself/its atmosphere is kind and welcoming. There are many opportunities afforded to students here, and the campus is kept well and the dorms are pristine."
Freshman,4,"I'm just starting out as as freshmen in college this coming January 2018/2019 I'm very excited and blessed to be given the chance to further my education junery and look faward to aquaire the skills and knowledge that will help me grow to become an early childhood education teacher with a miner in  special  Education.
For anyone that was told that you can't go to college or that it's too late for you I would highly recommend Indiana westlyn university"
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed my time at IWU. The professors are amazing, the campus itself is amazing, though the dorms could use some updating. It is expensive but the education you get is worth it."
Senior,4,"I liked that I was able to have one class at a time. I was never overwhelmed with tons of coursework. Mosf of the instructors responded to emails quickly. Above all, the program was Christian based."
Junior,4,"A lot of people have misconceptions about this school, but if you can accept it for what it is it is a wonderful place to go to college. You just have to understand what the school's expectations are for you."
Freshman,4,"It's a nice Christian college. What would i would like to change is making chapel more exciting. I know that sometimes you can't find the right ideas, but I would rather have someone is"
Junior,4,Some of the professors are exceptional and try to make sure you understand the lessons.  Most are rather quick in responding to a question or concern.
Freshman,4,"The faculty is really nice for the most part, and there are a lot of activities and amenities that many other college campuses do not have. There is definitely a positive atmosphere here that encourages you to grow both academically as well as spiritually."
Junior,4,"I love that I only have to take one class at a time. I would like them to accept all the credits I received from other colleges. I would also not make the introduction to college class optional, especially if this is not the persons first college experience."
Junior,4,"Though IWU is a fantastic university, it really needs some work concerning diversity and cost. Alot of the money that is spent feels like it is spent in vain. The professors are amazing. They care so much about the students and their growth as individuals. They want to take time to get to know their students and want their students to learn. I really like that. Campus is gorgeous and there isn't that much diversity."
Niche User,4,"From Indiana Wesleyan I experienced wonder hospitality from the track coach and a college sponsor that use to go to the school. They heavily explained that it was a wonderful Christian school that focuses on the spirit of college and finding yourself rather than the experience of more education. My majors of psychology and physical education is very well doable to take. Also they greatly explained that if necessary that clubs can be created to better the experience at the college. I love to dance, so when I mentioned of created a dance club at the school, they were very much thrilled.  As an undergraduate they got me very hyped to be  apart of Indiana Wesleyan. What i would like the change there is the track and field division team. They are division 2 which isn't bad, however I would like to be with the better competition to better  the like experience of being at the Olympics. "
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe and secure while on campus
College Sophomore,4,"I've just transferred to Indiana Wesleyan University, and so far my experience with this school has been great. They are very kind and helpful and quick to reply to emails."
College Sophomore,4,Sports are a very imporatant part of IWU culture.
College Junior,4,I have heard from several people that receiving a Indiana Wesleyan Degree is looked highly upon.  This is a school that has a great reputation for providing a job after graduation.
College Junior,4,"The school is safe, clean, and secure."
Freshman,2,"There are things I have noticed about the campus. There have been two active shootings nearby the school, and the students were not alerted about the shootings. There was also a girl chased on campus, and so far the campus police have done nothing to improve the safety. Also, the school loves preaching about mental health, but will not provide any resources to help with mental health."
Alum,2,They will preach and sell you any kind of dream you want but what they wont tell you is that there is literally nothing to do. They will also not mention that once you graduate you are on your own for finding a job they will only call you asking for donations.
College Sophomore,2,I doubt anyone comes to this campus for the night life obviously.
College Sophomore,2,"No one comes to this campus to party either, duh."
College Sophomore,2,"eh, eh? very eh unless you know people. If you know people its pretty great. Freshmen have a curfew the first semester but after that you can go goof around marion with your friends. not much to do lol. There was a time I was getting high every weekend with my friends. It was great. There are few parties, usually they are held during events/holidays. Such as haloween or break."
College Sophomore,2,mostly conservative white people. But there are the people who are diverse compared to the rest of campus and they're usually pretty awesome.
College Freshman,2,I'm considering transferring...not so much because of the school but because of my circumstances that have taken place while at school.
College Sophomore,2,"With Marion, there's not much to do. But get with a good group of people and even Marion can be fun."
College Junior,2,The nightlife around campus is poor at best. There is not  much to do.
College Junior,2,"I clearly have been in need of financial aid throughout my college career, but my school barely gives me enough money to rub two pennies together. I am working all the time and taking out loans and I can still barely cover all of the expenses."
College Senior,2,"It is so expensive to go here, and the aid is not super helpful. I am taking this quiz right now because I need money due to some unexpected changes that happened to my aid."
College Senior,2,"While Marion isn't too friendly of a city, with a high crime rate, there are good apartments, which are very close to campus, available to students. However, I do know that there is a regulation that IWU will not allow students to live off-campus unless they are over 21 or a senior. I believe that this rule is very unfair, increasing the overall cost of going to college for the students. I think if students are able to afford living off-campus then the should be allowed to live off-campus and save on cost."
College Senior,2,"Due to this establishment being an extremely proud Christian institution who keep very traditional points of view, there isn't much room for accepting others who do not fit into the mold of Christianity and its rules of what is acceptable. However, it is my firm belief that the students who attend IWU are much more open-minded and accepting than the administrators who run IWU."
College Senior,2,"As an art major, weather is always bad whenever I need to bring my projects and canvases over to the art building/my dorm. Also, living in the midwest, the weather fluctuates extremely several times a day."
College Senior,2,"The amount of students/faculty using the school's wifi simultaneously really slows down the bandwidth, making loading screens common-place. It has gotten better from last year, since the site blocker was taken down to allow full access to all websites and allowing students to their own responsibility when it comes to technology. Regardless, having a site blocker was completely useless in the first place when students are well-rounded enough with technology to simply activate a proxy server in order to bypass the system. The IT service could be better, instead of giving simple advice that could otherwise be googled. I would recommend adding computers and printers to the 24-hour study lounge in the library and increasing printing credits. However, most students come to college prepared with a laptop anyway, since they know it will be used constantly. Another tip would be to give an easily-accessible directory of all of the faculty's contact information, either on the student's homepage or e-mail program."
College Freshman,2,We can hardly do anything
College Freshman,2,in the winter we have had to cancel classes because of snow and cold
College Junior,2,"IWU believes that diversity is important and does a lot to promote it, regardless, diversity is still minimal."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The town is horrible. Very bad school systems, crime ridden, high unemployment rate. And a lot of locals don't like the white, rich students."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I met some very cool people and best friends at the school, but overall I would never go there again. I went in as a Christian and left as an atheist. I couldn't believe the lack of critical thinking on the campus. A good amount of students (especially in the communications department) thought they were the most amazingly intelligent people in the world. In reality they weren't any smarter than the average person. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm from the Northeast, so coming to Indiana was pretty awful. It's very hot in the summer and first few months of fall, and humid. Then in the winter the campus turns into a huge wind tunnel and the weather is very cold and the wind chill is freezing. Not a lot of snow but a decent amount of ice. "
College Freshman,2,"You don't want to live off campus in Marion, IN. Although, Indiana Wesleyan is one of the safest campuses in the United States, Marion is not a safe city. "
College Freshman,2,"Seeing as how this is a Christian university, acceptance of people with different backgrounds is fairly average as a whole and terrible on a case by case standpoint. Topics may be brought up among class discussions, but any other time is done with ridicule or rude comments."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do over here since the campus is located in a small town.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is nice and sunny for about the first and last month of school. It gets pretty cold and snows which isn't my favorite weather, but for some it could be."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't any transportation methods around IWU. It is just use of your own car or bike.
College Sophomore,2,Usually when I have school the campus is disserted. I don't usually see anyone. However the staff is Caucasian.
College Sophomore,2,"IWU's campus is pretty homogeneous. I love that the religious backgrounds and beliefs are that way because we are a Christian college after all, but I really wish there was more ethnic diversity!"
College Sophomore,2,"My school is trying, but hasn't quite gotten it yet. They want to be diverse especially racially, but its hard for them to be. Also they aren't as accepting of people as they would want individuals to believe. I think part of this comes from the Wesleyan background of the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The academics of the school is one of the best that I have seen.  However, the religious side of it is a little bit out there.  Being a Christian myself, I find that IWU appears to have some New Age leanings and have had a number of questionable chapel speakers in the four years or so that i have been there. "
College Freshman,2,The weather is very finicky in the Mid-West. One day it will be sunny and 65 degrees and the next it will be snowing. Classes never get cancelled for the weather but the academic buildings are close to most dorms.
College Junior,2,"I did receive financial aide, but to my knowledge there are not any scholarships offered."
College Sophomore,2,"IWU is white and conservative. Some people look for that, and it's a good fit for them. The school is trying to incorporate more awareness, but it's generally met with apathy. The students themselves are open and generally not closeminded, though. People are pretty welcoming."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking can be really rough; a lot of times, there are upperclassmen parking spaces open, but underclassmen have to park super far away from buildings. Sometimes tickets are handed out without any (seeming) rhyme or reason. Permit costs are reasonable, but usually unless you want a car or need it for a job, you'll be fine. It's about fifteen minutes to walk from one end of campus to the other."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Poor, Rundown Town – indiana wesleyan is a ""bubble."" great on the inside, rundown and poor on the outside."
College Senior,2,"I Don't Feel Safe Walking Out Alone After Class, or If I Need to Leave Before the Class Does. The parking lot is not well lit, it is deserted, and there is no obvious security. The students are the only ones walking out, and I have walked out alone several times.  This is an unnecessary risk."
College Senior,2,Not Really Sure – I felt like there was a real push to focus on diversity last year but other than that it really is profound
College Junior,2,The options at IWU for campus dining are limited for those of us that have special dietary needs. I'm a vegetarian and the food is limited for me.  The prices are ridiculous for the small amount of food.  I'm not very satisfied with the food service
College Student,2,"Even with IWU being a christian school everyone knows that not every student there came because of that reason.  We have students that are'nt religious at all there, or maybe even different religions."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are few computer labs, but most students have a computer of their own that they can use. Definitely need to purchase a personal computer for this campus."
Alum,1,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!  Save your money and go elsewhere.  I graduated from here and the only help I received in getting a job was a piece of paper with a few job websites (sadly, this is no joke).  I did not grow spiritually either.  In fact, the ridiculous rules do quite the opposite.  Go to a school that will help you grow in your knowledge and relationship with God, give you a great education and help you get a job after graduation!"
Freshman,1,"I honestly never felt like I fit in. Three other students from IWU all transferred to Grace College within the same year as me. Three other friends transferred out because of similar issues. Everyone there seemed very fake about their faith. I always ended up feeling like I didn't fit in because everyone was very charismatic about their faith and if you weren't you were judged and ""prayed for"". The science program was very nice. I recommend the education but not the environment on campus. It damaged my faith more than grew it."
Niche User,1,"This university has the academic prestige of a middle school. If you want to ""continue"" your education instead of staying stagnant, I suggest you look elsewhere. 

The community is in an echo-chamber; you are required to go to mandatory ""chapel"" sessions three times a week which are politically fueled and created to lead the student body into one singular way of thinking. 

The community is fueled by hatred of minorities and diversity. There have been many hate crimes on campus directed at minorities which have NOT been addressed by the administration.

You are not allowed to BE A PART OF THE LGBTQ+ (you literally have to sign away that you won't partake in homosexuality), you are not allowed to drink, smoke, stay out past curfew (what are we, 11?), you cannot have the opposite sex in your dorm unless you are being physically watched, and there is a dress code. 

The food is limited and unhealthy (no vegetarian or vegan), and the University actively hurts the surrounding area."
College Freshman,1,Carmin hall is bad due to the people that live there...pick another dorm and you'll be good to go!
College Freshman,1,Terrible options. Only good restaurants include La Cha's and Casa Bravia
College Freshman,1,The strictness is terrible. Doesn't allow you to experience much of a typical college (or even grown up) environment.
College Junior,1,In my opinion there is no real nightlife offered for Indiana Wesleyan students.  If they are wishing to go off to college in order to sew some wild oats or get into some trouble IWU is not the place for them.  Parents can rest assured that their children are not tempted as much as other college students could be tempted at secular colleges.
Recent Alumnus,1,The only way you're getting to town is walking (about a half mile) or taking a car. No other options. Except maybe a bike or long board. (good luck in the winter)
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's a Christian school, if you get caught drinking (on or off campus) you get kicked out of school or in big trouble. A few people have parties but there isn't much drinking at them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"When I was at school they had two rules that have just been overturned. No ""R"" rated movies and no ""M"" rated video games.

Each dorm only had three visit days (when members of the opposite sex can come to the dorm room) per week. And very limited hours. You also had to keep a light on when they were up there and keep the door opened. RA's were expected to walk around make sure nothing was going on every night. It was a lot like babysitting (I was an RA two years).

If a girl gets knocked up she will get kicked out of the school but the guy will only get disciplined. 

It's a backwards place."
Recent Alumnus,1,"IWU is almost entirely a white, republican, evangelic christian community. I only knew of 10 or so African-American students on campus during my three years there, and I think that says something if people are keeping track. There was a hate crime there my senior year that the administration made a big deal about (and rightfully so).

Almost every person you talk to comes from a typical christian family and at least 25% of students are preacher's kids."
College Freshman,1,"The campus can provide entertainment that brings in the community around us, but options outside of campus are almost nonexistent. The 'IWU Bubble' is still in effect since there is nothing to do outside of campus."
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,There are no chances for transportation at any place on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't live on campus however the pricing on the housing, and parking are EXTREMLEY EXPENSIVE !"
College Freshman,1,"Outside of the academic scholarship available, all of the scholarships requirements are intended for diversity outside of my control. In other words, I am not African American or Hispanic, I do not have parents that are alumni, I am not a Nursing major or a Education major, I am not a transfer student, and there is no Weselyan church relatively close to my home that I regularly attend. Although it is great that my school awards these diversities, I need financial aid just as badly, and find it largely inconvenient that I do not have more control over the requirements."
College Freshman,1,"Indiana Wesleyan University is a Chirstian campus, so partying, drinking, and clubbing are not allowed while attending."
College Freshman,1,"Punishments Are Severe – The school doesn't tolerate drug or alcohol use at all.  Students caught with these substances are given a letter home or punishment from the law depending on the age of the student and then after the second time, they are no longer allowed to attend the University."
College Sophomore,1,"Strict as Sin! This is a great school but by far the most strict school in indiana. It feels more like a daycare or maybe middle school at the most. they're really strict with guys and girls together, we have curfew, no parties, no greek life, they just now allowed dancing within restriction of course and we have a dress code. guy and girl dorms only, no co-ed. Get caught drinking, smoking or having sex and you're talking about automatic expulsion and if you get pregnant and you're not married at any point during the school year, you're instantly kicked out. There s mandatory chapel mon/wed/fri that does effect your graduation. A c- is a failing grade at this school and you will have to re-take the course if you have a c- or below. This is a small private christian school so its very religius and very strict."
College Junior,1,"Housing - Impossible – IWU is very strict with housing policies. They are quite rigid, and make it very difficult to live off-campus.  Technically, only seniors or those over 23 (I think; can't remember the exact age) are allowed to live off-campus.  If it were an option, I would have had an apartment as a sophomore.  Everyone has a lot of issues with housing assignments also - another difficult process.

Let me also say - the dorm life at IWU is really great with fun community. I just wish they would make it a little easier, and at least give us the option to live off-campus!"

Works Here,5,"I have not taken an online course at Champlain, but Champlain College Online's programs are incredibly unique. Classes are small and students receive a tremendous amount of support."
Works Here,5,"Situated on a hill overlooking Burlington, Lake Champlain, and the Adirondack Mountains, Champlain College has one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. You'll find jaw-dropping views from most of its dorms and academic buildings. Its welcoming community and innovative approach to academics are what makes it truly unique. Skiers, designers, techies, change-the-world types, entrepreneurs, creatives, and gamers all work collaboratively and support each other through a thriving student life scene. Most students take on multiple internships and many also study and intern abroad. The Upside-Down Curriculum allows students to start taking courses in their major in their first semester so they can take on more serious internships earlier in their studies."
Freshman,5,"Champlain College is so spectacular! The campus is great (warm, inviting, modern) and it is just close enough to downtown Burlington that you can walk there in 5 minutes but still feel like your comfortably out of the town when on campus or in your dorm. The Victorian mansion's modern dorms are great, and allow you to just relax and feel like you are living together in a house with your friends. My experience with my teachers has been that they're friendly and lenient and also act very professionally. There is so many classes to choose from, and because the curriculum is so customizable you can take major and minor classes right off the bat. I had many other collages I wanted to go to, but I underestimated Champlain. I am super pleased to go to school here."
Niche User,5,"As a parent, it's been amazing to see my son find his people, courses and faculty that challenge and inspire him and opportunities for him to grow and evolve, explore new interests and find his voice. Being in Burlington, Vermont is just the icing on the cake! I could not ask for anything more from a college town."
Sophomore,5,Very open and accepting. Never met so many students who were so nice and  inclusive of so many different groups. I've never met a group of more nice and accepting.
Senior,5,"At this time, I have not taken classes online at Champlain. I was studying abroad in New Zealand during the spring semester that COVID-19 affected when classes went online. I'm giving the online learning experience at Champlain five stars because it is a required field. From what I've heard, the online experience at Champlain is satisfactory."
Senior,5,"I'm really enjoying my time at Champlain so far. The university has given me the opportunity to study abroad on three separate occasions. As an international business major, these experiences have made a world of difference. My classes are small and I've gotten to know the students and professors in my major quite well. I'm headed into my senior year and I'm feeling prepared to get a job. Champlain does not have the same ""college bubble"" as a lot of universities. I feel ready for the real world because I'm living off-campus with an internship. I lived on campus for my first two years to get acclimated and make friends. Campus life can be quiet at times as a small school, but I've found my way by getting involved with on-campus jobs and spending time at the student activity center. Burlington has been great and is close to the ski mountain and hiking trails. It's a lively college town with a fun nightlife scene."
Works Here,5,"Champlain College is a welcoming environment with a career-driven academic approach. The Champlain community is truly one-of-a-kind! It's a fantastic place to work—it's staff and faculty are positive, driven, and community-minded."
Senior,5,"I have loved my time at Champlain College so far. The campus is beautiful and welcoming, our classrooms are well equipped with the proper technology to facilitate our learning, and the professors are friendly and helpful. Champlain also excels at doing its best to be welcoming and open to all different types of people from different backgrounds. I feel safe and wanted while on campus and the community of students is small enough to feel tight-knit."
Works Here,5,Champlain strives to be the best small private college in the country and it starts with great people working together toward a common goal.
Works Here,5,I am an online teacher as well as my full-time job. The integrity with which the courses are put together and administered is outstanding. The professors work very hard with the students and are highly available to them.
Works Here,5,"My son is going to start at Champlain in Fall 20 as a Computer & Digital Forensics major. He had gone to the Digital Forensics & Cyber Security Academy in July 2019, and he was hooked on Champlain. He was able to work for two solid weeks in the Leahy Center for Digital Investigation. After the Academy was over, he wanted to keep working in the Leahy Center, and they allowed him to do a year-long internship, every day, two hours a day during his senior year. He is thrilled to be part of the Computer & Digital Forensics program and the Champlain Community.

As a person who has been at Champlain for 13 years, I cannot begin to express how special a place it is. I watch students come in and become in a very short time competent, confident professionals—and then I watch them go out and land fantastic jobs. The education here is different. It's hands on, it's practical, it's comprehensive and it's intense. It serves the students incredibly well."
Alum,5,"Throughout my tenure as a student at Champlain College, I spent a large part of my time doing work for classes through the online system Canvas. As a Computer Science major, my professors were pros at working with new technology and my education was greatly supplemented by having access to such amazing resources. Now the college has taken a new turn in the world of online education with our new flex-hybrid model. This model allows for a combination of online and on -campus  experiences that are all meant to feel like you are sitting in a classroom. Not looking for a traditional undergrad pathway? Champlain College is also home of one of the greatest online education programs in the world, Champlain College Online."
Alum,5,"As an alumni and 3 year employee of Champlain College, I have found that the community here is like no other. Without fail, the Champlain community stands at the forefront of radically pragmatic education and social change. Throughout my time here, I have been a part of discussions taking place involving the entire Champlain community countless times, I have seen the administration take direct action in response to the needs of the community without fail, and I have been a part of a group of individuals that make coming to work every day more than worth it. I would absolutely recommend Champlain College to anyone seeking to explore themselves and become part of something greater, students and professionals alike."
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE THIS COLLEGE! I've been an online student for about a year now. I was at Penn State World Campus, but Champlain is SO much better! (I should have just started here first, but oh well.) If you are an adult, they understand that you are working all day and (possibly) have a family to take care of (like me). So far every professor that I've had are PhD s &/or experts in their fields with years of experience. They get back to you within minutes if you have a question or an issue. Workload is challenging, but manageable. Every class has a discussion: Initial post in class by Wednesday, follow up by Sunday. Plus assignments with and without a computer program (depending on the class). You have a list of required classes for your major. No guess work. Usually Finaid will not pay for a certificate or an associates degree at this level, but they work it into your BA/BS degree so it does. They really do care. If I had to it all again, I would go with Champlain College. <3"
Sophomore,5,Champlain College is the place you want to go to if you are looking for somewhere quiet. The peaceful atmosphere creates a great environment for studying and being next door to the University of Vermont also provides many benefits.
Niche User,5,"Awesome environment, nice, clean, and amazing people.  I love the tours and the people there just had great energy and really brought happiness to the application process."
Sophomore,5,My first time stepping on Champlain Colleges campus I instantly fell in love with the school. What I think is special about that is that amazement has never gone away. Our first-year residence halls are unique in the fact that they are Victorian-era mansions. They range in sizes from 14 students to 60. When you are an upperclassman you also can live in pod style housing in our Finney Quad or our brand new apartment housing in 194. The community at Champlain is amazing due to the small class and school size. You really have the chance to get to know everyone. Professors and students get a lot of 1-1 time and you get to know all of the professional staff on campus very well. There is always something to do on campus and travel options. Burlington has a really good scene for students to explore. We also are a hub between Boston and Montreal so it is easy to travel to those destinations.
Sophomore,5,Small school with an upside down curriculum especially computer related majors and business majors. Has some unique offers such as law BA and computer forensics. Beautiful campus in a diverse city.
Sophomore,5,"Honestly, I have no negative comments about Champlain University. I think that the most important fact about an online college it's the platform and Champlain's online platform is very easy to browse through, organized and modern. Financial aid can also be troublesome but Champlain always makes it seem very easy to me. As of today, I wouldn't change anything about Champlain College! And I say it from the bottom of my heart. If there was anything bad about it, I wouldn't hesitate on saying it!"
Freshman,5,"I have not officially started college yet but I have visited Champlain multiple times and I attended a summer camp there for cyber security (the camp was hosted by the professors who taught at the school). I stayed at the dorms there and the dorms are beautiful retrofitted victorian mansions, the campus is clean and beautiful, and Main Street is just a block away. The town is nicely sized and has everything you could ever imagine or need. They have the blue light system in regards of safety, the food is pretty good and there are plenty of clubs and student organizations."
Senior,5,"All around I have loved my time at Champlain College. The campus sits in the beautiful Hill District of Burlington, VT. Champlain's unique approach to academics, places you in your major related courses on day one. The upside-down curriculum is great for those that know what they want to do, and helpful for those still deciding. Instead of declaring a major that you won't see until your final years, Champlain places you in classes to help you find the right fit. Not to mention the focus on community is another amazing aspect of the school. Your first year residence hall is a restored Victorian-Era mansion ranging from 14-60 students, when returning,  you then move into a larger residence hall 50+. From Orientation to Graduation, the support of your peers, faculty &  staff carries through.

Looking back on my decision to attend Champlain, I definitely would still choose Champlain."
Junior,5,Champlain is a great college that is very professionally focused. You start taking classes in your major from day 1.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a first-year at Champlain and I love it so far! One of the reasons I love it is the upside-down curriculum. As a game major, I had a class in my first semester that I was already making games in. I also love the college because it is so easy to get involved. I knew that I wanted to be involved in Esports and the management team found a role for me that fit my interests. So far my experience has been great! I have made so many amazing friends and I am excited for the next few years."
Freshman,5,"Champlain College is phenomenal. Everyone there is so kind and including of others. I was nervous to start at Champlain, but my fears went away after the first week of classes. There are so many fun things to do on Campus like free Movie, Trampoline or Bowling night. Also the Professors see you as a person rather than just a number. They are invested in your success not only as a student, but as a person. I love Champlain and its a beautiful blue jewel tucked away in Burlington City , Vermont."
Sophomore,5,"Champlain College is a small campus with an excellent upside down curriculum and rad core class options. It could always be improved, but they listen to student input and  are always striving for better."
Sophomore,5,"I chose Champlain because they were one of the only schools with my major, and stayed because experience has been amazing.

Finding a school that had a quality Game Art major was a challenge, but once I found Champlain it immediately felt like a perfect fit. The classes I've been taking have been challenging but really fulfilling. The amount of work you have depends on your major and Game Art is certainly a lot of work, but it's super worth it though because you end up learning a ton. My professors are really knowledgeable and are always open to students going to their office hours or emailing them to get extra feedback on assignments.

Overall my experience at Champlain has been really positive. I can't say it's for everyone but it was definitely a good pick for me."
Senior,5,"Champlain starts you in the classes in your major your very first semester. For someone like me that knew what I wanted to do, it was amazing to get started right away. My friends who were less sure got to try out major related classes right away, and it helped them figure out what they wanted to do. Professors are amazing, knowledgeable, and personable. They will always make time for you."
Junior,5,"Champlain College is an excellent school. The campus is small, but a tight knit community that wants you to succeed academically, mentally, socially and professionally. Professors know you by name, and are always willing to help you out. Honestly a great school that treats you like a person, not a number."
Junior,5,Very great diversity and highly intelligent professors. The students here are kind and open minded. You can get into debates with any student and they will not get mad at you for having your own opinion. The classes are very fun and most teachers do not believe in testing which is really nice.
Senior,5,Would highly recommend Champlain College. I am a 100% online student so I am not speak on behalf of those that are on campus. Online instructors are very helpful. Tuition is very affordable if you are part of their TruED program. I am currently a senior and will be attaining a Masters in 2019 from Champlain as well.
Junior,5,"great school, small classes. The professors are great easy to get to know. student life is as good as you make it. Not much for sports but UVM is next door
Dorms are really cool freshman year and beyond if you like dorms. I am in an apartment now. Thats more my style, but each their own"
Niche User,5,Burlington is a great college town. Saint Michaels and the University of Vermont are also in Burlington. Champlain college is a small school with an upside down curriculum. Classes are in small groups called round tables. Professors get to know all the students. Students can receive help from the resource center when needed. Internships with local businesses happen as soon as your sophomore year. A large percent of graduating seniors get jobs immediately following graduation. Champlain freshman live in Victorian mansions. The food is great and there are many clubs you can join. Ski passes to all the local mountains are sold at a huge discount. The town of Burlington is clean and very safe. Church street has many great restaurants and bars.
Junior,5,Champlain College is amazing!  All of the instructors take time to help you if you are in need of it.  They always answer any emails you provide them.
Sophomore,5,"I love the scenery of the surrounding area, and that it's so close to downtown Burlington.  The only thing I would like to see change is more sports teams that can compete at the collegiate level - not just club teams."
Junior,5,"Professors are very committed to your success and improvement. For media-related majors, Champlain is very good at finding industry professionals to pass on knowledge. Food is atrocious, though."
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere of Champlain College is so friendly, innovative, unique, and creative. I drove 12 hours and it was worth every second this is my dream college now I simply can't wait to start!"
Senior,5,"I've made a home for myself at Champlain. As a senior, I've spent my years meeting incredibly dedicated and passionate students and faculty, getting involved in various student leadership opportunities (there are so many ways to get involved!) and building my professional portfolio. Champlain's upside-down curriculum let me get right into my major my very first semester so I could determine whether or not I wanted to continue my career path. We've built ourselves a welcoming community on our tight-knit campus and with our small class sizes, every student has the opportunity to make a connection with each of their professors. I've loved going to Champlain and I'm a little sad that by the end of the spring semester, my time here will be over."
Sophomore,5,"I'm very glad I made the choice to come to Champlain. When I was looking at some other schools across the country, I never felt any sense of community at any of those other schools. They were seemed so tightly wound that looking at Champlain was a breath of fresh air. I had someone once say to me that at Champlain, it's just the right size and friendly area that walking to class, you will see one person you know and can wave at, and one person who you've never met. Champlain is a prime example of a tight-knit community"
Sophomore,5,"Champlain College is a MUST to visit. The academics are amazing. My classes are small and have under 25 people in them. Because of that, my professors know my name and I have strong relationships with them. With the upside down curriculum, I have already taken nine classes that fit into my major as a second year. Student Life is constantly putting on events for all students to attend and they are always super fun. Living in Victorian mansions as a first-year really helped me build an awesome community in my hall, as well as on campus. The dining hall was just renovated and now offers more food options that are always delicious. Burlington is an amazing area with the amenities of a city and is very safe. Overall, I love Champlain College and it was a great choice to attend here."
Senior,5,"As a senior at Champlain I've had four internships, spent a year abroad, held several leadership positions, and understand how to articulate all of these experiences into a professional resume and cover letter. Champlain makes it really easy for you to succeed as long as you put forth your best effort and professors and staff are always willing to help you out. If you want to attend a school that actually cares if you get a job after graduation, definitely give Champlain a visit!"
Junior,5,"Champlain College is amazing. Let's start off with academics. All the professors know their students on a first name basis and are genuinely dedicated to teaching, making sure the students comprehend the content in the course, and helping students further their education.My first semester in my new major made me realize I had made the right choice for my career goals. The courses were exactly what I was looking for and we even got to work with real clients in the Burlington area. This brings me to my second point, job placement and connections. I know the reason I decided to go to college was to broaden my opportunity for employment. There are so many opportunities to network, get internships, or gain experience that will help you when looking for jobs post-graduation. My final point is the campus. Visiting Campus is a MUST! Burlington is the perfect setting for Campus, especially in the fall when the leaves change and it looks like an L.L.Bean catalog."
Sophomore,5,"As a Game Design major, Champlain was the only real choice for me. All the other colleges that offered any type of game major were super broad and I didn't feel like I would actually learn what it meant to be a game designer. Champlain splits game development into the four separate categories, and I actually feel like I'm specializing in something. The classes are amazing, and all my professors are from the industry, so I know that I'm actually learning things right. I've also been encouraged to travel abroad to Montreal for a semester and I am so excited for it! I'll be able to have an industry internship while I take my classes up there, and all my professors have connections on top of connections for the industry. The food is good as far as college food goes, the only real downside is how crowded it gets. If you don't like what they serve there is always another place to get food on campus (which includes an Auntie Anne's!) I honestly love being here at Champlain."
Senior,5,I came into Champlain College as an undeclared freshman and my advisor worked closely with me to craft a class schedule that allowed me to test every major that I was interested in (which were all of them). Every one of my professors were genuinely interested in me and my studies. I have had 6 internships - the majority of which were brought to me by professors who thought I would fit well. This school is a tight-knit community where you actually know your peers and you can share a coffee with your professors. My on-campus job turned out to be a passion of mine - which I in-turn transformed into my minor all with the support of Champlain faculty. Our diversity on campus is low and our dining hall gets really crowded at lunchtimes. But all in all I love this school!!
Niche User,5,"Major related classes are great, clubs are amazing because we get loads of funding, housing gets better the higher you are in years, and the city itself is wonderful."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus in a hidden gem of a town. Develop great relationships with your professors. The college gives a lot of real world opportunities, as well."
Senior,5,I love the opportunity to take online classes. The classes are hard but the work is doable. The instructors are all positive and helpful.
Junior,5,"I love Champlain. It is fun school with a great community. It is a business school, whether you're a business major or not you may feel like one at times."
Freshman,5,"The upside-down curriculum really gets you going during the first year. It helps you learn if your major is really right for you, and its easy to switch. The smaller sized campus helps you to feel at home - I never find myself in a room with no one I know. If there was anything I could change, it would be the fact the the campus is situated on an incline so that I have to daily walk uphill to my dorm."
College Sophomore,5,Alot of businesses look for students from Champlain
College Sophomore,5,I have only been at Champlain for two semesters but I already feel like I am knowledgeable in my field of study. I have learned so much and feel incredibly confident in my abilities to go out into the real world and excel.
College Freshman,5,Champlain College has an incredible curriculum which allows for students to dive right into their field work their first semester. I haven't seen any other school that gives their students that ability.
College Freshman,5,Champlain alumni are very famous and are constantly talked about. I've also learned that employers look more for Champlain students than any other school. Internships are constant and there is a wide variety for everything.
College Sophomore,5,"I BELIEVE CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE OFFERS A GREAT QUALITY IN COURSES CONTENTS, TEACHERS ARE EXCELLENT, HELPFUL AND EXPERIENCED, ETC. I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THIS TWO SEMESTERS. IT'S BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY"
College Sophomore,5,I HAVE LOVED THIS TWO SEMESTERS WITH CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE
College Sophomore,5,I HAVE ENJOYED THIS TWO SEMESTERS WITH CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE
College Sophomore,5,The professional staff does a wonderful job of making campus a safe place for everyone. There are a lot of services for students in order to provide the help that they need.
College Sophomore,5,Our Career Services office does a lot for us as a student body. There are magnificent job fairs and the LEAD program does wonders to prepare us for life outside of school.
College Sophomore,5,First year housing is unique and cool! Upperclassmen housing is new and up to date with great facilities.
College Sophomore,5,I love that I was able to get into my field during my first year of school and in just my second year I am student teaching and gaining extraordinary professional knowledge.
Senior,4,"Great Professional Writing program. Very flexible curriculum to meet your desires. Lots of activities to participate in and the community is generally very friendly and welcoming. Though there still needs to be improvement in the areas of diversity and inclusivity, Champlain is a school I would recommend to all that prefer a small-school setting."
Senior,4,Professors very accommodating of student needs and are aware of boundaries that may prevent participation during remote learning.
Senior,4,Champlain's online learning experience during the COVID-19 Pandemic was smooth sailing for the most part and engaging. Teachers really understood students limitations and all of mine were more then willing to work with students around these limitations while still meeting the learning goals of the class.
Senior,4,"Champlain College provides a holistic education by not only having students take courses in there major and minor but also having students participate in financial literacy and career building sessions/seminars. In addition, Champlain's CORE curriculum is engaging and allows students to take a real inter-disciplinary approach to important topics affecting both the western civilization and the global community."
Niche User,4,"The ability to access courses and material anytime, anywhere has allowed my student to continue his learning when and where it works for him. Sometimes that's at a scheduled time, sometimes it's at 2:00 in the a.m. after getting off Discord."
Alum,4,"I loved my program and professors. I was a Graphic Design & Digital Media major (which is now called Visual Communication Design) and I can’t speak highly enough of the major and the professors I learned from, especially Suzanne Glover and Jonathan Mikulak. They really were invested in helping me to succeed."
Works Here,4,"I am a staff member, so do not have a direct experience with the online learning experience at Champlain College. However, the students I work with remained motivated and driven to succeed during their online learning experience."
Senior,4,"I have taken one course online so far and it was structured well. We used Canvas to see and upload all of our assignments and it was organized well, I didn't have any difficulty in finding assignments or knowing when they were due. Communication with the class and the professor was easy as I could contact them either directly through Canvas or via email if I had any questions or concerns. While I prefer in-person classes to online, the online learning experience was still positive and I would take an online course again if I needed to."
Works Here,4,Champlain has been doing distance learning online for like 20 years and knows how to do it well.  Our conversion to full online learning during COVID has been seamless.
Sophomore,4,"I feel like I am getting a good education for my major there (Game Art and Animation) The campus is very beautiful and is very close to Church Street, which has a lot of stores and restaurants."
Sophomore,4,The programs are great overall! I chose the school for its upside down curriculum and I’m so glad I did because I feel like I’ll be a step ahead of others in my age group that chose differently.
Sophomore,4,"Some teachers didn’t have a lot of experience in technology and had a hard time adjusting but in most cases I felt the school did a good job of helping them learn and be able to teach us how. Because our classes seem to be more hands on than other universities in the first place, it was a bit more difficult transitioning completely to online work, yet somehow the teachers figured out how to do so efficiently."
Freshman,4,"Champlain College is a school that offers a lot academically, but if you are looking to go a school with a lot a parties it is not the way to go. The professors take their classes very seriously, especially the ones who teach the major classes, and are great about meeting outside of class hours for help. The community is tight knit since it is small, so you will feel right at home in your first few weeks of the semester. Overall, this college is great if you are looking for an education that puts you right into the workforce and internships your first year."
Sophomore,4,Awesome college with a small and intimate environment located in a large college city.  Academically speaking it fits very well with me and if you're an artist definitely consider Champlain.  I like to call it an unofficial art school.
Sophomore,4,"I've had a great time at Champlain College. I feel that the staff & faculty really care about me, the student life is great and there are so many opportunities to study abroad. I especially love the focus on career education, I feel like it will really prepare me for after college."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Champlain College because of the tight community that I made.
The biggest flaw about this college is that for the Game Art major pathway, the work load is ridiculously demanding. 
Specifically if you are coming here for a game related major, make sure you actually want to make games, playing video games all day doesn't mean you understand the hard work that it takes to make them.
A lot of kids in the game major are horrible in team work, which is extremely frustrating. The college should be more strict with the people they admit in as a lot of kids get in only to slack and play video games and not shower."
Freshman,4,"I am a first year at Champlain College and I am very happy with my decision. The majors here are focused and professionally oriented which ultimately is the most important thing. The study abroad opportunities are vast and accessible! You have the small school feel with UVM right down the road, so it's the best of both worlds."
Freshman,4,"Great academics and beautiful campus. Burlington is also beautiful and great walking distance. Busing is free which is also cool when it's cold and you don't want to walk. Champlain is full of ""gamers"" and ""theatre kids"", but you'll either get used to them of used to ignoring them. The one thing that needs improvement is the quality and diversity of food though."
Freshman,4,"Although I am just an incoming Freshman with one semester completed, I really appreciate the ""Upside Down"" curriculum.  During my first semester, I have already participated in a group setting developing a game.  The Core courses combine English, Social Studies and History to blend into a very interesting class.  It is advantageous to my studies as a future Game Designer/Programmer to begin my studies upon walking onto campus instead of waiting until Junior year like most degree plans."
Sophomore,4,Champlain College is a small community with big aspirations. Champlain constantly has events going on around campus so its really say to join the community. Their academics are what keep me at the s school due to their upside-down curriculum. The teachers want their students to succeed and students are not just a number in a classroom.
Freshman,4,"I kinda wish the staff was more politically diverse as all of them seem to be to the left, and while that can be a good thing it really hinders dialog at times when a teacher ends up shaming a student due to their political stance."
Senior,4,"My college experience has been everything I expected it to be. One of the biggest draws for Champlain is the area that it's in. Burlington, Vt, is a college town and it's great in the way that it has lots of resources and there's always something to do. Champlain's upside-down curriculum helped me figure out what I wanted to do early on and because of the small campus, it's easy to get involved, get to know people, and gain leadership roles and experience."
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time here at Champlain so far. They were great with financial aid for me, and the classes are exactly what I wanted to take and will help me a lot in my future. The food isn't the best, but there's usually at least something to eat. Lots of different clubs here on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I started here as a Computer Networking and Cybersecurity student and absolutely hated it, but because of the upside down curriculum, I was able to find that out during my first semester while taking major related classes. I was able to easily change my major after my first semester and now I am a Computer Science and Innovation major. I really like all of my professors and they do a great job of facilitating a good learning environment. However, I think Champlain has a LOT that they could do to improve the mental health awareness and environment on campus. The counseling center is in desperate need of an overhaul."
Sophomore,4,"I have made many friends at Champlain College, have used the school's resources, and have taken advantage of its location in Burlington, Vermont. The school is really great at pointing students in the direction of obtaining a career after their 4 years at the college. Every year, there are career building requirements, career coaches you give aid in LinkedIn profiles and resumes, and internship opportunities. I feel on track to a successful career. Champlain also does a really good job at giving its students free ways to enjoy activities off campus, and the Student Activities board organizes things on campus for the students to enjoy. On the other hand, the food situation at Champlain is not the best, but has gotten better since I have started school here. There are also no ""real"" sports teams at the college except the rugby team.. so if you are looking for a pep rally type of place, this probably is not it. We do have club and intramural sports though!"
Junior,4,"Champlain College is a great school if you find your Niche. While some professors are undoubtedly better than others, many of them care about your success. This is a very nice looking school with awesome academics. Champlain College has what they call an upside-down curriculum in which you are immersed in your major from the very first day. They also have many volunteering options in addition to their great curriculum."
Sophomore,4,"The community is very welcoming, you are bound to find friends that accept you for you, and the professors are always willing to help."
Freshman,4,I love Champlain College. It is a great school and really feels like home. Once I stepped on campus for my first visit I fell in love. It is an amazing place with great people and wonderful academics. The upside-down curriculum is very interesting and helpful when choosing your major. The only down side is the lack of variety in food and dining hall times. I wish that they had more f a variety fr the pickier students like me and would stay open later and for longer hours on the weekend.
Junior,4,My experience with Champlain College has been most rewarding. The academics are challenging yet fun and apply to your specific major or interests. I would like to see the COR (general eds) be less of a role in the education as they are quite repetitive and surprisingly incredibly hard at times as well as more work than major classes most of the time. But overall I love the school and the community it's in.
Senior,4,"I had a great experience at Champlain-- I'm confident that I'll be finding a job soon after I graduate, and I've met really great people here. I love Burlington and I love the housing on campus. I wish there was a sports scene here, especially wish that we had a track. The classes are hard and the professors push you but if you have good time management, you'll be okay."
Junior,4,"I love the opportunities that I have been given as a student at Champlain College. I have had first hand experience in the field since first semester of my freshman year and attribute my success in the Elementary Education field thus far to the combination of these field experiences and my coursework. I feel very safe on campus and the Burlington area. I would like more diversity in a student body but that often comes with a smaller school. Burlington is an amazing area, great for college students. I wish there were more sporting events at Champlain."
Senior,4,"Wonderful school - it's easy to get to know your professors and they are very engaged and involved with students. My only major complaint is around housing for students who do not live close. The dorms close for all breaks (Thanksgiving, Winter and Spring breaks) so don't forget to add in the additional costs of flying back home if you don't live close. There are a few dorms that stay open but the school does NOT give priority to students who live far away. In my opinion if you are from the west coast you should get priority in these dorms - it's to far to fly home for Thanksgiving break! Also the dorm food is terrible! Champlain please do something about the awful dorm food!"
Freshman,4,Champlain is an amazing community. The school is pretty small so it's easy to get to know the people in your year. The classes are about as big as a high school class and it's really cool to get to know people in your classes. I think it's amazing that we get to start learning our major from the beginning of your first year. The school is extremely inclusive and diverse.
Sophomore,4,"Champlain is definitely a school for certain crowds. If you're okay with that, you'll love the school. Major related classes are great, clubs are amazing because we get loads of funding, housing gets better the higher you are in years, and the city itself is wonderful. You don't feel trapped on campus and the people are extremely friendly all around. 

Campus food is the only huge downside. You are required to have a meal plan if you live on campus (all freshmen and most lower class years), and it is expensive for what you get. The quality is poor in the main dining hall (required), so you are somewhat ""forced"" to venture out into the two other dining options (breakfast/ lunch only place or a very unhealthy place open until 11pm every night) or even get your own from supermarkets. If food was fixed, Champlain would be close to perfect."
Niche User,4,"While choosing the right college for me to apply to, I decided to visit Champlain College to see if I could potentially apply. As a Vermont resident, Champlain College was one of my top choices because it is only a few minutes from my residency. During my research, I noticed that teachers care about students academics and are willing to take the time to give the student the necessary assistance."
College Sophomore,4,I love all of my classes and professors.
College Sophomore,4,"CPS, our campus security services are always around and have access to psychiatric professionals 24/7 if necessary."
College Sophomore,4,Compared to the other colleges around our rooms are incredibly spacious with lots of floor space. The one issue is that because the freshman dorms are refurbished mansions some rooms are strangely shaped or are without windows.
College Sophomore,4,"Champlain college is a great school for those who are dedicated to their academic success. The quality of the dorm rooms your first year is a gamble but aside from that its great. If you are a cyber-security of digital forensic major I highly suggest taking a class with Ginter, he is the best professor ever."
College Junior,4,online learner. Not on campus that often
College Junior,4,Easy enrollment process.  Advisor great to work with
College Freshman,4,My campus is very safe and secure with little to no incidents of sexual assault happening (to my knowledge.) We have emergency buttons along walkways in case people feel unsafe or for any reason need help.
College Freshman,4,"Champlain offers a wide variety of courses with amazing instructors in most cases. The only thing that I don't like is the fact that were forced to take core classes that have nothing to do with our major and in most cases, bore me. For example: I had a core class that talked about the brain and human impulse the entire semester."
College Freshman,4,I would definitely choose my school again if I was given the chance to do it all over. Most of my professors are amazing at what they do and it's clear that they want us to succeed. I've had ten different professors so far and nine of them know all their students names by heart. I definitely wouldn't change it.
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe on campus. Burlington obviously has some sketchy parts but when venturing around town just always have a friend to walk with. CPS is always a phone call away which is nice. I never hear about any crime on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Since I am a freshmen I don't have much experience with the job/internship stuff, however it seems very easy to talk to anyone apart of career services. Plus Champlain has a very high rate of graduating with a job so seems like there're doing a good job."
College Freshman,4,The dorms here are really nice. First year I lucked out and got a private bathroom and air conditioning which was really nice. Most of the dorms are really close to campus which is super convenient. Dorms are really tiny which can sometimes mean lots of drama. If you are good friends with everyone then it could be nice.
College Freshman,4,The surrounding area is upper class residential and campus security is helpful
College Freshman,4,"Professors in the Graphic Design department really care about students, some of the classes are too big though"
College Freshman,4,"High job placement rate after graduation, and career services is there to help"
College Student,4,In general campus is pretty safe. Walking into burlington is a bit sketchy at night but bring a buddy and youll be fine.
College Freshman,4,Do not know about the greek life at Champlain.
College Sophomore,4,"While there was one professor that was awful, I have had amazing experiences with my professors thus far. They really care about our success as students and professionals."
College Junior,4,Champlain helps a lot with connections and internships.  I have a good feeling that I will have a strong internships and job offer by the time I graduate.
College Junior,4,I have personally had an easy time talking to professors.  Even the professors that I have had trouble with in their classes have been helpful to me.
College Junior,4,"I have really loved the dorms that I have lived in.  They have been really cozy, and I have met great people."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy Champlain's small community and location.  I like being able to email the teachers and ask them questions whenever I need.  I have had a very great time here, and I have learned a lot.  I would like to see more course options."
College Freshman,4,Freshman dorms are in beautiful Victorian-era houses. Rooms are average size.
College Senior,4,I love it but there are many improvements that can be made
College Senior,4,"Pretty good, champlain does a lot to help you get a job after college"
Freshman,2,"It's just getting much better! it had a rough start (which was to be expected with such a fast transition) but now with professors being provided top-grade cameras and microphones, communication and ease of access to your professors during your online classes I relatively easy and painless. It's good, it's getting better."
Sophomore,2,I only had one class that was able to teach me this past semester. This was mainly due to the fact that my laptop wasn't made for my major.
Freshman,2,"The student health center is pretty awful. they don't seem like they know how to help someone who doesn't have a visible injury. The people there seem like they need to learn how to treat others and actually interact with people? of course it matters your experience, but through my own I give a warning of ignorance by a few teachers and students."
Sophomore,2,Not a very diverse college. Very expensive. Limited majors offered. Only recommended if you are certain about what you want to do. There isn't much room to explore.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of people who like to go out every weekend. You end up doing the same thing with the same people at the same few places.
College Freshman,2,"Champlain is a gaming school. Therefore like 90% of the kids here are for that. The circle of people who like to party every weekend is small so you will find yourself doing the same thing with the same people. Once you are 21 though Church street is fun, lots of bars."
College Freshman,2,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,2,"Very few athletics, small gym with a few yoga classes though"
College Student,2,"I would not come here again if I had the choice, the small liberal campus is not the life for me. However, if you like small liberal campus's then you'll probably really like it here."
College Senior,2,We dont have any but we have a nice gym
College Freshman,2,"If you're not a super hipster, a ski bum, a stoner, or a gamer, you may not fit in on this campus. I am not any of those things, and I'm transferring after one semester. Classes are not challenging, and there is no sense of community on campus. Think very hard about this school before coming here. Spend as much time on campus as possible to make sure that you fit in."
College Junior,2,"Burlington is expensive and there is like a 0% vacancy rate. It's not great, but it's possible to find housing."
College Junior,2,"I am not really the partying type, but even so, the party scene at Champlain isn't great. The school is a dry campus so most of the parties don't happen here. For parties, go off-campus or to UVM."
College Junior,2,"It's unlimited if you're on campus. That's great. However, Sodexo is not the best and there have been multiple times where the quality of the meals were sub-par. It's also very expensive."
College Freshman,2,Same food almost every week. International line provides good options though.
College Freshman,2,"Guys are gross, generally. Because of the heavy guy:girl ratio, you'll be surrounded by guys with poor hygiene. It's hard to find guys to date, I go outside of campus. It's pretty hard to find girls to date as a girl, but fairly easy if you're a non-gross guy."
College Freshman,2,We don't really have parties here aside from school sponsored ones. Those are hit or miss.
College Freshman,2,"We don't have sports teams at Champlain College. We have some intramurals and club sports which are decent, but most students are here for the educational aspect."
College Freshman,2,"Low quality, little variety. The desserts are good though."
College Freshman,2,"In the winter, it does get cold and snowy, there is no denying it. The ice can get bad around some of the less well cared for sidewalks, but the school is usually decent about making sure you can get to your classes and the dining hall. When the salt runs low, however, you get better at keeping your balance on uneven ice. The summers are pretty hot and humid as well, but the spring time really brings people together. When the sun comes out for the first few times, everyone comes together and enjoys the sunshine outside."
College Freshman,2,THE FOOD SUCKS. Most of the time it seems like the cafeteria just gets lazy and serves the same thing over and over. (Better get used to a lot of pasta). They try to be adventurous and make exotic foods which just fails.
College Freshman,2,Cabs take to long to arrive and buses run every hour!
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall reels you in by having amazing food the first few weeks of semester, just long enough for you to tell your parents how good it is. Then, the meals begin to become repetitive and bland. The hours are horrible, there are days that I can only get one meal in because of my schedule. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly though. You can tell that they're really committed to their job. They try to make the food as best as they can but I don't think they have a large enough budget. There's a rumor that they're building a new dining hall so that would help with the crowding and hopefully will bring new choices."
College Freshman,2,The cost to park on campus (with a parking pass) is too much. It also is hard to find a fair spot at a reasonable distance from classes.
College Freshman,2,I don't like that we have to bring our own laptops in. Some classes it's even necessary in.
College Freshman,2,UVM is much better with sports than Champlain. We are more of a student group kind of school.
College Freshman,2,"There aren't any school teams, unless students put them together. However, if you join on eof these teams, there are plenty of friends and students to support you at your games."
College Sophomore,2,We have intramural activities but no varsity sports.
College Sophomore,2,"When it's hot, IT'S HOT. But once it becomes winter you'll be lucky to be warm. At least when it snows the walkways around campus is shoveled and salted. School is never cancelled due to snow."
College Junior,2,"Media services can be slow to fix issues, but over all its not horrible."
College Student,2,"The hours of the dining hall are ridiculous on the weekend. But weekdays they have late night from 8:30 to 11 and always have snacks and wings and soft pretzels some nights. you get sick of the food though, except the sandwiches"
College Freshman,2,There aren't many people with different ethnicity's and diversity. The main population is Caucasian. There are people of different sexual orientation and are accepted up here at Champlain and in Burlington.
College Sophomore,2,"Because I am a transfer student, I have not experienced the strict penalities that some students undergo for academic and social penalities. I am 22 years old and live by myself so I do not drink on campus or provide alcohol for minors. I do know a couple friends who have been busted by their respective RA's but were given a warning. I am glad to know that the faculty takes underage drinking seriously. When it comes to academics as well, it is nice to know that the staff wants the students to succeed. If a person is performing under average in a class, it is safe to say that most professors will try and help the student achieve better grades and further their understanding of the subject matter before any policies regarding their admission to the school are put in place."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Only for Those Who Can Afford It. While living off-campus while in school is great for getting a feel for living on one's own, housing in Burlington is not cheap (even with roommates). Know before you begin looking that chances are high you'll be paying at least $500 + utilities per month."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Punishments Are Exactly What You Would Expect. As a dry campus, Champlain makes it very clear that drinking on campus/in dorms is not allowed. Underage drinking is punished more severely than those who are above the age of 21, but as I mentioned before, neither is allowed. However, if someone has chosen to drink and is not doing so well, they are ENCOURAGED to come to any of their campus resources (RA, Public Safety, Counselor) so that the student is cared for and will be okay."
College Sophomore,2,"There seems to be an administration-driven move towards less and less parking on campus, and building more buildings.  Personally, I see no good reason to diminish the parking on campus as it is already very limited.  Public Safety is nice about extenuating circumstances regarding cars parked during restricted hours, but the fact that the college is trying to lessen the amount of already minimal parking seems like a bad idea.  (2012)"
College Sophomore,2,"Cafe Food Is Cafe Food – Champlain College campus dining is quite alright. The food is give or take, but I could never eat as much as the unlimited meal plan cost me. The dining hall times, for at least dinner are pretty inconvenient. One of my classes last semester ran through the entire dinner time and I had to wait for ""late night"" and the food then does not make for a good meal. The taste of the food is pretty good though and the sandwich bar is great."
College Junior,2,"Welcome to a Winter Wonderland – Lets face it, we are in northern Vermont. It's cold up here. Real cold. Lots of snow, and classes are hardly ever canceled. It's paradise for skiers and snowboarders though, lots of great mountains within an hour of the College. If you don't like the cold though...get ready for a rough time. All the dorms are heated though, so you are safe...when you are not walking to class."
College Junior,2,"So, due to the construction of new dorms and buildings, we will be losing two of our biggest on-campus parking lots this coming year. There are a few small lots on campus but don't count on getting a space, just play it safe and park at Gilbane and take the shuttle up."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I Personally Hate the Food – Its okay, but not much variety. Also, there is a lack of healthy options, most of it is deep fried gross."
Freshman,1,They deleted all the negative comments. Don't come to this school if you like having the smallest bit of fun. People have been moved and kicked out for walking through a wrong door. I wish I never came here.
Junior,1,"I promise you, just go to UVM. Better yet, if you are a marginalized identity, then you constantly will feel like you have to defend who you are. Please pay attention to honest 'diversity' ratings and know that this school struggles with racism and anti-LGBT+ support."
College Student,1,The nightlife is smoking pot outside the dorm. If that counts as a nightlife?
College Student,1,"Its burlington vermont, is there any more to say? If you dont do at least weed then cross this college off your list right now because it isnt the place for you."
College Student,1,"Champlain college is not the place to go for athletics. While there are intramural clubs here, they are not widely participated in at all. Its just a couple of guys passing a ball around for an hour on Wednesdays."
College Senior,1,"We dont have any, its great"
College Freshman,1,We don't have fraternities or sororities at Champlain College. Got to UVM for that. Come here to learn something.
College Freshman,1,The health services sucks. Most of the time they'll tell you to come back in a few hours or just be rude and not know what they're doing. The campus is pretty safe though. CPS is chill.
College Freshman,1,"The weather sucks so bad! It goes fro warm to snowy, to rainy to hot!"
College Freshman,1,"Classes never get canceled, even with a foot of snow."
College Sophomore,1,"There are mostly white people here. There is barely any diversity ethnicity wise. However, there are quite a few international students."
College Junior,1,"Only Three Team Sports – Champlain does not have division sports. There are recreational sports in the gym, such as basketball. There are three sports teams at Champlain - boys' and girls' rugby, co-ed hockey, and Quidditch. If you count Humans v. Zombies, I guess you could say there are three teams."
College Sophomore,1,"Let's put it this way. Vermont is the whitest state in the country and Champlain is right below Canada, which is also primarily white. It's a very white school. I didn't choose the school because of this, it's sort of a downside of it. We have international students from places like El Salvador, or Egypt, but those are few and far between. This is not the school for diversity."
College Sophomore,1,"I Have a 4.0 and Have No Merit Scholorship – The school doesn't give aid unless you make them. I am an incoming sophomore and have a 4.0 G.P.A., an off-campus job in addition to an internship, and will be an RA in the fall and still have no scholarships, merit or otherwise, to the school."
College Junior,1,"Not Enough – It's hard for students who have financial needs to feel like their money is going towards their education when the school is constantly under going un-necessary renovations of the side walks. There are quite a few things that when examined alone cost more than a car, and it really makes you wonder when does the cost of education really become to great for the outcome?"
College Senior,1,What Sports? We do not have any sports. We have a club rugby team and I think the next closest thing to that is a Quidditch team.
College Junior,1,"The food at Champlain College Dining Hall is very poor quality for the price.  If you live on campus you are forced to get a meal plan. They only offer one meal plan, unlimited.  For people who only use it twice a day they do not get their money's worth.  There is minimal selection.  All the food is pre-plated, so you don't get to choose the food you get."
College Junior,1,"Burlington Is a Very Hard Place to Get Apartments – Burlington has one of the lowest rates of vacancy in the entire US, so be ready to pay a large amount for a crappy place. You will also need to start looking very early, or you will not get a decent one."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is very expensive and limited. You have to get there early to play the ""parking game"" which is where you wait til classes get out and sit in the parking lot hoping someone leaves and you can quickly take their spot! It is a hundred dollars per semester for a permit and they are continuing to take out parking lots for buildings!"
College Junior,1,Champlain College only has club sports and these are limited to two teams. We have little school spirit and limited fan support. Student involvement is not impressive and this is something that needs to be changed.

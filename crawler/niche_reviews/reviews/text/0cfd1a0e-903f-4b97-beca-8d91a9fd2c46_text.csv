Senior,5,"I really like the one on one interaction with my professors. The Psychology department at LMC is great! My professors really care about helping the students understand their options, and they help them understand the materials presented in class."
Sophomore,5,"Lees-McRae College is a very beautiful campus that is surrounded by three gorgeous mountains. Each person who goes here is very friendly and welcoming because there is very little of us. We are all considered part of the Bobcat family and we treat each as so. The teacher to student ratio is 13:1 so you really get that one on one with your professors and get help from them whenever needed. There is also so much to do around town that is related to Lees-McRae such a skiing, hiking, swimming, and trying out great restaurants around town too."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed playing for the varsity basketball team and the courses I am enrolled in. There is a strong tutoring network here too. I enjoy the location, being in a small town where there is peace and quiet to study but it is still possible to go into town to go out and have fun."
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere of Lees-McRae is like a big family. Everyone is so friendly and the staff are very caring and want to see their students succeed.
Niche User,5,I went to open house. The experience was awesome. Well organized and very interesting. The campus was beautiful. I decided I want to attend next year after I graduate. I applied at open house and was accepted the same day. I can’t wait to attend and experience all the advantages this school has to offer.
Freshman,5,"I love Lee's McRae, I play lax and I love being apart of the team. I love the atmosphere of the campus. Everyone is very nice and has their own personality. There are always people wanting to hang out but everyone is very understanding if you have class work and cant."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment at Lees-McRae College.  The rock constructed building's are amazingly beautiful as well as the general Banner Elk region.  There is a sense of security being nestled in the mountains.  The staff and fellow classmates are all very friendly and welcoming.  The faculty makes learning fun and are always willing to help students be successful.  I enjoy the athletics and especially track. I would however participate in football if it were offered.  A parking structure of some sort would also be beneficial in providing students with closer to campus parking.  I enjoy everything Lee's McRae has to offer and am glad I choose this college.
Freshman,5,"The area that Lees-McRae is located in is an absolute amazing place. Everyone that attends, works, or just visits Lees-McRae are such great people. The faculty at Lees-McRae are such great people."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus, small class room size and plenty of student activities. Would love to see a football team be added, but otherwise great sport programs as well. "
College Sophomore,5,"I love Lees-McRae! Like any school, of course there are things that could be improved upon. For example, the residence halls are old and slightly out of date, and campus spirit is generally low. However, what I think speaks volumes for the quality of LMC is that despite the minor inconveniences that go along with campus life, cafeteria food, and fees, life at Lees-McRae is amazing. It is so easy to overlook the struggles that would exist at any campus because the quality of the education and the beauty of life here is incomparable. Every day here is a chance for an adventure and a chance to learn under some of the most interesting, personal, and caring professors imaginable."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are great! Super helpful and friendly and they really get to know you. For a small school, there's a lot of course variety too."
College Freshman,5,"This school is wonderful. I would love to stay here but I am in need of more scholarships. This school is small, friendly, accepts people from all over the world and has great outdoor activities; not too mention that the school has stunning views of the mountains all around. I highly recommend this school."
College Junior,5,"The best thing about my college is its high up in the mountains , the campus is gourgeous. And what makes it unique is it started out as a all girls college then later became co-Ed college and it has a Scottish  Heritage."
College Freshman,5,"I picked my school senior year because when I was looking at schools I didn't really want to go far from home right away, and also I have friends going there with me as well.  So once I visited the campus I loved it and knew that it was the place for me.  Throughout the rest of senior year I did everything I could to make sure that I would get accepted so that I would be able to go there. It was hard but now that I actually did I'm so proud of myself for accomplishing it and getting accepted into the school. 104

I really like my school because of the fact that it is a really small, and friendly place.  All of the faculty have been really supportive and helpful throughout my time here, and I loved all of the outdoors that surround the school and that are apart of the campus.  I love the river that runs through campus it makes the environment really nice and a serene place to be around so it's great to go there and read or work on homework or even just to relax.  All of the students are really cool and down to earth and it's nice to be surrounded by that all the time. I really enjoy the fact that the campus is pet friendly also I think that it's a really cool thing to do that they let your pets live on campus,walk around, and even go to class with you. 254. 

Over all I am really happy with my decision on where to attend It's an amazing school with amazing staff and students and I'm so glad that I am apart of that.  Yes it was hard trying to get accepted and going through all of the paper work, but I'm glad that I did and got it finished because I have already made memories that I'm sure will last a life time.  I'm really glad that I chose it because in fifty years I will be able to look back and say that I did that and that I graduated college and actually made a difference in my life and to me that makes it all worth it."
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of little places to eat downtown. A lot of variety for such a small town.
College Freshman,5,I have not have any major problems with the administration
College Freshman,5,The scholarships are really great. They help out a lot with finances.
College Junior,5,The staff has worked great with me.  They have helped me with any problems I have encountered in a timely manner.
College Junior,5,Drugs are not done at this school. There is no peer pressure when it comes to anything. The students are allowed freely to decided in what activities they want to partake in with out being pressure by anyone.
College Junior,5,I believe it depends on whether or not if the person likes the cold and snow. Lee's McRae is located in the Mountains so in the winter time there is snow and a lot of cold weather.
College Junior,5,I believe that the strictness at campus is fine. The rules that are in place is there to protect us and make sure that we are safe.
College Junior,5,There is a restaurant on campus where you can just hangout with your friends as well play pool and darts. As well every Friday night there is a movie night where you can watch a movie and have free popcorn.
College Junior,5,I believe that the best way of handling financial aid is by talking to the advisers and have them help explain the process and give additional advice on scholarships and what to apply for. That is the way I handle scholarships and financial aid.
College Junior,5,The program that I am in is great. The teachers are well connected with the students and their educational goals as well with their professional and personal goals.
College Junior,5,Campus police is available all the time and if anyone feels unsafe walking outside at night they can have a campus police officer to escort you to where you need to go.
College Junior,5,At Lee's McRae there are students that attend from all around the world. Also the atmosphere at the college is great and very open.
College Junior,5,Being located in the Mountains and in a small community is a great learning environment. Lee's McRae is a small private school and there is a lot of one on one with the teachers.
College Freshman,5,I have an internship at an elementary school in the area as a freshman.  It is extremely helpful and I love it. LMC happily provided it for me
College Sophomore,5,"I had such an easy time with financial aid. They send you a package personalized to you, after you apply and send fafsa information, letting you know what funds you are eligible for and you simply accept or decline them."
College Sophomore,5,I love my major and how much I learn each week. The material covered in one test can be intensive but well worth it. One should definitely be willing to work hands on. Admission was fairly simple from what I recall.
College Freshman,5,They helped with anything I needed.
College Freshman,5,I love this school! Everyone is very nice even in the community.
College Freshman,5,I love my career choice and I am very happy in my program.
College Freshman,5,The Greek life seems to be doing good things for the school and community.
College Freshman,5,You have a couple of bars in walking distance. You have the bar on campus. Two cities about 25-30 minutes away.
College Freshman,5,The campus is so small that you don't need any kind of shuttle. You are easily able to walk everywhere.
College Sophomore,5,"The townsfolk of Banner Elk are the kindest, sweetest people I've ever met its almost as if the town and everyone in it is a family, they'll get to know you real quick due to the small size and just about every month or s the town has an event that everyone at the college can participate in, and it just fantastic. "
College Senior,5,"Awesome, the Finance and Accounting teachers are great."
College Junior,5,"There is the gymnasium, the student recreation center, and another smaller workout room. The library is very spacious and quiet. There are a ton of clubs, intramural sports, and other organizations to join. Mountain Day of Service is a campus tradition that happens in the fall and spring where students clean up the campus. The school plans plenty of campus activities such as movies, study nights, etc."
College Sophomore,5,I received an enormous amount of financial aid from Lees-McRae and what little i didn't have they helped me greatly pay for it.
Junior,4,"Lees McRae College has really become my second home. I play soccer for the women’s team and I am involved in many clubs including Student Government, Dean’s Council, Career Ambassadors, Order of the Tower, and I am an Orientation Leader. I do very well in my classes and I love the small classroom environment! I do feel as though there are some things that could be amended at the school but that is the same with any institution really. Nothing is perfect. A great school over all. I love it with all my heart!"
Junior,4,"Nestled in a small mountain town, Lees-Mcrae offers a wide variety of majors as well as many activities to do on campus. The staff and Faculty are there to help each student on their way to success and are willing to go above and beyond to help the students succeed. While the Campus is beautiful and historic, this almost means the buildings are old and in need of updating."
Freshman,4,"I think the school is excellent! So friendly and welcoming. The campus is easy to get around and not get lost. You're close enough away from Boone if you want to be, but if you're going to go into town its a quick 35-minute drive. Since Lees McRae is such a small school, it is easy for you to get to know your professors and to connect to others. The school isn't ""clicky"" and has such a warm atmosphere (despite the cold weather in the winter). The beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains is a reason in itself to come to Lees McRae."
Sophomore,4,Lee's Mcrae is a beautiful campus and everyone knows everyone. Professor to student ratio is very very small. I would like to see more options for housing and more college level sports. Lee's Mcrae does not have a football team or a baseball team.
Freshman,4,"Its a beautiful school and the teachers, students, and staff are great people. I have made wonderful friends and the classes are interesting."
Niche User,4,"The students, faculty, and scenery is amazing. It’s a small school in a small town but it becomes home and your classmates become family. Always a warm welcome"
Junior,4,I love Lees-McRae because of the leadership opportunities that I have as a student in everything aspect from my major to my interests and hobbies.
College Freshman,4,"Security is good, health services are great, and I generally feel safe around campus. At night, I do feel safer in a group, but that's true anywhere."
College Freshman,4,"We're small, so not a lot of recruiters come, but we have a few days they come and recruit students and career services let students know about a lot of opportunities. We get a really well-rounded education too, so I feel confident that I'll be prepared for a career after graduating."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is BEAUTIFUL! The professors are amazing and the academic programs are really well-rounded. There are things that need improvement, like there are at all schools, but over-all it's wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,There is rare use of anything here.
College Sophomore,4,Campus security does a good job.
College Sophomore,4,Classes are interesting and keep you involved.
College Sophomore,4,Many students participate in the schools sports.
College Sophomore,4,The school and atmosphere is great. The cafe food isn't great. Other than that the classes are very helpful. The teachers are great. The students are great.
College Freshman,4,Everything feels pretty great for a small town person.
College Freshman,4,"I, myself do not play sports because of health reasons but from what i have seen and heard, our cyclist and cross country teams are very top notch in the state and one of the top in the country."
College Freshman,4,"It is very nice, but it doesn't have a program I want."
College Freshman,4,I have met many people and already developed relationships that I will be able to take with me through life.
College Freshman,4,It can get a little repetitive. But it's unlimited for all students
College Freshman,4,"Some of the buildings are old, but still live-able."
College Freshman,4,i got the money but i could be need of more for next year since the tutition is going up.
College Junior,4,The staff assisted me with the financial aid process.
College Sophomore,4,Lax is the only sport we suck at
College Sophomore,4,char is about 30 mins away but always packed
College Sophomore,4,very strict about rules and regulations
College Junior,4,The local atmosphere is great. Living in the mountains there are things to do all season long any where from snowboarding and skiing to mountain biking and hiking.
College Freshman,4,So many different and unique restaurants in the area! I recommend Frog and the Monkey.   It's in walking distance
College Freshman,4,"Banner Elk is a small and beautiful town.  Lots of activities to do outside of campus!  Visit Wildcat Lake, or go hiking on the Blue Ridge.  Not to mention Grandfather Mtn is just 10 minutes away...."
College Freshman,4,"I am in the Elementary Education program- I love it!  Our professors really know what they are doing.  They work with us one on one and help us receive opportunities that wouldn't be available at larger schools.  Not to mention, we have a 100% passing rate on teacher licenser test in NC !"
College Freshman,4,"The rooms are pretty spacious compared to larger universities that I have seen.  Avery Dorm (For freshman women), have a nice amount of space, which means that bunking beds isn't a necessity.  Bathrooms for the most part are nice, or as nice as they can be for a community bathroom.  Most of Avery's have been newly renovated within the last 5 years."
College Sophomore,4,"I have never had any problems with either of these. Campus security is small, but vigilant and always patrolling/available. The town is very small as is the student body; everyone knows everyone."
College Sophomore,4,You really get a personalized education as long as you take the time to know your professors.
College Freshman,4,Its great when everyone on campus is not on the server at the same time.
College Freshman,4,Its been great so far.
College Freshman,4,It all depends on who you end up living with.
College Freshman,4,They do it for our own safety.
College Senior,4,"I absolutely love it here.  I'm a wildlife biology major and I am excited to be at a college that offers such a unique field of study.  I am also an outdoor adventure studies minor and that class allows me to learn the skills of how to handle life out in the wilderness, as well as how to become a great leader.  I have never heard of another college in North Carolina that offers such experiences to their students."
College Freshman,4,I feel completely safe. We live in a really small sleepy town.The only thing to really be concerned about are the bears that tend to dumpster diving on campus from time to time though. They are pretty chill though. Just don't pointedly mess with them and you'll be fine.
College Freshman,4,It snows all the time! Its pretty cold since we are the highest elevated campus east of the Mississippi River. 
College Freshman,4,Most people are pretty friendly and helpful. Everyone knows everyone on campus since only about 700 students go here. It's a good atmosphere especially as far as people go.
College Freshman,4,The only time I really ever SEE drugs and alcohol are at parties and those are usually off campus.
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid office really works with you to find all your options and get scholarships from as many different areas as you can. I personally was able to get an academic, athletic, honors, and performing arts scholarships which all added up to make a big difference."
College Sophomore,4,Lees-McRae has an excellent tech support. I love the Mac lab and the hours tat it has. Anyone is able to use it during the hours and even the printing is great. 
College Sophomore,4,"To be in the Comm Arts field at Lees-McRae is en of the greatest experiences I'd have to say the students ll get along, and the professors give great one on one advice that you normally wouldn't see in the other majors. I feel that being an art student at this school is just fantastic. "
College Sophomore,4,"The academics are wonderful the professors get to know you on a personal level and they even will offer to have meeting with you way outside of class time. The workload is never something that can't be managed, and if it becomes too much a quick chat with the professors is something   that can be arranged. "
College Senior,4,No one gives student discounts :(
College Freshman,4,I love my major. Its very hands on and the teachers are great. They really help me to understand what I'm learning.
College Junior,4,"Most everyone at Lees McRae is a student athlete. Those who are not are usually a performing arts student. The girls wear a lot of boots, because the weather is usually cold."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't drive, but whenever I speak with friends who drive they never complain or whine about the parking on campus and can usually find a nice parking spot if they want."
College Sophomore,4,As long as you don't do anything absolutely insane you should be fine at this place. They are pretty lax with what you can get by with as long as you keep to yourself.
College Sophomore,4,"Pre-Professional Biology – My school has a small class size, which aids in the student/professor relationship. The teachers are knowledgeable and kind. I really love the variety of teaching styles and feel like I'm learning a lot. There are a lot of people here who have the same major as me, so I have lots of opportunities to study with other people and make friends. The workload isn't too bad."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at Lees-McRae are generally easy to talk to and willing to help you if you're struggling with something.  Depending on what sorts of classes you take, the course load varies, but it's not ridiculous by any means."
College Junior,4,"We get several feet of snow in Banner Elk every year.  It rains constantly during the summer but it is nice that it never gets hot in this area.  Regardless, this area is so scenic that it doesn't even matter"
College Sophomore,4,It sucks that no one is allowed to live off campus so all the best housing is taken by upperclassmen but the dorms aren't that bad.
College Freshman,4,"Banner Elk, NC is very small but its history over theyear make it very interesting. I enjoy going on a hike up the mountain or going to Wildcat Lake. Its not too far from App State in Boone."
College Senior,4,I came to Lees- Mcrae to be able to get that one on one student- teacher relationship and I feel like my professors are always making me that way. I can go to my professors to discuss about my grade to my future.
College Senior,4,I really do love my major at Lees- McRae Collegebut I would love it even better if we had more internship opportunities or job opportunities once we leave. The workload and curriculum is fairly easy to me but I know when I need help the teachers are always there willing to help.
College Senior,4,campus is diverse with a strong focus on international exchange.
College Senior,4,"Great Bike Team – Cyclists are fantastic, others are good. Lacrosse: bad attitudes."
Sophomore,2,"I attended Lee's Mcrae for 2 years from 2011 to 2013. These were my experiences.

Positives: The nature was absolutely amazing, if you are an outdoor enthusiast you will love Banner Elk. As a cyclist the riding was great. 

The Small campus made for a close-knit community. 

Negatives: The academics was a joke. Most of my professors did not look for things like peer-reviewed citations in essays. Most professors were not knowledgable in their subject area and most did not have PHDs in their content area. My high school teachers were far more knowledgable. 

You are treated like a child - When I attended all students had to live in the dorms, even seniors. Dorms have strict curfews and you can not have girls over after like 8 pm. Your rooms are frequently searched without warning for alcohol and tobacco. I had more freedom living with my parents. 

The cost - For the quality of education and overall experience the cost is insane. If I could redo it I would save a lot of debt."
Senior,2,"I had to take online courses for the rest of the spring 2020 semester, and most of my professors adapted to the online environment fairly well, but one of my professors did not. She did not care if students passed or failed. She would not respond to emails, and she was absent for about a month after the school went online. Most of the students were extremely confused, and were very upset."
Freshman,2,"It is located in the mountains. People  have to make trips down to Boone. The school is too expensive  for a private school with  such capacity and infrastructure.  If I were to rate their food  1 is  me being nice. Basically,  you do not  the value for the amount  you are paying.  If you're  an athlete  it might be your kind of school ,because is about 50% athlete dominated. Their parking is the worst,  why would anybody want to park 15-30 minutes away from their dorms. There are  no INTERESTING gatherings and I even had to  start a club of my one for people  in general. The professors all have different  auras off of them. I suggest they need a mini kitchen  in each dorm, so others can cook or even just warm stuff  up. A place open to the residents in general. Doing  your laundry  is another  major  problem. These are some of the issues my club STM and I have discussed  and ways of financing  such projects because life at LMC can  be a  lot more better."
College Freshman,2,"You cannot get off campus housing unless you are 25, married, or have been in the military."
College Freshman,2,There are few parties held by the college itself and the ones that are not affiliated with the college are usually illegal.
College Freshman,2,dzn girls  are stuck up
College Freshman,2,i cant live where i want
College Freshman,2,They food is not cooked all the way and sometimes there is hair food....
College Sophomore,2,"Campus dining isn't exactly the best, but hey where is food always the best? Its what you would expect from such a small school, the food may be bland and the same choices just about every day, but life comes with struggles and dealing with the food is one of them, if you wan better food options than what the cafeteria can offer Lees-McRae has a bar and grill named Wily's that's pretty great. "
College Freshman,2,Wifi is hard to maintain.
College Freshman,2,Unless you like to go clubbing and drinking then a good night will entail you hanging with a few friends in your dorm room or in Wilys. Other than that there isn't much to do unless you drive 30+ minutes away to have some fun.
College Freshman,2,The food choices are not the best and I often go elsewhere for meals when I can afford it. I wish there were more healthy choices with more fresh and organic foods available.
College Freshman,2,"Lees McRae is located in Banner Elk, which is a little far from any local bars.  We have one bar which is called Barra and its not very big.  Our night life usually consists of finding stuff to do on campus or going to Boone which you have to find a way too."
College Junior,2,"Expensive and Forced to Live Here – Dorm life is ok. people get along. but it is expensive and required to live on campus if you are under 23 (most of us are) or not married (most aren't). there are a few places where you can pay extra to have your own room, but it's already so expensive and you only have access to a kitchen in one of those extra-cost places, and there you don't even get your own room. it is convenient because there is not much of a nearby community, which is unfortunate because getting your own place and a job would be easier and more frugal than staying here, but it would make getting to class more difficult simply because of the weather and geography here."
College Junior,2,"Often Not Accessible, Network Sometimes Slow – the labs and library can be quite crowded during crunch times, but what is more concerning are the limited library hours (close very early Fridays and entirely closed Saturdays), and even though there are labs in other buildings, those buildings are usually locked after hours or on weekends, and if they aren't, the classrooms that contain the computers usually are. one room (part of a food establishment) that is the most likely to be open at any hour only has 2 computers and no printer.

the network is often slow if you are trying to watch streaming video, but is generally ok for most research requirements."
College Sophomore,2,"Students are allowed to bring there cars as freshman, but you don't have to have one to function. It's always good if you want to get home, have a job, or plan on going to the city a lot, but otherwise it'll just be sitting around. Permits for parking cost from $100 to $150 depending on what part of campus you want to park at. If you aren't parked in the correct spot you WILL be ticketed $30 or even booted, which will cost you $60. Parking on campus can be a real hassle for upperclassman who live on the back side of campus. Your permits cost more, plus the layout for the parking lots are narrow. A lot of the time you have to deal with people who can barely park a car correctly!"
College Junior,2,"housing is very annoying unless your a guy and you live in the guy dorms. girl dorms are old, small, cold, and dirty depending on the residents. We're not allowed to live off campus unless property is owned or if you want get an apartment and have the dorm too, but that is very costly."
College Junior,2,"Money Assistance – of course receiving aid requires you to go through a process. They were a big help, but I still could use more help. they can at least guide students to outside resources."
College Junior,2,Drugs and Drinking – Lees Mcrae is in the mountains and isn't near city life amenities. So those who are used to the city life they have nothing else to do except drink ( which isn't allowed on campus) and do drugs. It does depend on who you associate yourself with of course. The people I know who do it don't pressure because they know that's not my style.
Sophomore,1,"The academics was a joke. Most of my professors did not look for things like peer-reviewed citations in essays. Most professors were not knowledgable in their subject area and most did not have PHDs in their content area. My high school teachers were far more knowledgable. 

I did have a couple of knowledgable professors, but they were an anomaly. Do not get me wrong, you will probably make all As if you give minimum effort, but  it does not set yu up for success.

I later transferred to a state university and for 1/3rd the price my professors were twice as professional and 3 times more knowledgeable."
Sophomore,1,"A complete and utter waste of my time and money. The views in the area are beautiful and picturesque; however, they become mundane after seeing it every day."
College Freshman,1,no atheltic has to be in gym
College Freshman,1,because you dont get discounts if you are working going to school or just going to school you should get a discount
College Freshman,1,Don't bother with it. It makes it harder to get to class when it snows.
College Freshman,1,Students at Lees-McRae aren't allowed to live of campus.
College Freshman,1,The Caf is awful. For the first semester there weren't even any options for people allergic to gluten or lactose intolerant. There are no healthy options. A lot of the food isn't as fresh as it could be and most of it look just plain physically appealing.
College Senior,1,"Over Priced and horrible. A few real options…mashed potato pizza, mashed potatoes mixed with sweet corn, etc."
College Senior,1,"Very small compared to other colleges, and you are required to live in campus housing ALL FOUR YEARS!!!! No sinks in the dorm rooms, and very outdated and small when compared to to other colleges dorms. You can't even adjust the heat in  your dorm, and no A/C!"
College Senior,1,"They are pretty horrible. No national affiliation, and I've never seen any of them do a philanthropic event. "
College Freshman,1,"If you don't drink or party, people will get mad at you and they won't like you. I personally don't drink or party and I've had numerous people talk down to me about it and talk about me because of it. I don't care though, I WILL NOT drink or party, I'm not interested."
College Freshman,1,I am still paying out the wazoo for my tuition. Financial Aid could better. 
College Sophomore,1,"There are only two on-campus dining options at LMC, and the dining hall is usually not that great.  The other option, Wily's is good if you want a burger and a shake, but it can get old after a year or two."
College Freshman,1,The dean does not allow students to live off campus with out an reason.
College Freshman,1,Im not sure i dont hear a lot staying off campus unless they live close
College Senior,1,I have always lived on campus since my freshman year and I would say that we as student pay to much money for nothing. I am not saying that where we live is suppose to be five stars but if people are getting sick from mold growing then something have to give. Either we pay less or fix the mold problem.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no campus shuttle that runs, however campus security will pick you up and take you from one side of campus to the other if you are not comfortable walking.  I did not have a car my freshman year and never found a problem with finding a ride or getting anywhere I needed to be."
College Sophomore,1,"LMC is very stressful.  Students do not have voices on campus and to fix any problems, the school must hear from parents.  Everything needs to be repaired.  Transferring is next to impossible.  The school is going under."
College Senior,1,Visitor Parking – there are only a handful of spots for visitors to park and they get filled up by students who don't want to pay for a parking pass
College Junior,1,We have to drive 17 miles to get to anything that we can afford. Most places close by nine o' clock even McDonalds. Which sucks.

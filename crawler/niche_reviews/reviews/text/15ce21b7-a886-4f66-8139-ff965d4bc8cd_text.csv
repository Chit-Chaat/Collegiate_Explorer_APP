Junior,5,"I have found Bluefield State College to be so comforting. I am close to home, and get to have intimate small classes, and truly get to know my peers. The only change I wish to see take place at Bluefield State would be further commercialization on campus. Such as adding one or two fast food companies, and possibly a coffee shop."
Freshman,5,The school is great. There is so much diversity. The campus is beautiful. We’re working on getting new dorms.
Junior,5,"Bluefield State College is a small efficient college.  They help every student on a one to one basis fulfilling all their admission needs. They are very professional and courteous.  Academics are wonderful, the professors and courteous and very helpful and they are building a dormitory to accommodate more out of state students.  Good safe, clean place to live."
Sophomore,5,My experience with Bluefield State College is  exceptional. Bluefield state is very outgoing school that try its very best to get students to their satisfactory not only in school work but also with bonding with one another. The school also have a lot of activities and cookouts so students can feel welcome and comfortable at the school they’re in. The athletic department is very awesome as well. The coaches makes the athletes feel like they are at home and take care of the athletes like they are their own children
Sophomore,5,"The professors are tremendous. They are extremely helpful, and they are there to help students achieve their goals."
Junior,5,"Bluefield State College offers many diverse classes, exceptional instructors, and a an opportunity to achieve your dreams! The campus is not overwhelming large, and the environment""feels"" like home. I'm so glad I decided to choose BSC to complete my higher education."
Freshman,5,"Bluefield State College is a wonderful place to get your degree. The tuition is more affordable than many other colleges and there are many things to do around campus. There are also many great places to study and plebty of activities you can join. The professors are great too and try to help you whenever they can. Everyone wants to help each other succeed at Bluefield State College. I highly recommend to anyone interested in getting an education , no matter what age you are."
Sophomore,5,"The available ""open door policy"" support and hands on academic setting set Bluefield State College (BSC) apart from any other campus.  The staff are not only focused to aid in your success; but it's almost as though they are willing to go out of their way (generally speaking and including all departments from President's Office to Maintenance) to see that your needs are being exceeding.  The campus is safe and relatively busy for the peaceful rural setting and despite popular belief from the relatively inactive student body there is PLENTY to do.  As a Sophomore I am this year's 2016-17 HBCU All-Star Ambassador for the White House Initiative, a full time security officer (Mercer Mall), active member of 8 social clubs/student organizations, and a prospective honors graduate with aspirations to attend Med/Law/Grad school of my choosing.  I attribute everything to the staff's support and guidance."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are wonder at helping a student in need and the classes are filled with a diverse group so discussion about anything is encouraged. The diversity then opens up an option for multiple classes that are differently diverse just like the students.
College Sophomore,5,The way the campus is set up there is a alarm every so many feet and if you feel threatened then you hit the button. Once the button has been push the campus security is notified and if they do no respond with one minute the local authorities located one mile away will be on the way.
College Senior,5,"My experience at Bluefield State College has been better that I could've ever expected. If they had a graduate program, I know I would apply because I like the school so much I would make myself enjoy that field."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very different and nobody judges them on it.
College Junior,5,"Its really hard at Bluefield State College to balance all the workload and curriculum. I received no financial aid, so its also very hard trying to pay for everything. The books for this program are outrageous and even taking the full federal student loan amounts, there's not enough to pay for everything needed."
College Junior,5,Love attending Bluefield State College at the Beckley Campus.
College Junior,5,The professors at Bluefield State College are great & willing to help if you need it. They respond quickly to emails.
College Junior,5,I love this college - I feel very safe & feel I'm getting a great education.
College Freshman,5,"its a retty busy area, transportation is solid"
College Freshman,5,I would call it a college town
College Freshman,5,The people here are great
College Senior,5,I have not seen or heard of anyone using drugs.
Freshman,4,"I took majority of my classes online. Before the quarantine I had a couple of my classes in person. My online learning experience was good and I felt that the professors really cared and were understanding. My professors utilized proctoring sites, case studies, powerpoints, and recorded lectures to enhance our learning. I think the professors did a wonderful job at providing us with adequate resources and materials. My professors also utilized sites such as google hangout to video chat with students to make sure we understood the material and gave us a chance to ask questions. I found that to be very helpful."
Freshman,4,Bluefield State is a good college and I feel like the professors care and help students as much as they can. I enjoy the online courses because they give me a more flexible schedule. My experience so far here has been good and I have enjoyed all of my course work.
Junior,4,"Bluefield State College for the most part is an amazing college to attend. Few professors I've encountered don't exactly teach material, just tell you to read the book. Biggest issues lie with the financial aid and business offices. Scholarships, grants, never on time. Students, including myself, have to submit the same information and papers to the offices multiple times and have to constantly follow up with them to ensure it's getting processed. Other than these issues, I highly recommend this college."
Sophomore,4,"A few of the things I like about Bluefield State College is the student to teacher ratio. On average it is 15:1 so class size is very similar to a high school class setting. Also, I like the professors there. They are very helpful, and they try to aid everyone in achieving their degrees or higher education. Lastly, I like the community feeling you have there. The college is not big at all so it feels like  tight knit community. Everyone knows each other and the college is not hard to get around."
Sophomore,4,My freshman year was a success at Bluefield State College. I enjoyed that it is a small school and anytime you need help there is always someone willing to help you.
Niche User,4,I have experienced an overall positive experience with Bluefield State College. They have been a great help with providing me all of the information I need.
Freshman,4,"The classes I'm enrolled in are very good. The professors know each student, which is a huge plus. You can always get help when needed with anything."
Senior,4,"It's a very affordable college that has some very good aspects that make it enjoyable for the students. However, some professors are hard to deal with, and they may be your only option for taking a required course."
Senior,4,"Bluefield State is a great college. Although small in size, it has 13 nationally accredited programs of study. The professors, for the most part, are outstanding. I am currently a senior at Bluefield State and will be attending graduate school at Virginia Tech next year. Bluefield State has prepared me for this opportunity, and I have had a great deal of help from my professors with advising on this subject."
Junior,4,"Most of the professors genuinely care about their students, however there are several who barely show up to class or treat students like children. I am exceedingly active on campus and participate in almost every event on campus. There is a lot of options if you want to participate or have time to join. There is talk about having dorms by  2018, but I believe it will be longer. Also, there is basically no security on campus. There are very few cameras watching the parking lots and they are of poor quality. Additionally the campus is a ghost town after classes if there is no scheduled event. As a parent, commuter, and non-traditional student, I would love to see some form of child care facility near the college or on the campus. "
College Sophomore,4,The school is very involved in helping the student who show an interest locate an internship. I personally do not have one due to my field but my best friend was placed on the department of highways and loves every second of the experience.
College Freshman,4,All I had to do was request my major change and it was done.
College Freshman,4,People here are very nice and accepting. I've made multiple new friends and the number keeps multiplying. Everyone is very nice and open with each other.
College Freshman,4,I've changed my major once in the two semesters I've been here and so far I've been helped and completely filled in on my major. I've been instructed on the classes I need to take and I've met my adviser in a sit down meeting. I'm quite happy with my major and the major opportunities are extensive.
College Freshman,4,I've never taken part in anything on campus that would be considered a violation of school policy. Though the security makes frequent trips around campus to keep their eyes on everything. Professors and sure to keep the classroom a healthy atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"My personal experience with the financial aid department was a very pleasant one. The people are very friendly and truly do care about you and your financial needs. All of my questions were answered properly and handled very well. I found no problems, unanswered questions, or conflicts at all. Though the scholarships and grant programs are not discussed, that's why I'm online looking for grants."
College Sophomore,4,It seems to be greay
College Sophomore,4,They are very helpful and friendly and keep an eye on things
College Freshman,4,They are not treated any different from any other students.
College Junior,4,Bluefield State College has a vast array of degrees available.
Junior,2,"Financial aid is messed up every year. For one reason or another, you won’t graduate on time. Professors up to this point, don’t actually teach you anything. They just tell you to self study which I understand is apart of college but what am I in class for if you don’t explain what I’m learning. If I had known what I know now when I applied I would’ve chosen a different school. Beckley campus seems to be better though."
Sophomore,2,"Most instructors don't seem to care whether students succeed or not.
One in particular seems to enjoy making students cry during clinicals, demeaning them on the hospital floor! 

Exam questions frquently seem to have ambiguous answers, and NOT NCLEX style like they claim. For instance, questions asking about nurse teaching a group about health improvement might have as the CORRECT answer to a multiple choice question is smoking cessation when the question does NOT state that ALL were smokers. Other answers could include eating more fruits and vegetables etc, so the answer depends on knowing what the instructor MEANT, rather than phrasing the question so students can figure out the best answer."
College Junior,2,The campus housing is pretty bad. It is an old converted hotel and is musty and damp. Very expensive.
College Freshman,2,The cafeteria is only open for a few hours
College Freshman,2,the facilities could use an upgrade
College Sophomore,2,"BSC is very limited in its academic offering. Unless you want to be an engineer or a nurse, this probably isn't the right place for you."
College Junior,2,Not a lot of options and eventually get tired of same food from same restaurants.  Quality of food has decreased in past few years due to economy and you can tell they have went to a cheaper brand of food to serve.
College Junior,2,The school isn't very good. I find it hard to get anything done
College Freshman,2,"The police force goes too easy on college students about underage drinking and drug use.As far as myself goes , i prefer to stay out of the party scene and focus on my work."
Senior,1,"The only thing I like about Bluefield State is their accessibility to tools to help students and their variety of groups and programs. But other than that, I personally do not like the school at all. Their handling of financial properties are terrible, and some of the curriculum from what I've done so far isn't always great and feels like there's not much help sometimes from teachers with the exception of library help. It just isn't the place to be."
College Freshman,1,I'm clueless on this one. I never ever party so I have no idea about the party scene.
College Freshman,1,I'm not even sure if we have a Greek life honestly. I think we might have a frat but I don't think it's anything exciting to be honest.
College Freshman,1,"they don't help you, and they are hateful."
College Junior,1,No greek life to mention that I am aware of. There's a non-social chapter of Phi Eta Sigma for honor students that I am a member of.
College Freshman,1,"I just feel that being from Canada, I'm not given the opportunity to get an education in a great country like America. That is why I'm here, cause I want to get the financial opportunity to study here!"
College Sophomore,1,"This is Bluefield, WV we're talking about. There isn't really much to do expect go to the mall or go to Wal-Mart."
College Freshman,1,To get accepted into the nursing program you must past the entrance exam.  I did not pass it the 1st year which automatically makes me go to school 5 years.  They will only allow you to take the entrance exam 1 time each year compared to other schools that accept it 3 times and some schools do not require it at all.  They only accept 24 nursing students a year.  I am waiting to see if I passed it this year.
College Junior,1,I hate BSC. It is a hassle to get anything done. No one answers the phone or e-mails me back. I am so disappointed in this school and I am transfering next semester.

Senior,5,"This is the best place in the world. Everyone is kind and fun it is perfect for outgoing people. Greek life is so fun and sports give you an immediate family. Macon is good at everything. Academics, Athletics, and Partying. Sure covid changed things but there is still no place I'd rather be."
Senior,5,The professors have been understanding and helpful. Online can be hard if you ignore it but as long as you get things done it really is not that hard.
Freshman,5,My experience with Randolph-Macon College has been nothing but exceptional! The faculty and staff is so friendly. The campus is beautiful!
Freshman,5,"It is an adjustment to go from in class to all online learning. The little time that I have been at Randolph Macon, the adjustment has been well for me. The professors that I have had online calls with have been very understanding if we get disconnected or I don't understand a topic."
Freshman,5,The community around Randolph-Macon is amazing. The people are so kind and the sports programs are fantastic. 10 out of 10.
Freshman,5,Love the school. Everyone is so nice and the teachers are very caring and just want their students to succeed.
Freshman,5,The school did a great job trying to make online learning as easy as it can be. Although it was online you still felt connected to the school
Junior,5,"Randolph-Macon college is an amazing school to attend if you like a small setting with a loving community foundation. You're not just a number, rather you are a friend, a classmate, a student, and most importantly, family. The campus is beautiful and everyone within truly cares about your success. Lots of outlets for academic and social advancement!"
Sophomore,5,"I believe that Randolph-Macon College has a wonderful community that is open and welcoming to every student. The learning environment is what I believe sets it apart from other institutions, the professors are knowledgeable in the classroom and caring outside of the classroom, may it be getting lunch in our dining halls to waving on the sidewalks our faculty are extremely courteous towards their students as well making Randolph-Macon feel like home."
Freshman,5,I liked that it is small and everyone is really friendly there.  The class sizes are small and you will get more individual one on one time with the professors.
Alum,5,"The professors taught us as though we were all on track to go on to graduate school, meaning they kick out butts, academically. The college has high expectations but makes sure you have the resources to succeed. Most of the professors are here because they care about teaching, not just getting published.

Greek Life is struggling a little because of overbearing administrators, but we still manage to have a good time and grow.

The fitness center is amazing and has anything you could possibly ask for.

The alumni will do anything to help each other in the professional world.

We consistently have at least two nationally ranked teams each year.

Macon saw that I had potential to be a leader even when I had given up that aspiration, and gave me everyone and everything I needed to become a change maker for good. I wouldnâ€™t trade my time there for anything."
Freshman,5,I loved everything about the college. They are literally the nicest people ever and the most down to earth college I have met. It feels like home and I don't think they could change anything to make it better.
Freshman,5,Randolph-Macon College consists of a supportive and kind atmosphere. The professors and guidance counselors are intelligent and want their students to succeed. The students are also positive and hardworking.
Junior,5,Small class sizes and an inclusive campus atmosphere create a welcoming learning environment at Randolph-Macon.
Freshman,5,Randolph-Macon is a excellent school. The school is really nice and everybody is friendly. I play baseball at RMC and it is great. Sports and academics are really taken serious here.
Junior,5,"Randolph-Macon makes you feel like you are home. I love my college and would recommend upcoming college students to apply and tour the college. Academics are focused on the student, and you can always receive helps from your professors. The school focuses on giving back to you even after you graduate."
Sophomore,5,"I will be a returning sophomore this fall as well as a returner on the field hockey team. I have made so many friends at college already. When cam at Randolph Macon College, I feel as if I'm at home and I feel very welcomed by everyone around me. I would totally recommend Randolph Macon to anyone considering a small college for one on one interactions with your professors also."
Niche User,5,Randolph-Macon is a very prestigious university.  They take their education seriously and the environment is very friendly.  It is a beautiful campus and everyone is very nice.  Everyone who works their and goes there seems to have high school pride and they are always working to improve experience at Randolph-Macon.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE it.I enjoy attending Randolph-Macon College. The academics here are stellar, as are the faculty and staff. I have felt like I am home since I began attending Randolph-Macon in 2018 and still feel that way now. The experiences I have been able to take part in both in and out of the classroom have set me apart from my peers at neighboring colleges and universities."
Junior,5,"A great school in the Virginia tradition. If you are a SJW looking for a safe space from microagressions, go elsewhere please."
Freshman,5,I recently just transferred to Randolph-Macon College and it is so much better then my last school in my opinion. Everyone here is extremely nice and helpful. I actually feel like there is so much more activities and opportunities here.
College Senior,5,The school offers a 4 year EDGE program designed for job/internships and career development
College Senior,5,The professors are there for the students even outside of school hours.  They want to see students succeed
College Senior,5,Very small town with a very safe environment
College Senior,5,I have been a member of the SAE Fraternity since Freshman year and we have done community service and had great times and fundraisers.  There is also tremendous alumni support
College Senior,5,Four Year Degree Guarantee and J Term
College Sophomore,5,RMC has The Edge which helps us prepare for our futures
College Sophomore,5,The classes are small and the professors really work with you
College Sophomore,5,The campus is small so the walks are shorter and overall I feel safe
College Sophomore,5,I was easily placed in a room with my friend who was a freshman even though I'm a sophomore
College Sophomore,5,All the frats and sororities are awesome and the people are nice
College Sophomore,5,RMC has the best sports involvement and team spirit
College Sophomore,5,Randolph-Macon is a beautiful and wonderful college
College Senior,5,The Alumni of Randolph Macon effectively take care of their own.
College Senior,5,All of the professors are masters of their trade at Randolph Macon.
College Senior,5,The athletes are down to earth and fun to watch. We have some pretty good teams too!
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very kind and open to each other
College Freshman,5,I walk around campus alone all the time whether it is 2pm or 2am (not that I am recommending it) but I always feel safe and have never felt endangered.
College Freshman,5,"I went into college unsure of whether or not I would decide to rush. I'm not like a stereotypical sorority girl you see in the movies who loves Lily Pulitzer and only cares about partying, but neither are a lot of my sisters. In fact a lot of us are very different but one common value we share is our love of Randolph-Macon along with our desire to help our community. If you have the opportunity to go greek I highly recommend you go in open minded because the process really does work and you will find your home with one of the amazing sorority's."
College Freshman,5,"I am absolutely in love with my school. A small school is not for everyone but it was perfect for me. Randolph-Macon has given me the opportunity to step outside of my comfort zone. With such a small school you truly get to know your professors on a one-on-one basis. They will notice if you miss class and some will even check up on you because they truly care about their students. Take advantage of office hours, professors have them for a reason. If I were given the opportunity to choose a school over again I would definitely still choose Randolph-Macon. It gives students an experience they would not get at a large school. It is true when people say you cannot walk down the sidewalk without seeing the smiling face of someone you know and I love that about my school."
College Junior,5,We are right outside RVA. Anything you could ever want is within a 20  minute drive.
College Junior,5,They are very easy to work with and always want to help you.
College Senior,5,Although there are a few things that would be better if they changed I would choose R-MC all over again because it has been the best 4 years of my life so far.
College Sophomore,5,It is the best because their are many options no matter what you are into.
College Sophomore,5,The athletic department has changed my life in the best way
College Senior,5,"The professors are wonderful. They are always willing to help, and have your best interest in mind. I love the small class sizes too because students get more immediate attention."
College Senior,5,Most student life buildings are very new (within the last 5 years). Everything is modern with a lot of options of things to do.
College Senior,5,I have never felt unsafe walking on or around campus. Everything is well-lit and the campus safety officers are more than willing to assist if need be.
College Sophomore,5,"All the professors are very willing to help you get focused and make the best grades possible.

I really feel like they care."
College Freshman,5,I love the Asian Studies program. The professors are wonderful and are so very helpful!
College Junior,5,Even the smaller sports are somewhat attended. Alumni is awesome!
College Junior,5,They are great. Don't be stupid and they will leave you alone. Helpful if you need them.
College Junior,5,"Theta Chi has the smartest, best looking and nicest guys"
College Junior,5,Thought I would spend a year and then transfer out. I was surprised at how much I love the school. I'm involved in a smaller sport (not football) and my coach is great as are my teammates. I'm in the a Honors program and the classes are challenging and the professors are excellent. Andrews Hall is the best dorm if you can get in. The one thing I really dislike is the food. The food at Estes is terrible. Theta Chi Fraternity Is the best!
College Freshman,5,The school takes every step necessary for students to be successful!
College Freshman,5,"Nothing dangerous ever happens in Ashland. In fact, the cops say the most ""dangerous"" thing that's happened here in the past 20 years is people speeding. However, the police station is just off campus and they say they can be to anywhere on campus without 70 seconds. The campus safety police are also very present and willing to assist with almost anything. I have had them let me in to my room when I've locked myself out numerous times. They have also jumped my car for me a few times as well. They're also willing to simply walk with students who are uncomfortable walking alone after dark. 

The Ashland Police have a presence on campus as well. In fact, if you're ever walking on campus after dark, chances are you will see at least one police car driving down the road."
College Freshman,5,"Personally, I LOVE the local atmosphere. Ashland is a small, very historic town that was established during the revolutionary era. So if you're someone who is even remotely interested in seeing how our country began, you would definitely enjoy Ashland. There are plenty of museums and historic businesses (such as Cross Bros. Grocery which has been in business for nearly 200 years!). The scenery both on and off of campus is just astoundingly beautiful. It's almost impossible to come here and NOT fall in love with it."
College Freshman,5,"The weather is much better in Ashland than where I am from in Indiana. I love the mild winters, lack of snow, and the warmth of the other seasons as well. I LOVE having all four seasons without ever truly having a horrible winter. It's perfect."
College Freshman,5,"Ashland is a cute town with alot going for it, everything you need is here..."
College Freshman,5,Everything you could think of is in driving distance...
Junior,4,"I love the feel of the small community Randolph-Macon has. I love that there is easy access to get to classes and to other resources we need. One thing that needs to be worked on though, is the diversity rate. I would love to see more students of color on the campus. I would also like to see better food options as well."
Freshman,4,It was ok! Online school is going to tough for most people but Randolph-Macon makes it feel like you are sitting in the classroom.
Freshman,4,I really like the staff. They are truly caring compassionate people who just want to see the students succeed. After my concussion I was really looked after by the teachers staff and students. I just wish there were slightly better facilities.
Junior,4,Professors are invested in your learning and are dedicated to individual success. The environment is welcoming and always fun.
Freshman,4,Randolph-Macon is a great place. It has a very welcoming atmosphere. The sports are great as well as housing. The overall scene is wonderful and it is a great place to be.
Freshman,4,"R-MC has given me so many great opportunities. I have made relationships with friends and professors, already as a freshman.  I am involved in athletics, academics, and the arts, and all three aspects of the R-MC community thrive. With the small community, I always see a smiling familiar face, but I see a new one everyday, too. I always feel safe on campus, as well. The only thing I would change is the food at Estes. Brock is pretty decent, but since Estes is mass produced, Iâ€™d like to see more fresh options (ex: fruits, vegetables)."
Sophomore,4,"I love the liberal arts approach at Randolph Macon College. I believe that the college has some amazing professors who really seem to take the time to explain the material effectively to students and are always available for help. The academic and on-campus involvement opportunities are abundantly available to students. However, more diversity would be welcome on campus to create a more inclusive environment."
Junior,4,"I love my time here at RMC. The first reason is because of the hands on experiences you get in your major right in your freshman year. I have already worked with companyâ€™s like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Hampton Roads Sanitation District, and Stantec. I am going into my junior year! RMC also has a very friendly atmosphere! Itâ€™s easy to make friends here and you are guaranteed a wave on your way to every class!"
Freshman,4,"Here at Randolph-Macon is very interesting and fun.  I'm able to focus on my studies as well as hang with friends without falling behind in class.  The activities they have are fantastic and everyone is able to connect and make new friends.  The Randolph-Macon neighborhood is also peaceful and have cool shops, so if you want to get away from the campus life, just into town and explore."
Junior,4,"Academics are overall very good. Food is subpar, and housing is okay, with a few nice places on campus. I love the small class sizes."
Senior,4,This is a great college for those who would love a small environment. The classes are great sizes and the professors work with you when necessary. The students are friendly and the surrounding area is great.
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere of Randolph-Macon. It's small but not too small and you feel very welcome there and it feels like home.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Randolph-Macon College. The academics here are stellar, as are the faculty and staff. I have felt like I am home since I began attending Randolph-Macon in 2016 and still feel that way now. The experiences I have been able to take part in both in and out of the classroom have set me apart from my peers at neighboring colleges and universities. I think the food and the safety at RMC could be improved with better guidance and feedback from students."
Sophomore,4,The campus is very nice.  I like it because it is small and walkable.  The class sizes are amazing because you get the attention you need to understand and take in the material.  I highly recommend it!
Senior,4,The staff and faculty are committed to the success of all students and dedicated to helping those students achieve in both academics and their personal lives.
Freshman,4,"Randolph-Macon is an good university with a great looking campus, decent party scene, and an awful cafeteria food. The amount of outside options for getting food make up for the lack of taste at estes. Done prepared to spend money off campus."
Sophomore,4,"Due to the small size of Randolph-Macon, every student has the opportunity to develop personal relationships with their professors as well as administrators."
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman on campus. I  love the college, my classes, and my professors, but there are definitely aspects I don't enjoy. For example, the Honors Program is pretty terrible and fails to offer anything worthwhile to its members, I don't think being a part of the honors program is worth it. Also, the food on campus isn't very good. The idea of Birdsong Cafe is nice, but I don't like the food very much. Greenberry's, however, is amazing. More importantly, however, is the fact that I am so close with my professors already and they all want to see me succeed more than anything. There are countless opportunities for any major and the Edge Program is phenomenal. The (freshman) dorms are nice, especially Andrews and Garland. The sense of community and school spirit is evident and really nice to be a part of. Everything that matters on a larger scale is nice but some of the smaller, less significant aspects (like expensive printing and food) fall short. "
College Senior,4,"Roommates can be hard to find, but overall the dorms provide alternative spaces for studying, etc"
College Senior,4,"Brand New facilities for Football Lacrosse, Outstanding Baseball Team and Basketball"
College Senior,4,I feel very safe at Randolph Macon College. There is also a police station close to campus.
College Senior,4,At Randolph Macon there are some very nice housing arrangements and some that are not so nice.
College Senior,4,I am not a greek but a lot of my close friends are.
College Senior,4,Randolph Macon College is a school that fosters progressive action.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is huge on campus. The best parties are always in fraternity houses and everybody knows who is in what fraternity
College Sophomore,4,"R-MC is a very small school, which makes it easier to maneuver around campus. Everyone knows everyone which is a plus and a minus. In addition, Macon is big on sports even though we are not the best, the spirit is there with everyone."
College Freshman,4,I feel completely safe on campus. I am never worried about anyone harming me or my friends. The campus safety officers are very friendly and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"You have a lot of options when it comes to looking for internships which obviously help lead to careers. The edge program may seem a little overbearing with all of the emails they send you, but they know what they're doing."
College Freshman,4,"I love the size of the classes! Because they are smaller you have more of an opportunity to participate in class and ask questions. I feel that there is a good variety of courses here, but they don't have some majors that some people are looking for. But, even though that is true, you can usually talk with your advisor and kind of create your own major."
College Freshman,4,I've been going through a rough time my first year and my professors and the rest of the school staff have been very helpful and considerate.
College Junior,4,Professors all very caring and willing to help in any way they can. Class sizes are small so you get to know a lot of different people
College Junior,4,Alumni networking is great. Alumni often come back to the college for interviews
College Junior,4,"Sports are a big part of campus, as a small school they bring us together."
College Junior,4,"Professors truly care about all students. Campus is beautiful. Small numbers, everyone knows everyone."
College Freshman,4,There are parties almost every weekend.
College Freshman,4,Usually the parties take place in fraternities but they also take place in peoples dorms
College Freshman,4,Drug and alcohol visibility are low and the policy enforcement is average.
College Freshman,4,Athletes work very hard every day and strive to do their best in every game. The facilities allow the athlete to continue their training when not in season.
College Freshman,4,They are very involved in school and participate in community service events.
College Freshman,4,"Campus security is very helpful. I always feel safe when I walk home from work, a sporting event, or late nights in the library."
College Freshman,4,"I am here to get a college degree with the rigorous education , but I am also having fun on campus with many school activities, clubs, and sports."
College Freshman,4,The career program works very closely with you to insure that after you graduate college you will have a job most likely in the field that you hope for.
College Freshman,4,"I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to live in Randolph-Macon's newest freshman dorm, Andrews. It is very spacious, has a large common room with multiple televisions and is suite style. Although the other freshman dorms are a little older and less spacious I hear that students still love where they live because they become very close with their hall-mates. All of the dorms are located so that it will not take more than 10 minutes to walk to class (and that is a slow walk including walking into the classroom)."
College Freshman,4,"The liberal arts education is remarkable, and the social aspect of the college is safe and fun!"
College Freshman,4,"I love that it's a small school so that you get to know other students and professors more easily.  There are tons of opportunities to join clubs and enjoy other social events.  Classes are challenging.  The food is okay, but could definitely be better."
College Sophomore,4,"The process was pretty simple for me, but i was more of a special case, i came later in the year for the spring semester and i was late with most stuff. Despite my lateness in was still helped and greeted kindly when i came to ask questions. In my personal experience i feel that since this school has is smaller it is easier to work with students individually because there is time, and that is exactly what i got. I had one friend at the school that really wanted to come back for the next school year, but was struggling financially. He went and talked to the people in the financial aid office and he was given the names of some of the alumni. When he got into the Alumni network they did their best to help him with the finances and anything else that could be helped with. The people at Randolph Macon College as well as the Alumni really want the best for the students and try their best to accommodate every student in any situation."
College Freshman,4,"So far, my experiences have been pretty great. People get back to me in a relatively timely manner. I think the only difficult thing is that the school thinks my family can pay more than we actually can, which is almost nothing."
College Junior,4,I would do it all over again.
College Junior,4,I love the class sizes. Its great going to a small school because all of the professors want to help and get to know you as a student.
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus. Great campus officers and resources.
College Junior,4,There is a lot of school spirit involving tail gates for football games against rival teams. Our mens basketball team shows the most school spirit.
College Freshman,4,There are several different places all over ashland and into hanover county to get food and diversif ythe dining experience. It is also a short drive to Richmond to enjoy the commodities provided there.
College Freshman,4,"I was awarded a grant from the school upon acceptance due to high school academic achievments and then the financial aid office also gave me a good package. This initial package was not exactly up to snuff with my family financial needs so we were able to easily set up an appointment, work with the financial officers at the college, and get the money we neede in order to afford the college."
College Freshman,4,"Parties are extremely fun on campus. Because it is a small school, people are easily able to find the parties they want to be at with the people they want to bethere with. There are also plenty of options for those individuals who enjoy social life, but not neccesarily parties like late night buzz and dorm activities."
College Freshman,4,"The housing is not as bug as i expected, but it is just enough space to be comfortable without feeling cramped. I personally love my room and the set up that i was able to create with my roommate with the space provided. The housing office is also very cooperative and easy to approach of an issue arises."
College Junior,4,They do their jobs without being crappy about it.
College Junior,4,It is college. Have fun. Be safe. R-MC is good for those who aren't about the party life and for those who love it.
College Junior,4,"R-MC may be small, but this is such an advantage. Brand new freshmen dorms and senior apartments are a huge plus."
College Senior,4,"I was offered a substantial amount of money, and I know a lot of people who are on full rides. The sticker price of the school is insane, but if you're a good student, you'll get thousands of dollars in scholarships. I was also able to interview for more money, and you have the option to always ask for a ""refresh"" of your financial situation to see if you qualify for more."
College Freshman,4,"There are two big scholarships freshmen can receive, Dean's Award or Presidential Scholarship. The Pres. Scholarship is the highest amount, with packages sometimes covering 2/3s or more of tuition, and the Dean's Award typically covers about a third. R-MC is very generous about their financial aid and will give the money you need, typically, and it doesn't hurt to ask for more (which is what I did--and I received)."
Sophomore,2,"Diversity: There is a HUGE LACK of diversity at this school. Nearly 90% of the students are cookie-cut white kids. As a minority, I honestly felt very out of place since everyone was so boringly-alike another person.

Food: The food is alright, but because there are only 3 places to choose from, you get bored of the options really quickly. 3 places to eat at (1 is a small ""cafe""). Dining hall estes is edible, but since they have tried to be ""diverse"" with their cooking, things have not been good.

Education: The education at RMC is extremely rigorous and difficult! I am a smart student, IB diploma recipient, top 5% in high school, yet received a 2.5 first semester. The professors are there to help, and somewhat care about you, but dont even think about asking them to round up your grades or for extra credit. ALSO RMC CREDITS TRANSFER HORRIBLY

If you are looking an easy major or easy workload of classes, DO NOT come to this school. The learning is fast-paced and very hard."
Alum,2,"Randolph-Macon College relies almost purely on its reputation as a historically prestigious liberal-arts college. It is steadily lowering academic standards in hopes to grow the college. However, it is not prepared to accommodate students, with housing already at capacity with just above 1,400 students. R-MC's graduation rate has dropped almost 10% in the past three years, most likely caused by its acceptance rate also dropping 8%. The college is willingly admitting students who they know do not have what it takes to graduate. It does this all while charging tuition nearly double that of Harvard or Yale. On the bright side, Randolph-Macon does have very successful athletics for such a small school."
Alum,2,"What happened to this school?  Ranked 138th by US News and World Report, an anemic endowment of 128 million, Nursing and Criminology majors easily found at your local community college..... the list goes on and on. The school's current administration is dead set on changing the ""DNA"" of this school and it
shows. Putting your finger up in the air to see which way the wind blows is no way to run a school. Gimmicky show choirs, cheer teams and Yellow Jackets plastered everywhere reek of midwestern high schools of the fifties. Additionally, if your going to promote a students progression to a graduate program at least make it one thats notable...attending Liberty or Regent University is not an honorable achievement by most academic standards."
Freshman,2,"Food is always awful, hope you love ramen and microwaved mashed potatoes! People often get sick from eating at the main dining hall so avoid it at all costs. Tuition is very high for the facilities and education I am receiving, do not count on getting a scholarship here unless you have a high gpa and can keep it there or you play a sport. I've had a problem with professors emailing me back, they claim they want to help but not unless you are willing to track the person down and demand they help."
Senior,2,"Life here is what you make it. Academics are tough but the teachers are amazing if you can find them. Diversity is a thing at Randolph-Macon if you want to live like the Jim Crow days, where there is a whole lot of white and nothing else. Sports here are fantastic when there is a game you will see the unconditional support that the school has for its team. Fraternity and sorority life is the way to go. The parties there are spectacular if you can get in that is. The President of Randolph-Macon cares so much about his school that he Is building a science center for us, which will be where current and new students will be sleeping because all the dorm rooms will be filled putting at least three people to a room. Isnâ€™t that exciting. Sure, way to make friends is to live with two other people in your personal space, stepping on your things because there isnâ€™t enough closet space for all the things you bought. 
So, come on down to RMC the happiest place to be!"
College Junior,2,Fraternities have been dwindling on campus due to probation.
College Junior,2,You make your own fun
College Junior,2,"Going back to the lesson of beating the system, RMC provides another great exercise of getting around things with their off-campus policy. Recently changing the age requirement to live off-campus from 22 to 23 does not stall students from lying about medical conditions, proximity to campus from ""home"", age or etc."
College Junior,2,"RMC is a private school, which in part secretly means they like to keep everything private. Anything that can give the school a bad reputation is punishable."
College Freshman,2,"I do not attend athletic events, the football team is not that great and all the other sporting events are barely paid attention to."
College Freshman,2,Most of the girls here are very preppy as well as some guys. The girls usually wear Lily Pulitzer with Jack Rodger shoes during the summer and spring;  but in the winter its boots and a north face during the colder seasons. The preppy guys wear Vineyard Vines and Polo while the normal boys wear sweatshirt and khakis or jeans.
College Senior,2,"Doesn't make major changes for current food trends (gluten free). If you live on campus you are required to have a meal plan.  Don't really accommodate for students with dietary issues. Don't really offer organic, vegetarian, gluten free, or vegan meals. Many students complain about the campus food (particularly Estes) but it is probably more from the fact that they eat it everyday of the week up to 3 times everyday."
College Senior,2,Students are not allowed to live off-campus due to regulations that college has in place but there are a few exceptions.
College Senior,2,The process never went right the first time. Also after you receive your scholarships the amount you receive can not increase based on your college performance. It will stay the same all four years based on your high school performance.
College Freshman,2,"Frat parties are boring, all people do is get drunk because the campus is boring and there is nothing else to do on this campus for fun."
College Freshman,2,In a small town 15 miles away from Richmond.
College Freshman,2,This college feels like a boarding; teachers care if you don't show up to class even with a note of an excused absence. It's in a small city and there isn't alot to do on weekends. Many students stay in their rooms or go to the same frat party every weekend.The food is not very good and gets repetitive.
College Junior,2,living in a 24 hour quiet dorm that is not enforced is not good.  to complain to the administration doesn't seem to help
College Senior,2,"The food isn't that great. On several occasions, I have received uncooked food from the dining services. I know of several students who experienced food poisoning from the food. The overall review from the student body is very poor."
College Sophomore,2,I would rather eat out.
Senior,1,"Poor professors, horrible dorms (watch out for the tour day they show senior dorm. Food is horrible and makes most students ill -yet you can not waive a food plan even though you eat anywhere but there.   Most students are local commuters, its a glorified community college with a four year degree.  Make sure to ask to see Freshman village-notice anything?  Ask to see Mary Brach Dorms (sophomore housing)  a building of which has NO AC and is literally falling apart.  Next on your nightmare is junior year in Conrad or Mooreland a trip into filth"
Sophomore,1,"Randolph-Macon has earned the nickname 'Scamdolph- Macon' because this college is basically a boarding high school targeted at rich white d3 athletes.

nearly inedible food. after a couple weeks of estes, you will have a cast iron stomach. required to have a meal plan for 4 years (food $ for RMC! yay)
you have to live on campus in moldy dormitories for all for years, unless you have a medical waiver to live off campus (more housing $ for RMC! yay) 
there are no bars and no night life in ashland, the same frat parties happen every weekend with the same people- the fun frats have either been kicked off or on on probation.
you can't get the classes that you need for your major because there aren't nearly enough professors so all the classes fill up within minutes of sign-up- this results in having to take a 5th year(more $$$ for RMC! yay)"
Freshman,1,"Food- The food was awful, freshman had serious stomach issues the first couple of weeks
Dorms- my building smelled like cat piss. 2/3 of the showers were broken for 3 months. A room flooded 3 times before they actually fixed the problem. some do not have AC, and a certain building has given people toxic mold syndrome. you live in a dorm w/ roommate until senior year, when you have a small chance to get a apt
Off campus housing- need a medical reason or live w/in 20 min
Bars- 0 bars
Parties- frat parties on the weekends, ~hard to get into. Off campus parties(limited) get shut down quickly every time. 
ACADEMICS-great class size, and personal experience. Tons of writing."
Senior,1,If you plan on being a student athlete do not come here. RMC does not work with or care about student athletes even though we bring campus life and publicity to the school. Countless professors have given me a hard time about missing class due to athletics. I even have had to pay out of pocket for an online class at a community college due to RMCâ€™s class scheduling during all of my games. When I talked to the professor to try and work out a solution he basically just told me I had to choose whether to take the class or play that yea.
Freshman,1,"To sum it up, some professors will hold a grudge over you and give you bad grades (I have heard many stories of so). Some professors also only give one exam prior to the final, so if you get a bad grade on the exam, like me who got below a 60 on a exam I worked very hard on, harder than most students in that class, which brought my A down to a B-. You can't bring that grade up because there's only one exam, so my grade for that class and GPA are ruined because of one exam (which I believe was unfairly graded). There is a council for when students misbehave, but I believe there should be a cancel for when professors misbehave. Some professors offer extra credit, some don't care if they fail you. Food is disgusting, I've only eaten in Estes (main cafeteria) twice. I've been eating at Brock (mini McDonalds, with nastier food). I'm leaving this school.

If you're the life of a party and don't mind graduating with a 2.0 GPA, this is the school for you."
Senior,1,"If you are considering this school, Do not go. The administration does not care about students, their scheduling system makes completing the honors program and second majors challenging if not impossible. The residence halls are infested with spiders, roaches, and are generally low quality. Additionally, the school will not work with you in emergency situations such as the loss of a loved one or of a home. The Dean of student's recommended that I live in my car over Christmas break because they will not approve requests to stay on campus over break unless you are on a sports team or are an international student, even if you do not have a home to go to for one reason or another. There is no party scene.  The class choices are strongly limited and classes fill up incredibly fast making it difficult to get into the classes you need or are interested in."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not trust that a degree from this college will help me, I think the associations I made with my high school will get me further in life."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is horrible, especially since there is only one dining cafeteria on campus. The place in brock commons is alright but it closes by 11 so that blows. The cafe in brock is open until like 1, so you better hope you have snacks in your dorm room. The library is not up to date. Greek life bites because there are only three sororities and eight fraternities. KA got kicked off and SAE is on suspension so the two best fraternities are not active. Lambda chi's empty house is a complete eyesore for the campus. You can hear trains and getting caught behind the gate sucks because you can wait up to 10 minutes sometimes. The dorms are small. There are not a lot of parties and the ones they do throw typically have a guest list and it is all BYOB. The one positive thing about the school is that there are two gyms so you will not be kicked out of the gym in the middle of your workout for a team practice. The turf field is nice as well."
College Junior,1,Crazy rules that prevent students from living off campus
College Junior,1,"No, just no. Between the fear of food poisoning and/or having the runs versus going hungry, I'd pick trying to do what Ghandi did any day."
College Senior,1,"Until they lose the contract with Chartwells, it's terrible. They've *recently* begun improving on variety, but I know people who habitually get sick from the food because it's so cheap and non-nutritious. Dining Dollars/swipes aren't able to be used in the community, only at the two places on campus to eat. You feel locked in to eating on campus."
College Freshman,1,"As a minority in this college, I have experienced the most racism here. Professor think it is okay to use racial slurs in class and students who are not White often times stick together.There is not much diversity here; many students of color leave this college because of the environment."
College Freshman,1,"The food is gross at Estes. The only food I will actually eat are the sandwiches and salads. The only other options is a place called Mondos in the Brock commons; they make burgers, subs, flatbreads, chicken tenders, grilled cheese and other types of sandwiches."
College Freshman,1,This school is mostly made of Greeks.
College Freshman,1,"If you want to get anywhere, you either have to walk, drive, or hope one of your friends can drive."
College Freshman,1,"If we didn't have the new Commons, life would be way worse, and even the food there isn't always that great. The food in Estes is absolutely awful. The only time there is good food is usually on Friday and whenever there is an event involving parents or alumni. I have eaten cereal for so many meals, it's ridiculous. I haven't talked to any other student that has liked the food. "
College Sophomore,1,"It doesn't exist, literally, so I can't really give it an accurate rating."
College Freshman,1,everyone here always brags about the diversity which is sad to me because its like 70% white. And all the white people are preppy and the same. There are little to no asians or people from latin america. The international students can give the school a little flare tho.
College Freshman,1,"The dining at RMC is terrible. Seriously. Estes, the dining hall, closes at 8:00 and the Brock Commons Cafe closes at 10 so if you get hungry after then, consider yourself out of luck. The food is not that great and they have very little options."
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene is apparent at school. You can smell the marijuana in the halls of the dorms and the beer cans or in the trash as well as on the roof and in the grass. At parties, it is apparent that people have been drinking and some even have cups of alcohol in their hands. There have been 40oz. bottles laying on the grass of the football field and vomit everywhere on campus. On the second week of school, there was vomit everywhere on campus. Since then, the amount has decreased but it still is a problem."

Niche User,5,"When I first walked on campus I was welcomed by warm smiles from unfamiliar faces. They made me feel right at home without skipping a beat. The campus is very beautiful and open, just like the people there. I loved all that the athletics had to offer me and I enjoyed meeting with current students. They were very honest and gave me tips for when I attend Earlham in the fall."
Niche User,5,"I did not take online although currently, some students are due to COVID-19. I met with some professors on my visit & they all were very welcoming. They gave me tips about classes and seemed very involved."
Alum,5,"N/A I didn't take any classes online, but I couldn't submit my review without filling this section out."
Alum,5,"I have not taken any online classes at Earlham College, so I cannot give an authentic feedback. I am very sorry."
Alum,5,"As an international student who came to the United States for the first time in my life, studying at Earlham College was the best decision, I have ever made. The best experience at Earlham College was that I met so many other international students in class and domestic students who were passionate about learning more about different cultures. Thanks to their presence, I felt like I am not the minority on campus.
Earlham has a culturally inclusive environment, so whoever I talked to, I felt respected and heard. Earlham students are supportive and understanding, so whenever I needed some help, students were willing to show their helping hands to me. I was truly blessed to be in the open-minded, friendly, and caring community."
Junior,5,"Earlham is an amazing college for those who choose to seek out the opportunities that it offers. A student can receive funding from the EPIC advantage program which will allow them to create an internship or research project that is fully funded and enables the student to gain experience. The small class sizes and overly qualified professors make the class room environment a caring and challenging one. Earlham has the capacity to build Rhode Scholar students, with the hands on professors and numerous research opportunities. For those saying it is is easy, then take different classes (because trust me, there are some difficult ones) the experience is what you make it."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year in Earlham College and it has honestly been the best educational experience I have received so far. I like all the resources Earlham College provides, like the scholarships and many programs like EPIC. I also like how the professors care about each student and how they are doing. The one thing I would change about Earlham might be just renovating the dorms. But overall Earlham College is very nice and helpful from students to all of the faculty."
Alum,5,"Earlham offers an education that can and will prepare you to achieve any endeavor after graduation. The commitment to student growth and learning are beyond that of most colleges in America, and the professors are exceptional human beings and compassionate to student needs and interests. Earlham also offers several opportunities throughout the year to see and hear from exceptional visiting lecturers and performing artists, from T-Pain to bel Hooks. Richmond Is a small and rather poor midwest town, but has a tradition and history in music and fine art that dates back to the early 1800s. I met some of the most interesting and wonderful lifelong friends at Earlham, and though it doesn't have fraternity life, it has a social scene that is more fun and more memorable than I've seen at many other universities and colleges. The campus is beautiful, and includes 80 acres of Indiana forest. What else can I say? I'm glad I picked Earlham."
Freshman,5,"The diverse student body is the most exciting thing about Earlham. I have learned so much from just talking to such a large group of students with different perspectives on life. The professors are all so caring and truly want their students to succeed academically. They are also so clearly passionate about what they are teaching, it is inspiring. Anyone who is up for an adventure, will succeed at Earlham."
Junior,5,"Earlham College is a diverse college with beautiful surroundings. We have a large portion of international students here, which can let us share different cultures and experience a lot. Even though it is a small college, you can find really interesting things here and have a wonderful four-year college life here."
Junior,5,The atmosphere is excellent and the Faculty are caring and smart. There is a strong focus on diversity and inclusion which makes the college feel very safe. Also there are lots of beautiful trees back campus.
Sophomore,5,"Earlham is a great place to be if you are looking for diversity and engagement in the community. Having a smaller class benefits the students to have a better environment to learn. Also, have easy acess to communicate with the Professors. I think it is an amazing school for its culture and beliefs."
Senior,5,"Great school with excellent study abroad opportunities. Coupled with the small classroom sizes and close-knit community, it fosters a great environment for learning both inside and outside the classroom."
Junior,5,I think it is a nice place for those who want to explore their options with in the academic setting.
Alum,5,"A unique college that changes lives! A dense thoughtful community which will challenge your world view, and help you develop into a compassionate person. You can not graduate without being challenged academically or by the community."
Niche User,5,"I am a parent of an Earlham Student(class of 2020) and I also am in secondary education.  (As a teacher and the advisor for students doing elite college applications.) 

I am thrilled with the edcuation that my son is getting at Earlham. Comparing it to my other kids who have attended at Amherst, Middlebury, and Bowdoin, the Earlham education is every bit as good, and - in some ways - better.

I am impressed with my former students who return from Earlham on their breaks.  They advance quickly when it comes to their academic and intellectual development, as well as their independence, confidence, and their overall awareness of the world. After one year at Earlham, when compared to their peers from the same high-school cohort, Earlham students are generally more advanced in their development. And after four years, they tend to be significantly more advanced."
Alum,5,"I thrived in Earlham's collaborative learning environment surrounded by people who wanted to do good in the world more than they wanted to do well. Thankfully, I've been able to do both since graduating in 2004, thanks largely to the connections I made through my peers, faculty, and alumni. There are numerous opportunities for student leadership, and students are good at making their own fun (since Richmond isn't really a destination town).  I went to big suburban public high school, and I was so fascinated to meet classmates from wildly different educational experiences. Earlham attracts some unconventionally awesome people. Earlhamites hold themselves, their peers, and especially the institution to high standards. If you want to change the world for the better and surround yourself with others who do too, this place is for you."
Alum,5,"If you are looking for a close-knit community that challenges you intellectually and personally to become a leader and change agent in the world, Earlham is for you!"
Senior,5,"Earlham is a place where faculty and students work as a team when doing research. Professors do their best to make themselves available at the most odd hours of the day and they actually care about you and how much you are learning. You feel special as a student and you get to ask your questions and express yourself. Athletics are popular and we have Lacrosse, Tennis, Track, Soccer, Football, Baseball and lots of student life groups as well as friday afternoons with pets. You are having fun as you are learning a lot and getting prepared for the workforce."
Alum,5,"I would love everyone in the world to have the challenging, thoughtful, purposeful, life-changing and powerful college experience (academically, emotionally/mentally/spiritually and athletically)  I had.  With the changes Earlham has made (academic and athletic conference, drinking policy and college leadership and faculty staff appreciation/benefits/support), I'm not sure anyone can have that experience now, including at current-day Earlham."
Alum,5,"Earlham College is a life changing institution! It’s diverse, but cozy campus brings so many people together in one place and creates a family atmosphere! Earlham challenges you academically, also, socially! You grow and mature intellectually, along with morally! You gain an irreplaceable education, along with a lifelong passion for respect and humility for every race or creed in the world!"
Sophomore,5,"During my experience at Earlham College so far, it has been fantastic. I have met so many great people here in just one year. Everyone on campus is so nice and easygoing. The classes and professors are also wonderful. There is just a variety of majors and classes to take. Not just academics but there are curricular activities on campus as well. There are so many different clubs and sports that you can join. There is so much that one can do on and off of campus throughout the school year. I highly recommend applying for Earlham College or just coming to visit our campus sometime, you will truly love it!"
Alum,5,"As an Earlham alum, I can't say enough about the impact and amazing transformation this place has had on my life and the person I am today.  If you want to be challenged to think critically, to change the world, to see the world, to develop life-long relationships with people you spent your time on campus with (be they classmates or faculty), and to study with a diverse population (that is unparalleled in a liberal arts school anywhere in this country) then Earlham is for you.  Its important to visit and experience first hand the community and engagement that exists at this very special placee. I promise it will be worth your while."
Freshman,5,Earlham College is a great university dedicated to providing a top notch education to all of its students.
Freshman,5,Earlham is an awesome school full of amazing people and some really neat classes. I love the tight community and the close connection with faculty. There are also so many extracurricular activities and academic opportunities . I do wish the school had more political diversity. The school has great financial aid and scholarships too!
Junior,5,Earlham is a great school with many opportunities. They offer great financial aid which can be put toward a semester abroad also.
Freshman,5,Earlham encourages people to be themselves and reach for their full potential without inhibition. I think that the student life committee needs to be more involved with the student body.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are, for the most part, incredibly helpful, passionate, and knowledgeable. They go by their first names (because of the Quaker values of Earlham) which makes them more approachable in some ways. Courses in every area are challenging and engaging. A lot of the assigned readings are incredibly interesting, and on more than one occasion I've discussed them with friends (in a non-academic setting). Courses are also frequently interdisciplinary, drawing on and connecting several subjects. Classes are usually very small (10-20), with a few intro classes reaching 50-60 students."
College Sophomore,5,"I've become a person, and I love my education."
College Sophomore,5,I didn't encounter any challenges. the professors and students alike are very welcoming and inclusive. Admissions cares more about the content of your character than test scores.
College Sophomore,5,"I love it! lots of great opportunities, very available resources, and there's always someone to answer your questions."
College Junior,5,"Earlham gives a lot of financial aid, especially to international students from UWC schools and through the Bonner scholarship."
College Senior,5,"I am very happy with my program, I love the arts and I find it so rich and fulfilling.  If I did it over again I would still choose are and do pretty much the same thing I am doing now. For my future I would really love to make a living off of my work so I can use the money to enrich others lives through my art and by helping them have a better life. I worry about the opportunities for people in the arts, it is not a highly sought after carrier and people do not seem as interested in it, which makes me worry about getting a job or supporting myself with my work."
College Senior,5,"My program is fairly time consuming but it is very fun. I love it, there is a laid back atmosphere and the professors are very insightful and helping. A unique aspect of the Arty major is you can literally do what ever you want, there is not a limit to the types of art you can do, and if they do not have what you are looking for they will find it or find the closest thing to it. The work load is pretty heavy you have to take a lot of classes to get the needed credits. The classes are great and so are the professors."
College Senior,5,"Getting into the Art major at Earlham was fairly easy. I have not encountered that many difficulties in the major other than the challenge of skill, time and patients. There was not an admission processes for my major. There was not an application."
College Junior,5,"There are many different religions, ethnicities, political beliefs, and religious backgrounds also sexual orientations on Earlham College campus. The students are amazing and very accepting it's the administration that must be wearied. I found myself very pleased though with all the amazing people I was able to meet. I am now friends with students all over the world. This is easy to do considering the small population and the high rate of exchange students. My first year I lived with a wonderful woman from Uganda, had friends from Swazi, Nigeria, Serbia, Mali, Spain, Greece, Russia, Sri Lanka, and the list goes on..."
College Freshman,5,There are people from absolutely everywhere here; I have many friends who are international students or exchange students.
College Freshman,5,"Diversity is a huge thing at Earlham. I have made friends from all over; Palestine, Vietnam, China, Ghana...and they are just wonderful individuals. Most of them come from UWC program. They have such worldly knowledge and it's great. 
Earlham is also known for their Japanese program. Japanese exchange students com every year. Even if you are not in the Japanese program, meeting these individuals are really quite an experience.

Sexual orientation is not a problem if you are afraid to not be accepted. LGBTQ is accepted extremely here. You will not be judged and everyone really wants to be friends with everyone.

The political beliefs run mainly Democratic, which is expected in a liberal arts. 

Biggest thing is community...it's a principle lived by here. You will be accepted no matter where you come from as long as you let yourselves into the community. You will find your place for sure."
College Freshman,5,"I got a substantial amount of financial aid from my school, which made it possible for me to attend. The scholarships usually span all four years of school, so you don't need to keep submitting for them every year."
College Freshman,5,There is definitely a lot of diversity. Not only are there students from ALL OVER but you also see mixed groups of friends. Yeah there are cliques with people of one ethnicity but there are also tons of groups of people of mixed ethnicity and everyone's really accepting.
Alum,4,"I had a great time at Earlham. I learned a ton and grew a ton. More importantly, I loved the environment because it was full of smart, capable, and caring people, all of whom wanted to make the world a better place and we're ready to work to do so!"
Freshman,4,"I took online classes after my spring break. Professors were understanding of the whole situation and placed a higher emphasis on our wellbeing. Generally, there was more leniency with deadlines and assignments, and the workload was reduced."
Freshman,4,"Professors at Earlham are very kind and they want students to succeed. They're very willing to help and work with students, and it's easy to communicate with them outside of class. In general, class size is not very big, so it's easier to bond with your professors. There are a wide variety of interesting classes that you can take. You can also take music lessons and there are scholarships that you can earn to help pay for them. There is an athletics center that anyone can use, but I wouldn't say sports are super major. There's not much to do on campus, and the town (Richmond) doesn't have a lot of entertainment to offer, but there is a grocery store very close to campus. Students here are very kind and the community is diverse. There are many international students that study here. Housing and food is average."
Alum,4,"Small campus, but very connected and open. Professors are always willing to help. You can create your own Major and while there isn't a lot to do in Richmond there are plenty of places to eat."
Alum,4,"Chose EC as (1) probably the best Japanese Studies program at a 4yr liberal arts school, (2) a relatively affordable option that offered the scholarships I needed, and (3) a Quaker school. Not disappointed on any of those fronts. Also loved the social engagement of the student body."
Niche User,4,"The campus was absolutely beautiful, head coach of track and field was extremely nice, and gave a great tour of the college! Can't wait to go back for another visit!"
Sophomore,4,My first year experience was very good. Everyone there is so nice and helpful and are very open. You know the teachers on personal level which makes it easier to ask questions and understand the material.
Sophomore,4,"I love it there, the professors are so nice and easy to befriend. They really want you to succeed and will do what they can to help you do so. Plus there's a bunch of extracurricular activities. If there isn't one you want, it's pretty easy to start one."
Freshman,4,"I like that Earlham College takes the time to get to know you. They really are one-on-one. Any time I had a problem with signing up for something or getting a loan to go through or really just any questions at all, Earlham faculty really took the time to understand the problem and help make it right."
Junior,4,Earlham is a great college with a great academic environment and aspiring professors. The college is diverse with lots of international students. Classes size is small so the interaction between students and professors is high. I learned a lot from Earlham and from my
Freshman,4,"Earlham has excellent academic, and I've enjoyed my time here overall. However, there are significant things that could be improved at the school, and some things that make being an Earlhamite extra difficult, such as the area of Richmond, limited on campus opportunities, and occasionally obnoxious, rude students."
College Freshman,4,"I always feel safe on campus, often walking alone late at night without any worries. That being said, sexual assault has been an issue on campus (as on every campus). Administration response has been frustrating, but students have responded incredibly well. Earlham students believe and support survivors of sexual assault. This past semester, a student publicly called out an assaulter in order to draw attention to the issue. AASV (action against sexual violence) is an on-campus student organization that discusses and raises awareness surrounding the issue. Although administration needs to step up its game, the student community is really good about addressing the issue of sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,"Dorm quality varies a lot. For freshman dorms, Barrett is usually considered better than Bundy. Bundy has a livelier atmosphere and slightly larger rooms, but Barrett is much cleaner and has AC (which is important for more than just August and May). There are also lots of spaces in the theme houses, which have the advantage of being closer to Dominos and Marsh, having more living space (which can also be used for parties), and living without RAs."
College Freshman,4,"Earlham attracts an incredibly diverse group of students and professors, and classes are challenging but manageable. We have tons of great traditions, like Beerster (beers are hidden all over campus around Easter time) and Whiskey Tue."
College Freshman,4,Campus security is fairly accessible.
College Freshman,4,I hope to have good career prospects as the school is known for its commitment to public and social service.
College Freshman,4,I have had great professors and courses.
College Freshman,4,"It's still the only school that I would consider attending due to the small size, the academic standards, the course options, the student population, and the professor credentials."
College Sophomore,4,"The wellness center in my school is very nice and well-designed for everyone to work out.

The baseball stadium is one of the nice facilities Earlham has."
College Sophomore,4,"In terms of academics, Earlham is very rigorous and has a lot of inspirational professors who are willing to help. In terms of community, Earlham is very friendly and internationally diverse. In terms of financial assistance, Earlham tends to be very generous and supportive."
College Senior,4,"It's pretty good, better in some ways than other similar schools"
College Freshman,4,There are many students for whom the deciding factor in coming to Earlham was financial aid. It tries very hard to give out the scholarships and grants incoming students need.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are always security guards patrolling the campus. They are approachable and willing to help. If something happens that should be addressed, emails and text alerts are sent out to the campus."
College Freshman,4,I plan to have a internship eventually. I think that the internship will be extremely helpful for my future and I believe that the college will definitely help me find an internship that fits my needs.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the fact that people at my college can dress and act in any way that they please. People do not make fun of others or judge them for being who they are. I enjoy that fact that people are very open and not closed minded to other cultures and interests.
College Freshman,4,The campus strictness is about the perfect amount. People are adults and should be treated like such. However there are rules that must be followed. The administration does a fine job of enforcing these rules.
College Freshman,4,There is constant safety on campus. Students are protected and feel safe. There have not been any crimes reported thus far.
College Freshman,4,The athletics at my school are not focused on pressuring students. The athletics program is just there for those students who wish to participate in sports. The program is very supportive of other sports and allows students to enjoy their college experience on and off the field. The athletics program allows for students to focus on their classwork as their main priority.
College Junior,4,"I love Mills, it's the best dorms to live in on campus in my opinion."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus crime is low, security bikes around and keeps an eye on students at night so we're safe, and I feel safe walking across campus at night and in the dorms. My one concern is when Richmond police try and get involved, as I don't trust them to have the student's best interests at heart."
College Sophomore,4,"At first it seems like there are only chains with a few exceptions, but once you find the good places it's not bad at all. La Mexicana is an authentic and amazing Mexican restaurant/grocery store that Earlham students love, and Square Donuts is a cheap donut place that is open crazy hours so midnight study break donuts are a thing."
College Sophomore,4,"You have an advisor who is one of the main teachers in your major, which really helps you form a bond with someone in your field. I would recommend tailoring your application around representing who you are as a person, rather than trying to seem impressive."
College Sophomore,4,"I find the teachers in my program are very qualified and inspire me to learn more about what they're teaching. If you visit the Center for Integrated Learning they are very willing to help you figure out how to get internship/job opportunities. A general thing for college students to realize though is that you have to try and get an internship, someone isn't just going to hand it to you (unless you already have the connections.) You need to try hard to make those initial connections, because they are key."
College Sophomore,4,"Printing can sometimes be a nightmare, since you have to go on a special website to do so, but otherwise, it's pretty good."
College Sophomore,4,"My hall is good. The dorm rooms are fairly spacious, and the bathrooms stay relatively clean. Other places are more rough, but on the whole, I think campus housing is good."
College Sophomore,4,My favourite thing about Earlham is being in the choir.
College Freshman,4,Work load difficult but worth it.
College Junior,4,"I've always had really good experiences with getting help for technical problems, sometimes printing can be annoying though."
College Senior,4,"Happy overall. Small field, may be difficult."
College Senior,4,"Very decent. Good faculty, courses available."
College Junior,4,Top #5 in terms of diversity
College Sophomore,4,"For its size, Earlham is one of the most diverse colleges I have ever been to.  It is not uncommon to hear three different languages being spoken just on your way to class, and something like 20% of the student body are international students.  In terms of financial status, Earlham's compliance with students' needs make it diverse in this aspect as well, especially by means of the Bonner Scholars Program.  I've known people who go here free of charge or who only pay a few thousand a year, a price that is unbeatable at most other schools.  As for political beliefs, the school seems to be overwhelmingly liberal, though I've met a few conservatives (all of whom tend to be on the football or baseball teams).  "
College Sophomore,4,"Earlham's parking is very easy to handle and quite convenient for students.  There are parking lots right outside of every dorm and classroom building, and since not everyone at this already small school has a car, parking spots are abundant.  "
College Sophomore,4,"We have free wireless access here at Earlham, which is quite reliable and fast. There is no need for a personal printer, but if you are a person who likes to study in their room that you would need a personal computer. There are many school computers available to students at any time."
College Sophomore,4,"People are very friendly and will try to socialize with new students. Generally, girls are more fashionable that guys. You'll find all sorts of people at Earlham. The most important thing though is that everyone is well accepted. 
Earlham has a diverse student body, with a lot of international students from all over the world."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many restaurants around school. Some of them are within the walking distance, but for most of them you would need to get a car ride. There are quite a few places that are not costly and have a very many varieties of food."
College Sophomore,4,"I does not snow a lot, it is never too hot or too cold. All the classrooms are within walking distance from dorms, so it is not a big deal if it snows or rains."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid process was very easy and gave me a very good package.
College Freshman,4,Nightlife is limited to mostly non alcoholic parties and gatherings which is fine if you are under 21 or not a drinker.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are very helpful, small classroom settings"
College Sophomore,4,At Earlham there are students from all over the world. Very diverse.
College Freshman,4,The facilities are nice; some buildings lack air conditioning but most buildings are undergoing or have undergone recent renovation.  A new arts building is currently under construction.
College Senior,4,"I would say that Earlham is a very diverse school in terms of many different aspects of diversity. Earlham has students from nearly 80 countries which allows you to interact with students from all over the world, which personally has been very rewarding. It is exciting to know that wherever, and seriously wherever, I travel in the world there is likely an Earlhamite a stones throw away that would want to grab a drink or let me crash at their place. As an openly gay student I have never felt unaccepted or ashamed of who I was at Earlham. In terms of sexual orientation I feel like Earlham more or less assumes people to be neither straight nor gay until they say otherwise, which allows people to be themselves without pressure."
College Freshman,4,"The professors at Earlham have come from very prestigious backgrounds. Many of them know their profession very well and love their subject matter. The passion can be seen in many of the professors, which is also why they are very open if you want to learn more about the subject. Their door is open and many of them are very welcoming.

Registration is easy (Except when a server crashes but thats' chill). The curriculum is pretty average. I say this because it is never so easy but it is never so extremely hard. Everything is doable as long as one manages time. In my experience, there is a lot of reading in all classes. Majority of Earlham relies on papers then tests (unless it is science and math...then it is tests). 
Gen-Ed's are a pain but not horrible. What is nice is that most teachers who can see the students who love the class and separate them for gen-ed's are quite understanding. If you're taking a Gen-Ed and struggling, again the teachers do not mind helping you out. They WANT you to PASS!  TA's are also very helpful as well and offer many special study sessions. 

If you need to study, there are two libraries where it is quite quiet. People also study in the coffeeshop and of course dorm rooms."
College Freshman,4,"Earlham College is a college that is underestimated as a liberal arts school. The college makes up for it with the amount of community that the college praises. My education here so far is satisfying....it is never to hard or to easy. There is always a push or challenge in whatever class you take. 
In terms of my major (HDSR), I really do enjoy the projects and discussions. As well, another potential major I have is PAGS. I'm on the fence for it because it can be biased. I also considered education. There is an MAT program, but education is not a big major here, if that is what you care for.
Earlham is also a great school for those of a science major. The science majors here are intense, especially Biology/Chemistry. Art as well. 
Teachers in general are very helpful and are very nice. They really do want to help you, so don't be shy to ask them for assistance. Majority of the time, the door is always open. Again, the sense of community is there."
College Sophomore,4,"I have been fortunate to meet people from India, from the Middle East,  from Asia.  In addition, there are many students from across the Northeast, Connecticutt, New York, new Jersey, and many students from Maine. I am therefore able to connect with a variety of people, and learn different culural valuses and customs."
College Freshman,4,"Most academics are pretty good. Our Biology, Environmental Science, Environmental Studies, Peace & Global Studies, Comparative Languages & Linguistics, and International Studies programs are the most well-regarded. There's criticism in that Sociology/Anthropology are thrown into one major, making a full study of either of those separate disciplines difficult and disappointing for SoAn majors. Many aspects of Sociology or Anthropology are not covered due to the merge."
College Freshman,4,"Most dorms are pretty decent. Bundy is out-dated, is the only dorm with no air conditioning, no kitchen on the 3rd floor, and all the laundry facilities are in the basement, but the lobby is the best for socializing and the rooms are the largest. Hoerner is very small and awkwardly shaped, plus the two floors are gender segregated and the kitchens are both in the basement. Barrett is the nicest as far as newly renovated, decent sized rooms (although inconsistent), kitchens and laundry on each floor, and closest to the student center (Runyan). OA virtually the same as Barrett, though closer to the Social Sciences and Humanities buildings (Landrum Bolling Center, Carpenter Hall). Warren, Wilson, and Mills are the newest dorms and make a U-shape (thus called ""The U""), they are nice and renovated and some have private bathrooms, but they are the furthest dorms from central campus and are known for wild upper-classman parties and property damage (that everyone gets common-billed for). Earlham Hall is connected to the cafeteria so that's nice, it's also clean and functional, although it's deadly quiet."
College Freshman,4,"Earlham's campus life is like no other. The student union (the HUB) was newly renovated a few years ago and is very modern. There are fast food joints, places to study, convention rooms, and an art gallery, it's a very popular hangout. There are tons of organizations to join, and there are always fun activities and events going on across campus."
College Freshman,4,"I definitely think there are a lot of attractive guys on campus (as well as a fair share of unattractive dudes). There are plenty of athletic types if you're into that, but there's a lot of guys that are smart/funny/whatever but not in an obnoxiously nerdy way. Basically a lot of the smart guys are good looking. As far as girls though, there's plenty of good looking girls. There's a lot of girls who don't shave, but everyone's pretty cool. Some groups that stand out on campus are hipsters, athletes, theater people, and stoners, but of course there are a lot of mixed groups and even though people might have their own friend group I've found people are quick to accept new people as their friends and hang out with people who don't necessarily share all their interests."
Niche User,2,"The academics at Earlham are beneficial for political science majors. There is a huge divide amongst athletes and non athletes. The athletic teams are not all that great and the parties are not that great due to the small campus size. 
However, there is a lot of international students and the campus is amazing."
Freshman,2,"Heading into Earlham College, the surrounding area is not the greatest.
The students are very opinionated and liberal.
Being a Jewish student who supported Israel i was targeted by students and some of the faculty about my beliefs.
I would not recommend the school to my future family and also college bound students."
College Freshman,2,The school does not really allow students to live off campus unless they have a specific reason to. So many students do not have the option of staying away from campus. I do  not think that the school helps others find housing either.
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly, you're stuck on campus if you don't own a car, or you don't know someone who has a car. The bus system in Richmond is almost nonexistant, and the shuttle the school runs is more than a tad confusing."
College Junior,2,There haven't been many parties in the last couple years due to Res Life policies. Going out can be challenging and disappointing most of the time.
College Junior,2,"Students aren't typically allowed to live off campus, but there are college owned houses that students can live in."
College Junior,2,The security officers and health staff are kind generally
College Junior,2,Difficult if youre a science major
College Sophomore,2,"I've met some truly amazing people at Earlham and made some of the best friends of my life.  There are intriguing people everywhere, and the size of the school makes it so you'll probably have the opportunity to meet someone you find particularly interesting at some point.  The friendliness of the student body is hard to come across anywhere else, and most people are willing to talk and hang out with newcomers.  Earlham's size does make it a bit suffocating at times, however, and there will definitely be phases where the craving to go somewhere more exciting and meet new people will be intense.  When it comes to academics, I must say I have had a quality experience with most of my classes and professors with the exception of a few that left me utterly uninspired; the classes here really seem to be hit or miss.  Also, Richmond is utterly devoid of recreation, with the nearest city being Indianapolis at about an hour and a half away.  "
College Sophomore,2,"The most popular drugs are alcohol and marijuana, but occasionally other psychedelics such as LSD and mushrooms are available as well.  There is definitely a noticeable scene, but it is quite easy to avoid, and there is little to no pressure to participate if you're not interested.  Study drugs such as Adderall are prominent as well during times of finals or otherwise stressful weeks.  Security is generally rather lax about alcohol usage, concerned more with the students' safety than with punishment.  "
College Freshman,2,"Sadly, there is not so many options here in Richmond. There is only one good Asian restaurant, and it's Thai food. The rest are questionable and suspicious. You have chain restaurants a bit out, like IHOP or Cracker Barrel. But the closest restaurant in Domino's. If you want off campus food, you would need to drive or take a taxi. The better food is in the Historic Richmond district. It's more hip and nice hang outs. Not the greatest, but not the worse."
College Freshman,2,"The night life does kind of suck because most places in town are closed. Roscoe's just opened up though and they're a cool little cafe/deli place open late. Unless you go to house parties or whatever there's not much to do. Sometimes there's student-sponsored activities like raves and movie nights and stuff but they can be lame. I guess it is what you make of it—if you have a fun group of people you can find something to do, it's just not going to be spelled out for you."
College Freshman,2,"There are a few nice places in town to go, but after dark it gets pretty shady, especially if you're walking around. Definitely don't go into town at night if you're alone, and you'll feel a lot better if you have a car. During the day people seem friendly enough."
College Freshman,2,"We have a dry campus, but it's hardly reinforced unless a party gets to be too large. The most that they do is make you pour your drink out, unless you become a liability to school property and students.

Strictness in terms of academics: professors expect you to be in class and do the work. Class size is small enough to enforce this."
College Freshman,2,"Not the Worst – The options off campus include mainly (good) Mexican or Italian food. There are many chains (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Arby's, O' Charley's), but also some really great local options (Little Sheba's, Gislain's, La Mex, Gallo's). They just put in a new Italian restaurant within easy walking distance of campus, next to MARSH."
College Freshman,2,"Remember: It's a Small School. With a student population of less than 1,200, burning bridges happens quickly here. Say you break a girl's heart -- well, suddenly the next day, half the school is mad at you. 
As far as 'genres' of people, most folks here are hipster or nerds! Not very many punks, goths, girlie girls or preps here and certainly no jocks."
College Freshman,2,"I'm Still Not So Sure.. Earlham has a lot of exciting programs (study abroad, cool internships, etc) but even being such a tiny school with less than 1,200 students, they're super competitive and hard to get into, unfortunately. Also, the town around here is a real bummer, with very little to do. The movie theater is about the only point of interest. On campus though, there are usually neat student events, like dance classes or cooking contests. Most students never take advantage of them and they're poorly attended :( The parties at this school are often busted by security, also."
College Sophomore,2,"The girls at earlham are.... ""aight"". very nice and respectful as well."
College Freshman,2,When you need a ride to the airport the shuttle rides cost $75 a person.  It is more likely that a student will catch a ride from another person on campus.  There are no trains or buses in Richmond.
College Freshman,2,"There is not alot of parking spot for the number of people who want to bring their cars to campus.  Each dorm does not have their own parking lot.  Dorms have to share parking lots.  If you live in a dorm across campus and you can't get a spot, then you would have to park across campus in the U (the biggest) parking lot."
Alum,1,I would strongly suggest people to avoid Earlham. The quality of education I received was very low and most of the students are extreme leftists.
College Freshman,1,"Unless you want to smoke some weed and sip on local hipstery artisinal beers on back-campus in the woods, you're out of luck."
College Junior,1,"We don't have Greek Life on campus, but I wish we would. It would make the campus more lively."
College Junior,1,"Unacceptable generally, although about once a week the food isn't bad"
College Sophomore,1,It is no secret that Earlham lacks school spirit for its sports teams.  Crowds at games are usually small but enthusiastic.  The Wellness Center is a quality facility for both athletes and non-athletes alike. 
College Sophomore,1,"Well, there isn't a whole lot around the downtown of Richmond, Indiana, and most of the best spots require a car to get to, but the Depot District has a few good cafes and sit-down restaurants.  If you're look for some late night face-stuffing, Sunshine Cafe is just down the road and open 24 hours a day.  "
College Sophomore,1,"Off-campus housing is very cheap due to the surrounding area of Richmond Indiana, but usually requires a car or bike to get to campus.  Most students live on campus because of this and also because the sense of community does not extend far beyond the campus.  "
College Sophomore,1,"There is no public transportation in Richmond, so if you want to explore the town you need to walk or borrow a bike. There are campus vans, but they are not very reliable, and only operate at set times."
College Freshman,1,"We have athletics, that's about all I can say. They accept anyone who wants to join. Very few students participate. We're in the lowest division and worst school in that division. We never win. We have decent athletic facilities though..."
College Freshman,1,"Unless You Have a Bike or Car, There's Nothing! Earlham's campus is super small, yes, but trying to get to any 'close' major city is a massive pain. There are no buses or trains to get you from Richmond to Dayton, Indianapolis, etc. It's extremely expensive to take a cab or have another student drive you (you need to pay for their gas). I found it very difficult to even get into the local town of Richmond without a car or bike! The Walmart is something like 4 miles from campus."
College Junior,1,"This past year our football team lost every game they played, and it wasn't until recently that I even knew we had a baseball team. Soccer is very good, though few students make it out to even those games. Ultimate frisbee and rugby draw a much larger crowd. Most importantly, though, in my most biased opinion, is that EARLHAM HAS AN EQUESTRIAN PROGRAM. It's completely student-run, and the equestrian team does very well in competition."
College Freshman,1,"Dysfunctional Administration – The administration generally has a lot of problems, but can be exemplified by the fact that final grads are coming out 18 days after the last exam. I have no idea why the process takes so long, but at many other schools, grades come out soon after exams. Students and faculty are generally unbothered by this kind of slowness. I knew Earlham was a laid back school, but it was too laid back for me, to the point that problems don't get solved, just brushed aside. "
College Freshman,1,"There is not much to do in the town of Richmond. It has a very blue collar feeling. From what I've heard, the bars are creepy. There are a few restaurants that are good, but not in walking distance. There is a movie theater, but they closed down for a period of time due to bed-bugs. There are some fast-food places, but most Earlham students eat only organic vegetarian food. North of Richmond there is a cute Amish grocery store. There is also a small mall with a few popular stores.  The only place I've ever walked to off campus was Marsh, a grocery store, and professors houses."
College Freshman,1,"All students pay the same amount for housing. You must live on campus, for all four years. People here have a diluted idea that everyone paying the same amount for housing is a good idea. I live in a small, dirty, dorm with a broken heater and water system. Others live in houses, where there is little supervision and they can get high all they want. 
As someone who respects the dry campus, it is upsetting that my money is funding other people to live in a nicer place and get high. 
People are pretty anti-capitalist here."
College Freshman,1,"With the exception of shuttles to 2 airports before breaks, and the shuttle that takes students to work study programs, there is no usable transportation that I have ever seen or heard of. 
The campus transportation is not good either. I had a problem where they continually filled a Honda Civic or a Toyota Highlander with way more then could fit, which is a violation of Indiana law.When I complained, I was told that I could wait for the next shuttle. Which would have left me standing outside, alone, on another part of town. Finally after talking to the dean of students, the agreed to tell the student drivers not to do that anymore. My initial response was that they didn't care because students wanted to get to work on time."

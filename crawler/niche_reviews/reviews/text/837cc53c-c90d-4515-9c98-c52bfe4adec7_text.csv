Graduate Student,5,I am going to be an incoming P1 ( 1st year Pharmacy student) at South University. I am so excited to get the knowledge I need to be a great pharmacist.
Senior,5,The advisors are awesome at making college a great experience. They are very helpful in the beginning processes and throughout attendance of college. They are one of a kind.
Sophomore,5,"South University really cares about their students. They supply all your needs and excel at helping their students achieve their goals. Instructors are there when you need them. We have a great network of providers for whatever our needs are whether it be for class, tutoring, counseling or most anything concerning the student. I have attended many colleges and South University is by far the best."
Senior,5,Very caring professors and staff members. They make sure you have the tools you need to succeed. Would definitely refer to other students who are inquiring anout this school.
Graduate Student,5,"I was an online student. I graduated with an BSN. I enjoyed my online classes and never had any problems with South University. My advisors were excellent and helpful when I needed them. The nursing courses were not easy ,I had to study approx 20 hours per week and worked full time job in the hospital. I wish everyone the best."
Junior,5,"South University is a school that really cares about your education. They make sure that each student stays on track with his/her studies. My overall experience at south has been phenomenal.  I would not choose any other school. There is online tutoring for those that needs help in certain areas. The professors provide every student with plenty of information to help you with class, also you have the opportunity to catch up when you have gotten behind in your class. You also get a chance to meet alot of different people from every walks of life. The life stories that they tell are can be very motivating and educational. Again I cannot express how south has been to me."
Sophomore,5,Small class size. Dedicated and knowledge teachers. Flexible schedule. Affordability. Good Program choices. No hassles with  hidden fees and no expensive book fees. Parking doesn’t cost money. Allows blended learning environment (online and ground classes) convenient location.
Sophomore,5,"I enrolled in South University March 2016 for the degree program in Allied Health Science. All of my instructors were helpful. Whenever I was hospitalized, they gave me an opportunity to catch up on all of my homework assignments. I would recommend anyone to apply and attend this college. There isn't anything that I would change about this university."
Freshman,5,"South Universities online courses are convient for someone like me who works full time. The staff is very helpful and supportive. Armando the Academic counselor constantly check in on you to make sure that I am staying on track. He is also there in case I have any questions. The professors are good at replying back within 24 hours when I email them with a question or concern. I would most definetly recommend South University to anyone. In fact I recommend the school to my sister, cousin, and aunt. We are all currently enrolled in South University."
Freshman,5,Great leadership and such great advisors many choices to further my education they are really just above awesome...
Junior,5,I like doing college courses on line. You can pick your own time to get the home work done as long as you meet the deadline.
Freshman,5,South University is a very friendly environment with all the administrators and counselors. They provide everything with my online classes and they always reply to my email rather quickly.
Junior,5,"Since I am an online student, I do not have any experience on campus but as for education online it is great. When you are focus and have your work in on time, everything is okay. Professors are great in teaching and answering questions, and also financial advisors and academic counselors are always checking on your process while you are enrolled there."
Freshman,5,"I just applied yesterday, got accepted , and already had spoke with my admissions and financial aid rep."
Freshman,5,"The staff at South University are very professional and friendly. There are many programs to choose from. Also, there is a diverse population of students who go to this University."
Senior,5,"My experience here has been great! Overall fantastic staff and good classes. I study online which has been very flexible for my job. There will be participation requirements of course, but very easy to achieve. I highly recommend the online learning program."
Sophomore,5,"I  must say that I really am enjoying South. The professors are very nice and down to earth and the campus is very small and quiet. The people here are laid back but focused on getting you the best education for the price tag here. The more effort you put in, the more you get out. They are completely digital with textbooks as well, so no book lines and outrageous fees for those. It makes for a great experience overall."
Sophomore,5,What i like about the school is that the counselors are alway there motivating ans encouraging you no matter what situation you go through. They are very supportive to their student. I would change anythi g about the school.
College Senior,5,professors have been nothing short of awesome.
College Senior,5,They have a job placement you can use up to 6 months after graduation
College Senior,5,you have set deadline but not set login times.
College Senior,5,100% online with tutors and all.
College Sophomore,5,The academic flexibility is awesome. The online course is created to do classes at your own pace with no hassle or frustration.  If these issue occur they is always someone to hold your hand and pull you through it.
College Sophomore,5,It is very convenience and user friendly.  You also evolve yourself with other classmate especially in discussion.  This online courses are very easy to navigate.  You have so  much resources and faculty member that will stand right beside you to help you succeed.
College Sophomore,5,The post grad services at my school is great.  We have services that actually help build your resume and also help you with job placement.  This is great for those people that have finish their studies or majors.
College Sophomore,5,My academic counselor is amazing. she is always on point and cares for me immensely.  She is always there for me to address any concerns and always push me and encourage me even when things are not going good for me.  All my professors are professionals and are very passionate about what they do and how they teach.  They are always there to help you around the clock.
College Sophomore,5,The value of a degree from this school is priceless.  you have all the resources needed especially online to be successful.  You don't feel lost at no moment.  You always have a helping hand.
College Sophomore,5,"The online curriculum is easy to follow. The workload is very flexible you do it at your paste.  Yes you have deadline but

as long as you do it  by then you should be okay. I find that everything I am learning right know will be an attribute to my career."
College Sophomore,5,My experience at south university is awesome. My counselors are all amazing and they care about my success.
College Sophomore,5,THE SCHEDULE IS THE BEST PART
College Sophomore,5,ONLINE COURSE ARE SO MUCH EASIER THAN GOING TO A CLASSROOM
College Sophomore,5,COURSE AND PROFESSORS HAVE OVERALL BEEN GREAT
College Sophomore,5,ONE COURSE AT A TIME USUALLY ONLY FIVE WEEKS LONG.  YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET BORED
College Junior,5,very convenient.  1 class every 5 weeks gave me enough time to complete assignments and test in a timely manner. I wasn't overwhelmed.
College Junior,5,my course is charted out for me since I'm enrolled in the ADN to BSN program. no complaints regarding the quality of courses or professsors.
College Junior,5,"the field I'm in (nursing) is in high demand. Currently employed as an RN, just a goal of mine to complete my BSN"
College Junior,5,workload applicable for a working adult mother
College Senior,5,I received everything that I was promised.
College Senior,5,"Other than this school I have not had any other experiences. I do however love this one, so why would I?"
College Senior,5,As I said before I have loved it so much I am going for a higher degree.
College Senior,5,All of my professors are very friendly and accessible. They call you personally before your class even starts and introduce themselves.
College Senior,5,I have loved this experience so much I am going to advance my career right away.
College Senior,5,I love how accessible all of the information is to me.
College Senior,5,"From the financial advisor to the finance counselor, everyone is so helpful and there for me no matter what."
College Student,5,I have enjoyed the school so far. I have no complaints.
College Freshman,5,Haven't had online courses but have heard great things.
College Freshman,5,Alot of career possibilities with their program.
College Freshman,5,Professors are super friendly and helpful
College Junior,5,"I am 58 years old and I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of more than what I was then doing with my life.  The more I got into the classes, the more I wanted to excel.  I changed my major from administration and management to nursing and have maintained a 4.0 GPA so far. So, it IS possible to teach an old dog new tricks.  I am 100% satisfied."
College Junior,5,Online courses are super easy at South. The professors are always quick to respond to emails pertaining to assignment questions. They are up to date on online assignments as well as grading.
College Junior,5,"Career services are amazing. I've talked to several people who have connections in the area, and are willing to help students in any way possible."
College Junior,5,"I've talked first hand with potential internship facilities, who give this school a thumbs up as far as educational value, curriculum, and accreditation. It makes it all the more reason to fulfill my education."
College Junior,5,"Topics of anatomy and physiology have helped shape me into the student I am today. I've had such great, dependable, and helpful professors, it's made learning a lot more fun and rewarding."
College Junior,5,The program is easy to follow so far. The professors all seem to work together to get their students all on the same page when it comes to assignment requirements. I find it very easy to approach someone and ask any question I may have pertaining to the program or assignment.
College Junior,5,"The ability to work with admissions and professors so easily, makes it a lot easier to focus on what's important, and that is being there to learn and better yourself and gain knowledge in your field of study!"
College Junior,5,I love being here. If I had known about them instead of M arygrove I would have choose them because they actually care about their students. Other schools have professors ir faulty that just doesn't care about you. They have the mentality that they have theirs you have to get yours type attitude and the tutors care by sticking with us until we actually get the issue and solve it. Plus I can learn and get my degree without having to be stressed put about financial aid always calling me to the office about a problem or payment.
College Freshman,5,"My Favorite experience so far has been with my admissions representative. When I spoke with her while I was looking for a college, I had some issues with my transcripts. She assured me that she could take care of it. I had been through this before so I did not really think it was true. She called me just a few days later and said she had received the transcripts she needed and I could start the financial aid process to see what else I might need. I could not believe it. She has been an awesome help in this experience and I am looking forward to continuing my interactions with her."
College Sophomore,5,The amount of help is amazing but it would be amazing to get scholarships.
College Sophomore,5,everything is very flexible and right up my ally
College Sophomore,5,My favorite experience has got to be the adviser is always calling to make sure that i am doing ok and f there is anything that he can do to better my education.
Graduate Student,4,"I am really enjoying my program- Physician Assistant. The faculty is great and they care about your success and are always willing to help. The curriculum is tough, but its what you sign up for. The one negative about the campus is that the library printer seems to always break down multiple times each quarter."
Freshman,4,"Just started class, but so far its going ok just getting the hang of doing online class, but so good"
Graduate Student,4,Challenging online courses with wonderful format. Professors vary on helpfulness. Prompt grading. Again. Alot of the feed back is cookie cutter/ copy and paste
Freshman,4,I like how the classes are set up and that my advisor actually keeps in contact and makes me feel like I am welcome.
Graduate Student,4,South university school of pharmacy is a wonderful program with professors that truly take an interest in students and their ability to succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"IT HAS BEEN PERFECT FOR MY SCHEDULE AS A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE, FULL-TIME STUDENT AND SINGLE MOTHER."
College Freshman,4,I really can't complain .
College Freshman,4,South did everything possible to make sure i was accepted.
College Freshman,4,I learned alot of material in my program
College Freshman,4,I enjoy this school! Faculty is great :)
College Sophomore,4,so easy to schedule classes with online flexibility
College Sophomore,4,it is so easy  to manage classes and times as well as credit transfer
College Sophomore,4,jobs are available and they offer higher degrees
College Sophomore,4,my admission rep. was the best i have ever encountered
College Sophomore,4,this school offers almost every class imaginable. great teachers
College Sophomore,4,it is online which allows me to continue working
College Junior,4,All my professors to date have been great.  I feel very comfortable asking for help or advice from them.  I have been very fortunate that I have been able to grasp the concept of online school so effectively.  I think my age has a lot to do with tho.  I feel a large majority of my classmates do not know how to study and learn on their own perhaps online school is not the best choice for them.  High school graduates today are not as independent as the graduate students when I graduated high school in 1976.  There is a great deal of leniency now as opposed to then.  I have been surprised at the massacre of the English language by some of my classmates.  And their inability to read assignments and follow directions.
College Junior,4,"Since I am majoring in nursing and want to obtain a Bachelor's degree, I will first have to do all the prerequisites, then do my clinicals and then return for the Bachelor's.  I'm okay with this since I have to do online school because I am sole breadwinner in my home.  I support a daughter in college and her two year old daughter.  I work full time and part time to make ends meet.  A RN with a Bachelor's degree will greatly improve my financial situation and I am willing to do anything I can to obtain my degree.

I am already working in the medical field as a medical assistant and have an associate's degree.  I am employed by a major corporation and will be able to do my clinicals there.  

Classes at South University allow me to work at my place and study in my comfort realm, but yet I am able to seek help anytime I need it."
College Junior,4,This school has been a blessing. As a disabled veteran and single father; this school really takes care of their students and makes every effort to help each student with their individual situation.
College Junior,4,I have really enjoyed  my online  experience  at South University.  All the faculty  have been very  helpful
College Junior,4,It's great! The staff are great!
College Senior,4,There has not been any issues with the classes. I was able to take a small break between classes if needed. The credits had transferred with no issues.
College Senior,4,I enjoy the online courses because I work at my own pace. There is no one breathing down my neck and you are not sitting in a room for massive hours.
College Senior,4,"The professors have all been great. I have enjoyed each one, some more than others. Some of them make the class really fun others just go through the motion of it. The class size is great because each of us get to know the professor personally."
College Senior,4,The curriculum is easy. The workload is not overbearing like some colleges. The work is straight to the point and simple. I have not had any experience with internships yet but I look forward to getting into one this year.
College Senior,4,"I enjoy being at South. The schedule is very duable and the staff is wonderful. They are always making sure I have what I need in a timely manner. They are all professional with their work as well. If I can do it again I would just at a earlier time in my life, not at the point of time that I started. I think I would have been better off doing this sooner than later. I am very proud of how well I have been doing and I am looking to graduating this year."
College Junior,4,"Class scheduling is definitely an easy process. I started school with a full time job, and I was able to make both of my schedules mesh together. Class availability is a good thing, as multiple classes are offered at different times of the day to work with peoples' schedules."
College Sophomore,4,The School actually help you learn and better yourself so its pretty hard to fail with all the help they give you
College Freshman,4,I like the quarterly system
College Sophomore,4,I haven't had any real hassles. Ive had some frustrations but the normal frustrations. I have never been good at algebra and it took me a couple times to pass the course. They rearranged my courses because I was unable to get Microsoft office so I got all my algebra course out of the way first. Works for me. My grades are a lot better now that that is over my gpa is going up with the end of every course.
College Sophomore,4,I would choose this school all over again. My admissions coordinator was great and waved the application fee because I didn't have it. I am struggling financially and when I made a payment this last time my financial advisor asked her manager if they could match my payment amount. She said they would even do it again. My academic advisor calls frequently calls to see how my classes are going and offer congrats on my course ending good grades. The classes that I struggled in she made me feel as though I was not alone. I really enjoy our phone calls. She makes you feel comfortable and is very encouraging.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very knowledgeable and want to see you succeed in their classes. They give you times that they are available to talk. But are available through emails and question to the professor. They offer a wide variety of courses. The classes are small so easier to follow along in the discussions. The class style works well and they are always trying to make them better by the advice from students.
College Sophomore,4,I chose South University because it had exactly what I was looking for. The professors are really great and know their stuff. They are available if you ever need anything. I have talked to a few on the phone even. Which I think is incredible for an online setting. The course studies is what I expected and more. the school offers just about anything anyone would want to study.
College Sophomore,4,I like it because through our online setting. I am just not working with people from my course of studies with allied health sciences. I work along with students studying different majors. From business to nursing and beyond. The work load is what I expected. Sometimes seems a little more difficult being online because I am a hands on learner. Everyone is very helpful. They want to help you succeed.
College Freshman,4,"Some credits from my stint at a hometown campus at a comunity college after so many years didn't exsist too many years passed.  So, I had to start anew.  180 credits for my degree have done 5 or 6 classes at 4 credits per.  3.2 years to go."
College Freshman,4,Math is my weakness.  And I had to do a refresher twice but I did pass.  And now I am in my second to third semester with a 3.2-3.4 GPA.
College Freshman,4,Their there when you need them if you have a problem.  They will let you know if they will be out.
College Freshman,4,Although anything in Algebra or any math blows my brain.  I'm quite smart otherwise.  A challenge is a good thing.
College Freshman,4,"Although we are seperated by land or sea and not at the actual campus.  I've met several people of various relegion, creed, sex and historical background."
College Freshman,4,Submitted resume awaiting responses for possible jobs I'm training towards.
College Freshman,4,"I don't know why biology in COMPUTER SCIENCE.  Seems like a roadblock.  But, if it is part of my degree then so be it."
College Freshman,4,Since I'm online and no where near the campus location.  Long as the website stays stable I can access what I need.
College Junior,4,If you need help the Staff are there for you and tutors are big help as well free of charge.
College Senior,4,"I think it could be a bit cheaper, but have never had a problem with financial aid going through. I just need more of it because the fees are a bit high and I went to school for a bit before this. In most cases, everyone should be able to get through school with just grants and student loans and not having to be out of pocket money until it comes time to pay back loans. I believe all the information I am learning is relevant to the degree I am earning and will need in my career field. Anytime there is a slight change in fees, they notify you of the changes and why they are doing it. There have been no large significant changes the years I have been there though, only a few small ones."
College Senior,4,"I am choosing this rating because it could use some help, but there are some aspects that are really good too. Registration, curriculum, and workload are all pretty good with no real issues. If you like breaks, then it might not be too good. You take classes all year round with only a week off between Christmas and New Years. Other holidays only delay when an assignment is due if due date falls on the holiday. You don't push off other due dates, so it is not really helpful. You do have the option to take breaks though, but you have to request them and I think you can't do more than 4 weeks a year unless under special circumstances, such as, having a baby. But, taking 1 to 2 classes at a time depending on your funding and what you think you can handle helps lessen the workload. Given the class is fast paced, then this is something most would need, especially since most attending usually have families or jobs or other obligations that made them choose an online flexible schedule over campus. I am not sure how the campus itself rates."
College Senior,4,"If there are any issues in regard to this, I am unaware of them. Unless you specifically tell people your ethnicity and such, then it is hard to know what anyone is anyhow. Names can slightly give it away in some cases, but mostly only gender is more apparent. Some people give their ages when introducing themselves in a class. But, because of this type of environment, who you are is not usually an issue. We are there to learn and don't care how old someone it, what religion they practice or anything else that might set someone apart. We are all the same working toward the same goals."
College Sophomore,4,The other classmates arealmost the best part of my experience so far.
College Sophomore,4,All resources I need are available at any time
College Senior,4,Student career prospects are excellent and the value of the degree from this school is high. I have not participated in internships due to my own busy life with family and work. I am unsure of the quality of employers recruiting on campus because I live out of state and my classes are all online.
Recent Alumnus,4,With this being an online school there are a lot of options for the different majors. I haven't had any issues.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My concentration under the RN-MSN program is Nurse educator. The teachers have been helpful and I've been working on my practicum which has been a great experience. Having this degree will help my career, but I still have a lot of experience to get under my belt before I can actually pursue a new position."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My classes are plotted for the school year. I was able to transfer my undergrad credits into the program with ease. At one point my financial aid adviser was not helpful, but since then the issues have been resolved."
College Sophomore,4,Just starting program no opinion yet
College Sophomore,4,Just beginning my career here - looking forward to great things
College Sophomore,4,Looking forward to completing this program
College Sophomore,4,I look forward to a career in my field
College Sophomore,4,No problems in this area
College Sophomore,4,Folks here are very friendly and helpful
College Sophomore,4,Just starting my career - loving it
College Sophomore,4,Just starting my experience here at this school. So far so good.
Junior,2,"Very expensive, with a very very very high turnover rate for the staff, including the academic counselors, financial aid, and even admissions department. The ones ""teaching"" are referred to faculty instead of professors, so not sure what thats about either."
College Junior,2,The tuition is pretty expensive here.
College Senior,2,"It is an online environment where I am, so resources are limited. What there is, is unhelpful. There is a student library, but it only consists of reference materials. It is extremely terrible with navigation and almost impossible to find anything helpful for assignments. I rarely ever use it and I have been there over 4 years and almost done. There is a tutoring service, which can be helpful to some. I've not used it much myself, but when I have there is never enough time to get enough help because the service takes forever to explain something on a whiteboard then tell you they have to go because other students are waiting. Campus activities are rare. With student services a friend and I started a student organization to hold plenty of activities, but it was difficult to get students to come and administration would block any efforts in trying to reach the students to make them aware of them saying it would be spam to notify them of it and they don't want to spam students. Not sure how letting them know about school activities that could help them and fun activities to win prizes would be spam, especially if they offered the ability to opt out of getting the notifications, but we gave up eventually."
College Senior,2,The price for this school is very expensive but are on a quarter schedule and not a semester schedule which helps you graduate faster.
College Student,2,The financial Aid office really helped me with filing the paper work and giving me ideas of where to go to find different types of scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process was extremely easy. But the classes and credits were so expensive that my financial aid was not enough to cover it and they applied me for a student loan without telling me about it. Once i researched it I realized that I am going to have to start paying back money before I even graduate.
College Junior,2,"It's hard to communicate with staff, I'm an online student."
College Freshman,2,"Ones that I have dealt with that are Black are in the ""slavery"" state of mind and wish to worship Obama openly. This tell me they have not been paying attention to news online (where the actual events are being broadcast, as Obama has complete control over public news stations and newspapers). The minority type class of student have been duped into believing they are in a ""gifted group"" where they will receive more goodies via Obama. This is distressing in that they are evidently blind to the cost of education rising and the government control is stepping into the education field where it does not belong."
College Junior,2,"I Need More Financial Assistance! South University is a private for profit university which means that tuition is higher than a typical college. I have received little financial aid from South University, and because of this, I spend a lot of time that I really don't have on searching for scholarships and grants. My EFC from my FAFSA is 0, and at least 75% of my tuition is currently being paid with by student loans that I cannot afford."
College Junior,2,School Is Okay – South has some really helpful people but they tend to lack the idea that a student goes through a lot and pays a lot so they need to be on top of your education but sometimes the advisors arent on top of things that end up costing extra like failing a class and realizing the right prerequisites for algebra hadnt been taken and when the prereq was taken the class was passes and was much easier to understand. They are working on it but I hope they continue to inprove.
College Freshman,2,I have trouble catching on to the Algebra course and getting so very frustrated but am not giving up. I have a C for now and I want higher!
College Sophomore,2,"The link for Connections allows you to access organizations and programs such as the National Honor Society, Clubs and Sororities.  It is like a social networking page for students and faculty.  There is not a lot of advertising or exciting marketing towards getting students involved or even interested in being a part of this feature."
College Student,2,"In Comparison to  Others – I found that many classes that are scheduled are ""fill-ins"" with  no credit towards your degree. Others, many colleges do not require for the same degree, thereby achieving the same degree in less time and less money."
College Sophomore,2,There are services I have not looked into as of yet.
College Sophomore,2,"E-Books Are Free – While ebooks are FREE, they mean little if one is having a bit of trouble understanding. Reading..and absorbing  - staring at a screen - is hard when you are struggling to ""get it"". Interaction with an actual person is welcoming in a ""in person"" setting. Online one can go to the limited tutoring and pray you understand before the hours run out. I could care less about ""peer to peer"" as I am not here for the social aspect."
College Senior,2,"No Student Life – There is no student life for business students. The ""computer lab"" is a classroom that happens to have computers in it, which is also a very used classroom. This makes it practically unavailable most of the time. The library hours are very good, but there is no student center or cafeteria...theres a break room with a vending machine."
College Sophomore,2,The tuition is high for a online school that the classes are only 5.5 weeks long
College Freshman,2,"Online Schooling. I go online to South University, I am a single mother of two. I thought while taking full time student classes I could get help financially from financial aid, but South took all the money, so now i'm in a rut to weather or not I should go to school or immediatly find a job."
College Junior,2,"The professors are very helpful with giving you quidance and websites to use for additional help.  Also your classmates will help you whenever possible.  Online classes require you to prioritize your time, work and life.  You have to be disciplined to do online classes.  You are required to log into classes and interact with your classmates at least 4 times per week."
College Junior,2,South University – South University has a great enrollment process. The professors that work for SU apparently have been working for them for a period of time because they get away with giving lengthy assignments and bad critism to the students where the other students can view this . I feel that the tutoring assessments are not up to speed with other schools that I have viewed but they sure do have what I need for my degree progam.
College Junior,1,"Due to FA and Pell Grant I have to pay out of pocket, I can not look forward to a refund check."
College Sophomore,1,There is no career center or job listings. And i have not found any links to a alumni network at all. It may be different if your not 100% online.
College Senior,1,"Everytime my FA comes up it takes the Financial Aid department a long time to get it straight and I always end up being told several different things before they get it fixed, then instead of getting the extra money back i get told I owe."
College Freshman,1,"The curriculum is questionable in that an unreasonable amount of math courses are required in order to advance. In the field I have chosen, there will be no reason for use of math in dealing with others problems and resolutions and resources. Yet, the numerous math courses remain, and if these are not completed to a high standard the advancement onward into the actual courses that pertain to the degree will be disallowed. If no progression is made, the student will be expelled from the college and still owing huge debit in student loans. No flexibility."
College Junior,1,I don't like the rising cost per quarter. I'm just getting by with one price and it goes up the next semester.
College Freshman,1,The School's Tuition – The school's tuition program is very good. I had a problem changing over from another school and failed my first Algebra class and I was not fully aware that I was going to have to pay the amount back for that class which I am struggling with now.
College Senior,1,"No Resources Available for Online Students – There are no resources for online students.  If you have a dispute, your only resource is your academic advisor which doesn't get you very far."
College Senior,1,"South University Online – The school is expensive and most of the time the student is researching and teaching him or herself.  Some of the classes have way too many complex assignments due each week, and the attendance policy and strict due dates make the classes exceedingly difficult for working adults.  Furthermore, online students have no access to student services, and there is no way to handle disputes or to appeal administrative decisions."
College Sophomore,1,South University Online Program – Is poor at best. The financial department does not take care of its end of things causing problems in all other areas.  There is no one to complain to or anyway to get in touch with someone who can attempt to fix problems. The instructors are pretty much allowed to do as they please and the student has no where to turn for help. The Academic counsellors (at least a few of them) are left to handle everything to the best of their ability keep in mind their hands are tied and they do not have the authority to do anything. The classes for my intended major are not going to prepare me for my career. I could go on but will stop here.
College Sophomore,1,Silent Professors – A long time Composition instructor barely appeared as she was working on her own career goals.
College Sophomore,1,"Majorly Depressing – If we could get on to the subjects that pertain to my goal, it would be a great deal more interesting."
College Sophomore,1,"Expensive Self-Educating – At the end of my ""education"" and I have earned my degree, I will owe over seventy-thousand dollars to the government in loans. I read every day that there are grants available for women my age,yet due to my status of being non-minority and non-immigrant or of racial/color, I am denied this privilege. I am disabled, but being white voids all my chanced of grants. Verified by my Senator's office.
 Discussions in classrooms are not welcoming. I seldom am spoken to, as people seem to shy away from the ""older crowd"". It is wrong to base a large part of our grade on whether or not we discuss 75 - 150 words each time - even when there is nothing of interest to say or ask. 
 Self-teaching at $1500 (or more) on a 5.5 week course without help from ""professors"" that are paid to teach is quite steep and a complete and total rip-off.  I am sure there are people that hang out in the community chat areas most of the time, so they are paying for the company. I simply cannot afford that ""luxury""."
College Sophomore,1,I cannot do online courses.  The online courses are 'way' to difficult.
College Junior,1,"Easy of Online Classes – I am an online student. I use the student center for homework help, it is like an online chat with a whiteboard to show your work. You get 12 hours a quarter. It is not very helpful, they give incorrect answers and steps. They also get upset when you ask a question and usually do not answer them. We alo haxe a online library, it is useless, a very limited and not helpful information. South University needs to update their departments."
College Sophomore,1,"No Help – You don't get any help for other sources for financial aid.  This school doesn't qualify for some loans
I don't like this school at all. I really would like to go somewhere else"
College Freshman,1,Most Seem Ill Prepared for College and Lack a Basic Education – UVC 1000 class is not a great class for educated or returning students.  Most seem to lack a high school education.  The instructor should have been harder on grading other students

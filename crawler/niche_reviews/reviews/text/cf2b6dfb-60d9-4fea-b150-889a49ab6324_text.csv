Senior,5,"I took nursing courses online and it was definitely scary, but we had weekly phone calls with the instructors to make sure we were on the same page of what needed to get done. I thought the online courses were handled very well."
Senior,5,I transferred to this University for the small nursing program. I love the instructors! They truly care about their students and want to see them succeed. I am so blessed to go to a school that puts faith above all and acts in a way that shows God's love and light through the staff.

Freshman,5,"I wanted to find a university that would help me grow as a person, athlete, and as a Christian. I have joined various organizations and groups on campus and everyone has been nothing but nice and welcoming. I have met some of my best friends in college whom I would not have met if I didn't go to Howard Payne. I always get asked if I had to choose over again, would I choose Howard Payne, and my answer is always yes."

Freshman,5,"So far in my freshman year here at Howard Payne it’s a blast. From all the student activities on campus, to the chapel services we have each week. I believe it really brings the students together. It’s like even in the short amount of time we’ve been on campus we have found friends that we will have for a lifetime and I couldn’t be more blessed than to have chosen this college."
Junior,5,A good small town for students to obtain a degree. Campus life is nice and professors care to see you succeed. Dorms could be better as there is community showers but besides that it is great!
Freshman,5,"I will be an incoming freshmen this fall of 2019 at Howard Payne University as well as playing volleyball for the university. When i went to my visit, i instantly fell in love with the campus and how everyone was kind and welcoming. It felt as if i was home. I loved the athletic program as well. I believe Howard Payne University is a great place to grow academically, mentally and spiritually."
Sophomore,5,A wonderful Christian college full of great people and a loving staff. I've only been there a year and I'm already in love with this college.
Senior,5,"First off, the staff is personal, caring, and genuinely works for the students.  They worked with me to find the best path toward graduation, after transferring from a couple other colleges.  The professors care about their students, understand the work load, and provide an excellent classroom setting.  Most of us, at the El Paso campus, are night school students who work full-time jobs during the day.  The staff encourages and refreshes our tired, weary souls, to continue to pursue a better education for ourselves."
Niche User,5,Howard Payne is a great Christ centered environment filled with people who truly love you and want to see you succeed!
Niche User,5,"I liked the caring professors and coaches that are at the University, they want to see you prosper in life and do amazing things.

Not only do you get an excellent lectures by five star professors, but you build faith in god and his glory. Howard Payne is a great undergraduate school."
Sophomore,5,"The culture of the staff and professors is one of family, always there to help in any situation as well as  the diverseness of the student body. From day one I have felt as if I was at home but with the freedom that comes with being an adult. A smaller university with a real hometown feel."
Niche User,5,The campus is quaint and everything is highly accessible. The people there are very interested in the success of their students.
Senior,5,I love going to this school. The students and professors are so nice and welcoming to everybody. The professors only want what is best for students and so do the people in the financial aid office. This is a great place to further your education or start it up again.
Sophomore,5,Howard Payne feels like a very tight-knit community full of people who genuinely care about one another. Professors are understanding and treat students as individuals and put more effort into helping them succeed as individuals rather than only preparing them for the next exam. I love it here. Howard Payne University feels like home. Department of public safety keeps us feeling safe with their constant patrols around campus.
Freshman,5,I like that when I first stepped on campus I felt welcome and I felt at home. unlike every other campus I didn't feel that way.
Freshman,5,It is nice small friendly university. It is a close family oriented campus. There is a lot of activities to do anytime on campus. I live on campus so that is real nice. Everyone is so friendly and nice. I was sacred at first leaving home but everyone has help with the  adjustment.

Freshman,5,"I want to thank this school for giving me a chance to further my education.  I am also afforded the opportunity to play the sport I so love, football.  Yes, I have to go to class and even though I did not score very high on the entrance exams, HPU said, ""still you are welcome.""  Thank you!!! If I could change anything, I would ensure more athletes would come here.  It is expensive and I pray that I am able to remain."
College Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are very small, it is the perfect atmosphere because students and teachers have the ability to know each other on a more personal level. A student is not just a number to a professor, it feels like a family. There is a large variety of course that a student is able to take."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is very secure, cops are usually around driving and keep things organized. It is not common to hear about campus crime, so I do feel very safe. It's a small town University and feels very secure."

College Junior,5,"There are two national band fraternities/sororities, a national theater fraternity, two community service sororities, one social sorority, two community service fraternities, and one social fraternity. Greek life is a fun experience that you don't want to miss out on. It is a great way to help the community and make life long friends."
College Junior,5,"I am so incredibly thankful I decided to go to Howard Payne. I don't have a favorite experience because there are really too many to choose from. From the many fun Greek life events and opportunities to the fun that I have had in band, being social and having fun has never been a problem. As for the classes, they are challenging because the professors push you. They really care about how you are doing in their class, other classes, and outside of the classroom. One of my professors would bring homemade pastries and coffee to every 8 AM class because 8 AM is too early if you don't have coffee! My largest class last semester was my general education history class. It had 20 people. It's fantastic."
College Freshman,5,It has been an honor to explore this university. I love how devoted each person is about building their relationship with God.
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about the school. I feel like I'm being given the best education.
College Sophomore,5,my advisor and nursing teachers do everything they can to help.

College Sophomore,5,I love this school. all the teachers are very very helpful. and every student is more than just another number. we matter.

College Freshman,5,The small student body makes Howard Payne University unique. My professors know who I am and are friendly to me outside of the classroom. It is very easy to contact my professors when I need help. I do not feel like just another face in the crowd.
College Freshman,5,I had wonderful professors that I saw outside of classes as well as in class. They helped me so much and were friends while also being teachers.
College Sophomore,5,"I got the aid I needed, and the ladies are always kind and cooperative. They do the best they can to work with you. The only people that struggle with aid are the rich kids."
College Freshman,5,"Out of my three years at Howard Payne, the extent of drug activity I have seen was two guys cutting up tobacco. I believe they got in trouble.  Drugs and alcohol are not a big issue on campus. If people want to do those things, they can go off campus."
College Freshman,5,"As a Political Science major in the Honors program, I get to participate in Luncheons, etiquette banquets, lectures, parties, debates, and the building most of my classes are in is amazing. We have an exact replica of Constitutional Hall, a Mesopotamian room, Magna Charta Hall, and a mural showing the journey of mankind. The building is old, and looks like a castle. The Secretary at the Academy sends emails with intern and job opportunities that are available in the area and all over the United States. The workload can be tough, but being in the Academy is worth it."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, there are too many great things to say about academics at Howard Payne. You just have to check it out yourself."
College Freshman,5,"I love Howard Payne. I could not have picked a better school. I have great friends from all walks of life, and great professors who put in the extra effort to see their students succeed."

College Freshman,5,"I think that the campus should be strict about things like safety, drinking and drugs."
College Freshman,5,Excellent - we neither have to participate or are persuaded to not participate.
College Junior,5,Central Texas has nice weather if you like extremely warm and dry climates.  Allergy sufferers will have a hard time due to the large amount of sporing trees.
College Freshman,5,There is always plenty of available parking and it is easily accessed
College Freshman,5,I love the weather. Its rarely humid. The nights and mornings are generally cool as well.
College Sophomore,5,"Howard Payne offers a wide variety of majors, and is also known for its christian studies and its academy of freedom."
College Sophomore,5,"The surrounding area is very safe, though not overly exciting.  There is a theater, several restaurants, hotels, a couple shopping centers and a small mall.  There are many activities offered by local churches, and a considerable number of activities offered by the school.  There are several sports sites close by.  There is a fair that occurs locally every year."
College Sophomore,5,"Generally speaking, I am impressed with the modesty of the students at Howard Payne University."
College Freshman,5,"Just Around the Corner. Off campus housing at Howard Payne University is about average. There are plenty of places to live with in just a couple of miles of campus. One of the best places to live is the 377 Villas. They are fairly new and are very nice for a very reasonable price. The apartments are available with 1, 2, or 3 bedroom options, all apartments have hardwood floors, A/C, water paid, pool, and a awesome gym. They are next to a wooden area so you hardly have to battle with road noise. The only downside I had with the apartment complex is the lack of parking."
College Freshman,5,"Loving the Slow Life. Brownwood, Texas is located smack dab in the Center of Texas. The community is a very lively and energetic, with plenty of outdoor activities to do, including a lake, parks, natural trails, and plenty of room to roam. Howard Payne University has been part of the local land scape for over a century. With my grandparents and parents both attending HPU. The people in the community love the students at HPU and usually have different events aim towards the HPU community free or low cost to students. I have a motto for the school: Your a person, a student, and a family member at HPU. This motto is true in every aspect of your daily life here in Brownwood."
College Senior,5,"HPU Experience – I love this school. Here you are not a number, but a person. They do whatever to work with you and help you. They truly care. It's family here! I could not have chosen a better school. People really do care about others here and try to help them succeed in every aspect of their lives..."
Alum,4,"The academics were exceptional. I've got no complaints in that department. I do feel as though the atmosphere of the college is a tad exclusionary, as it is a heavily Christian campus. My primary objection is the anti-LGBT+ sentiment expressed in the school's handbook."
Sophomore,4,"I didn't take any classes online till the outbreak of COVID-19. During that time of transitioning from traditional courses to online learning, Howard Payne Professors helped out a lot and went over different ways students can contact them to helped them understand the material that was being taught. Although it was hectic during that time of the pandemic, professors made sure every student was understanding, doing well online , and reached out to all students to see how we were doing at home as well as checking on our mental health."
Sophomore,4,"Howard Payne University has given me an amazing opportunity to continue my academics, volleyball career, and my Faith. This college has really made me feel at home as well safe in my new community. Professors and other staff have really made a difference and a huge impact on my first year of college by helping me in many different ways to help improve not only my knowledge in the classroom and volleyball court, but my knowledge in knowing God. I am very blessed to know that I have other types of support and encouragement from Howard Payne University."
Junior,4,"Howard Payne is a small, private university with a wonderful faculty & staff who will do anything within their power to help you succeed. The size of the school allows for more personal relationships with professors as well as other students and alumni. I have only been attending for 1 year and I already feel like I am part of the Howard Payne family.  It is a Christian university and a close-knit community so safety is never a concern and your support system constantly grows from the moment you step on campus. They also provide you with a number of scholarship and loan opportunities in order to cover the cost of tuition & fees."
Sophomore,4,I am in love with HPU. Howard Payne is a family and Christian orientated campus. I am able to express my beliefs freely with my peers. The food is great and there are a variety of options. My professors have become my mentors in my life. I found HPU to play volleyball and I just knew on my visit that this was the place for me. I have found friends and a great undergraduate degree program. I would be wrong if I chose anywhere else.
Niche User,4,"I liked how it was such a Christian school with nice people who are a little like me, their women's soccer team was very nice and I felt like I actually fit in.
Howard Payne is a very welcoming school that offers m major and with still allow me to do activities and feel like home away from home  being able tp participate in small events."
Niche User,4,"The music school is a very close-knit part of the university, with lots of great opportunities in different departments. The whole school is pretty good overall, just small. That can definitely be a good thing, though."
Junior,4,"I like that Howard Payne is a small school and everyone gets to know everyone and the classes are small. Overall, I think it is a great school!"
Freshman,4,"I love the school! It is a small campus and great fro people who don't like big crowds. I personally would tell everyone to go to Howard Payne, but I'm just biased. It is so much fun and everyone who love it! "
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of alumni that help out students. The career center is also a great place to find out more information.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not a part of the Greek life; however, I think that there are great groups in our school."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are really important at the school, the school is mostly athletes so everyone supports everyone."

College Senior,4,Howard Payne University has several different fraternities and sororities that are very active on campus and have many different events to attend.
College Freshman,4,"I like living in veda, but i prefer my own place."
College Freshman,4,"I play volleyball for HPU, and it is very fun. ive learned alot!"
College Freshman,4,I love the people! It reminds me of home.
College Senior,4,"One of my favorite things about Howard Payne is the professors. The professors act like they genuinely care about their students not only in class but also outside of class. The campus is small, but has a home feeling. I have been so blessed to have been able to come to Howard Payne and I have made some of my best friends at this campus."
College Sophomore,4,On campus housing was great because there were many different housing options.
College Sophomore,4,All of the Greek life is dedicated to helping the school with many different fundraisers or help around the school.
College Sophomore,4,I would definitely choose Howard Payne again because it has a family environment. It also has staff and professors that care for their students.
College Freshman,4,As  a  student  athlete I love all of  the fan support from the professors at the school  and the fans from the city.
College Sophomore,4,there are many students attending that participate in sports.
College Freshman,4,The dps is always riding around campus and more than likely many people are always walking around.
College Freshman,4,"There are very few of us, but we are all different and very diverse."

College Freshman,4,I love this institution. They are very good at helping find housing and even helping find places to go and things to do.

College Student,4,I love virtually all of the dining options off of campus.
College Student,4,it gives a sense of safety knowing that the police are there to watch your back.
College Freshman,4,"There is not much crime at Howard Payne. If there is, we don't hear about it. There are random room searches to make sure people aren't keeping things they shouldn't. The visitation hours are simple. Doors open, and not after 11:00 p.m. Parking violations are usually answered with warnings but drugs and alcohol are not tolerated. Smoking outside on campus is not punishable but it is frowned upon. Mobs, fights, and demonstrations have never been an issue since I have been at school. Theft is probably the most common crime but even that happens seldomly. I feel safe at Howard Payne."
College Freshman,4,"I have found people on campus to be accepting of all walks of life. Most people in Brownwood are Christian, but I know people who are Atheist or Agnostic and they are friends with plenty of Christians. Religion and race have not seemed an issue at Howard Payne. Most people don't really care. Because Brownwood is so small, everyone is friends with everybody. We don't get many foreign exchange students but that is because Howard Payne is a private university. Political affiliation is mostly conservative, but politics is not a common conversation topic. Sexual orientation is mostly heterosexual, but I have no doubt that people of other orientations would still find it easy to fit in and make friends. Brownwood is just such a friendly place."
College Freshman,4,"It gets a little hot in the late Spring, and a little cold in the Winter, but getting around is not difficult and it does not really affect school. Activities are provided to cool off in the Spring, and we don't get much snow  or ice in Texas. If we do, it is at the end of Fall semester. Occasionally class is cancelled, but noting major."
College Freshman,4,"I have never had any issues with the network or finding a computer. The school has set up a Microsoft 365 OneDrive for every student so everyone can access their own files from any computer on campus. most places on campus with computers stay open until 11:00 p.m. There are also a few computers in the dorms for those who need them for late hours. There needs to be printers in the dorms, but it is possible to get by without any. If watching T.V. shows is important I would recommend bringing a laptop, because not much is offered through the T.V. connection. The tech staff are very helpful if you are having problems with any kind of device. Just stop by their office in Packer and they will help you out."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a way to build lasting friendships and participate in the community. Howard Payne offers many different organizations. Greeks are not seen as better than non-Greeks on campus. They live in the same housing as non-Greeks, but their efforts and dedication are appreciated. Being Greek at Howard Payne is mostly about fun. It is definitely not a popularity contest."
College Sophomore,4,"Security on campus is very timely and controlling. They keep the environment safe for a higher level of learning to be maiintained. I have never been in danger or have had anything stolen from me. Also, they do not tolerate drinking on campus. They will be sure to maintain a highly respectable scene on campus at all times."
College Sophomore,4,"We're in central Texas, so there's not really much that affects classes weather wise. We get thunder storms and stuff like that, but it's never that bad."
College Sophomore,4,"HPU has a variety of races and religions, and most everyone is very accepting. Howard Payne's students are all like one big family almost. Everyone is friends."
College Sophomore,4,Parking is not an issue. You can find a spot pretty close to wherever you need to go and get there within ten minutes. Parking permits are only five dollars and are included in the tuition. If you don't want to drive your own car the university offers a shuttle bus that comes every fifteen minutes to take you through the campus
College Junior,4,"its not bad but sometimes i just get tired of eating in the cafeteria all the time there are options off campus and ""stinger bucks"" which is a way howard payne students say some money.. it is like having money in your i.d. card to be able to go to places like chillis and not pay out of your pocket =)"
College Freshman,4,"The community at Howard Payne is very friendly. If you don't have a car, plenty of people will give you a ride. There are always activities and clubs going on, so you should be able to get plugged in."
College Freshman,4,HPU tries to reach out and support the students at Howard Payne.
College Freshman,4,"The facilities are very nice. Kind of old but refurbished, they look really nice from the outside but the inside you can tell for the most part it is an older campus. I enjoy it and the way it looks."
College Junior,4,"There are shuttles that go between both the campuses in town so that having a car for a student is not a must. There are also shuttles that ride around to the main parts of town. Since the town is so small these prove to be enough. Walking or biking could also get you to the main part of town in 15 to 20 mins. There are usually groups that get together to run into town to shop or eat as well, so catching a ride is usually pretty easy."
College Junior,4,"There are enough off-campus housing opportunities for any students who care to live off-campus.  Prices of housing are reasonable and vary greatly, depending on type of housing, whether or not utilities are included, size of housing, and location in regard to the public schools.  The landlords are kind and reasonable, the parking is perfectly sufficient, and the safety is good enough to satisfy even the parents of students.  The school has conveniently-placed bulletin boards on which available housing is posted."
College Junior,4,"I have had no problems with school policies affecting my academic or social lives.  Some students may not like the policies against drinking.  The school is strict, but not suffocatingly so.  If you are a good student and have common sense, you will have no trouble at Howard Payne University."
College Sophomore,4,Not Very Diverse – HPU isn't really that diverse. It's a christian school so everyone's beliefs are pretty similar. The topic that is probably the most diverse is the sexual orientation.
College Sophomore,4,Its a private Christian school so that kind of sets it's apart from other schools. And the school is pretty small.
College Sophomore,4,"Very Welcoming – HPU is very welcoming. Everyone here makes you feel at home and comfortable. It's a pretty small campus so you meet everyone really quickly and make lots of new friends. We have a recreation center where you can skateboard, rollerblade, rock climb, play basketball, and much more. It's so much fun!"
College Senior,4,I feel safe pretty much all the time. security officers are always out and about making sure everything is going smoothly
College Sophomore,4,"Academy of Freedom – The Academy honors program is wonderful, and everyone is extremely helpful. That's what attracted me to HPU, and they professors are all helpful and caring. They want you to succeed, and make it their job to help in any way they can."
College Sophomore,4,"Girl Dorms Are Great – There are plenty of dorms, as far as I know, but the people have a tendency to stay up and make noise after quiet hours. It can be dealt with. The dorms themselves have wonderful views though."
College Sophomore,4,"Help When You Need It – The professors are amazing and are extremely helpful. If they don't know something, they're always willing to point you in the right direction. They are understanding, and if you have a problem, they'll help you with that too. I've never felt more comfortable going up to a professor and asking for help."
College Freshman,4,Still in Basics – I am still a freshman at Howard Payne and have yet to  begin my specific classes towards my degree. I have started my music classes towards my minor and find the classes wonderful! All the professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. The coarses  are difficult but manageable.
College Freshman,2,"the dorm rooms beds are uncomfortable and very noisy also, the bathroom and shower that has to be shared between four people is very small bad lighting."
College Freshman,2,Awkward and most people think they can only have fun with alcohol.
College Sophomore,2,"There are roaches that fly, silly rules that are overly enforced like not being allowed to put decorative tape on furniture. The furniture quality will vary. I  guarantee there will be a problem with the plumbing. The same goes for AC/Heating units.  There is no sense of privacy whatsoever."
College Junior,2,"I am not aware of any internships available, if there are any they are not made well known to the students. there are on campus jobs though. Such as working in the cafeteria, library or gym."
College Freshman,2,Nothing to do at HPU but hang out with friends. We do have the guys get together to watch sports on tv as a baseball team.
College Junior,2,"Brownwood is a very small town with only a few options for off campus dining.  There are several fast food places.  A really good BBQ cafeteria style restaurant.  There are not any really good choices for healthy foods.  Healthy food choices are limited to the ""diet"" section of each respective restaurant."
College Freshman,2,"i gave all my information to the registrar 3 months prior to me starting college, but she waited until 2 days before school to submit my paperwork, making me have no finacial support for the first 4 months."
College Freshman,2,"you can not use one of the schools computers without having to close 5 or more updates that the computer says it needs, if you try and update the computer yourself you need a password to do it. It is hard to concentrate on work when pop ups continue to happen."
College Freshman,2,"Hpu is a Christian School/College With that being said i do not think religion should be forced on its students, being unable to graduate without taking there religion classes is a bad policy in my opnion."
Freshman,1,"A dying school in a dying town. The faculty and staff only want students who look, talk, and act exactly like them so that they can continue living in their echo chamber/ bubble. Athletics are terrible and student life even worse. The buildings are crumbling, dorms are terrible (with the AC constantly going out) and the tuition is way too expensive for the type of “quality” you get. The school will be dead in 10 years.  Enrollment is down to 600 students at the moment.. And instead of bold changes and visionary leadership they’re digging in their heels and refusing to change with the times. The community does not support it, in fact the relationship between the two is downright contentious because HPU acts as if they’re more valuable to the community than they really are. Graduates go on to little or no success because the academics are a joke.  The only reason I would send my child here is if I was doubtful they could hack it at a regular college."
College Sophomore,1,"The food: If it doesn't look like it can grow legs and walk away, it is smothered in grease and cheese. 

The Caf: They no longer have to-go options, so you can forget eating if you have back to back classes. Their schedules are not flexible whatsoever, and they definitely need a thermometer to check their food!"
College Junior,1,Brownwood is a very small town.  There are no nightclubs to speak of.  Entertainment is limited to restaurants and a small movie theatre.
College Sophomore,1,Had Trouble – This Year I had the most trouble with Financial Aid than ever before. This school is so expensive and they do not give away a lot of Scholarships like other schools. I will not be attending this school next fall due to the financial issues that I went though this year. It took me a month until i was awarded and I sitill couldnt get all the loans I needed because the Lack or a good co-signer. It was really a bad semester.

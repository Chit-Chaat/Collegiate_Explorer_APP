My time in Europe was an amazing experience I will always remember. One of the main reasons I loved my time at LCU was how the love of Jesus permeates all corners of the campus.

The quality of the career center/services on campus is the best, I know that promotion and help is always offered for upcoming graduates."
College Freshman,5,"My decision was between Texas Tech University and Lubbock Christan University because I wasn't ready to leave home due to the fact that my parents would need my help the upcoming year. I was not very confident about turning in my application for LCU but I hoped for the best! Weeks later, I received my acceptance letter in the mail and felt it was a sign that God was calling my name to grow close to him. I love the bible classes and chapel. I also love the small campus and small classes as well. I know I couldn't have chosen a better school in town and I know I will be successful at Lubbock Christain University."

Freshman,4,I loved the Christian aspect and also the campus itself ! The people there are great and very nice!! They helped me with a lot so far
Niche User,4,"It's on my family farm.  This is a small friendly West Texas Christian University in an extremely nice larger West Texas University town.  It is less diverse than people there understand but the Religious Denomination that runs the school works at being ""Color blind.""  This school is likely torture for a North Eastern Liberal Black Lesbian!  And likely ""Heaven"" for a Shy Conservative not too over-achieving black or white straight kid.  The Social life is the Religious life or you're going to Texas Tech for parties.  This school started in the 1950's & strictly follows it's founding Religious principles...kindly.  This is about where George Bush had his wild drunken party days.  Don't assume the local population is stupid or poor."
Junior,4,"Lubbock Christian offers a wonderful community experience during your educational experience. The professors are there to help you grow,  not only academically,  but spiritually and socially as well. They are always willing to listen and are very understanding. They help you become your best self.  It's not only a school,  but a community to lean on. We are all here for each other. The only complaint I ever had with LCU,  is with the dorms. They are in need of some updating and maintenance."

College Freshman,4,"I have tried intramural sports, as well as attended some of home games.  When one athlete had medical problems, entire campus overwhelming supported her and her family."
College Freshman,4,"I personally didn't live on campus, I stayed at home but I heard the dorms were small but great!"
College Freshman,4,"I personally did not join any sororities because I have two jobs and I also am a full time student but I heard sororities are great, I have a tons of friends that rushed! Would love to try soon!"

College Senior,4,Really good people look for LCU students.
College Senior,4,"Pretty fun, reasonable amount of stuff to do"
College Senior,4,"Housing would be cool, some inter club hostility"
College Senior,4,"Decent, can be a little pricey"
College Senior,4,"Quality could always improve, but very good"
College Senior,4,"Housing is good, sometimes staff can be difficult"
College Junior,4,"Housing is not to bad. It all depends who you live with and what you do, to not get in trouble. It is very strict your freshman year."
College Freshman,4,"The Administration will be very involved in your life which is a good thing. The President and Dean are very prevalent in the college and you will see them at chapel and on campus. Most students are on a name basis as well with the administration , but not as much as they are with professors. Most students aren't on that Name basis with the Admin cause of being in trouble its just because they care a lot. The Dean of Students is very good at being available for any questions, reports, or concerns you would ever have. He will Squash any incidence of Bullying, Harassment, etc Immediately and he won't tolerate it . Which is what is to be expected, but sally some colleges are more lenient on these things, not LCU. They want a Safe Environment. Yes, of course there have been incidences on harassment but thats everywhere, and Like I said it won't be tolerated ."
College Junior,4,The students on campus are very nice and make you feel like your at home.
College Junior,4,"Being a first generation college student has made it difficult to understand the process at times.  My mother and I not being familiar with the process has baffled us at times as to what the next step in the financial process will incure. However, the staff at LCU has been wonderful in guiding us through the this process.  They show amazing patience as year after year my mother and I enter their offices countless times asking questions we have asked hundreds of times. 

I think the most important criteria for admission is academics and a Christian background. I think the application process is about the same as it would be in any other college institution. My tip to new students is just be sure to have all the information required for grants, scholarships, and loans processed in time for enrollment."
College Junior,4,"Our clubs do a lot with the school, but no one makes a big deal if you do not join."
College Junior,4,Athletics are fun and our teams do well every year.
College Junior,4,The school cares about the well being of its students
College Junior,4,"I just recently moved off campus and I really love it. I live about three blocks away from the school, and have two roommates who I go to school with. Rent is usually pretty easy, since I have an on campus job that helps pay for it. The freedom of being off campus is the best part."
College Junior,4,"This school is very strict on it's alcohol policy. Even if you're of age, you are not supposed to have it on campus. I appreciate that they are trying to keep students safe."
College Junior,4,I work for technology at school so I am very biased in this matter. I believe we work as hard as possible to provide a good network and technology environment for the students.
College Junior,4,"Although it is far from perfect, I really do love my school and the people here. You build wonderful relationships, so it makes the little things seem unimportant and you focus on those relationships."
College Junior,4,The athletics at the school are great. I'm an athlete and a part of the sports involve in the school. Soccer and basketball were popular sports in the school and they were student involvement along with school spirit. There want anything that affected the athletics scene. It was nice having fan support to represent the school.
College Junior,4,"My major is Business administration. Its great having this major at this school having opportunities to learn more of my major. It contains internships and programs so I can be well prepare. Business administrations is an excellence career for me. They are many job opportunities after I graduate for Business administration. My major consist of working with people, organizing, being the team leader, and to target all goals. Some characteristics to help me ensure in Business administration is to have communication skills, leadership, multi-tasking, flexible, etc. Business administration is huge goal for me and a major that I will enjoy throughout my life."

College Sophomore,4,This year soccer has had more supporters then ever! Basketball is one of the popular sports on campus and a lot of students attend those games which are super fun! The social clubs have club sports and a lot of people mainly other club members and friends go and watch them. The school offers intramural sports for everyone and a lot of students play in those!
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of off campus apartments for students to choose from! A con is that you might miss out on some things that are happening on campus, but living off can be cheaper in so many ways. As a freshman I think you should stay on campus but after that I would encourage students to maybe get a apartment off campus to save some money. "
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of places to go on campus to relax, be alone, study, chat with friends, do some homework, and play games. The only thing I do not like is that the campus closes at 12 on Fridays so those some of the places are closed and people leave so it is dead. "
College Sophomore,4,Everyone seems so happy here! The professors do whatever they can to help us grow in our education and in faith. The campus is small so that everyone pretty much knows everyone. It is a very interactive campus which I like. 
College Freshman,4,I'm not sure if I'm blind and don't see people using drugs or drinking on campus. For the most part it might be that drugs and alcohol are not allowed on campus. 
College Senior,2,"Too much attention is paid to singular sports, and not the athletic departments as a whole."
College Junior,2,I am not a fan of greek life
College Freshman,2,"Everyone in this school seems extremely cliquey. Faculty members love to get in your business. The classes are not easy, but they are not a challenge at all. Everyone knows everyone, so gossip spreads like wildfire. Not much to do on campus. The cafeteria sucks."
College Senior,2,"They're all taken, arrogant or annoying"
College Senior,2,Stay on top of food quality and expiration dates.
College Junior,2,If you are a girl. NO BOYS ALLOWED. vice versa. Your freshman year you  have a curfew.
College Junior,2,Not much of a party school!!! YOU SHOULD NOT GO TO COLLEGE TO FOR PARTYING ALL THE TIME. IF THAT IS THE CASE DON'T COME TO LCU. IT IS TO EXPENSIVE FOR YOUR MONEY TO GO TO WASTE!!
College Sophomore,2,"the weather is extremely unpredictable. one day its 70, the next its 30."
College Junior,2,They don't know where the money is and what to do to figure it out.
College Freshman,2,"The weather in Lubbock is not good at all. We can have sun, wind, snow, and rain in one day. Or we can go from a perfectly pretty day to a terrible day in just five minutes."
College Sophomore,2,I usually don't go to lunch or dinner. 
College Senior,2,I do not eat on campus I just have had it a couple times
College Senior,2,you don't always get enough aid to pay for the entire semester
College Sophomore,2,The variety of resteruants near campus in not diverse but I feel is accurate
College Sophomore,2,I believe off campus housing is somewhat difficult to access.
College Sophomore,2,I have never had a negative experience in the computer lab. 
College Sophomore,2,The weather really has no effect on my campus experience the dorm temperatures are set accurately according to the weather whether it be hot or cold outside.
College Sophomore,2,"As a Christian school, it can be tough to find any parties or anything you would expect. It's there, you just have to know the right people."
College Junior,2,This school does not off much nightlife events. If a student wanted to experience this they would need to be involved with Texas Tech.
College Junior,2,"There is not transportation offered by the university itself, but the city of Lubbock had public transportation that runs and there are bus stops located near the school."
Freshman,1,"No, I haven’t taken any online classes at Lubbock Christian, for all my classes will be in person come this fall."
College Senior,1,"Too strict, often unfair, does not understand students, often harsh"
College Freshman,1,I had so much trouble with my financial aid. I had to go through the process on my own because my parents don't speak English. I am also the first one to graduate in the family so we had never been through the process. It was hard and I didn't get all the financial aid I needed but I did learn a lot from it so hope that does not happen again.
College Sophomore,1,"Many people live on campus which means that everything is in walking distance, but for people who live off campus you need to have your own car."
College Sophomore,1,"They're everywhere but very slow, not good when in a crunch! The Wifi is even slower!"
College Sophomore,1,"Since LCU is a Christian School, they have a few rules. There is no drinking or smoking on campus. The RA's watch the dress code, especially for the girls. We have campus police patrolling the campus at all times, but that makes everything super safe. I mean the it isn't too strict where you feel like you can't do anything, but you have to have some sense. Lubbock CHRISTIAN University, if you go there you know what's right and wrong."
College Sophomore,1,"I would love to say that on campus food is good and that everyday I look forward to eating but the truth is I never look forward to eating on campus. The only good days they have good food is Tuesdays, which Chick fil' a day."
College Sophomore,1,Ehh Its Average – We have a buffet style cafe which is slightly over priced for fairly average food. If you live in the dorms then you have to buy the 19 meal plan which is more meals than anyone would ever care to eat in the cafe. There are two other restaurants on campus: a sandwich/coffee shop and a fast food place. I have never eaten at the fast food place. The sandwich shop is pretty good and I probably eat there 2-3 time out of the week.
College Student,1,First Time Ticket – Parking is quite unclear and confusing. I have one friend that got a ticket on her very first day of class because she was simply unsure of where to park.

Junior,5,It’s a small university with a staff and professors who care about you and want you to succeed. The student life is pretty good. Everyone on campus usually knows each other or it doesn’t take long to have a group of close friends.
Freshman,5,"great School, they are really passionate about you and your education. followed up on everything and were incredible with the application process and it couldn't have been more smooth."
Senior,5,"I like the small classes provided by the UP, yearly free retreats in Yellowstone and Glacier Parks. I also like the academic support center and writing center services. It is great to know the professors personally and drop by to ask questions any time ."
Sophomore,5,"The teachers and staff are fantastic, super nice and available to help when needed. I do wish the bathrooms were updated but besides that I really love my experience here."
Junior,5,"I have only just moved here a month ago, but so far I am in absolute love with my school. It is reasonably sized, so I rarely feel overwhelmed. And since the apartment I manage to snag with my roommate is close by, I rarely drive my car anymore! Go Argos!"
College Sophomore,5,Brand new Building is awesome!
College Sophomore,5,It is the best I have been around so far at school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Everyone was friendly and helpful from  my first visit to the campus. If I could start over again, I would start as a freshman instead of transferring with an AA. I would do this so I could spend all four years at the university of Great Falls.

Transferring from California, you can see and feel the difference in the people and the University. My counselor at the JC I transferred from  did not know my name without my file in front of her. My second  visit to the campus, the office staff knew me by name. The students were incredibly friendly and helpful. 

The professors in the Psychology department are amazing."
College Junior,5,The parking permits were easy and there is always a spot for me to park almost anytime of the day.
College Junior,5,"My school is very unique, it brings a great scenery to the area while there is the city and stores around it. The campus seems like it is separate from the area which to me is great because great falls is not a pretty town. "
College Junior,5,The computers on campus are on the higher end of basics with a few apple computers set up in the library.
College Sophomore,5,The forensic science program at UGF is the only one on this side of the Mississippi River. Also the biology program has an 89% placement for graduates.
College Sophomore,5,"There's no charge for a parking pass, it's issued as soon as you tell security that you have a car. However, there's very little need for a car on campus because UGF has a relatively small campus and walking across it takes less than 5-7 minutes depending where you're going. There are several very large parking lots for students to park in."
College Sophomore,5,"The smaller size of the campus allows students to access the computers in the labs, the University also has WiFi available to assist if you need to work on your own laptop for connivance you can access the USB and print anything from your own laptop just as you can if you was on the University's computers."
College Senior,5,There are many awesome restaurants in a very close area that will appeal to any preferences.  The costs are average and since I have been to almost all of them I would say the food is very good at them.
College Junior,5,"The guys and girls at my school are cool. They are very considerate of others and will willingly help out anyone. The staff is very friendly. One of the best things about this school is, it offers free tutoring within a friendly atmosphere. That is definitely something not to be taken for granted. Go! Guys and Gals."
College Freshman,5,"Professors at the University of Great Falls are easily accessible. The ones I've met have been friendly, easy to talk to, and don't mind helping you catch up if you're out. They don't mind if you ask for help, and they actually encourage it. There aren't any TA's that I'm aware of. Casses are actually taught by professors, and in time, they all know your name."
College Sophomore,5,A big part of my tuition is paid for by my academic scholarship. Athletic scholarships also help. They offer other scholarships as well.
College Sophomore,5,"It is a very friendly environment. It is small, and professors know you by your name."
College Freshman,5,You don't see or hear really anything about any drugs on or around the campus at the University of Great Falls.
Alum,4,I really loved the small class sizes and group activities. It really made the students and the facility into a tight-knit community.
Senior,4,"They are still relatively small so there weren't a lot of on campus clubs and limited activities. However, the class sizes are small so you get one-on-one with your teacher which really helps when it comes to asking questions and understanding the material."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy how small the University is and how well the professors know their students. The athletic teams support one another by showing up to games cheering them on, whether it be Ice hockey or Basketball."
Sophomore,4,It is a great small university. The level of education is excellent and everyone at the university is always trying to help the students to succeed.
Junior,4,"I will be going into my third year at the school, and I am still absolutely in love with it! What I really like about this school is the small class sizes. Since there is small classes your professors really pay attention to you and care about how you're doing in your classes. The school also has many great academic resources and many majors to choose from. Another thing I love about the school is how diverse it is. There are students that come to this school from all around the world!"
Freshman,4,It was an amazing experience. I was there during my freshmen year. The people there were very kind. They helped me a lot like the teacher they spent a lot of time to do an individual meetings. The only thing that I think need to be fixed was the cafetaria food and better Athletic facilities like soccer field and gym.
Freshman,4,The school was reallly nice. There are a lot of recourses to use. I had a great experience. There were some professors who didn’t get a long with the students. The hardest thing about this university is it is very expensive. I only have one parent to help pay for school so I’m having a really hard time trying to afford it. I love this school though.
Niche User,4,"I am only a commit, but I was very pleased by everything that UGF has to offer. Your academics are as important as your athletics to everyone there. I am very proud to be able to say that I am going to UGF."
Sophomore,4,"This school offers a variety of classes and always has a positive vibe around campus. Not only is the staff is very supportive, but also all of the students, no matter the age of the person.  Every building is in easy walking distance and the athletic programs here are great! Overall it has been a great experience. "
College Junior,4,The athletics at the school are great. Everyone is a great supporter for the athletes.
College Sophomore,4,The Safety on campus has been great so far.
College Sophomore,4,Not too sure so far what my career prospects will be but I have heard from other students that they are good.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience so far has been great!
College Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been great!
College Junior,4,I love this school just as much as I loved my first college I went to.
College Junior,4,I have yet to truly see the sporting atmosphere since I have only been here for a semester.
College Junior,4,I do not live on campus but from I hear it is very average on pricing.
College Junior,4,I am not on campus much. I just go to my classes and leave.
College Junior,4,The academics offered is slightly different than what I am used to since it is a different state but with being in a small school and small classes makes it helpful to get hands on help.
College Junior,4,"The school is on the smaller side with students, so the student to teacher ratio is great. The teachers that I have encountered are nice and very helpful with each student making it through the class."
College Freshman,4,"Its great most of the time, unless your going late night studies, or get crammed for finals"
College Freshman,4,there are quite a few options and some fairly close to campus
College Freshman,4,"The food is good. the one thing I don't like about it our weekend dining hours, I have to wait to almost noon to go eat. "
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at UGF have some small amount of drama but all of the teams do a lot of volunteer activities as a team.
College Sophomore,4,"If there is an on-campus party, security hears about and breaks it up almost immediately almost 100% of the time. Also, if you are 21 and have a roommate that is under 21, you are not allowed to have alcohol in your apartment."
College Sophomore,4,UGF has a great community and everyone says hello when they walk past each other.
College Sophomore,4,There's almost no need for transportation at UGF. The farthest campus housing is three short blocks from the school and there's a free campus bus service for these students.
College Sophomore,4,There are tons of computers and printers on campus and unlimited printing for a basic printing fee that's included in the start of year expenses.
College Sophomore,4,"We have great Chinese places and a bunch of different easy places and of course Taco Bell, which is always great at about one in the morning!"
College Junior,4,"Really good housing! Dorms are well organized, clean, and friendly. Dorm staff are really nice and helpful. The upperclassman housing is the best."
College Junior,4,"I am a history major at the University of Great Falls. The major is very flexible; you can more or less just take the classes you want. The professors are amazing - Dr. Pedersen and Prof. Donnelley are very knowledgeable and great in class. You can also work with your advisor to set up various internships - from working with the professors to assisting local museums. The program is absolutely fantastic and often offers travel classes - you take a class, then travel for two weeks (after paying for the trip of course). I would say there is only one downside to the program (and this is more of a general university as a whole downfall): language offerings are minimal at best. At present, I am struggling applying to graduate school because of my lack of language training. As I wish to study Mediterranean archaeology, more often than not, an ancient language such as Greek or Latin is a prerequisite to applying. Other than the language issue though, the program is fabulous."
College Freshman,4,"I had no issues with getting financial aid. My admissions counselor was fantastic and made sure that I got all the help I needed. The scholarship I applied for involved an interivew, and my interviewers were all nice people."
College Sophomore,4,There is quite a diversity. It is not a problem because everyone is friendly.
College Sophomore,4,Sports are a big thing at UGF. There are a lot of student athletes. Everyone is pretty good about supporting one another.
College Freshman,4,everyone is super friendly. there are a lot more girls than boys. for the most part everyone knows each other's names.
College Freshman,4,Campus is really safe but the city has some crazy reputations.
College Freshman,4,"2 dining halls. One in the student center, the other by the gym. not many options but good enough."
College Freshman,4,I don't think people do drugs but if they do it's not noticeable.
College Freshman,4,The school has a very good athletic program and the teachers are very understanding and easy to work with when it comes to missing class for athletics.
College Freshman,4,Several different majors are offered. The professors are all knowledgeable and thoughtful.
College Freshman,4,"The small class sizes allow for more personal relationships with the professors. Every professor I've had is on a first name basis with their students. They want everyone to be successful, and definitely try to make that happen."
College Freshman,4,everyone comes together for school sports and its cool to see all the teams supporting eachother
College Freshman,4,"small town, but you can always come up with something creative to do."
College Freshman,4,It went smoothly but didn't receive as much as I needed.
College Junior,4,The college supports their athletes and makes sure they get recommendation.
College Sophomore,4,"This campus is usually very safe and sends out alerts when suspicious peoplehave been spotted, which happens never practically."
College Sophomore,4,"It Isn't the Paper - It's the Accomplishment – I don't need the degree to be happy, but having one sure makes me feel pretty good about myself. I had to work hard to find the right college to fit my needs, without being some college 'out there' that was virtually unknown, even if it was accredited. I like that I have distance learning as an  option, while there are real people, who are near me that I can sit and meet with face to face. The staff has been so helpful and encouraging without seeming to be overbearing or pushing for my admittance like some online colleges, and unlike those colleges, UGF is about me, not me as a dollar sign. I've thoroughly enjoyed the process of connecting with them and I look forward to meeting my educational goals with their assistance. My only 'regret' thus far is that I didn't find them until late in the summer, making it really close to the deadline for application and registration for this term. I wouldn't encourage anyone to start as late as I did, but if you- the staff at UGF will do their best to help you meet your goals. I couldn't have picked a better route for (a mainly) distance learning program. It's an incredible feeling when you finish something, self-worth is the first and most important prize."
College Sophomore,4,"I Feel Safe – The area surrounding our campus does make me feel safe. There are a lot of different business, shopping options, and food/stores. These are all good to have around a university."
College Sophomore,4,"I like attending school here. I feel that there is no problems with race towards others, everybody is accepting."
College Junior,4,"Labs Crowded, but Wifi Accessibility Worth It – If you don't have your own portable computer, you may not have prepared for college properly. It would be irresponsible to rely on the school to provide a computer these days. Wifi access, however, is mandatory, and at UGF, it's stellar. I can get it in any classroom, in my car, outside in the shade under a tree. That is what is really worth it. I don't even need to use a computer they have to print something off. It's done wirelessly."
College Junior,4,Perfect for Major – I'm in Athletic Training and this school's requirements are great for this major. The classes are very job specific and will actually help you in the future. The instructors are very personal and helpful with anything and everything. The classes for core requirements really help you open your mind to new ideas.
College Junior,4,"Private Catholic – We have a wide variety of student types, but because we are a private catholic school, I think people turn away from it if they aren't catholic. I personally am not religious, and didn't feel pressured to be to be able to attend the school. I think we could have an even bigger student body if more people understood they didn't have to be catholic to attend."
College Junior,4,Very Secure – This campus is a small campus that has good security and is a place that works to provide constant practice of checking that security. They have a system set up in the housing so that any problems are dealt with right away and so no real problems with drinking or drugs ever arise. Some of the housing could use some upgrades but otherwise is still secure. It is a smaller town and the campus is located only a few blocks from one of the top hospitals in the state. It is overall a great place.
College Junior,4,"COLD COLD COLD – Ideal for snow bunnies, hunters and fishermen, hikers nature enthusiasts."
College Sophomore,4,if your a bio major you have plenty of intership availability actually that goes for anything with science. Criminall justice and law have a lot of opportunities too because one of the professors works with the legislature.
College Freshman,4,"We have GREAT NAIA teams. our volleyball, soccer, basketball,track and cross country, and wrestling teams are some of the top teams in our division. Soccer boys won confrence the last two years, our volleyball was leading the confrence this year, and our wrestling is in the top 4 in the nation every year."
College Freshman,4,Off campus dining is great; We are surrounded by all the food chain fast food stops and restraunts and they are cheap. There is also a lot of locally owned places to eat that are great.
College Freshman,4,"They have decent facilities. They have an athletic center, a gym, a cafe, a coffee corner, a student center, a center for academic excellence, a library, a book/convenience store, and a cafeteria. They are working on installing a fountain in the center of the quarter that is promising to be quite nice. Overall, it has anything you need for daily life on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Place to Go – Great Falls in my standards is a big town, There is lots to do; like shopping in the mall, movie theater, swimming pool, plenty of fast food place to hang out with friends. Being a college athlete, i need to train and Great Falls has plenty of place to run and cross train. There are students here from all over, like Ireland, Norway, Alaska, Florida, New York. There is a great wide variety of students which makes it much more fun to get to know people."
College Junior,4,"Small Class Sizes and Great Professors – One of the best things about the University of Great Falls is the small class sizes. Class sizes top out at just twenty students which allows a more hands on learning experience. It makes it easy to relate to professors and other classmates. It's very beneficial to be able to hear and learn about about different perspectives from these people you grow so close to. Also, the professors are not just there to preach, they care about each individual."
Senior,2,Lots of issues with the program used by the university Moodle was very hard at times and had a lot of bugs. Teachers were not well prepared for the online classes as the pandemic happened which was stressful and confusing.
Sophomore,2,"The name is now the University of Providence. The name change occurred in July of 2017. The admin is poor, and they never get back to you, and they treat all of the students like children. The sports scholarship program is also not good. If they gave every team fair scholarships and rewarded athletes for the work they do instead of signing, and then quitting the team it would be a lot better. I like the teachers though, they are very good at what they do, especially the business department."
College Freshman,2,This school will not help students with off campus housing. Students are all on their own.
College Freshman,2,"Off campus dinning is composed of mainly traditional fast food food chains. There are few Hispanic Dining, they are not good, they all taste like Taco Bell. There is few good places to go eat, for example, Kobe's sushi, and Montana Wheat."
College Freshman,2,"Fridays are great to go out and do something, such roller skate, hang out with friends, watch movies, etc. This school is not really a party school. I been to a few parties but did not enjoy none of them. All people do is drink, sit, and in some cases get emotional. No one really has fun and dances."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the food is fating and the line is usually horrible. The only thing that I really enjoy and recommend is the BBQ meals. Other than the BBQ, the food is not really great."
College Freshman,2,"The overall housing, especially freshman housing, is not good. The rooms are not one bit of sound proof, so there is no privacy. The restrooms are discussing as well as the lounges. They are usually always dirt. The halls are usually loud and have no respect for others living in the building. The only thing I like about the housing is that the housing office will occasionally host events that students usually find enjoyable."
College Junior,2,The bars are lower class and I am surprised a lot of them survive the years. There is one or two I would go to because they are newer and meant for young people but they are not close to the campus
College Junior,2,"The professors are amazing and they do great things for their students, all things considered. But the administration likes to micromanage and puts image before anything else - including academics. Because of that, this university often doesn't have the equipment and materials needed to have a truly successful program. Also, as the school has open enrollment, there is a very low bar of expectations. Among the core courses is Math 100 - where you learn about adding, subtracting, and fractions. No offense to the people that have to take these courses, but the very fact that the majority of students that go to the University of Great Falls have to take such low level courses and barely scrape by ... that's all that really needs to be said about how great the academics are at UGF. I personally would have given UGF an F for academics if it wasn't for the great professors there."
College Junior,2,On top of going to school full-time I also work full-time so I am unable to go enjoy the Nighlife at UGF!  One day I will be able to have a little fun but that time is not right now.
College Junior,2,The facilities are quite old.  You would expect more with the price of tuition.  Te simple things like new chairs would go a long way.
College Junior,2,The campus is not very strict at all.  As I would expect with each student here treated as an adult and not a child
College Freshman,2,"It's windy beyond reason here! If you don't like wind, don't come here. The weather,since this is Montana, changes multiple times throughout the day. Winters are cold and windy, and summers are hot."
College Sophomore,2,"It snows here and gets very cold. Classes never get cancelled. Wind makes it colder.
Very nice during summer though!"
College Junior,2,"Variety at a Null – Around campus, there are not a lot of options for restaurants. There are 2 or 3 places within walking distance of campus, but they are all fast food. The majority of them also require you to cross the main road in town which can be very dangerous for any pedestrian."
College Sophomore,2,The school is pretty strict and limits the social scene. Having a gathering in your apartment of more than 8 people is not allowed. There are many silly rules and regulations that have to be followed.
College Sophomore,2,"It is a great starter school for those who are looking for something small and personal. There are some really great aspects to the school, but it is very small and everyone knows everybody and everything. It is a private school so it is quite expensive. The dorms are fun while your in them but because all the upper class man housing is so spread out the connections made sometimes are hard to keep up on. The housing process is really easy."
College Sophomore,2,"The professors are great but if your not from a small town or from this ""city"" ( its a really small city) then its a huge change. People can be fairly nice but most people have known eachother from hs or since they were kids and stick to their own clicks. The atmosphere to me is very high school and childish with many people classified as jocks and the drama club and so on. But there are those few people who are great to be around. the classes are small and the professors are always reachable. You can always get help from the professors and tutors are everywhere. The weather here is excruiciatingly hot in august, september, october, nice in november, and then cold from december to may, and by cold i mean snowing and below zero temperatures. I have to say though, the faculty is very nice and the president of the school will listen to anything you have to say. He also knows the names of all the students on campus which is rare for any president of any school to do. If i could do it all over again, i would opt for a bigger school with more activities and things to do outside of school. this place gets pretty dead other than the drinking almost everyday."
College Freshman,2,"Montana weather is hot in the summer, reaching temps over 100 at times, and very cold in the winter.  The winters are long, usually starting in October or November, and lasting until April and sometimes May.  The temps can frequently dip colder than -20.  Great Falls is not the place of choice if you do not like long cold winters."
College Junior,2,"The Windy City – You should expect the wind to blow and the temperature to be low. It gets cold and snows quite a bit in the winter. But of course, it is Montana."
College Senior,1,"The campus is too small. The town has nothing to do, no sight seeing, night life and only 1 museum. Very limited on the banks that are not local. The dorms and apartments are in terrible condition and the science department has little or no instructors and has no student councils for dealing with terrible instructors. The business office that handles scholarships and payment try to cheat the students out of money. The student cafeteria is not open all day and the students are only allowed a small array of food options. The food is expensive and does not taste good. They use eggs out of a carton similar to that of a milk carton. The library services are not too bad but the hours are terrible. The whole campus is very inconvenient when it comes to hours of operation for food services, many students are forced to eat out due to the limited hours and even if the cafeteria is open to serve food it is very expensive."
College Freshman,1,There are no frats or sorieties
College Junior,1,"It consumes everything!!!! It's awful. I get that sports are a part of campus life ... But they shouldn't be all the university cares about. After all, we here to LEARN!"
College Junior,1,"While the security guards we do have are kind, there is only ever one on duty - driving around from the various campus apartments and walking around campus. There was an incident of a girl getting attacked in the dorm parking lot. Two freshman called campus security from their dorm, watching the attack. Not only did the response take too long, but maintenance was sent to the parking lot instead of security. While things like this don't happen often, it would be nice to know you're safe. 
With all recent shootings, UGF attempted to create a plan for if such an attack took place (unlikely, but you never know). The plan failed. Not only was the notification for lock down delivered poorly, but there are locations on campus that simply would not be safe in such a situation, due to ease of access (gigantic windows, doors with windows ... makes it easy to just shoot out the window and enter). Also, the walls are so thin that all a shooter would have to do is walk the halls and shoot through the walls.
As for health ... there is no health insurance available, so many of us students are screwed if we end up with health needs. There is a nurse available two days a week, but she really can't do much but care for the common cold. Also, the campus is NOT disabled friendly. The only building on campus with an elevator is in the dorm. And the campus itself is on different levels, and if somebody is in a wheelchair, they have to go out of their way just to get from building to building. It's difficult to get through doors, deal with laundry, and get in and out of the bathrooms if you're in a wheelchair. While the school might negotiate your disability (say arrange that you are always on the first floor), it still leave much to be desired. Overall, I'd say that UGF fails epically when it comes to being safe and healthy."
College Junior,1,"While there might be actual ""rules"" on campus, they are never followed. If you're going to college to party, you'll be fine. If you're going to college for the education, UGF offer the best environment. I moved off campus half-way through my second year. Between the stifling (albeit typical) rules (such as no posters, basically no decorating of any kind, quiet hours that everyone ignored) and the constant noise and distraction from my less than focused counterparts, I decided to move to an off campus apartment ... where it has been very quiet and easy to take care of without people being allowed to go in and periodically search my room without my permission or even knowledge. In any case, the rules are there. Sometimes you might get caught, but most of the time, you won't. If you're an academic like me, take my advice. Live off campus. Period."
College Freshman,1,There are no ways of transportation unless its a school event I which the school provides buses.
College Senior,1,its snow a lot  some  years. weather is bi-polar sunny one day and poring rain the next day

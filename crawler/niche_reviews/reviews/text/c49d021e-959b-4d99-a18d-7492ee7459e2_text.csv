Senior,5,My experience at NEIT has been great. As a Senior in the Architectural Engineering program I have been set up with a foundation that will help me to further my career exponentially.
Senior,5,Being a student here during the current Covid-19 pandemic has changed my education greatly. I went from being a strictly on campus student to fully online then continued to a hybrid of both. The teachers never changed the way they help is however. We were still given the opportunity to ask questions if needed and to get as much help as possible. They transitioned easily and they online classes were thorough and they explained everything to set us up for success.
Alum,5,"The nursing faculty is the best in the whole East Coast or even in the country, I dare say. They truly care about your total well-being and success after the program and not just their graduate passing rates. I was truly blessed to attend here. It changed my whole world view."
Alum,5,"Online classes do not feel virtual, the professors and entire faculty are just messages or phone calls away, even on weekends."
Freshman,5,"NEIT is a wonderful school. They gave me a chance to accomplish my dreams when other did not. They also have a great hands on school work, to build our skills."
Freshman,5,My experience so far is very good! I am currently getting used to the building and where to go for what. I am applying into the nursing program because it is my dream to gain a career as a doctor in the future. I love the staff and teachers who have already helped me along the way so far. I am truly blessed and excited to begin the next step in my life here at this very school of my choice. The architecture and the way the building is made is amazing. I was so surprised to see a beautiful water fall in the middle of the entrance walkway inside the school. Everyone was so welcoming and always smiling. I was going in the wrong direction and asked for help and was immediately pointed in the right direction. The students I passed seemed very nice and eager to further their education which is very motivating in my opinion. As I said before I am so excited to start and meet many new people to gain friendships with.
Niche User,5,"With what I have seen of the College, they have a very broad curriculum for students to dive into and learn about. The tuition may be a bit pricey, however there will be a pay off by them being able to help students receive a job of their choosing."
Freshman,5,"I started at NEIT in January of 2019.  Previously, I was enrolled at Community College of Rhode Island and I am so grateful for transferring.  The admissions staff welcomed my family and I with open arms in orientation.  The campus is beautiful.  I really do enjoy waking up every day to go to class. My professors in the Respiratory program are outstanding.  They push us, but encourage and help us to work to the best of our ability.  I have five more ten week quarters and then I will be graduating.  I cannot wait to work in a hospital and save as many lives that I can."
Niche User,5,New England tech is a good trade school. The workers at this location are lovely and willing to help those in need. Great programs offer to student to further there career. I love the two year program they offer to student to advance they career!
Freshman,5,"Overall I like NEIT because of the hands on experience you get in your field almost immediately.  It focuses strictly on the career path that you are choosing and the schedule is already set up so you don't waste anytime getting the degree you want.  I love that it also focuses helping students get jobs in their career field after school.  There is internships built into the degree program, and they have job fairs with prospective employers multiple times a year.  The campus is all up to date facilities and infrastructure.  From my experience the teachers all have lots of experience in their field and are knowledgeable in their subject matter.  The only negative thing is the price to go here."
Freshman,5,"New England Institute of Technology is THE place to attend if you wish to find a job in your field quickly and easily. There are so many resources available to each and every student to do just that and honestly cannot be compared. To top it off, all the faculty are very understanding and are willing to work with each and every student to ensure success."
Sophomore,5,"New England Tech has been a wonderful experience. Lots of activities to do and great programs. People here are nice and friendly, especially the teachers and staff. I love here and wish the school will only improve."
Freshman,5,I love the nursing program! I love how fast it is! Great when it comes to help. You will always have someone there to help; we have the academic skills center. Free touring! And the school catches your eye. Very attractive looking.
Junior,5,This college is great and Iâ€™m proud to be enrolled. The professors and faculty are always willing to help and push students to try their best. The curriculum is very constructive and effective based on courses of study. The brand new campus is beautiful and architecturaly attractive. Lastly when finally looking to get hired the school does a great job of setting up networking nights so students could possibly start a career with companies assosictaed with the school.

Freshman,5,"I found NEIT very helpful for me with application and financial aide.  Everyone made this process easy, especially since I am going back to school after 10 years from High School Graduation.  The courses are specific in the field of study I am interested in. I am very excited to get started."
Freshman,5,"What I like about New England Institute of Technology is the convenience that is provided for students, The accommodations and kindness that all of my professor and teachers have offered to students. New England Tech is certainly a school that caters to the needs of the students rather than private interest and is an amazing university to attend."
Junior,5,NEITs mechanical engineering program is very resourceful between the vast course selection and adjunct professors that have real world relateable experience.  I was referred here by two other mechanical engineers.  It is definitely a challenge but all in all they get you ready for your career.
Freshman,5,Students and staff create a welcoming atmosphere that invite you in and want to be apart of the school.
Freshman,5,Very high tech!!! Always improving different things. Up with the latest things and will accommodate for Mac or pc computers. They help with every aspected of the process and are very involved
Freshman,5,Very professional and teachers are always very helpful. I would highly recommend New England tech . The staff at New England tech all go above and beyond to assist you in any way they can
Graduate Student,5,New England Institute of Technology is a great school for anyone who is passionate about the career of choice. I had completed my associates here in the OTA program and am back to complete the OT program to earn my masters. The professors are incredibly knowledgable and help build your clinical and professional skills.
Freshman,5,This school is absolutely beautiful. The campus is newly renovated! The staff is so pleasant to deal with. They want you to graduate!
Niche User,5,New England institute of technoloy has state of the art nursing simulation labs that train individuals to become great nurses!
Freshman,5,"Although I don't attend the school YET, I went for an interview today and the experience was amazing. My admissions advisor Brian was wonderful, he laid out everything I needed to know and didn't sugar coat anything. Coming from a young teen whose been around the block with schools and health care jobs, I was thrilled to hear about reality than painted fairy tales."
Freshman,5,"I have ben to New England of Institute of Technology twice now, and each time I went there the faculty was very helpful and kind. I love the campus, it is very beautiful and has access to a small plaza with restaurants and a movie theater! They are just now making dorms for the students as well; however it is quite expensive to live in the dorms, not to mention you can only live there for the first year, and then you have to move into an apartment complex. That is probably the thing I would like to change about NEIT, other than that, this school is fantastic!"
Freshman,5,"This is my first semester at NEIT and I couldn't love it more. Beautiful and up kept buildings. Professional professors who love what they are teaching and have a degree in that subject. All of the students are nice and welcoming. Definitely recommend and if you go to every class and do different things.. the price is worth it! They have so many different free services for students such as tutoring by professors, career services where they make your resume and help you with interviews, transportation etc. I LOVE NEIT!!"
College Senior,5,Like I said I am a military Vet with five kids ranging from ages 4-11. My fiance' recently got offered a job that would be a big help financially. I was concerned I would not be able to continue in my major because it doesn't offer night courses due to a lack of students interested in doing nights. I went to my department head and he was more than happy to help me figure out a solution that would both benefit my education in the same major as well as allow my fiance' to take the job. I am extremely grateful to the staff for understanding the importance of my education as well as taking in the consideration of my family's well being.
College Senior,5,"I may have already covered this but the professors I have worked with are always more than happy to help out with advice or if you don't understand something. I think the small classes make it easier for students to get a professors attention when it's needed. The professors aren't overwhelmed with students, they know us by name and get to know about our personal lives and we learn a bit about theirs which makes the environment more comfortable. it's easier to talk to someone when you actually get to know them as more than professor and student."
College Senior,5,They know that coming back to school can be overwhelming and were very informative and helpful every step of the way. I don't think the degree matters as much as the actual skills and experiences you are receiving as well as the real world advice and information given from the professors who learned from their own experiences in the field.
College Senior,5,New England Tech was a huge part of being able to turn my life around. Like I said the hands on learning combined with academic learning really helped me get a grasp on how to work the equipment needed in my field. I learn best when I'm physically doing things. I'm currently going for my bachelor's degree but in my associates I interned at a small magazine and felt confident enough to hand the editor a few articles that I have written and they actually made the magazine. I don't think I would have been as confident if it weren't for the training I had gotten from NEIT.
College Senior,5,"I was nervous about going back to school after the military, I have five kids and the professors and head of my department have always been more than helpful and understanding when it comes to my family. In most cases it doesn't feel like we are students but more like colleagues and they are walking us through what our careers will be like. I have gone to professors for everything from registering for classes to personal problems and I have never been turned away. In fact, if they were busy at the moment they made sure to make time for me and get back to me either in person, over the phone or through email. We as students have virtually unlimited access to learning resources as well as the latest in state of the art equipment. The mix of hands on training combined with academic learning has really helped me get a better understanding of what I want my career to be...I have even considered looking to work for the school once I have my degree."
College Junior,5,"A degree as a registered nurse will give me the opportunity to work at high-level hospitals, speciality practices such as orthopedics, cardiology and oncology, or a pediatric hospital . However, your employment history and personal desire to work is all dependent on where you go and if you are hired upon graduation. It is not guaranteed to find employment upon graduation, you will still need to pass the NCLEX for your state licensure. There are plenty of study groups available but you have to be determined to find the time to study and apply the principles of nursing to daily living."
College Junior,5,"In addition to the beautiful facilities and amenities available to students, the faculty and administration are very knowledgable and always available to assist with any questions and concerns you have. Beginning with the admissions counselor and financial aid advisor, that was all I needed to confirm my decision to attend NEIT."
Recent Alumnus,5,I am learning everything I need and want to know.
College Sophomore,5,The school does not stop until you have a job in your field of study.
College Freshman,5,They really help you to see what you really want to do in life and get there at the school with their help to the best of their ability.
College Sophomore,5,"Great facility, fun courses, great location"
College Sophomore,5,very knowledgeable and helpful professors
College Sophomore,5,New England Technology is a place for a student who wants work hands on. The school shows what it is like the workforce is like and how to get ready for it.
College Sophomore,5,The school is non-profit and expanding their campus for a reason. The professors are as good as they get and they are the only college that will let you meet some of the professor... during the open house. What you see is what you'll get. #1 college in Rhode Island for online courses too!
College Senior,5,"Overall, I enjoyed NEIT. I find the professors very knowledgeable. The night classes afforded us, as students, a little more leniency when it comes to turning work in because the professors are understanding of our situation. This does not mean we get to turn in everything late, but if we just explain the situation the professors are very understanding. I am the graduate program right now and I am very glad I chose to attend NEIT for it. If you are looking to complete a degree only in 3 years, this is the place to go - but it is intense. Be prepared mentally or you won't be able to give it 100%."
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the school every one is so helpful and wants to see you succeed.
College Sophomore,5,New England Institute of Technology is a school geared towards students who want to learn. The school's policies are fair and the instructors are friendly and approachable. The Library is always in impeccable condition and the student resources like the Career Services and Academic Skills Center are home to staff that love the school and the students. The atmosphere at New England Tech is one of cooperation and encouragement. There are frequent events where networking is encouraged among students and possible employers. The students are treated as adults regardless of age and every department is ready and willing to work hard to benefit each other. It is the ideal environment to study and learn.
College Sophomore,5,As long as you register for your classes early you can rest assured that your schedule will fit in nicely with any other commitments.
College Sophomore,5,I fell in love with this school when I first walked through the door. I attended a summer camp to prepare me for what was to come but I wasn't expecting to have so much fun. This really is a school worth attending.
College Sophomore,5,I grew attached to the teachers and staff faster than I thought I would and that is unusual for me. I love how easy it is to register for classes and learn from people who have had years if experience in their respective fields. There tons of courses to choose from and I feel like I get more than money's worth at this school. I am happy at NEIT and the quality of education that I am receiving.
College Sophomore,5,New England Institute of Technology goes above and beyond to bring their students the best and to bring the workforce the best workers.
College Sophomore,5,The Architecture major in particular is enough to keep any student on their toes. Because of all the information an architect has to process there is a lot of notes to be taken. That aside it is mostly hands on work in the studio that keeps us busy. The studio is where most of the draft work gets done. The school provides a clean and productive working environment for its students and professors often walk back and forth assisting students when necessary. Inter-class teamwork is encouraged between new students and the more experienced ones.  There is a wall in the studio where employers seeking interns or part time help can post job ads for students to fulfill.
College Senior,5,"Since I live far away from my school, the online classes worked out great. Discussion boards provided a lot of good discussion and class communication."
College Senior,5,"I'm so excited to graduate and find a job in this great career and I know the school will help me do this, and succeed."
College Senior,5,I love everything about neit it's amazing. All the professors and the classes are great.
College Senior,5,The students at my school are all so nice and are really interesting. There are people from other cultures and even students from other countries. Everyone is so smart and understanding. There are always groups of people that are cliquey but that's life and even they are nice sometimes.
College Senior,5,"The library is beautiful and the staff there is so helpful, it's always quiet and there is always computers available to use. Also there are private rooms you can have unlocked for study groups/ sessions which are really nice and make it easier to get closer with fellow program students,"
College Senior,5,"It's so easy to sign up for classes and I've never had the same professor twice but they are all very nice and knowledgable about that subject. They also have an English and math lab with free tutoring which is amazing, for when you just have a few simple questions or need indepth help with a certain issue."
College Junior,5,The school building is pretty brand new and the atmosphere is beautiful. The classrooms are all state of the art. The nursing lab room is brand new and has the best learning appliances.
College Junior,5,It is a technical school so everything  is up to date and the best that is out there.
College Junior,5,"best academic experience I've had, great teachers, good workload where we learn the subject matter but aren't buried, wouldn't change a thing"
College Sophomore,5,Flexibility of classes for sure.
College Sophomore,5,They help you untill you find employment
Sophomore,4,"My experience at New England tech is a great one, wonderful teachers who put you first and wonder student support. If you want to go to a school who cares about you go here."
Freshman,4,"I normally would be on campus, but due to COVID-19 I am doing online classes. From going to classes in person to online my teachers are doing an amazing job. In the short time they where given to set up the classes."
Freshman,4,Itâ€™s amazing the support here is just so great one main reasons why I came here cause there so supportive and want help you to succeed they just donâ€™t wanna take your money. I love it here
Freshman,4,I plan on attending NEIT this coming fall. I have visited the campus multiple times throughout the summer and i have to admit i am very impressed.
Freshman,4,"I have not started attending classes yet, however I was recently accepted into the Nursing Program for this upcoming fall semester. This good review is based on how nice and helpful all of the admissions and testing center staff is. I have attended other colleges/universities in the past and have never received such good service. 
The campus is beautiful and clean as well."
Freshman,4,I prefer small campuses so this is great for me. Theres a very hands on approach to learning. The teachers and staff are very knowledgable and helpful. Everything is very new and modern and is a comfortable place to learn and meet new people!
Senior,4,I love working with other classmates. The teachers are awesome and they even work within the same field you're studying in. Amazing 1 on 1 time of student and teacher.
Freshman,4,"As I have just applied to New England Tech, it is difficult to give an honest review. I can say that are a variety of programs to choose from which makes your choice either easy or difficult"
Alum,4,"I love NEIT. I graduated from here in 2017, and am planning to return here for a second degree. If you are focused on getting your degree and furthering your career and not wasting time Gen Ed's, this is the best school for you. New England Tech is a technical university and is very hands-on, and you earn your associate's degree in a year and a half or your bachelor's degree in three years. This school lays out the classes and paths you must take in order to graduate, there is so much help between councilors and tutors and advisors. You have smaller classes, which helps professors focus on you and your style of learning.  I recommend this institute highly.

The only issue I've had is that tuition is high, due to it being a private university."
Freshman,4,New England Tech is great. All of the teachers are very knowledgeable and actually want you to succeed.
Freshman,4,NEIT has a lot to offer a student. Free tutoring and open labs to practice away from the classroom. The staff is very friendly and very helpful.
Freshman,4,"Everyone is extremely personable, you are not just a number here. I recently moved from England to be with my wife, and everyone has made me feel like an American and like I belong here."
Niche User,4,This is a great school for the trades. The teachers are knowledgeable and have worked in the fields that they teach. But this school is very expensive.
College Senior,4,Online courses were great and helped me a bit. I continued to take online courses during summer break and really the only thing missing was the hands on experience.
College Junior,4,"As a student of nursing, the goal is to promote health and wellness. With the help of the faculty, you learn the fundamentals of nursing, anatomy and physiology, critical thinking skills, math related to nursing, microbiology, importance of communication in the medical field, etc. This opportunity will lead my to a career as a Registered Nurse, expanding my career opportunities to hospitals, home health care, clinics and speciality hospitals around the country. It is not an easy field by any means, the workload is strenuous but totally worth it after the 21 months of education."
Recent Alumnus,4,The administration helped me with everything.  I have found classes are easy to schedule around work.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I'm sure this school would help with placement, but I don't intend on leaving my current job."
Recent Alumnus,4,The nighttime professors I have found to be better and more helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,I am somewhat in the field and I have learned so much.
Recent Alumnus,4,"One of the Professors should be retired, but one of the Professors that I've had is excellent."
College Senior,4,"My teachers have been only a few, and most of them have been very understanding about real-world problems or responsibilities that require flexibility."
College Senior,4,"My school offers many job fairs and career center opportunities including but not limited to resume building seminars, mock-interviews, etc."
College Senior,4,Each one of my core courses I've taken so far are straight to the point in the way that the name of the course strongly reflects its material.
College Senior,4,This school is more career orientated than any school I've attended.
College Senior,4,There is a lot of hands-on experience in my major that immerses you in the field in which you are going to work in.
College Senior,4,I have had a great overall experience at this school so far. I have learned so much that its sometimes hard to reflect on it until I finish a quarter.
College Sophomore,4,It is great because it lets me work at my own pace.
College Sophomore,4,Like I said previously they do not stop helping you until they get you a job.
College Sophomore,4,I am very excited to continue my education here at New England Tech.
College Sophomore,4,They have an awesome nursing program with great labs.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not currently go here, however I have a lot of family and friends who have gone and they loved it."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy my school the teachers are always available for extra help if you need it
College Sophomore,4,I can't really speak to this with accuracy yet. But I know I am already employed with a company that will continue after I graduate if I want.
College Sophomore,4,The instructors are also involved/working in their fields of study. Not just teaching it. When I was at a different college studying a different degree the professors teaching had never even practiced in the field they were instructing and often even knocked the profession. NOT COOL!
College Sophomore,4,"The general education requirements that must be taken are applicable in our tech classes so it makes the learning important instead of just ""to get the degree""."
College Sophomore,4,"So glad I transferred here! I thought I wanted ""college"" but hands on education at a technical university fits me best. Would definitely recommend this school to someone that is smart but not into book learning!"
College Junior,4,Instructors are thorough an attentive to students. They will make time and be there if students need help.
College Junior,4,There are so many different things to learn in the criminal justice system. Students are taught a lot of just about everything in the field from technology to forensics etc.
College Junior,4,The career center emails postings of new jobs. They teach you interview skills
College Junior,4,Instructors are flexible with people who work and understand when students have to leave class early to make it to work.
College Freshman,4,They are very good with being flexible with the students' schedules and working around them.
College Freshman,4,This school provides careers for a little bit of any and everything a student would want to pursue in technology in their career at some point.
College Freshman,4,It is a very beautiful school with a very beautiful environment all around.
College Freshman,4,"Everybody at the school was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They help me with anything I asked and they are very helpful and respectful and as well as being a beautiful school, the school can provide me with what I need to get what I want as a career done in the process."
College Sophomore,4,beautiful school but incredibly expensive
College Sophomore,4,The workload is balanced and truly emphasizes the content learned in class.
College Sophomore,4,"Though I've only spent one full trimester at my school, i find it easily navigable and an enjoyable place to learn. The teachers are very knowledgeable in many subjects that directly relate to your major. This was the best choice of schooling for me."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics at New England Tech are fairly challenging and the workload is usually heavy enough to warrant a decent effort. Teachers do their best to instruct their students and teach based on the feedback given by the students. In the event that a student struggles with any given subject, the academic skills center is open around the clock to assist students in any given subject."
College Senior,4,The education environment is very rewarding and hands on but lack of a student society and price of tuition really take a toll
College Senior,4,"Really hands on, teachers are very direct and help you outwith anything."
College Senior,4,Regarding the education i think a degree and the knowledge gained at this school will be very valuable out in the real world
College Senior,4,The teachers are very direct and care to every student. Also many hands on lessons.
College Freshman,4,The EG building is beautiful. The library is one of my favorite places to go and study.
College Senior,4,The every other weekend classes worked out great since I live far away.
College Senior,4,It is a tech school and offers many different programs. I chose it because it has a bridge program from COTA to OTR. They are very helpful and friendly.
College Senior,4,It is a bridge program so almost everyone is on the same page as far as educational background.
College Junior,4,"There is a variety of students at my school, most of which seem to be very goal orientated and focused."
College Junior,4,The program is wonderful. It is fast paced and not too much workload because most of the work is either hands on or done on the computer.
College Junior,4,The curriculum is straight forward and unique to my school.
College Junior,4,The post-grad services at my school are great. There are people who assist me along with other students in finding jobs.
Sophomore,2,"With a accelerated program it is extremely difficult to handle school work and work at home. It even is hard as deadlines creep up on you fast. Iâ€™m not as fast as a learner, so I feel behind quick when it came to online classes. At times I wanted to wait out the pandemic and go back but I will never give up on my dreams no matter what."
Alum,2,"I attended NEIT and graduated in 2017. It was one of the worst decisions ever. If you are planning to become an engineer, stay away from NEIT because it's a technical school, not an Engineering College. The courses at NEIT are more hands-on, and for a technical degree, the tuition should not be this high. With an associate's or a bachelor's from NEIT, you can be either a technician or a technologist, not an ENGINEER. So, make sure you do your own research, and do not trust the advisors at NEIT who will let you believe that their credits are transferable. Unfortunately, they are not, I tried everything to transfer my credits to many schools, but the answer was always the same, ""we do not accept credits earned from NEIT."" Some engineering companies are also confused about NEIT graduates' background. They might hire, but later on, they realize that we have basic understandings of the field, and they won't like it. That's what I'm going through right now,  back to Engineering College."
Recent Alumnus,2,I am an international and I can not have finical aid.
College Junior,2,"NEIT doesn't offer financial aid like a typical state college. Your financial aid will be the Federal help you get plus the handful of $500 scholarships you have to apply for but possibly won't even get. They'll set you up on a monthly payment plan but if you miss some payments be expecting a call down to student accounts so they can nag you on how you're going to pay it. They don't offer ""real"" financial aid."
College Senior,2,"Only one campus contains the computer labs. The other facilities are running old computers mostly still on Windows XP. Equipment is rarely updated (A/V, apps are mostly out of date). On my campus there are no facilities to for quiet study."
College Junior,2,"the tuition is a bit more than i originally expected. the financial aide process is, well, a process. i applied about 4 times just to find out i didnt qualify for financial aide. i dont understand why i need to use a parent's information if neither of them are helping me pay for school. not all schools require a parent's information, so i'm not sure why it matters at this school."
Sophomore,1,"This is the worst school I could have picked. I am in my associates for Nursing and am desperately wanting to leave this program. DO NOT COME HERE! I was living on campus and got injured by another student, saw multiple holes in the walls from students, and couldn't go to sleep before 1am ever. I am moving out and, hopefully, can continue my education without further injury."
Graduate Student,1,Great teachers for plumbing but horrible system. I went there for an associates and have spent the last two years battleing with there 3 seperate loan systems. During school on a busy day they would send a guy  around a pull you out of class to tell you that you missed a payment. Intimadating and embarrassing. I got injured last year serious neck fracture i let them know i was going to be out of work and could not pay she said she would put that down. I never recieved any phone calls even tho they said the repeatedly tried. They accually issued a warrent for my arrest for not paying! I highly recommend finding a different school. I know how great there academic and teachers are but its not even close to being worth  it with how bad the system works
Alum,1,"This ""school"" is a joke. They take your money and RUN. And if you even think in the slightest you'll be okay, you won't. They are going to run you dry. The teachers are also a joke. To be an ""established institution"" is another joke. The degree is not worth it here. There are so so many issues, especially with how they handle things."
Niche User,1,"Worst school possible. I was falsely accused of plagiarism and have witnesses to prove it. That didn't matter to the professor they still got failed for it. So I left because I was then being forced to pay for the class out of pocket, that I couldn't pay for. Now they say I owe them money for the class I ""failed"" and when I tried to get my student loan information to make payments they refused to give it to me, ""until I paid off what I owed the school first"". If it was possible to rate them as a 0 I would. This place will ruin your life."
College Junior,1,"cafeteria is terrible and grossly overpriced

bookstore is also robbery in the form of ridiculous prices"
Recent Alumnus,1,Their credits don't transfer to other colleges.
Recent Alumnus,1,"For all the money a student pays, the education is no better than getting a book and computer and just teaching yourself."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I don't know which school the other reviewers attended, but my experience with Career Services has been a waste of time. The very few jobs they've managed to scrounge up are menial and pay very little."
College Junior,1,for the program im going to school for and the campus im on not alot of activities. the library is at the other campus most activities are there as well.
College Senior,1,"This school has virtually nothing in the way of resources for students. Unless you're into pool and ping-pong forget it, even with these two you have to have afternoon or evening classes to take advantage of the 'competitions' they hold. There is nothing outside of the new campus to excite and engage the students with. I did try to get a sailing club off the ground, even though this is Rhode Island, the school gave me a flat out No to starting anything that might involve actual activity."
College Senior,1,"I would give the resources a 'just OK' There are three separate campuses, but only one has any facilities. I have taken this up with Student Support Services on a couple of occasions almost since I first enrolled, however there has been no improvement. Facilities could and should be better."
College Senior,1,"The staff was overall good to work with and its not so much the school.  I do not come from a poor family, but we can just about keep the lights on and have a little extra, sometimes with my help.  Being a white male born and raised in the united states has not helped me.  I can not get financial ""aid"", all the loans applied for on a private level were denied.  The school was ""nice"" enough to pick up the remainig balance leaving me with a 300 a month bill to pay while in school.  Just a horrible system for someone who truely values education, not looking for a free ride but just some help so I do not have to worry about getting kicked out of school vs getting my car repossessed."
Recent Alumnus,1,professors act like it's high school they gossip and don't grade based on your work but whether or not they like you. I have seen professors give students points to pass and some they tell to leave b/c they won't be a good nurse in their minds and won't help them. IT IS DISCRIMINATION
Recent Alumnus,1,"for the nursing program be prepared to spend a fortune, I have not even graduated yet and I am up to $60k in debt"
College Freshman,1,"Not a Real School â€“ its a great school for learning teachers are great, but no real campus"

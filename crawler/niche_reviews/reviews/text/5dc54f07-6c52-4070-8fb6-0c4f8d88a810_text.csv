I decided that Accounting was no longer for me. I have struggled all semester with math and I decided to change my GPA won't be destroyed because of my struggles. Sheryl Sandberg said, “ We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.” When I began my journey here at FVSU, I wasn't very sure of what I would be doing or getting myself into but after getting advice and insight on the different majors I decided to hop into something that is more hands on and interesting."

The dorms are much more nicer and cleaner than I expected. My roommates are awesome very honest and straight forward. I do look forward to going here for the next three years and having an awesome time with life long friends. I would recommend this school to anyone who is about the books but also like to have a little bit of fun and let loose a little bit. A person who is very friendly. You can not be shy at this school. I'm happy I went here my personality shows and people do not judge you for it. This school helped me discover who I really am and just be happy with yourself.

I would like to see more faculty/staff interaction on campus, with very few figures being known to all students on camp, as well as making sure students are objectively taking the right courses so they may graduate on time with no outside forces. Financial aid can be also fixed as for every year I've attended I have seen our staff change in faces."

Senior,4,The school is really good if you are looking for a small school. You wouldn't necessarily have to worry about big classes. The teachers will get to know you and are willing to help especially in the Biology department. The on campus advisors will assist you as best as they can to enroll you into the classes you need for your major.
Senior,4,"Fort Valley State University is a HBCU in Fort Valley, GA. In my 4 years here i have so many mixed emotions. The school is nice. The professors are very nice! I feel like since this is a small campus, there is more one on one time with professors and students. The professors really do care, and are understanding of situations. They know how hard it is to make it through college and they have no problem working with you. Obviously there are some things that can be worked on such as finacial aid but other than that i think it is a really nice campus"

Sophomore,4,"I have attended Fort Valley State University for over a year now and I can honestly say that it has been a roller coaster of emotions, but overall this college has taught me things that I will take with me for the rest of my life. The student body and staff are very friendly and if you attend FVSU, it will feel like home to you. As far as academics go, my advice is to be very focused, and really take your education into your own hands so you can get the full experience in regards to education. You will come across all people, of all shades, sizes, and backgrounds here and I truly do think that most people will find comfort in the school itself. If you are thinking about attending this school as a student go in focused like never before and make sure you complete any important applications ahead of time if possible. This will ensure a smooth ride through your registration process, and other processes to come."
Freshman,4,Only problem would be location in reference to everything else. if you're looking for a get away this would definitely be it.
Freshman,4,"Fort Valley is a small school, it's quit expected from Thursday through Saturday those are the party days. The food is not the best, but you will not die of hunger either. The city of Fort Valley  is small and not a lot of things go on,but the cities around Fort Valley have a lot fun things to do and places to eat.
The academics comes down to you, if you refrigerate early then you have better chance of getting a great professor that everyone recommends. Overall most of the Professors are understanding people that want to best for you, they are okay with you buying or renting the textbook cheap or two to three editions behind. As long as your Professors see you trying they will work with you until you get the course material. 
The dorms are suite style with either 4 individual rooms were every 2 rooms gets a bathroom with a kitchenette or 2 individual rooms with a personal bathroom. Also there are apartment style with a full kitchen."

Freshman,4,Fort Valley State is a great college to attend. I have been here only a semester and I can see how dedicated the University is to helping their students learn and succeed. There is no place I rather start off my college journey than here. The whole community is friendly and the atmosphere here is great. There are some minor flaws to going here but it does not compare to all the pros!
Junior,4,"From the day I first stepped foot on campus until now, I have felt nothing but love from my school community, we are truly a family. Yes, as a school, we have some improvements to make as far as safety, and academics, but overall I love my community, I love my school, and i love my experience here. It is said that the majority of life lessons are learned while in college, I am a firm believer of that. I have learned many tough lessons since my freshman year of college. In retrospect, I am grateful for every experience, difficult situation,and every lesson that i have acquired over the last three years. Without them, I wouldn't be man I am today. "
College Sophomore,4,The value of a degree from this school is important. A lot of alumni that I didn't know went here come back and give students the opportunity to become successful with an internship and even a career.
College Sophomore,4,My experience with courses and professors has gotten a lot better. I now know how to speak out and ask questions in class. Class sizes are usually crowded the first week and then even out to a smaller class.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life on campus is usually shown throughout special events that are held on campus. When it comes to parties, more people go to the Greek hosted parties than just regular club parties. I think non-Greek's view Greek as normal students because they never really know who is Greek until an event happens. When it comes to Greek housing, some Greeks stay on campus and then some have their own houses off campus."
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at school so far is that it is very challenging but worth it. I would choose my school again because it feels like home and the professors are very understanding and they care about every students needs.

Recent Alumnus,4,"Fort Valley State University has a great experience overall being a huge university in a little town. The professors work closely with the students and there's an awesome agriculture program. My favorite part of FVSU life is HOMECOMING! It's absolutely amazing! The food strip, school pride, intense football game and even wildcat a lashes for students to fully enjoy events throughout the week. There are even tutoring services as well as online help for assisting with classes that may seem difficult. I enjoy being a wildcat and look forward to graduating this Dec."
College Student,4,Fort Valley is one of the best secured colleges and I have the pleasure to be attending there soon!
College Student,4,"Being new to the whole college life, the only way I was able to compare Fort Valley's Housing was to my elder sister's dormitory when she attended Alabama A&M. The housing here is by far than what I expected!"
College Student,4,The Greek life on campus is always active and have been very friendly to other students even though they are not wanting to be apart of Greek life.
College Freshman,4,The Campus Housing is fine and there is a curfew but other than that everything is great.
College Freshman,4,"The Greek Life is awesome to me. They're very friendly and they don't make you feel like you dont belong. As i said once before, Fort Valley is a huge family. Just respect the Greeks and they'll respect you. You have to have great grades, behavior, and attitude to become a greek. The Greeks are the only ones that stay inside of the Greek house."
College Freshman,4,My school is accepting and everyone is one huge family. This is my first week here and I'm already loving my surroundings.
College Junior,4,"School offers internships in my major, recruiting"
College Junior,4,"Always room for improvement, but I feel very safe."
College Junior,4,"Football team performs well, I attend games."
Freshman,2,"The professors at FVSU are superb, you can tell that they genuinely care about their students and go above and beyond to provide the best experience they can. My only complaint is the way the University handles their staff, they lack communication and are often making it more difficult I=on the students to handle their affairs and classes. For example, several students were enrolled in a few English classes and the department fired several teachers, I assume because of budget cuts, and then neglected to inform the students that their classes were canceled. All the while, the class remained on the schedule and nothing appeared out of the ordinary, until the beginning of the semester when a bunch of students could not find their class and it was too late to try and be placed in another class."
College Freshman,2,"It's cheaper so I've heard, but also bad as far as safety goes if you stay off-campus in Fort Valley. I'd stay in Warner Robins if I stayed off-campus."
College Freshman,2,it seems pretty easy to live off campus. the school doesn't help but it is easy to look around on your own
College Freshman,2,they mess peoples accounts up all the time. some peoples aids don't kick in til late
College Sophomore,2,A lot of people especially the campus police want to be very strict about drinking even to the people that's legal
College Sophomore,2,"My program is okay. The challenges are there are not a lot of professors in my field. So, not a lot of the courses I need to take are available for me. I have to wait, or take it online."
College Sophomore,2,"I made a little mistake on my fafsa, that could of taken a week to fix, but instead took a month. No one would help me it was very stressful calling and emailing and no one would give me a answer. My tip would be hire more advisors and please answer emails and calls."
College Sophomore,2,The environment is pretty clean.  The school is located on the outside of the city.  Its an diverse school
College Sophomore,2,Football team sucks. But I believe they are better this year. Basketball team will always be great.
Recent Alumnus,2,we have fell off when in it comes to school spirit but student government and greek life trys to pump it up.
Recent Alumnus,2,"the reason so much has been enforced is because the class before us ruined it for everyone else. visitation use to be 24 hours now underclassman has a set time and upperclassman has a set time, these type of rules is what drives students to move off campus. we pay all this money to move from home and enjoy college life and things are being regulated without any sane rules ...some of them do make since to help with safety precautions but other than that there are ways to enforce these rules and still make things comfortable."
Recent Alumnus,2,too many people come with the mindset that they can come as they are. rather than dressing to prepare them for the work place. so to help influence this we have dress for success Wednesdays for those who lack the understanding.
College Junior,2,"The folks weren't properly trained to assist my needs.  A twenty or thirty minute visit to get the ball rolling,  it turned into a nightmare.   After completing all forms required, it took three months to get the money to pay for my studies."
Recent Alumnus,2,to many rivals and non are near
Recent Alumnus,2,your car will get booted for visiting the school and trying to get you paperwork done to attend
Recent Alumnus,2,classes you need to graduate are always being cancelled or moved around and it seems they change the course degree requirements and do not tell you until last min and this leads to you not graduating on time.
Recent Alumnus,2,campus is not located in a student friendly area.
Recent Alumnus,2,we have limited amount of teachers yet they set aside more parking spaces for them and commuters have to walk across campus
Recent Alumnus,2,they counslers do not have the best attitudes but as long as you go in knowing what you could do for yourself you'll be better off.
Recent Alumnus,2,they have closed down the decent food vendors and opened up something more expensive and tasteless.
Recent Alumnus,2,the security isn't securing the campus they are too busy worried about where the students are parking.
Recent Alumnus,2,I do not live on campus
Recent Alumnus,2,I do not care to much for my school im just trying to get my degree in communications to further myself.
College Junior,2,"Not much to do in activities, or area attraction.  Cultural events do happen in Macon, GA, but if you don't have transportation, you are at a loss."
College Junior,2,Fill out the FAFSA before you sign up for classes.  The financial aid process goes a little smoother.
College Student,2,They didn't tell me they had off campus houses so I went with what they showed me.
College Student,2,I ot a bill for some loan that was charinging me interest while classes were still in secession. No one told me I even applied to it until... I was so mad.
College Freshman,2,The dining options are slim. There are a few dinning places that may be convenient but there are not enough options. Also the restaurants do not offer student discounts.
College Freshman,2,"The Campus is very unorganized, boring, and unappealing. The price does not match up with the quality of the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"We'll considering that FVSU is an Historically Black College, the university is about 90% African American."
Recent Alumnus,2,Need to continue to revoate buildings 
Recent Alumnus,2,Needs more for students to do
College Sophomore,2,"At Fort Valley State i was a Business Major. Being a freshman/upcoming sophmore there arent to many major classes that youd take at the moment. My main concern is that my attended major was fashion merchandising which they do not have, let alone any art majors. With subjects such as math and science which are the most important i think the university couldve done alot better with hiring reliable teachers or a better variation."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you go to Warner Robbins or Macon then the grade would be an A or B, but within the city of Fort Valley, there are not many options, and even fewer late night options."
Recent Alumnus,2,"FVSU is a traditional HBCU. While there is diversity, the majority of the students (particularly the ones that reside on the campus) are black people. Most of the students who commute are non-traditional students or of a different ethnic background. I feel that the campus is welcoming, but would benefit more if we had more diversity as far as Asians, Latinos, Indian, white/other races represented on our campus."
College Sophomore,2,FVSU strictness they are okay they do what they need to do on campus. The campus police could do their jobs better but you do see them a lot around campus.
College Freshman,2,They have a lot of great majors but personally for me they don't offer enough opportunites just the menial things.
College Freshman,2,There are a few nice people on campus. The girls dominate our capus
College Sophomore,2,"When you come to fort valley you'll see some of everybody from many diffrent places! Not only in Georgia but I have seen students from up Nortth like such as: New York, California, Virgina, and Rhode Island. I have also seen some international students that are from Africa and Ghana which is very intersting!. The girls are pretty and high class but some are middle class but the the most important thing they are friendly. The mens are such gentlemans who open the door for us young ladies that is something I really admire!"
College Sophomore,2,The weather changes constantly and you never know when it will be cold warm or hot.
College Sophomore,2,the guys and girls get along pretty well with each other.
College Sophomore,2,Attempt to be the first one to get your financial aid settled. The process is long usually so patience is a virtue.
College Sophomore,2,"Fort Valley State university is a HBCU. 	HBCU means
Historically black colleges and universities. The campus is filled with African american, however, there are a few, Latin's and Asians. Some students travel from far places like Africa or Antarctica. The campus is very excepting and not hard to compute with class mates. The campus is filled with many different personalities and open with different activities for new incomes can meet and greet new faces. Some activities may be speed dating or movie night, etc. The economic background on campus are very southern and country. To some   Fort valley may seem culture shocking but with a couple of months people can adapt to."
College Sophomore,2,"Fort valley state  university off-campus dining is very expensive and a hassle.
Majority of the restaurants close at 8 or 9.  Dining food place never stay open long enough for students. There food  isn't quite healthy or fresh cooked."
College Sophomore,2,"In fort valley , the weather is very bipolar. In some days it may be sunny , sprinkle with a little rain  and  after wards storm extremely hard. The storms are not friendly and students could get hurt or shock by thunder. The winds are extremely strong and umbrellas never seem to last for long. When its hot humanity could be a headache because a fresh new hair due could mess up within seconds. On that note, Fort valley weather has a mind of its on."
College Senior,2,Not That Great – Financial aid advisers can be rude at times. They don't keep students updated on new policies regarding financial aid. Try to apply as soon as possible to prevent being late with payments for tuition.
College Sophomore,2,"Smoking, Drinking and Students – At Fort Valley State University, almost everyone drinks and smokes. Most of the students smoke on campus and get upperclassmen to buy alcohol for them. It all depends on who you surround yourself with."
College Sophomore,2,"Could Be Better – I came in the spring semester and had no guidance on what classes to choose or anything of that nature. I had to learn on my own. Although, everyone's experience differs"
College Sophomore,2,"The UV's – Our off campus living is called the University Villas. Its dirty and messy, the students dont keep their room clean, and the bed matresses are basicly on the floor. And there are no RA's so if there was a problem, than there is just a problem that no one can fix."
College Sophomore,2,"Off Campus Dinning – Everything closes to early. There is no reason why this certain McDonalds should close at 10:30, where everywhere else is 24hours. People do get hungry after hours and need food to concentrate on their studies."
College Freshman,2,There are reasonable amount of majors but not many.
College Senior,2,Make sure everything is done on time and make sure financial Aid is doing there part and not missing any paper work. If you don't you probably wont be in school that semester.
College Senior,2,Drugs Vs Alcohol – I think both substances are used as often as the other depending on the individual.
College Freshman,2,i love being the school. i love every random moment that i have had in college.
College Freshman,2,"Party, Party, Loitering, and More Party. I have yet to go to a party but, nightlife here in the Valley is always out. Yelling, screaming, hanging outside the commons, going out to clubs. Its a handful."
College Sophomore,2,The Veterinary Science department and Agriculture department have a great reputation... Besides that...
College Freshman,2,"Dorm Life – Freshman dorms are nice. They stay clean and are comfortable, but the rules are rediculus. They tell us that we're adults, but then we're treated like children."
College Freshman,2,"A Little Over the Top.. I love my school like any student would, but at times our school can be quite strict. It wasn't as bad as first, but over the years it is getting alot worse. 
In the dorms we have a strict curfew, even the upperclassman. During the holidays when it is time to move out, we must move our stuff out after each break (besides spring). During campus events, we must go through security, and we aren't allowed to bring in small snacks (Such as a box of nerds). 
There are times where they may tell us to cut the music down because it's too loud, or escort a student out because he/she is having fun. 

Then, when you go onto campus you must go through security. This is ok for when alien people come onto campus, but when regular students come one to campus and get stopped because of small things, then that's when it becomes a problem. Besides the above they have other situations where it bothers alot of the other students to enjoy college life, such as parking and the cafe."
College Freshman,2,"Like any school, the financial aid process is the longest process. It can be quite nerve-reckoning if you do not stay on top of your business. The earlier you complete your file, the quicker your process."
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing are limited and very expensive and to be honest they are not that good at all
Freshman,1,"I am a currently a freshman at Fort Valley State University. The Financial aid office & Housing office is absolutely TERRIBLE. They don’t try their best to help you with nothing. They only tell you what they can’t do or what you can’t do. This is my first semester here and I had a bad experience the first day I came. If i we’re you I WOULD NOT attend Fort Valley State University. I am so applaud at the service i have gotten here so far. I am currently in $7000 worth of debt for unneccesary things. I have no place to stay due to the verification process which has NOTHING to do with the FAFSA, instead of telling me what i did wrong on the FAFSA they sent me through a verification process i can not get out of which is causing me to be in debt. I’m stuck with no place to stay, no meal to eat everyday & $7000 worth of debt to paid for which i CAN NOT afford. 

Sincerly, Jazmin Ardis"
Recent Alumnus,1,"3 restaurants and non are walking distance for most, you have to go into another town to get options that most eat daily."
Recent Alumnus,1,worst school iv been to yet.
College Junior,1,The visitation hours are poor.
College Junior,1,"Everything is horrible, but im there for school."
College Junior,1,The dining hall should be open for longer hours. It closes at 8:00. everyone is hungry again before 10:00.
College Student,1,"There are some parts of campus I avoid, for lack of a oxygen."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking at Fort Valley State University is horrible.There are not enough parking spaces to accommodate student parking especially commuter parking. If you would like to park in commuter parking, you will have to arrive on campus by 8 a.m. that morning."
College Sophomore,1,There isnt much to do in fort valley at all. the city is 10 minutes long. its basically a college town. The closest city near by is Macon which is about 30 minutes away which has malls shopping centers etc.
College Sophomore,1,"You see different races around campus here and there. I attend a HBCU college so there arent many that may appy to my school. But the different races that do attend my school are comfortable with their environment, they also interact with the different programs we have on campus."
College Freshman,1,The school is in the country. Transportation is scarce and everything is distant.
College Sophomore,1,"Fort Valley's financial aid team is very slow when it comes down to that they take a long time to receive, review, and process your information and you find yourself making a lot of trips to their office."
College Freshman,1,Its sometimes never on time and the drivers a rude
College Sophomore,1,"At Fort Valley State University you have many students who care about how they present themselves. However, there are many students who do not care about how they look or dress. Many of the boys walk around with their pants sagging, while many girls have short clothing or tights. But for the most part, you can barely go anywhere without smelling smoke from cigarettes or marijuana and hearing profanity. Both the boys as well as the girls participate in this activity. This is my analysis of the boys and girls of at the school. Totally opinionated. There are many descent people here though."
College Freshman,1,I personally think that students should be better housed off campus. Especially in the local apartments around fvsu.
College Freshman,1,You have to drive 30 minutes to actually get to restaurants although there are local fast food restaurants
College Freshman,1,It's awesome only if you like walking and I'm not that kind of person. I have had three parking fines and a boot on my car because of parking. There is nowhere near enough parking for every student that owns a car and drive.
College Junior,1,"There is not much to do in Fort Valley where the school is located, so if a student want to go for entertainments or sports, they will have to drive to a nearby town."
College Junior,1,"Too many students too little parking spaces, Have to pay $50.00 yearly for parking permit is kind of too much. Students have enough going on for us, bill, gas, books, tuition, living necessity, unexpected expenses and many other financial needs. The school should provide a one time free parking permit that the student should keep all though their school time. Only if a student lost their specific parking permit, then they should be charge for replacements, otherwise, the first one should be issued free."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no form of public transportation in Fort Valley. There is a shuttle that is provided through the school and it goes out to Walmart once a week, and also make drop offs to the local grocery store and the ""downtown"" area. If you don't have a car already make friends with someone who does!"
College Sophomore,1,The Absolute Worst – Faculty and staff get the majority of available spots. Little to no spots by the commons. Officers are quick to put a ticket or boot on your car
College Sophomore,1,"Computer Review
     Just about every computer at Fort Valley State is outdated. Some are in bad condition, while others are just slow when in use. When one computer crashes it seems like the whole lab shuts down. The wireless connection is constantly going out at random and some of the most important times. I can remember during finals week during the spring semester the wi-fi went down in the middle of an online exam. The professor had to re-post the exams and keep them open until the next morning just so all of her students could finish. In the end I give the computers a D because they are not reliable and are outdated."
College Freshman,1,The school gives all the parking spots to the teachers and when you do find a parking spot they will put a boot on your car and make you pay to get it off. That is why most people walk or get dropped off at school.
College Junior,1,"Pain in the Bumper – The parking on campus is ridiculous. If you don't have morning classes its definitely hectic for people that have afternoon classes to park,  because people that have morning classes normally stay on campus all day. The quote ""The early birds get the worms,""well the morning class students get the parking spots."
College Sophomore,1,"My first year dealing with financial aid was horrible; so please come prepared for the wors. Never come with your head held to high when it comes to Financial Aid at FVSU. They always let you down; one way or another. 
First- make sure all your paper work is correct and put together properly. 
Second- Hand your paper work to someone that howa what they are doing; not to the student working. 
Third- Please make sure your parents do their taxes early; no questions asked (no excuses)."
College Freshman,1,"Why are we paying a technology fee again?! Technology at Fort Valley is Horrible, half of the computers do not work in the labs. The wifi and regular internet is slower than anything I've ever experienced. I had more technology at my high school than here and this is COLLEGE!"
College Freshman,1,"FORGET A CAR – Parking at Fort Valley is Horrendous! You pay $50 for a parking permit, yet when there are things going on... people who either DON'T have a permit or have a commuter's permit love to take up your spaces. Leaving you to have to park four to five buildings away from your dorm or even having to park where visitors park.  "
College Sophomore,1,The universities transportation isn't very helpful. The Shuttle Bus takes to long to come back and retrive students. They choose where and who they want to pick up. Students have even been left off campus and a friend had to go and get them because the shuttle bus wouldn't return for them.
College Sophomore,1,The Life of the Greeks – Greek life on The Fort Valley's campus is very little. They have just started to come back on the yard in the previous semester.
College Freshman,1,"Weather is unpredictable. One moment it's Hot, next moment it's raining and the next day its freezing cold."
College Freshman,1,Below Average – Facilities are Old and outdated we still use Chalk Boards. Hardly any technology is used in the classroom besides Slide shows and they still use the mobile projector screens.
College Freshman,1,Only nightlife in Fort Valley is two clubs and that's The Swamp and Spruce Street Gym. Parties are only on Thursdays and sometimes Saturdays.
College Freshman,1,"Being a HBCU, there is no existence of Diversity. There are a few White Students, One or three asian, and Couple of African Students."
College Freshman,1,We have a shuttle bus but it only runs at certain hours from 8am-8pm on weekdays.
College Freshman,1,Dry Campus! Fort Valley is a very DRY campus so of course there is a lot of off campus drinking and a lot of on campus smoking from tobacco to actual marijuana
College Freshman,1,"Not that anything is wrong with it, but most females on campus are Gay. And there are more girls than guys so there really aren't many attractive people at Fort Valley."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office rarely answers the phone during crucial periods, and it often takes extremely long for things to process. I suggest not waiting until the last minute to complete paperwork. Get everything submitted and satisfied ASAP and keep in contact with them until everything is posted."
College Junior,1,I think that Fort Valley State is a school that is bad but has alot to offer because it is a great historical black college. The administrators are faculty make it unfair mostly but great pride comes from the fact of it being an HBCU
College Student,1,We get fined $500 for violating visitation rules in the commons.
College Freshman,1,The computers on campus are outdated. lack of Technology period

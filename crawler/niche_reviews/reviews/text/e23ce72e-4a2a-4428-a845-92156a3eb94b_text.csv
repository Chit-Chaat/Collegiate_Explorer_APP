Sophomore,5,"As an upcoming sophomore, I loved my first year at Marywood University. it was such a welcoming atmosphere and when someone says this school is like a family, it really is."
Sophomore,5,Even though it was very hard to adjust to it was very well organized for it is very fast and on the spot.
Niche User,5,"I visited Marywood in the fall, and it is a beautiful college! The professors seem very kind and helpful. There are many majors to choose from and clubs to join."
Junior,5,"I honestly love Marywood University! Personally, besides a select few professors, all the teachers have been incredibly impacting, helpful, and empathetic to their students. The student activities and campus connections are the best part of going here. Even as a commuter, you can get 100% involved. 
Marywood also accepts most outside credits so that can be helpful to the student in between schools or transferring in other credits."
Freshman,5,"I love the size of the campus. It's very quaint and home-like. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it here, but I was wrong. It's a nice fresh of fresh air. It's different from the surroundings I'm used to, but I think that's another reason why I love it. I like exposing myself to new things, and the nice calm scenery of Scranton was just what I needed."
Sophomore,5,"Marywood has so far been an incredible experience for me! I am in the speech pathology program and I’m surrounded by a caring teacher and student body that encourages me to use my gifts and excel in school. The faith life is awesome-there are a bunch of clubs and retreats available, as well as on and off campus bible studies. But religion isn’t pushed on anyone either, and I think a bunch of political opinions are present and encouraged. The best thing about Marywood is the people-those who stay on campus on the weekends or participate in clubs have a lot of school spirit and often people get really involved! It’s in a really safe area, and campus safety is awesome! The male to female ratio and parking situation are my only problems with it, the ratio cant really be fixed, but the parking probably should..."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman, I feel that the school orientation program has prepared me greatly to enter my freshman year."
Sophomore,5,"Marywood is a fantastic school because of its size. Being on a much. much smaller scale compared to your large state schools, it provides an inclusive environment that benefits all of the students and the staff as well."
Sophomore,5,"Marywood University is a place that kids can learn and grow into people that can help the world and themselves. The knowledge that the school and teachers share is something you can't experience in a large school. The only thing that Marywood could change is the availability after hours, but it isn't something that causes stress to me."
Alum,5,"Marywood was a wonderful experience.  The faculty and staff were always helpful.  The campus was safe.  I enjoyed participating in the theater productions and the radio station, even though I was not a communications or performing arts major. 

At Marywood, I built life-long relationships."
Sophomore,5,"Marywood is a great opportunity for education, with a variety of different majors. As a transfer student, in a switch of major, Marywood was one of the few schools that allowed me to transfer and switch my major. The campus is not too small nor big, but just a perfect size. The population is close to about 2,000, which to me, is perfect."
Freshman,5,"Marywood University is great! The campus is clean, and very safe.  Classroom size is very small and that's great for me, that's one of the reasons why I chose Marywood.  The campus is close to downtown Scranton, and there is always something fun to do there."
Graduate Student,5,"Welcoming community with experienced and engaged faculty that provide a balanced education and great experience for any college students. 

Academics and athletics are a part of University life and whether you are on or off campus there is always plenty to do. The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area and northeast Pennsylvania is a great area with many attractions. Also, close proximity to day trips to New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. metro areas."
Freshman,5,Marywood is a great college! Has a wonderful architecture program! Would love to win a scholarship to help pay for tutition. Food is wonderful! Has a great gym. Also has great activities for students. Campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"I am not from Pennsylvania at all. I live in New Jersey and coming to Marywood was the right choice. I was worried that it would not feel like home. As soon as I got here it was welcoming. Everyone says ""in college professors don't care about their students."" At Marywood that is false. There is honestly no other school I would go to."
Niche User,5,"Students at Marywood have the best of both worlds, the suburban town of Dunmore and the city of Scranton. The town of Dunmore offers everyday conveniences such as grocery stores and pharmacies while Scranton offers a nightlife, shopping, and entertainment. Both can be reached by the Smartbus provided at no cost for Marywood students. I really enjoy the location because I feel at home and safe in a residential neighborhood but can also access the many opportunities the city of Scranton provides. Marywood is safe, friendly, and has plenty to do!"
Freshman,5,"From the first time walking onto campus and entering the admissions building, I felt welcomed and not a distant outsider. The people in admissions, financial aid ,  and registrar spoke to me but mostly listened to all my concerns.  Each got back to me in a timely fashion with answers to questions I had. They make you feel you belong whether you choose to be there or not."
Freshman,5,Marywood has so many resources that it is almost impossible for you to fail. As long as you apply yourself you will do well. Professors genuinely want to see you succeed. The campus is beautiful. Cute little Panera bread like shops for on the go. Easy commute through campus.
Graduate Student,5,"Marywood University has been an amazing experience. The teacher are extremely friendly and willinging to help. The options on campus are phenomenal from food, to study space, technology, and the gym. It is a great school."
Freshman,5,I love Marywood because of how personal my experience was. All faculty and students were welcoming. And the campus is beautiful!
Niche User,5,Amazing college with a brand new track team with a great amount of potential. The campus is beautiful and the library is of impressive scale.
Sophomore,5,My first semester has eased me back into the school routine and it has been a great transition. The teacher are super helpful and the students are very friendly!
Graduate Student,5,"Marywood is such a close-knit community located in Scranton, PA. There are fun things to do outside of campus and always events going on for students on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy this community I am a part of. They make every day challenging and make me question life and why things are the way they are. I like going on campus and knowing that I will see people I know everywhere. It is a little community inside a bigger city. It feels like home and I will miss it once I graduate. The campus Life I have to say is awesome they give out awesome gifts, like expensive ones, a couple of events I went to they handed out iPads and gift cards and we LOVE bingo and it is all free!!!"
Sophomore,5,"Marywood has a very small supportive nature due to its size. Almost everyone, teachers and students know each other and are determined to help everyone succeed."
Junior,5,"Marywood is a very small-knit community that allows each and every single student the chance to succeed. It's very easy to gain a meaningful relationship with your professors, who all want you to succeed. Small class sizes and a newly rebuilt library are the most appealing aspects. The health care programs are rated in the top 5 and push students to be the best future medical care professionals."
Junior,5,This school has become a home away from home! The college is filled with loving individuals who make this place a great place to be!
Freshman,5,"Marywood University is a very well-rounded university. Being a university, Marywood is different from other colleges that I have visited in the past. The students and administration are very welcoming, friendly, and care about everyone. The academic programs are taught by great teachers, and the students are there to learn."
College Junior,5,"It was a the perfect school for me, it is very small so I knew that I would feel comfortable waking up every day. My major is very stressful but exciting at the same time. I would recommend going to this school if you were dedicated to architecture or interior architecture. The professors are very willing to help you with any questions you would have."
Recent Alumnus,5,Perfect size school for me.  Students have fun but are committed to their academics
College Freshman,5,Professors at Marywood are the Best! Very accommodating and friendly! truly care for your success both in their class and in others
College Freshman,5,I believe my degree will have immense worth after graduation
College Freshman,5,NO WAY TO NOT FEEL SAFE AT MARYWOOD! Safety is #1
College Freshman,5,BY FAR THE BEST OUT OF ANY SCHOOL I VISITED!
College Freshman,5,Only two sororities but they are completely charity based! they have some of the nicest girls
College Freshman,5,Class sizes are small enough for professors to know everyone.
College Freshman,5,I love my school because of its sense of community.
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at Marywood University has been nothing but amazing! There are a variety of courses to take, all of which have brilliant professors. Class sizes are smaller, which I enjoy. The small class size ensures more personal time with the professors and your classmates."
College Sophomore,5,"My degree will hold great value. I am confident that I will be able to get an internship, when the time comes, without a problem."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life at Marywood University is very low-key, but impacts so many in need. Instead of focusing on drinking, partying, and the social aspect of being s sorority, they are focused on raising awareness for several groups. Greek students are not viewed any differently than non-Greeks. There is not a specific house dedicated for Greeks, which I think is great. This gives students a means of expanding their social groups, as well as informing other students of different volunteering and fundraising activities."
College Sophomore,5,"Marywood University is an outstanding school. The nursing program is challenging and can be overwhelming at times, but I am confident that I will be well-rounded and ready to start my career after graduation. The professors are caring and always willing to go above and beyond for their students. The  love the professors have for their students and the nursing field is immeasurable. Marywood University's new state-of-the-art library has all the resources a student will need throughout their college career. Marywood is more than just a school; It is a means for expanding my knowledge, making life-long friendships, a place to break out of your shell without being judged, and most importantly, what I would like to call ""my 2nd home""."
College Freshman,5,"The liberal arts core needs to be toned down, especially for education majors. That is a lot to take on top of a music degree."
College Freshman,5,"Campus police generally take their time. However, the campus is well lit and feels safe. The crime logs from the Marywood Campus Safety office state that the most henous crime last year was someone spray painting the tractor. It's a very safe campus and I feel safe there."
College Freshman,5,Marywood is everything I hoped it would be. The perfect school for a music major who likes a small campus. Class sizes are generally between 5 and 25. The professors know what they're talking about.
College Freshman,5,"My friends love the dorms. However, I am a commuter student. I have been and stayed in the dorms and would love to be a resident, but I cannot afford it."
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about Marywood. The faculty are very professional within their fields. I could never regret going to Marywood. It is the perfect size for me, and the upperclassmen are extremely kind and helpful. You can have fun no matter what course you take at Marywood."
College Sophomore,5,"Johnson College is a great learning experience for students who want an associates degree. I like Johnson College because the transition was easy, and the professors get to know you one on one. The people there are friendly and they relate well with the professors and other students on/off campus"
College Junior,5,There is a variety of people on campus which just makes it more interesting and great to go to!
College Junior,5,"The academics at Marywood are great! They offer a number of courses to really make each semester more interesting and entertaining! I wish I had time to take all of them! Registration process is always a fun time, racing other students at midnight to try and get into all of the classes you need, however even if you don't get in there are always other options to chose from!"
College Junior,5,"I believe that it is important to create a bond with your professors and at Marywood it is possible to do so! They are very accommodating and always willing to help out when they can, and I am extremely grateful for that!"
College Junior,5,"Like myself, there are many Pre-Physician Assistant students, who are all very degree-oriented and always looking at the bigger picture. This helps me stay focused and keep studying and joining study groups to gain as much knowledge as possible."
College Junior,5,"At first I was unsure if I made the right choice when picking Marywood, although it was in my top choices. However I fell in love with it. I love the small campus and that all the professors know me by name and even about me. The library learning center is excellent and I really feel productive when I'm there. Looking back at all I have done in my quick three years at Marywood, I am extremely satisfied!"
College Student,5,Marywood is amazing. Highly advanced and very beautiful.
College Junior,5,I love being in the program. This is the job I want to peruse for the rest of my life and being in classes with others who enjoy it is fantastic. The curriculum is very hands on and we have the opportunity to go out into schools starting freshman year!
College Junior,5,I plan to have an internship as it is part of my curriculum. Internships are matched to students based on their aspirations in the field.
College Freshman,5,With safety Marywood is great
College Freshman,5,There are so many option!
College Freshman,5,There are a couple clubs that are poppin and there is ALWAYS a party going on somewhere. Just walk up and down taylor ave . You will find one
College Sophomore,5,I'm very happy with my program. I don't have any concerns about finding a job.
College Sophomore,5,"Its very strict, but we understand that it is for our safety and well being."
Graduate Student,4,Marywood is committed to their students and learning. They have altered their learning to accommodate for social distancing and are still trying to challenge students.
Graduate Student,4,My online class was challenging. I am a visual learner and it was hard but I was able to get through it and retain the information being taught. Professors were concerned about students and how they learned so they tried their best to accommodate students.
Junior,4,"Great small university, great opportunities on campus To get involved, and individualized attention."
Junior,4,"Well executed attempt to switch to online, I am personally not a great type of student for distance learning."
Junior,4,"I like the warm feeling of being welcomed and accepted at Marywood. I transferred from a college where I always felt under pressure and judged. At Marywood, it was a breath of fresh air. I felt calmer and more confident stepping onto campus everyday. The professors are very welcoming and the small class size makes it easier to learn and fully understand. If you need help on anything, there’s probably a kind and helpful professor there to help you. The students are very nice and always make you feel welcome. Overall, I’m very happy with my transition to life at Marywood University. If you’re looking into an education degree, what I am perusing, I would definitely recommend Marywood!"
Junior,4,"When schools across the nation transitioned to online learning for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester, things certainly changed at Marywood. Many of my classes only utilized Moodle, the platform we use throughout a normal semester. Only one of my classes utilized Zoom for online classes, and that was only for weekly check ups. Many professors simply uploaded work and discussion forums at the beginning of the week for us to get done throughout the week and have submitted by Sunday night. Being that the transition was unexpected, I understand the confusion with the online learning. I do, however, think that Marywood could have done a better job at remote learning and hope for improvements if we have to continue with it for the upcoming semester. 

As for online classes when there isn’t a pandemic going on, Marywood does a nice job! I have taken many online summer classes during my time at Marywood and do not have any complaints! I really enjoy these online courses."
Freshman,4,"Quaint campus in Scranton. The small campus makes it easy to make friends. Marywood does not have the best food, but there are great options around campus."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the smaller classroom settings. I believe this gives the students an opportunity for more one on one time with their professors.  Campus is not very large which makes it easy to get to “back to back “ scheduled classes on time. Learning Commons is a beautiful building and there is plenty of room for studying needs.
Freshman,4,I like the environment they have on campus for students. They have a lot of resources on campus to help students with whatever problems they may be having. The camp is relatively small so the c campus life is no too extravagant.
Niche User,4,"I loved how welcoming everyone on campus was and how everyone is always there to help you, including the staff. The campus is very easy to get around and haven't had any issues with anything, I hope to continue my education here."
Junior,4,"I enjoy how small the campus is. The faculty and teachers are very helpful and friendly towards their students. Most of the food is alright, but with room to improve."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Marywood University has been generally good so far.  I have enjoyed all of my classes that I have had so far in my freshmen year .  I love the smaller size of the university because I have a maximum of 30 kids in my largest classes, so I can feel that I am in a classroom and not in a large hall where the professor might not even know who I am. I also am happy that the size of the school is small because I do not have to walk a half an hour to a class, rather 10 minutes at max.  The area that Marywood is in, I feel very safe to be. The scranton area has a lot to offer to anyone that likes the outdoors, or even just hanging out at the local restaurants. Overall I am enjoying my experience at Marywood so far. The only improvement that I could ask for is possibly updating some of the insides of the older buildings. Some of them feel outdated, but they are in good condition."
Senior,4,"Choosing to go to Marywood has been one of the best decisions of my life. There is a real sense of community at Marywood and plenty of clubs and extracurriculars to get involved in. Marywood also has a fantastic faculty. While most schools offer very dedicated professors within the classes of your intended major, Marywood goes one step further and provides faculty that truly care about you and your education in both the classes for your major and the core classes. I have never once felt like any of my teachers did not care about me or how I was doing in their class. Marywood also has a fabulous Music, Theater, and Dance Department with a staff that is of extremely high caliber, especially for a university of Marywood size. I would highly recommend Marywood to anyone and everyone."
Freshman,4,So many activities for the students to participate in. Campus is very quiet and cute. Students and teachers are extremely nice and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"The staff at Marywood University are very helpful, giving positive feedback to their students. The buildings are very clean and well kept. The campus lawns are also very well kept."
Sophomore,4,"The school is great. The classes and teachers are useful and prepare you for the future. Although some of the gen-eds seem useless, the classes in your major are great and fun to learn. Some of the dorms are nice, but the food is bad."
Junior,4,"Currently attending Marywood for a B.S in Nutrition and Dietetics. It is a wonderful, accredited program.  The teachers care, they know you by name, some go the extra mile to help you. However, the financial aid, registrar's, cashier's office, etc. will send you in circles if you have a problem that needs to be fixed. They are not that helpful and I think it is the biggest downfall of the University."
Sophomore,4,"Marywood offers a lot to its students. It is a liberal arts school so every students needs to take other classes outside of their major. This is both a plus and minus depending on your situation. I am a commuter student and have a full time job. I wish Marywood would be more accommodating to older commuter students. For example, in the nursing program, it is fine if a student misses clinical for a school sport but other reasons for missing clinical, including childcare or weather, is inexcusable and that student would have to pay a fine. That doesn't seem fair. Marywood has many excellent professors but some are downright mean and intolerable."
College Junior,4,There is a wide range of machines to use and the facilities are wonderful.
College Junior,4,Most professors are very helpful and passionate about the courses they teach. Classes are small enough that professors will know you by name quickly and can help you one on one if needed.
College Junior,4,"Very safe campus. Campus safety is all over campus, and there all call boxes everywhere in case of an emergency. People leave your personal property alone, and if you leave your phone on the table while you go get dinner, it will be there when you return."
College Junior,4,"All housing options are great. There is something for everyone. Every resident first-year must live in Loughran Hall, which is a very nice freshman dorm, and much better compared to many other schools. For students looking for a more modern dorm, they can live in Madonna Hall, and Regina Hall is available for students who want a more rustic/old fashioned housing option, or something cheaper. In addition, there are on campus apartment-style dorms available for those looking for more independent living. All dorms are close to at least one academic building. Housing process is a little complicated, but as fair as it can be."
College Junior,4,The school is very open to people. There are also many clubs and activities available for everyone to attend and join.
College Sophomore,4,I had one bad professor but taking the one rotten egg out the rest were great. They help us but let us go enough so we actually learn what were doing.
College Sophomore,4,I don't know of any incidents but there's always things that can improve with things like this.
Recent Alumnus,4,Safe campus!  Have no worries
Recent Alumnus,4,Perfect attention for this sized campus
College Freshman,4,Most school spirit revolves around sporting events
College Freshman,4,I just feel at home at Marywood
College Student,4,"There are help poles all over campus.  Each person is given campus safety's number as an incoming freshman.  Campus safety will do anything necessary to ensure the safety of the students.  I feel very safe walking alone on campus, even in the dark sometimes."
College Student,4,"Most professors are very kind.  They make you work hard, but they are there for help whenever you need them.  They respond to emails.  The classes are all small and the professors are able to get to know each student one on one."
College Student,4,With the program I am in I will earn my masters degree.  I will be able to do an internship my last year.  I will get a job quickly when I graduate because this school is so highly recommended for this program.
College Student,4,There are dorms to live on or apartments in the woodlands.  There is nothing to do on the weekends which makes it hard to live on campus.  The cost is okay for the dorms we are given.  The housing process is good and went well for me.  It is easy to change roommates if you can find one too.  The dorms are right in the middle of the campus around the other buildings and the woodlands is at the edge of campus.
College Student,4,There are many people there who are available at all hours for help.  The faculty goes a step further than most to help the students.  There is free tutoring and the students get paid to do it.  The programs are very hard but very efficient.  I would choose to go to this school again because it is the perfect fit for me.  There are so many different types of people out there and this school accepts them all with loving arms.
College Senior,4,I feel like the health and safety at this school is great
College Senior,4,"There are emails for opportunities for internships and jobs everyday, there are frequent job fairs."
College Senior,4,"Its a great school, love how many friends ive made, the relationships with my professors and all the activities they have to offer."
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is great, the space is good and it is always clean."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus with campus safety always around.
College Sophomore,4,Marywood University does not have a high crime rate. The student body is protected by campus safety services and procedures. I personally have never felt unsafe while on Marywood's campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Marywood University offers a copious amount of ways in which students can get involved. Some of these include intramural sports, student activities and varsity sports. Although I am not part of the varsity sports available for students, I do participate in some of the other activities available for students. Marywood's cheerleading team brings fans and students together to show the school spirit. Fan's support in response to the cheerleaders, as well as the players, is thrilling. Our gym and varsity fields are great quality and very refreshing. Overall, Marywood University has great opportunities for student athletics!"
College Freshman,4,"Personally, I am not an athelete, nor do I use the athletic facilities on campus. With my course load, I simply do not have time."
College Senior,4,"Campus safety cars are usually seen patrolling campus all hours of the day and night. Most are kind, friendly and will help you in any way.  There are emergency boxes located on campus which feature a bright blue light to easily locate, and a button that signals a campus safety officer to locate you should there be any trouble."
College Senior,4,"My opinion has swayed a lot over the years, but overall a great school.  I love how small the classes are, which helps with student-teacher relations.  Your teacher will most likely remember you and they serve as a great resource in the future."
College Senior,4,"This school is great - wonderful programs, small classes which leads to better relationships with teachers, I could go on.  HOWEVER, this school desperately needs help in communication.  Programs and options need to be laid out more clearly on the website and in person, and offices all over campus need to be on the same page about policies and helping their students.  For instance, to resolve an issue, I went to one office, who sent me to another, who sent me to another, who sent me to the office I began in."
College Junior,4,"Campus security can always be seen and students are constantly aware of them. When I was a freshman I was nervous about walking to my car after my night class, however the campus was lit very well and security was always around, which really made me feel good and safe!"
College Junior,4,"There isn't a fraternity, however Marywood has two sororities that do a great deal for the community and the people in it. One of the sororities works with children and I have always looked up to them and respected them for that!"
College Freshman,4,It is over-all a fun school. You need to be involved in the sports program. There is a very big split between the NARP's and the athletes. If you play a sport you will easily find friends.
College Senior,4,"While Marywood is definitely not a large university, it has a ton to offer and there are lots to get involved in if you are interested! There are now 2 sororities (both social service) available to join, as well as tons of community service opportunities and clubs. Being in a small school can seem like a pain, but I am so grateful for my small classes and how close I get to those in my major, as well as my professors who mostly take a real interest in each of their students."
College Sophomore,4,"The dormitories at Marywood are in general very nice as the have bathrooms in the rooms so that you do not have to go down the hall for the bathroom. Other than that, the rooms are very nice and spacious and provides beds that are comfortable and clean."
College Freshman,4,Marywood has a really nice gym with a variety of work out equipment/machines. Most of the sports teams seem to have good reputations.
College Freshman,4,The policy when it comes to alcohol is very strict on campus since it is not allowed.
College Senior,4,I enjoy going out to eat. Anything is better than eating on campus.
College Freshman,4,Lots of dining options including evening hot snacks.
College Freshman,4,"Gym and pool nearby.  My dorm is far away from my business building, but not too far from dining hall and student union. The dorm is co-ed and each room has its own climate control."
College Junior,4,"A lot of the houses don't look great on the outside, but have really amazing interiors and can be really reasonable in terms of monthly rent"
College Junior,4,"Favorite part of Marywood - Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera, Basilico's, Chipotle, Chinese food, Dunkin, Mannings... all below $10 for a meal and great quality"
College Junior,4,"Dorms are the nicest out of any school I looked at, including each room's individual heating system, no communal bathrooms, carpeted floor and painted, sheetrock walls. All classes/buildings are within a 5 minute walk from your dorm, with the exception of the on-campus apartments (Woodlands) which may be 10 minutes or so, max. Its a pretty decent cost considering what you're getting for it, and choosing housing goes by completed credits and then GPA. The worst living option is Regina Hall just because its one of (if not the) oldest dorm on campus, but they're still pretty nice."
College Junior,4,Fans come and support all the sports teams. I know from personal experience that the sports teams all support one another.
College Junior,4,There are always campus safety workers around. They are just a phone call away. They are available to walk you to and from class if you feel unsafe.
Junior,2,"Terrible area nothing to do. They do not help you at all with anything. Basically on your own if you want to go to grad school or get a job. If you are not from the area it will be hard to meet people unless you play a sport. Advisors do not care and don’t even respond to emails all the time. They require classes that they only offer 1 or 2 sections for so not much of an “elective.” If you are not from the area, it’s not worth going here at all!!"
Junior,2,"Marywood University is overall a terrible school for many reasons. 1) It is located in an area where there is zero potential and nothing to do. 2) Maintenance might as well not even exist because once something is broken, it stays broken. This includes your dorm room. My room was filthy. No one cleaned it from the people living there before me. 3) The food is awful. The only time it's good is when parents visit to put a good show on. There are 3 places to eat that have bizarre hours. 4) EXTREMELY liberal. Not only do the students constantly push politics, but the professors even do. 5) There is ZERO party scene. Z-E-R-O. 6) It is such a small school that it is honestly clicky. You can see different click groups on campus all the time and you won't even get into certain clubs without being in that click. 7) To sum this university up the best, it is a second high school that you are paying thousands of dollars for. Take my word for it. I cannot wait to transfer."
College Junior,2,"Well Marywood doesn't want anyone to live off-campus, so they don't help you at all with that. you can find some places in the very near walking-distance area, but everything is way too expensive for the actual area you are living in, I mean, it's Scranton. Landlords tend to be okay, but that really varies like anything else."
College Junior,2,"University living is about staying safe and having fun. Having visitors of the opposite sex and drinking are things that is part of the college experience, none of us signed up for the convent yet. Marywood administration attempts to take all of the fun out of it, but in my experience that just pushes students to hide what they are doing, causing more dangerous situations."
College Junior,2,"The hours food is offered is not suitable to the college life really. From Friday afternoon on it is very difficult to match up with the hours that food is available. Additionally, the food is just not very healthful. They have attempted to make better options, but some nights the sub-par salad bar is really the only option. I wish with the housing agreement a meal plan wasn't required so that food money could be spent elsewhere."
College Senior,2,"The strict policies at Marywood make it very difficult for students to enjoy themselves, sometimes even making it difficult for them to stay safe, as they fear getting in trouble so they may avoid coming back to campus at night."
College Senior,2,"Majority of the housing is really great. The life on campus is absolutely horrendous. This is a suitcase school and unless you are 21 and enjoy going to bars there is little social life except for exclusive, off campus, unwelcoming, underage parties."
College Junior,2,The school provides little help in finding off campus housing. The only useful information from Marywood are two links on the housing page which refer students to overpriced housing complexes.
College Junior,2,"Marywood University is a religious institution, which leaves little room for religious diversity. When students are forced to attend religion classes, often taught by members of the church, it is rare that anyone reveals a different religious attitude."
College Freshman,2,its annoying.  the freshman parking lot is in Narnia... seriously
College Sophomore,2,Parking tickets are handed out multiple times. Never really responsive to calls. Drinking and visitation policies are annoying.
College Sophomore,2,Even commuting I am still taking out loans
Recent Alumnus,2,"Used computer lab for research class. SPSS did not function properly and when upgraded, the class was not informed by tech support."
College Freshman,2,"There's supposedly some kind of bus system but I've never seen or heard anything about it except for a vague mention during tours of the campus. Some kind of long-distance transportation besides taxis are needed. There's literally nothing to to do off-campus within walking distance. There are no stores either. If there's something you need to buy that isn't in the school bookstore, you're screwed without a car. It's also very expensive to get a pass that lets you park your car on campus."
College Junior,2,"If you're a fan of winter months this is a perfect school for you. However, if you aren't it might not be."
College Junior,2,Unfortunately it seems to be hard for many people to get the aid they need to actually go to school without having to worry about having multiple jobs to try and pay for it while going to school at the same time.
College Freshman,2,In the dorms they have someone (a worker) posted to keep track of anyone who may come into the dorm who does not live there. If you end up signing someone in of the opposite sex they have to be out by a certain time and cannot stay over. Even people who live on campus in other dorms cannot get into a dorm they do not currently live in.
College Freshman,2,The sports teams aren't that amazing and in my experience not many people attend many games/matches/meets. There are a few games that are the exception but sports aren't that exciting and there isn't much fan support.
College Sophomore,2,"There are very very few places to access a public printer, the cost for use is a little high as well. The wireless network often is slow or non existent, especially in specific dorms or area of campus "
College Sophomore,2,"Violation of visitation in dorms is a very harsh offence and is treated with the same level of seriousness as alcohol abuse, even as a sophomore I find it difficult to interact with my classmates of a different sex after hours, even if the visitation is active "
College Sophomore,2,Greek life does not play a major role in my day to day school activities 
College Freshman,2,The price for a parking pass is $200 and it doesn't guarantee you a parking spot because there are more cars than available spots.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The satellite location offered classes two evenings per week and closed at least two times per semester due to the weather. Fall of 2012, classes were cancelled because of loss of power from Super-storm Sandy and in the spring 2013 for a ""freak"" snow/ice storm."
College Senior,2,"The campus is too strict. They monitor students all the time. They have very strict dry campus rules. Also people of opposite sex are not allowed to stay over night in the dorms, even if its family."
College Senior,2,"The paper issued by security, and the actual signs at parking spots on campus are out of sync, (also hard to read some signs), and the student is always wrong. It's also very expensive, and you aren't guaranteed a spot. Parking is essential for most everyone who attends this college (though bus fare is free with Marywood ID), but requires knowing scheduled times, and so on."
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing much around Scranton. Takes 10 minutes by car to get anywhere you'd actually like to go.
College Senior,2,"I dont party at my school.  I grew up here, I'm of age, and have my own group of friends to barhop with."
College Freshman,2,"Public transportation is extremely inconvenient in Scranton. The buses are unreliable and the taxi service takes up to an hour to actually get to the place that you called them for, then they are extremely rude when you get in the car and it can cost up to $25 to go ten minutes away."
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing in walking distance to do at marywood. No cafes, no resturants, nothing. "
College Sophomore,2,The computer labs are pretty much available all the time and are not always crowded unless it is finals week. Printing on campus you have to pay for and they are always changing the system for that so it gets confusing. The network is pretty bad depending on where you are and it tends to have lots of trouble. It is always a good idea to have a personal computer that way if the computer lab is crowded you don't have to wait.
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one sorority and one newly formed fraternity. Neither are very dominating on campus. However, I do believe that the sorority does a great deal of community service, which is great. If you're looking for frat parties and easy sorority girls, this is not your school. If you're looking to give back to the community, this is where you want to be."
College Senior,2,"There are not many of places to eat on campus.  In the main dining hall, there are a few different options, but many are not the appetizing and we end up getting a wrap.  I like to eat at The Atrium.  They have a lot of options for dinner, but when the main dining hall does not have something good, it gets very crowded."
College Sophomore,2,"You don't need transportation to get to classes but it is much more convenient to have a car, considering you can park it on campus all four years. Though the public bus system is free for students, its hours are very inconvenient, they don't run on the weekends."
College Junior,2,"Expensive , cars get damaged often. Cars get  hit by baseballs from field"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Much Going on – There aren't a lot of cool activities for students.  For those who are over 21 downtown scranton is the place to go.
Recent Alumnus,2,Things Are Strict Here – This is a dry campus..no alcohol allowed.  Students are only allowed to miss 3 classes or they lose points from their final grades.
College Student,2,It is a division three school. There is no football team. Not much school spirit. People do not come to this school for the sports.
College Sophomore,2,Process Is Rough – I thought I would recieve more than I did last year but everything worked out. It's a process I don't like to do though. The director of the Finanical Aid department at Marywood was a good help when I needed it.
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs and Alcohol – I have never heard of or encountered anybody doing any kinds of drugs. However, while I do not drink, students frequently refer to Thursday as ""thirsty Thursday"" and even if they are underage, find a way to go out drinking. That is not my scene, If I am drinking, its usually water."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Lot of Guys – There's about a 70:30 girl to guy ratio, which kinda sucks. The University of Scranton is close enough by to help the ratio out some."
Junior,1,"There's a glaring issue with favoritism and lack of diversity. Racial discrimination is rampant and reflected throughout the faculty, the student body and administrative staff. Most students are stuck up and not very friendly. The university doesn't try hard enough to address and call out discriminatory behavior from it's students, and the professors turn a blind eye. If you have an issue with student paperwork, Financial Aid and HR are the most inefficient departments ever. No one likes to do their job, emails are rarely answered. The  student activities are usually pretty boring and obviously based on what the event planning team likes, not what students like. The area surrounding the campus is dead, no businesses or hang out spots within a close walking distance. I'm considering transferring elsewhere because this University does not fit me in any way. No one should stress over anything other than classwork, An absolute nightmare."
Junior,1,I’m a student here and attending this school is one of my biggest regrets ever. I feel as though I have no voice. There have been a total of 4 teachers that have expressed genuine interest in ways to help a student succeed and marywood fired one of them last year. The food is terrible ( like the chicken is served literally still bleeding when you cut into it) and the dining service hours are even worse. There is no room for religious diversity either. In one of my religion classes I mentioned that I had been raised in an Atheist household and after that my teacher started grading my essays in a far harsher manner than he had previously. I have tried reaching out to every “academic success” resource they have and all of them have been so disappointing. There is no life on campus either. I was once a prospective student checking out reviews on this very website and I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews.
Alum,1,"Do not waste your time, money, or mental health. I have nothing positive to say about this place other than meeting a few great friends. The professors who haven’t left have virtually given up. No one ever answers their phone, and forget trying to find help over a break- yes, there may not be class for everyone, but a registrar’s office should still be open! Favoritism and discrimination are rampant. Poor education at an unreasonable cost. Side note: they will not give you your transcript if you have unpaid Loans with them (because everyone pays them off right when you graduate???) yet another way they set you up for career failure! Rated for having the unhappiest students multiple times. Shutting down programs left and right and losing accreditation outright, which has ruined some people’s futures. Do not risk that for yourself as well. Do not go there or give them your money."
Niche User,1,"I transferred out after 5 semesters and let me tell you best decision I’ve ever made. A better one would have been to never go there. The school is so poorly run. 1) my department head was also my teacher, older then a dinosaur and only used the class time to talk about his golden years in the industry. I never learned anything. 2) The area SUCKS. I worked off campus and I saw addicts and needles almost daily. Says a lot about he area. 3) Residents across the street from the school HATE the students. They literally stalked and tormented me and my roommates when we lived off campus, PD, no help, MU did nothing to support their students. There are no opportunities for you after school unless you want to stay in the area. I pay less As an out of state student at FAU then at MU, it’s larger, easier to schedule classes, better run and better opportunities."
College Freshman,1,"The sports teams are friendly, the coaches are vicious."
College Senior,1,The social life here is absolutely awful.
College Junior,1,"The campus is completely controlled by Chartwells, the on-campus food provider. Chartwells is the only food available in the student center and everywhere else on campus and the food is mediocre at best."
College Junior,1,"There are hardly any males on campus. In my two semesters at Marywood, I've had all of 10 guys in my 11 classes."
College Junior,1,Campus security spends more time looking for parking violations than they do anything else.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid process is an absolute nightmare, it took me so long to receive my refund check for books that I could not purchase books in time for my first semester, and I am almost to my finals and I still have not heard back if my loans cleared or not, this is a strong downfall of my school and has almost made me reconsider continuing attending here"
College Senior,1,"The nightlife here is not what you would expect of a university. It is subpar at best. The university is not located near any attractions. It's a 15 minute drive to the closest bar, and there are few taxis that can take you there."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is the worst, the parking pass is expensive, while there's not much parking spots available, best thing to do is get there 30 minutes before your class. And Marywood loves to give parking tickets out in all season, rainy and snowy too!"
College Sophomore,1,"I never noticed any Greek life, it is non existent."
College Sophomore,1,"The COLTS bus is free for anyone with a Marywood ID, however it does not run very late. McCarthy Flower Cabs is TERRIBLE. They are unreliable and very rude. If you plan on going off campus, you're better off getting your own car and making friends with people who do."
College Junior,1,Parking is extremely limited even at the high permit cost of 100 dollars.
College Senior,1,"Marywood's Greek system is hardly present. Marywood only has one sorority, dedicated to student life and community service, but they are not very present on campus, except for the occasional flier. Though I don't mind, as I'm not too interested in Greek Life."
College Senior,1,"Not a Lot to Say – The thing about the program I'm in is we're only on campus in the summer - class is held elsewhere in the spring and fall semesters. I've never needed to use the campus bus in the summer because everything was in bearable walking distance.

I do, however, think the school should have a shuttle to the off-campus locations rather than forcing everyone to get on a bus or a plane. This is why I'm giving them a D+ in terms of transportation. I think everyone could meet on campus and take the shuttle to whatever city we need to be in (usually NYC). Considering what they charge for tuition, I think they can spare it."
College Student,1,I Do Not Like My School – I am transferring next year. My school is boring and the other students are strange and stuck up.
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life at Marywood. There is one sorority, and you never hear anything about it. Plus, it is a very religious sorority."
College Freshman,1,"Go Off Campus – The nigthlife at Marywood is nothing special. Most of the students find things to do among eachother, while others will go and meet up with friends who are either at the University of Scranton or are commuters. The people who branch out and make friends off campus, are those who will most likely find things to do at night."

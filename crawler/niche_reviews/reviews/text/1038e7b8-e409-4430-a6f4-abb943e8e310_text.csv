Senior,5,"It is a great community of aspiring Engineers.  We are all working together towards the same goals and assignments, making it easier to focus and build each other up."
Freshman,5,Colorado School of Mines is amazing and all the teachers I have met are very informative overall it is a great school and I cant wait to go back in the fall.
Freshman,5,The professors were very helpful while teaching and could help me with any problem if I went by their offices.
Freshman,5,"I loved the recruiting process of Mines when applying to the school. They answered all of my questions and talked to me about safety, academics, and mental health. They really cared about their incoming students and tried to limit the stress and confusion during the coronavirus."
Sophomore,5,"Most of my classes were easily transferable to be online, so it was not a very chaotic transition. I enjoyed being more independent in my studies during that time, and I think Mines handled the abrupt transition very well. It really took care of the student."
Sophomore,5,"I like how everything at Mines revolves around math, science, and embracing nerdy-ness. I felt at home there and enjoyed all of my classes. It is a small campus with lots of communities to be a part of, and has some great dining options."
Sophomore,5,"Mines is a great place for students to attend. The staff are very friendly and want you to succeed, even if that means working specifically with you. All of the students are very smart, but most are willing to support you if you are struggling. Mix this in with the intensive coursework and the renowned name, and you have a great school!"
Freshman,5,"I love the school and it has an amazing reputation as a top tier engineering school. I was able to secure an internship my first year, and I was also able to be a part of so many opportunities such as undergrad research and the first-year honors program."
Sophomore,5,"What I love most about CSM is its prestige. If you want to major in STEM this is the place to go. I have had great experiences with the professors and the community in general at Mines. In only two years Mines has not only molded me for the professional world, but for life as well. 
At this school, it's okay and even cool to be a nerd. Being surrounded by brilliant people has helped me become who I really am. Not only is the academic side amazing but so is the recreational and the athletics side. 
Our athletics are A1 and are extremely fun to take a study break and watch. The athletes on campus are also smart, just like you, so they aren't like jocks. 
The location of the school is great, within walking distance from downtown Golden which is amazing! 
Have no complaints besides the homework!"
Freshman,5,Mine is an excellent school for anyone intrested in pursuing stem. They offer smaller classes with professors who actually care about their students and plenty of hands on time is offered. The campus is kept very clean and up to date.
Niche User,5,"Super! It was amazing to be able to visit the campus and see what everything is like. I would highly recommend visiting the college that you are considering attending, it will pay off."
Freshman,5,"Very challenging but highly rewarding. The academics is exceedingly difficult but I know I will be prepared when I go into the work force. I am constantly surrounded by amazing, fun, highly-intelligent people who embrace their ""nerdiness"" with a passion. Everyone here has a lot of school pride and always has each others backs."
Freshman,5,School of Mines creates a strong feeling of community in a very strong academic setting. The work is difficult but always fulfilling and gives students a head start to a great career even before they graduate.
Junior,5,"Colorado School of Mines is incredibly challenging, but totally worth it. Students are given the opportunity to experiment and learn things that no other institution offers, and most importantly, encouraged to fail because that is how we learn the most."
Freshman,5,"While very challenging, Colorado School of Mines has introduced me to the best group of people and has also expanded my knowledge of math and science. The teachers are very kind and supportive. They understand that it is a hard school so they try to help the students as much as possible."
Freshman,5,"Mines is incredibly challenging, but well worth it. The profs are overall very great. There is ample chances for research and jobs and many clubs. There is a friendly atmosphere and its not a cutthroat school which is much appreciated."
Niche User,5,My experience with mines is based on the day tour i attended this summer. It was a full day experience where I got to interact with current students and professors. I couldn't enjoy it more. The campus is small and close knit and everyone was very welcoming and encouraging.
Niche User,5,"When I toured Mines, I loved the atmosphere and the campus setup. It had great views of the mountains. Their sports fields were very well-kept, and they seemed to have a lot to offer educationally. I will be attending Mines in the fall of 2020 and I am happy to be able to go to such an amazing school."
Alum,5,"Great school, it was very challenging. The workload forced you to rely on your fellow classmates and friends. I made some of the best friends of my life there and met some of the smartest people I have ever encountered."
Freshman,5,This is a college that focuses heavily on one type of degrees and thus they have very nice courses that will prepare you for all possible things in the future.
Freshman,5,"This is an amazing college. I will be an incoming freshman in the fall of 2019. So far, I have only been there a few times and pretty much everyone is friendly and likes the outdoors. It is a small college that is located in beautiful Golden Colorado."
Niche User,5,I only came to the school of mines for a campus tour and right away I knew that I wanted to come to the school of mines after high school.
Freshman,5,Solid STEM programs. Students are serious and supportive. Job placement is absolutely great. Location is amazing: close enough to mountains and close enough to Denver.
Niche User,5,I visited this last February and had an amazing time there! I love the area surrounding Mines and the community they have worked hard to create. My only wish is that the athletics programs were given more attention
Niche User,5,"I have just recently accepted this school's offer for enrollment, but every time I have been on campus all of the students seem enthusiastic and they are always very welcoming and helpful. I am really impressed that professors have come in over weekends when Discovery Days were occurring to talk to potential students interested in their field."
Freshman,5,"Overall, it is a very good school that provides a quality education. I have been challenged with complicated material that pushes me to my limits and helps prepare me for my future career as an engineer. In order to make it through this academic program you need to be committed and work very hard but the pay off is well worth it. The school provides great opportunities for careers or graduate programs after graduation."
Freshman,5,"Great environment for learning with great academic buildings, professors, TAs, and athletic programs. Also, golden in beautiful."
Freshman,5,There is a great community here. The people are really nice. The teachers want you to learn practical stuff from the lessons that you will actually use for your job.
Freshman,5,"Mines is academically challenging but the students are very motivated, which makes it easier to word hard."
Niche User,5,"I am currently taking a few courses with Colorado School of Mines and Red Rocks Community College, and must say that the staff, environment, and class structure is amazing! Courses go in-depth, however, teachers are always there for you if you need any help or questions with the information. Homework is also manageable with a part-time career, and the class-size is also balanced perfectly! Thanks!"
Sophomore,5,"Mines is a great school for people that love to learn and love a challenge.  The workload is definitely difficult, but you can expect to find great professors that love what they teach and plenty of resources to help you succeed. 

You also are in the perfect location to have a ton of fun outside of school."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus. The view is amazing and the atmosphere felt very safe and educational. Their labs are very nice and the opportunities for engineering students are endless. My student ambassador was very helpful and answered almost all of my questions.
Freshman,5,"Colorado school of Mines is a home. The engineering academics are unrivaled by any other public university, the environment is comfortable and beautiful, it’s the perfect place for any engineer major looking for a real challenge while still making the best of life. The amount of clubs and activities offered is unreal and unmatched. The campus is picture perfect, the admin are kind and really try their best to make sure you’re coming in prepared and are willing to help with any issues. The athletic teams are excellent and a good time. It’s an amazing place to be if you’re looking to be an engineer"
Freshman,5,Great School. 100% would recommend. Teachers are very knowledgable and helpful. Gives an excellent return on investment for a reasonably priced education.
Freshman,5,One of the best engineering schools in the country with a beautiful campus. Students can feel extremely confident that they will get a job/ go to grad school upon graduation.
Niche User,5,"The Colorado School of Mines is not only a beautiful campus, but it is also full of great people who you can always ask for help. When I was touring there, so many students came up to me and told me how great this place is and it has made me want to be there even more."
Junior,5,"Good solid courses.
Parking situation leaves little to be desired.
Exams are held in the evening, which can be disadvantageous related to the difficulty of the course material."
Junior,5,"It is hard. It gets harder. I won't lie to you there.

But if you work for it, get help from others, and help them in return, you'll get one of the best educations available in America.

I'm a undergoing my junior year, which is one of if not the toughest years for engineering physics students. I am also going for a minor in creative writing and communications. Despite the large focus on engineering and sciences, there are opportunities to go outside of that a bit.

After I finish my undergrad, I plan on getting a masters in electrical engineering and then joining the work force.

If you decide to come, make sure to talk with your teachers and advisers whenever you start having problems. They are there to help, and will provide some of the best assistance you could ask for.

This is a school for success, not for partying. People still do of course, but the people who stay past freshman year know that they are serious about their education. And you better be too."
Freshman,5,"Mines is an extremely prestigious and academic school that helps all of its students to succeed not only in academics, but in applying and searching for jobs after graduation.  This is the school for lovers of science and academia all around."
Freshman,5,Colorado School of Mines is a wonderful school that really prepares its students for life outside of college.
Sophomore,5,"The professors put great effort into student's learning and understanding the concepts of the class. The work level is difficult but can be doable with some time management This university was a nice change from high school; since the acceptance rate is moderately low, students try more and put more effort into assignments and group work. While the homework and general schooling can take up much of your time, students still have plenty opportunities to have fun. There are several places to hike in the area as well as multiple fun events put on by the school. Overall, it was and still is a wonderful experience."
Junior,5,"Colorado School of Mines is an excellent school for individuals who want to be engineers, the curriculum is very challenging but the opportunities for internships are excellent and jobs after graduation.  Professors are vested in their students.  Golden is a great community with Denver only minutes away."
Freshman,5,One semester in and the school has been great. The academics are challenging while the social part of school provides a nice balance. The small population encourages great relationships and fosters valuable resource opportunities.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is extremely nice to one another. Taking the same classes the first couple of years makes it really easy to study with other people. Joining a TLC is a great idea in order to make friends before the school year starts. Finally, the amount of programs for students that are struggling is amazing to have."
Freshman,5,"As a freshmen, everything is what I hoped for and more. However, prepare to be pushed like never before. Being the valedictorian from your high school doesn't necessarily mean you'll do the same here. This school is geared towards preparing you for the real world, and you'll be thankful they were hard on you."
Alum,5,I graduated almost 20 years ago and I still find that my base education gives me a challenge mpetitice edge over my colleagues.  Best investment I ever made
Niche User,5,The professors are passionate about what they do. The lunch servers always love to start conversations and make you laugh. The blaster card system is very efficient and works well.
Junior,5,"Colorado School of Mines is a small, tucked away university with world class professors. The curriculum is strenuous and will test your resolve but you will come away understanding what you've been taught"
Freshman,5,"All the professors I've had have been very good. The workload is manageable, and you will have time to be social on top of school. If you're going to college to party, go to a different school. From what I've experienced and from what others have told me, newer dorms are better suited for people who want to study, and the trads are more for people who want to socialize."
Freshman,5,"Colorado School of Mines is the best engineering school in the world. This being said, as a freshman I know that I will struggle in the school but every bit of the struggle will be worth it."
Sophomore,5,"This is a great school with lots of very intelligent people. Golden, CO, is one the nicest places to live. We are only 50 minutes to the nearest ski resort. The professors are very nice and helpful. The school is challenging but that's why we are all here!"
Alum,5,"Great school, academically challenging.  This is not for students looking for the 'college experience'.  This school is for students who are looking for a solid career in science or engineering.  The school has a great reputation and a lot of resources for career searches, with a very high placement rate of graduates into jobs.  The campus is nice, and they are doing a lot of improvements/additions."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman here at Mines, I must say that I am very impressed by the quality of education, the community on campus, and the overall vibe of Mines. I had originally anticipated this STEM specific school to be very dry and single-minded in terms of its campus community, but people here are very open thinkers and are deeply concerned with the future of STEM and making that future more humanitarian in nature. The education received here is really awesome too. The professors are incredibly understanding and, while they challenge students, they create classroom environments that are very conducive to learning and leadership building. I am in love with this school."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful school. Easily one of the top engineering schools in the country, and maybe the world. Every program is world class. Professors are great, students are connected and act like a family. For an engineering school, the sports are amazing. Usually winning the division title in each sport. "
College Sophomore,5,I feel extremely safe on campus and I think our campus takes a lot of pride in ensuring the health and happiness of students. So many faculty members and students spend all of their free time taking initiatives to take care of people and make sure that resources are known across campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I loved living in the residence halls and made lifelong friends there, I am so glad with the situation I ended up with and all of the living options on campus are amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life on our campus is very different than most, and is incredible. Greek life students are very involved and do much better than most other students on campus. They are all very friendly and there are no large stereotypes or grudges against any particular branch of Greek life."
College Sophomore,5,Although I struggle in my classes a lot I have never felt a more compassionate and involved community in any place I have ever been. I love the campus and all of the people in it. I feel at home there and and I am very glad that I chose to attend school here and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
College Junior,5,"The school is known for it's academics, and once you are suffering through it, you understand how incredible the experience actually is. Every professor that you get the privilege of learning from is more than willing to help you understand the curriculum - from entry level courses to very specific lectures. Classes range from 300+ lectures to 25 people seminars depending on your major and how far you are in your degree."
College Junior,5,"We have companies on the waiting list for our Career Fairs because for years a degree from Mines has been compared to gold in many career fields. Employers know that we have to work hard here, and that is the kind of person you want working for your company."
Junior,4,"Colorado School of Mines is full of some of the brightest minds in the world, our teachers are all top of the line and it is rare to find a class where the teacher is not one of the best people. I would like to see our food options change here, we have a cafeteria option which is good for the first month but then you realize the food is very bad."
Junior,4,"I have taken a few classes online now, honestly it saves me time on commuting and I learn more then I would in class. I get access to teachers during their office hours and can email them for help any time of the day."
Senior,4,I have taken a few classes online now and all of my professors have been very good about uploading lectures on time and keeping up with assignments
Junior,4,"The academics aren't horribly difficult if you can keep up with the pace and volume of work to do. Most professors are very kind and willing to help you with any sticking points in their learning, if you ask."
Sophomore,4,"Mines is a very challenging school, occasionally to a fault, and has a hard time adjusting to new environments that require patience with students. For example, many professors made no changes to their expectations when classes went online. Even though there was less communication between the teachers and students, there was less tutoring, study groups were no longer meeting, and many students went home to environments that were not conducive to learning (small children, etc.). However, the environment student is amazing. The people are wonderful and there is a place for everyone on campus among so many different organizations and groups. Sports and arts are also incredibly important at Mines with full fields for a variety of sports including rugby and a full pool for water polo and swimming and a theater for drama students who put on several shows a year and are open for all students to audition. The motto, ""Mines climbs together,"" is very true."
Sophomore,4,"The second half of last semester was taken online due to COVID. It was a very strange transition, and neither students nor professors were prepared for it. However, that said, things went mostly smoothly, and I was still able to learn."
Sophomore,4,"Awesome community! People in the Golden community and on campus are very nice, but the competitiveness between students can get stressful."
Sophomore,4,"After the pandemic hit, everything was online, and was hard to be away from in-person help, but professors were very forgiving and helpful."
Niche User,4,"I did not take any online courses at Colorado School of Mines, but the college website is easy enough to navigate. Never had any issues trying to find what I needed on the main website."
Niche User,4,Mines is a great engineering school with great environment and support system. Love the small college/retirement town that it is located in.
Senior,4,"It's really difficult and professors are not always the most willing to help you. However, the community is focused on supporting fellow class mates and making sure that everyone keeps track of their own needs. Most professors are absolutely willing to help and are invested in their students college career."
Junior,4,"The school is very difficult but the people I have met, both students and faculty, have made the experience so much better."
Senior,4,Very demanding and a misconception about how smart you are. Still a very good place for a lot of opportunities.
Freshman,4,It is a very hard school but is also very rewarding. Both faculty and students surround you with support and provide you with many opportunities to succeed. I would like to see change in having more activities around the school in helping with mental health issues students will face at school.
Alum,4,"CSM was a great experience for college, there was not substantial hand-holding through classes. The professors and methods used encouraged students to think for themselves and come up with methods to learn, collaborate or learn what you needed to get through classes rather than relying on a passing grade by just showing up to classes. This has served me well as I moved on from University and into the workplace."
Junior,4,"I have loved being a student at CO School of Mines, the academics are rigorous, but if you work hard and ask for help when you need it, you will succeed. There are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus and I've loved being a part of many clubs. The only reason Mines isn't getting an excellent rating is they've started accepting more students, many of which may not be qualified to take the freshman classes here at Mines. In talking to my professors, many first year students struggle with the core classes especially since the classes have grown to huge sizes."
Freshman,4,"My time here has been great so far. Professors know exactly what they are doing, and are extremely willing to help students. Housing is high quality. Main gripe is the food, it's not great."
Freshman,4,"So far I've had a very good experience. The campus is pretty, the professors are generally very knowledgeable about the classes they are teaching, friendly, and helpful. The class sizes are small except for lectures (which is not a problem), and the overall focus on education here by professors, advisers, and students is amazing."
Freshman,4,"Colorado School of Mines is known for its academics. The return of investment is phenomenal! Small class sizes with professors fill you with education. However, with incredible academics comes a cost. The party scene is not that good, unless you join a fraternity or sorority."
Junior,4,"Great support, and good academic programs. It's important to select a major you will like during the four year you are here, otherwise it will not be very sustainable motivation-wise. I chose a major I liked and I have not regretted it."
Senior,4,"Colorado School of Mines is a great college overall. To get the most out of it, you definitely have to put the work in. Most of the professors are very nice and have great insight. They always have the time to talk to students and work with you on your personal projects. One of the best things about Mines is that the school hosts a celebration every year called E-days in which the school has concerts, comedians, and other cool people come out to celebrate the students. One of the best events is the cardboard boat races where students come together and build themed cardboard boats to try to make it down the local creek without sinking. 

One negative which can be improved upon is that during your first year, it can be hard to get off campus with friends to do things. However, the school has tried to remedy this by giving free public transportation and decent access to it."
Freshman,4,"Mines is a fantastic school for anyone interested in STEM. It's curriculum is extremely difficult, which is why a degree from Mines is so valuable! The student body hosts a collaborative environment, which is very helpful when studying for exams or doing homework. Free time is hard to come by, but when you do you're surrounded by beautiful landscape, minutes from climbing, an hour from skiing. So happy to call Mines my home away from home!"
Sophomore,4,STEM focused community with great academics and awesome student resources. There are always a lot of activities to take part in when not grinding school work. Beautiful area with large mountains and cool views.
Freshman,4,Colorado School of Mines is an incredible school with lots of unique opportunities for its students. The only thing I would change would be increasing the number of teachers that are more conscious of what the students go through at the Colorado School of Mines.
Freshman,4,"The people I've met here are amazing and it's great to be surrounded by people with similar goals. The only part of this school that can be problematic is the weed-out classes freshman year. It can be really tough to do well and they can make the courses tougher than they need to be, but overall is still a great school and I'm happy to be here."
Niche User,4,"Very beautiful and new campus with mountain scenery. Most students are like-minded and all are studying some sort of STEM major, making for a small focused community"
Freshman,4,"I love the campus, academics, and opportunities Mines has to offer. Since the campus is in Golden, it is beautiful and there are many outdoor activities to do. The academics are great and since I want to study engineering this is a perfect school for me."
Junior,4,I like the classes and the professors are very helpful. The food offered in the dining hall is not ideal but there are other good options around campus. The campus is beautiful and every building is easily accessible by walking.
Senior,4,"The education that you will receive at CSM is second to none, although you will have to work your butt off every step of the way. Supportive friends and study groups are absolutely necessary in order to make it through. The only bad thing i can say about the school is that the constant construction makes the campus look very bad, although the few times there is no construction it looks amazing."
Junior,4,"Currently as a student here at Mines, I find that the potential for job opportunities has increased significantly since I started here. I am receiving a very high level of quality education and I am surrounded intelligent students who are hard working and professors who care about your success at the University."
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed the academic side of things.  They teach you everything you need to be an engineer in very short order.  I have also found that all of the instructors are brilliant but only about half of them can teach really well.  If you go to mines expect to be working on home work and studying pretty much all the time, and it will be worth it."
Freshman,4,"i've only toured the campus and have current plans to attend in the fall. from what i've seen and heard from those that i've talked to however, it seems like a great school!"
Sophomore,4,"I like how academically rigorous it is, but there is little culture. The culture is improving, but it has a long way to go. It's hard to make friends because everyone focuses heavily on school, and schoolwork leaves little time for extracurricular involvement."
Freshman,4,"Colorado School of Mine is filled with dedicated teachers that want you to learn and succeed. You will be working hard to achieve a degree, but it is well worth it."
Alum,4,"While a very serious school, the Colorado School of Mines has a lot to offer. The academics are rigorous comparative to other universities, which is to be expected of an engineering school, but the professors are supportive and easy to contact when you need extra help. The campus and surrounding area are beautiful and have no shortage of areas to hike, bike, run, or otherwise explore."
Freshman,4,"Colorado School of Mines is top ranked for its return on investment and its prestige. It boasts a strong focus on hands on course work and field based methods. Its students and graduates are known for being highly prepared for their respective industries. 

Campus is situated right outside Coorstek, has gained two new buildings in recent years, and received multiple renovations. Students have access to multiple workshops and labs throughout the week."
Sophomore,4,"You get out what you put in.  If you put in hard work, it's rewarding.  If you don't put in the effort, it's an expensive four (or five, or six) years."
Freshman,4,I was able to work on personal projects as well as my schoolwork. (Personal project was a 2.5HP electric motor)
Freshman,4,My first semester here was of course difficult as is for the majority of freshmen. The people are so nice and inclusive. The housing is pretty good as well. The food could definitely use some work. Sometimes professors will go to fast in lessons are not answer your questions fully. But overall it’s pretty great here. If I had to choose again I wouldn’t pick a different college. Mines is a place where you build a real future for yourself.
Alum,4,All students are required to put in a lot of hard work but with CONSISTENT effort and  good study habits it's definitely possible for the students that value a good engineering or science education to succeed.
Freshman,4,"Colorado School of Mines is a very supportive community of peers.  Coming into one of the most prestigious engineering universities in the nation can be very intimidating, but everyone is here to help.  There are many resources available to aid you in studies, athletics, future careers, and personal development.  Though classes can be very challenging, here at the Colorado School of Mines, you are never alone, and there will always be others willing to help."
Senior,4,"Very good school with hard and demanding curriculum. If you are ready for a challenge and a hard worker then this is the school for you. You will learn a lot but also it may take a lot of self teaching as well which to me is a good way to learn, it sticks longer. If you are smart but lazy then its not the school for you. If you are just looking for an easy college ride not the school for you. If you are smart, hard working and looking for a challenge you have found the school for you."
Junior,4,"Great school, though academically rigorous. Not a typical college experience as you will be studying quite more than others, but well worth it."
Freshman,4,Very Friendly staff and professors. EXCELLENT Disability Support.  A very supportive and friendly climate.
Sophomore,4,Going here has been a great experience because you know that the professors and other faculty are extremely committed to your education and how it will be useful to you in the future.
Junior,4,"So far my school experience has been good. For the most part the classes are hard and the workload varies from class to class. If you want to party then you have to get in with the fraternities/sororities, or at least know someone in them. The food on campus is alright and if you don't like it you can take your pick from the many different places in Golden. There isn't anything  i would really want to change about this school."
College Sophomore,4,I am not personally involved in sports on campus but the teams are amazing. They compete very well and everyone I know who is involved absolutely loves it.
College Junior,4,"It depends on where you live. The oldest buildings  - the Traditional Halls - are the smallest ones, but they have the best atmosphere. The other dorms are suite style so they feel a little more private and spacious but they lack the community feel. All buildings are a close proximity to dining and classes because the campus is small to begin with. I living in the Traditional halls and would highly recommend it."
College Junior,4,"When I tell people where I go to school, usually they look at me like I'm crazy. ""You go to the Colorado School of Mines?! That's hard work!"". Yes, yes it is. I work my butt off, but I'm doing it with so many other students who have the same mindset. We all want to do our best and learn as much as we can from every experience. I even have enough time to be a part of multiple groups on campus including greek life. I wouldn't change my school for the world because it's just the right amount of crazy with a healthy dose of reality."
College Junior,4,I have a few friends involved in greek life and they tell me they love it. They suggest I join but sports consumes more of my time when not working on school. Greek life is a great addition to the school but does not stand out as any one social group; meaning they are very friendly and welcoming.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe when I walk alone at night to my car. More lights in Q lot would be preferable though
College Junior,4,"As far as i can tell from my other friends at different colleges, this is one of the few colleges where they hold events called carer fairs. These events allow students to talk with companies that are in their field and are interested in and allows the students give them their resumes for a chance at an internship. It is as worth noting that this school spends no expense when it comes to preparing the students for these events: resume checking, cover letter checking, and basic tips/tricks when it come to applying for jobs/internships."
College Junior,4,"The course work is not easy, but you know that coming in. The professors have a good variety of office hours if you need help with the material and there are usually tutoring services for most of the courses at this school. The style of teaching varies from teacher to teacher but its generally teacher goes over the material, you take notes, you ask questions and the homework is very reflective of what was gone over in class."
College Junior,4,"Our school has a career fair twice a year, one in the spring and one in the fall. This gives the students an opportunity to talk face-to-face with companies, give them their resumes, and to generally get their name out there. All students that come to this school do so because of the name of the school and how once they apply to jobs after graduation they will have a higher chance of getting the job because of the school they came from."
College Junior,4,We have our own police that wounder around campus either driving or walking from place to place. There are emergency phones set up around campus in convent places. The campus is small so its very easy to hear if anything happens in or around campus.
College Sophomore,4,The classes concerning my major have all been incredibly interesting and engaging.
College Sophomore,4,In all of the time I've been there I haven't heard of any major problems occurring on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Would recommend to anyone pursuing a degree in engineering, specifically mechanical or petroleum."
College Freshman,4,"Variety of courses is appropriate, and professors are fine."
College Freshman,4,I am very happy with this school. The environment is very inviting to reach my potential as a student and as a person. I have been very challenged and have grown A LOT and I plan on continuing to do so in the future.
Junior,2,My online learning experience was less than idea at Mines. It is difficult to administer the types of classes that are taught there through online means and the spring 2020 semester fell below the bar for me.
Freshman,2,"Just wrapped up my first year and am hoping to transfer. Not a single day went by that I didn't hear someone talking about depression or suicide. The school administration is trying to fix this but honestly its ridiculous how many suicides and suicide attempts happen each year. Also, after talking to a few seniors who work in the career center it sounds like mines isn't even that respected by employers. There are a lot of socially awkward students who go here and who have trouble working in teams with others. Companies accidentally hire these students and don't come back to mines because they don't want to hire another person who can't communicate with others. Also, campus administration refuses to put more lights along the pathways so walking across campus at night is pretty scary. Its just sad. Not worth the tuition."
Freshman,2,"This school is definitely not for everyone. I tried to join a bunch of clubs but the people either ignored me the entire time or talked to me for a little bit and then ignored me. Most of the people here are very intelligent academic wise but then put them in group work or in a common sense life situation and they fail and fall behind. People either love it, leave, or stay even tho they hate it because Mines has a high reputation and they're afraid that no where else is going to get them a job in engineering. The culture is toxic and if you take a while to understand something, good luck. The professors are nice but they make the courses much harder to understand than necessary."
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, my school isn't really known for the athletics. Most people are too stressed out with classes to attend events, but that doesn't mean the school tries to get people to come. I know other schools in colorado have a much better athletic program."
College Senior,2,eh. good greeks are few and fair between.
College Freshman,2,"the greek life is weird. its so small, and the school makes them do a bunch of random garbage. They have to be completely academic and a lot of the times are dry. The parties suck and aren't worth going to."
College Sophomore,2,"Since Golden is a really small town, it can be hard to find housing close to campus AND at a decent price. It is not uncommon to be paying $700 dollars a month for rent, for a house that is 15 minutes driving distance. There are, although, a few great houses nearby that (if you are lucky enough) can get them if you know the people living there."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorm that I stayed in had very lenient policies on drinking; or at least, that's what it seemed like to me because my neighbors would constantly get drunk and even though the floor assistant saw them drunk, they wouldn't do anything about it. This affected me personally because I don't like being around these kind of people, but nothing aggressive or super bad ever happened so it's fine."
College Junior,2,"The school consists of mostly young students, so there's nothing going on for the older more mature community."
College Junior,2,It's hard to get healthy cost-effective options.
College Junior,2,"The off-campus housing scene is challenging because there are so many working professionals here and so many rich kids here. The prices have sky-rocketed so it's very very difficult to find a good place at a good price. It's not uncommon to pay $3,000/mo for a house or $1,000 for a single bedroom."
College Junior,2,"I hear from traditional students that the party scene is mostly non-existent. Many kids are into video games and that sort of thing, and plus everyone's weighed down with homework so it's hard for them to have any real fun."
College Senior,2,"there is something going on on the weekends if you know who to talk to, but the the bars are the best place to go for hanging out."
College Senior,2,"it's pretty bad but the shining glory are Einstein's bagels in the morning, and digger den at late night, but they shut that down contrary to what the students have requested. It is nutrition and thats about it"
College Freshman,2,You easily forget that there is Greek life.
College Junior,2,The degree programs they've put together are restrictive and impossible to work around.
College Junior,2,"The food is not bad, but the number of locations where it is available are very minimal and have poor selection. Subway is the only useful option."
College Freshman,2,It is a lot of work to find off campus housing and it is usually quite expensive.
College Freshman,2,I have no idea on this topic because I never go to parties.
College Freshman,2,It's pretty bad. Gets repetitive and isn't very healthy.
College Freshman,2,"There are fewer than one on campus party a week. Parties are often off campus, and/or highly exclusive."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of guys, and very few girls. Most of the guys are cool and attractive, but its a little harder to find the ""good"" girls."
College Senior,2,"Yea, Mines isnt a party school so you have to relocate to boulder if you want to get crazy. I always have stuff to do on Saturday and sunday mornings so thats never a vital option for me"
College Senior,2,"People need healthy food options. Pizza, french fries, and pasta is dense and unhealthy. I would have liked more greens and vegan friendly options."
College Freshman,2,The financial aid was not lenient at all and the aid you get is final and still hard to receive at all. Even if you are at the top of your class do not expect high amounts of aid.
College Freshman,2,There is no college pride and no one attends sporting events. People mostly stick to themselves and its hard to interact with the limited women on campus.
College Freshman,2,There are very few significant scholarships at this expensive school.
College Junior,2,It is very hard to find off-campus housing due to the small campus and the price of the very close off-campus housing .
College Junior,2,"The on-campus and off-campus dining is pretty much the same. The quality is better but the prices are terrible, along with the hours."
College Junior,2,We are very limited on our meals on the Colorado School of Mines. We only have 3 good options for food and that really gets boring and bad at certain point.
College Junior,2,It's very competitive to get into Mines. They look a lot at what you were involved in in high school and your grades and your GPA. and It's a lot harder if you're a guy.
College Freshman,2,I want more options.  I ate subway everyday.
College Freshman,2,"There's not much in terms of on campus housing. Unless you're in a greek life or an RA, you can't live on campus- there's just not room. There is enough off-campus housing, but sometimes it is difficult to find. The best places get picked up pretty quickly but none are more than a 5-10 minute drive from campus so they are pretty close by."
College Freshman,2,"Transportation within the town of Golden is terrible. I can never find a bus when I want one, though they always seem to be there when I don't. The town also uses a bus service that promises to pick people up and shuttle them to where they want to go as long as you call their number, unfortunately whenever I have tried to use this service no one has ever answered."
College Junior,2,We're an engineering school.  The fact that we have a football team shocks people-- what were you expecting?
College Sophomore,2,"Our school is not big on sports, being an engineering school. There are many IM teams, but not a lot of people participate in them. I have attended the male indoor soccer IM games, and generally the only supporters there are the girlfriends of the players. Tonight there was a game and there were 4 or 5 people watching the game go on. "
College Sophomore,2,"Mines is known for its students having no social lives. Unfortunately, it seems to prove true for a lot of people. If you don't seek out things to do, and make an effort to find out what's happening, your weekends will be spent inside doing homework. If you make an effort to look for things to do, you will find them though. If you always want to be involved in something, join clubs or do greek life to make sure that you will always have options. "
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of people care about sports at Mines, which is pretty sad considering a lot of our teams are actually pretty good.  There are typically more Golden residents at football games than students, and Homecoming weekend is a joke.  The low school spirit in athletics may be due to the fact that students are probably doing homework or studying during games, but varsity athletes are not seen as anything special by the majority of the student body.  However, IM and club sports are pretty popular if you want to play for fun."
College Junior,2,Not too much to do at night. Don't hear of parties
College Sophomore,2,Increasing prices each year with decreasing quality.
College Sophomore,2,I received the federal student loan offer from the FAFSA submission and the paperwork was signed at the college. They have no other forms of financial aid to offer outside of sports scholarships for some of the sports offered and those who maintain a 4.0 GPA. There is no other assistance available to look for scholarships or financial aid offerings from the school directly. It all must be done on your own.
College Sophomore,2,If you are 21+ the bars are pretty good and thee is free beer at coors lab but other than that its house partis and there aren't many fo those.
College Freshman,2,"The Presidential In State Merit Scholarship, is something but nothing special. Also their is not a lot of money for the sports teams, especially cross country."
College Freshman,2,"Golden is expensive, and small. The closer to campus the more expensive, and it can be hard to find a place since everyone is looking for the same thing; get as close to campus for as cheap as possible."
College Freshman,2,"People aren't the most social people or the best dressed, however everyone still knows how to have fun while maintaining a healthy balance with the rigorous school work. Most of the school consists of the typical nerdy boys while about a fourth of the school is girls."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much to do after 10 pm in Golden, unless you are 21 and older as everything but the bars seem to shut down.  There are some parties every weekend, but there are few house parties that are worth going to.  Of course, Boulder isn't far away, and CU is known for having great parties."
College Sophomore,2,"The school doesn't help students find housing off-campus.  There are apartments off-campus that are owned by the school, but they are incredibly expensive and have extremely strict rules.  A lot of people will post advertisements around campus for available housing, but it usually gets snatched up quickly.  From what I've seen, it's best to find a group of friends and rent out a 5-bedroom house together.  Rent can be expensive, but the dorms don't even have A/C, so commuting to campus isn't really that bad of a trade-off."
College Senior,2,"Not a lot of options (Slate Cafe - all you can eat but not very good; Digger Den - burgers, sandwiches, etc; Subway, Pizza Hut, Einstein's). No reasonably priced meal plans for upperclassmen, little flexibility for those living in the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"Slate doesn't have many options and often doesn't taste good. Digger den has many options that are available for meal swipes, and einsteins has the best breakfast on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on and around campus can really be awful, get a general parking pass before they get sold out, and get to campus early in the day to ensure that you get a spot."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally do not enjoy parking at Mines. There are three different types of parking here on campus. There is freshman parking which means you can only park in a certain lot and live on campus. Second is the commuter parking pass which cost fifty dollars a year and you can only parking in designated lots that tend to be farther out from campus. The best parking available at Mines is the general parking permit. It is a hundred dollars a year but allows you to parking anywhere on campus that is not a restricted lot. This means you can park on the streets as well as the general,commuter or freshman lots.If you plan on having later classes make sure you get a general parking pass since lots fill up pretty quick."
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria is okay with a lot of options so one can eat pizza everyday if there is nothing else better, There is digger din, which is a snack bar but you can also get meals off the grill. There is a subway and an Einsteins which are both pretty good."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a lot of school spirit here, mostly because being an athlete here isn't as good as being good at school. The football team isn't very good but the basketball team won nationals last year. It's pretty easy to try to join a team but it will take up more of your time so a lot of freshman won't unless they scholarships because there is already so much work to do for classes."
College Freshman,2,"my friend receive a lot of tickets, not much space to park"
College Senior,2,"Lots of Old Houses Close to Campus – Because there's only enough room in the dorms for freshmen, most upperclassmen have to live off-campus. If you want to live somewhere within walking distance, expect to lower your standards a bit. A lot of the houses close to campus (and available for rent) have been lived in by college students for years, which leaves them in less than perfect condition. A good option is Mines Park (school sponsored off-campus apartments), that are relatively new and nice, and are a 15 minute walk from campus. It has a high sticker price ($450-$550/month), but includes everything but electricity/gas, and is only a 10 month lease, which helps save money if you plan to live at home during the summer."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Poor Access – There's disparity between departments. The chemistry department is over-crowded, over-burdened, and under-funded. Yet, the environment sciences department is the diametric opposite."
College Freshman,2,Hard Work – The Schoool is incredibly hard it always feels like you never have any free time because your doing homework at school or try to give your brain a break.  There is some fun social activities but they all seem to be through the fraturnaties.  We're also in school longer then all other schools around.  I wouldn't come here if I had the choose again I would go to a bigger school the times I visit them I would like it better.
College Freshman,2,Fairly Strict – The academic standards are very high.  You must get a C in order to to continue to the next class and most teachers don't curve tests or grades.  Also you can't have alcohol in dorms even if your over 21 and the school is really strict even on fraturnaties that get caught breaking rules.
College Freshman,2,Hot Concrete Box – It is extremely hot in the dorms--air conditioning only in hall. Small.  Seems pretty expensive
College Freshman,2,Im the Minority – It seems like 90% of the people at Colorado School of Mines and me would never be friends we have no similar intrests or experiences.  Plus girls (expecially attractive ones) are an extremely rare group.  If it wasn't for a few of my close friends and fraturnaty brother I have here the people would have made me leave in the first two weeks.
College Junior,1,"The administration has way too much red-tape and has no idea what's going on, on campus. The school might actually run better without them."
College Junior,1,"I went back to school after taking time after high school to work. This school is not helpful for people who transfer in from 2 year schools. Right now I'm fighting with financial aid to be able to borrow the money i need to get through this year. I graduate in 1.5 years, and yet the school is telling me I might need to take an entire year off and cross my fingers that there will be more money available next year."
College Junior,1,"The administration is horrible because they are unaware, or ignore, the huge disconnect between what the school says it does and what it actually does. It says it gives the best engineering education in colorado. In reality, it encourages cheating over learning, and actually penalizes those who refuse to cheat."
College Junior,1,"This school is set up for rich kids who at the drop of a hat can have thousands of dollars put towards their education. They offer kids who start as freshmen straight out of high school special grants etc. Meanwhile, non-traditional students get about 60% of their financial need met. After that they're on their own. Sometimes special loans will come out but for the most part the school doesn't care whether you can afford it or not because they know so many other richer people are clamoring to get in."
College Junior,1,"This school is very bad at educating and teaching engineering students, but is also very, very good at marketing and leveraging its reputation as a good school to attract students. I ended up going here because I had heard and read that it was the very best engineering school in Colorado. As it turns out, I've only had two or three professors who I think were good professors. All of my other professors were very sub-par. Not only that, but the school has an unspoken policy of drowning students in excessive homework assignments. This forces students to strive for good grades and shirk understanding the concepts. This leads to mass cheating. When the institution throws ridiculous assignments at the students and sees completed work come back, they decide to make things incrementally harder. If you are not part of a group that cheats, you end up spending all of your time working your hardest and only earning C's and D's. The administration is too proud to accept this reality."
College Freshman,1,I have never been to one.
College Freshman,1,Only freshman housing on campus is available
College Junior,1,"The administration at Mines is absolutely horrible, they all are very snotty and unhelpful. The RAs in my dorm were also not very good as mine didn't even know my name and falsely accused me of my life habits."
College Freshman,1,"Not enough parking spaces. Parking passes continue to increase in cost while the number of available spaces decreases. The largest lot, a gravel lot, is not well maintained and is full of huge sinkholes.

There are few-none security cameras. Parking fees are huge if you park in a space which you don't have the right permit for."
College Sophomore,1,"Chemical engineering is infamously the most difficult major at CSM.  We work our butts off, and the time spend on school work can be quite overbearing.  If you want an easy life, be an environmental engineer.  Our classes are the most difficult at the school, and a lot of people switch out.  Our female percentage is slightly higher than the school average, so there are not very many creepy lonely men, like in the mining engineering department.  It does pay off in the end though, because we make ungodly amounts of money upon graduation."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid is not one of Mines' strong points.  According to my FAFSA, I shouldn't be paying anything for school, but the financial aid office won't give me enough loans or grants, or point me towards any scholarship opportunities.  Most loans have to be co-signed by a parent.  So if your parent wants you to be independent, you have to go through a bank and deal with ridiculous interest.  My boyfriend went in to financial aid once a week for about three months to bug them before they would even give him a loan application.  The financial aid counselors are unhelpful and insulting, and people drop out of school all the time because they can't afford tuition."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't get financial aid when you apply, you're not going to get it after you get in the school. I am personally in the top 2% of my class, but because I didn't get a scholarship from high school, I am still receiving no financial aid despite trying constantly. If you get aid when you apply, you're set."
College Sophomore,1,"Although Mines is located in Colorado the weather hardly ever affects classes. It is a miracle if classes do get cancelled so be prepared to tread through snow! The only downfall is exams may be scheduled around 6pm and driving/walking through the snow or rain at these times may be difficult. This campus is located on a hill so be careful when it is icy outside!However, when it is summer the weather is perfect! One can enjoy the sun at Kafadar commons which is where many students hang out, slack line, and play frisbee."
College Senior,1,"If you want to park closer than a 10 minute walk to your car, you won't find a spot after 9:15. I have to leave 30 minutes before my class to make sure I get a spot, and I have a 5 minute drive to campus. There just aren't enough spots  close to class buildings, and sometimes not even enough spots at all. It can be faster to walk to class."
College Junior,1,"There are very few places to park on campus - mainly because campus is so small for the volume of traditional and non-traditional students it harbors. Parking is near to  impossible to find, and they partition it based on types of parking. If you ever want a parking spot, you have to buy a General pass (most expensive), and get to class at least 30 minutes before if you drive. If you leave your car parked illegally for five minutes - expect to come back with a ticket. Driving isn't worth it - take the bus or get a place near enough to campus to walk."
College Junior,1,"They Throw a Couple Ragers, but It's Nothing Like at Other Schools – Fraternities are either VERY geeky, or full of a mentality that women are just to be trophy wives and you're weird if you don't drink like a sailor or hook up. There are very kind and unique individual guys in Greek life as always, but it gets drowned in the overall vibe that they expel.

Sororities are not laid back at all - very stuck up, very bureaucratic, very political. It's a money suck: They'll fine you for anything, and the girls more often than not are friends by proximity and convenience than true friends. Granted - it's what you make of it, but from experience (I joined and quit), I can say that it's a poisonous environment."
College Sophomore,1,"There is not enough parking at this school.  Freshman are required to park on campus, and so their cars take up all the spots."
College Freshman,1,"Transfer Students will not get any help other than students loans for the 4 years of study. One week before starting classes they raised Student Health Insurance according to the students age. If you are in the 40's or 50's you have to pay for you and your wife about $10,000 per year only in student health insurance which makes it in 4 years a total of $40,000 only for health insurance.  Financial Aid Office is arrogant and not helpful."
College Sophomore,1,No Scholarship or Internship for International Students. No scholarship or internship for international students.
College Sophomore,1,"There are bus routes near the campus, but no way closed to the dorm."

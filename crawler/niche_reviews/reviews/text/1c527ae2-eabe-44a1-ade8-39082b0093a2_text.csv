Alum,5,"I loved the close knit learning environment! I was a transfer student at ODU, but I quickly became engrossed in the academically rigorous and diverse curriculum."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online courses at ODU. However, the traditional classroom setting had a teacher/student ratio that was conducive for an efficient learning experience."
Sophomore,5,"I love the how it is a small school and you are really involved in all your classes since they are smaller and you are able to interact with your professors easier. I like that everyone there is very friendly and the professors really do want to see you succeed. I also love how diverse the college is and although many people are from Ohio, the students are from all over Ohio. You really get to experience a diversity in all aspects. Something I would change is for the Ohio Dominican to be affiliated with more food places around the area where the students can use their points."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently taking online classes in the summer due to the pandemic, otherwise they would be in person. The professors are very good with communication and when something is unclear, they are quick to respond to emails. The lectures are all posted and we can go at our own pace and complete and turn in the material whenever we desire before the due date."
Freshman,5,"I have been attending Ohio Dominican since the beginning of this fall semester and am in love with this place. The campus is beautiful and just the right size for me. It is not too big that it feels like its own city, but not too small to feel like every one is on top of one another. The teachers are very helpful and keep themselves easily accessible to students for questions and help. Everyone is friendly and if you have any questions, they will happily help within their abilities."
Freshman,5,I love how small yet big the camps is. The class sizes are not to big. The professors are very helpful and nice. They allow you to ask questions when needed and help explain things further.

The small class sizes are amazing and allow you to really get to know your professors and learn a lot about the subject. The free resources offered on campus, from peer tutoring in the library, counseling in the wellness center, and career planning in the career develop office, help make this university great and sets students up for success if they choose to take advantage of all that is offered. I love ODU!"

Sophomore,5,"Ohio Dominican has totally changed my view of college for the better. I transferred there my sophomore year with the feeling that every class and subject would be frustrating and difficult, I soon found out that wasn't the case. As soon as I started my classes I was welcome by eager professors who took the time to make sure I was comfortable and knew my way around. The atmosphere is unlike any other for this size of school. Earning my degree has been so worth while here and I am so happy I transferred to such an awesome school."

College Freshman,5,There are plenty of computers on campus even some class rooms have their laptops and the library or computer lab is never really to full.  each semester you start out with $25 for printing which really is a fair amount i never used more than that. most teachers allow use of laptops while others dont just depends on your professor.
College Freshman,5,Biology is a great program here the teachers are great and there is a lot of fun things to do and the teachers make it great.

College Freshman,5,"Great City â€“ Although ODU is not on a main street, there is a bus line just a few minutes away that will take you to a City (Columbus) that has so much to do. Columbus has so much excitement from baseball games to malls to places to eat out. There is always something to do in Columbus."
College Student,5,The student diversity from what I have seen is awesome at ODU.
College Senior,5,"Stop Complaining. You at Most Have to Walk 5 Minutes to Any Class. People want to complain about the parking here because they have to park at the back of the lot. Did I mention the furthest stop in the lot is, at longest, 150 yards from the student center? which is immediately across the street from the class buildings? You could choose to park far away to get exercise and you'll still only walk 10 minutes to get to class."
College Sophomore,5,"Happy to Always Go Back â€“ I love going to ODU! I love the small campus matched with the small class sizes that give all of the students individual attention. It is a great, quite place for intellectuals to study and further their education."

Recent Alumnus,5,Sunbury Ridge â€“ Ohio Dominican has or is in the process of buying an entire apartment complex about a mile from the school. Its very convenient and perfect for living with roommates. The surrounding areas also have several apartment complexes all within a 10 mile radius
Alum,4,I took a few classes online and it was a good remote experience and allowed me to work the weird hours I had to work in college. They were difficult because it is hard to stay motivated and on top of the work but is as quality of a class as the in person classes.
Sophomore,4,Student/teacher ratio is very small in certain classes allowing that more hands on teaching approach.
Freshman,4,My experience at Ohio Dominican University was great. The small class sizes enhances a one-one students teachers relationship. I can be a true version of myself at ODU.

College Freshman,4,"great school, friendly people, a lot to do"
College Freshman,4,Being in Columbus provides a ton of opportunities and variety especially when it comes to dining.

College Freshman,4,Financial aid is an easy process at ODU and there are great people to help you through the process.
College Freshman,4,There are four great options spread throughout campus. The offer great hours and the food honestly isn't that bad. Plenty of swipes and panther points are given.

College Junior,4,"This is the first year in which the Biopsychology program has been offered. Before it's creation, I was feeling burnt out with school, along with having thoughts of transferring in order to attend a school with majors applicable to animal behavior or zoology. With the Biopsychology program, an animal behavior track was created, allowing me to stay and take classes which pertain closely to what I most enjoy. Ecology, Ornithology, Research Methods and Stats, and Animal Behavior all are part of the majors curriculum, among many others."
College Junior,4,"Ohio Dominican is close to Easton Town center, which carries a variety of restaurants for students to enjoy. A Dairy Queen is within walking distance for those with a sweet tooth, although for those who prefer real food, Easton's restaurant choices are the way to go. KDB restaurant and bar provides a discount for students, as does the AMC theater. The mall is riddled with coffee joints, (Cup of Joe, along with the multiple obligatory Starbucks'.)"
College Junior,4,"Although rules and guidelines are set to generally give students an understanding of what is/is not accepted, strictness is not an overwhelming problem. If someone really steps out of line, consequences may result, but for the most part, the campus is understanding."
College Junior,4,"The school provided scholarships shortly after I was accepted in 2011. They have been generous, helping students that may not come from the richest backgrounds."
College Freshman,4,"The supply us with a fan to take us to the mall and back.  I don't know about the other students, but I usually stay on campus most of the time.  So the only time I need a car is to visit home.  "

College Junior,4,"We were told that ODU has the lowest crime rate of any university in Ohio, and I believe it. I feel very safe there."

College Senior,4,Good for the price just have to find the best deals
College Junior,4,Athletics are essential and a lot of students are interested in them. It keeps us busy especially with being on such a small campus. The sports allow us to come together and be more of a community.
College Junior,4,"Both girls and guys are very unique in their personalities. We all express out feelings and qualities through out attitudes, clothing, and interests. The attitudes of the students tend to be positive and focused on school. Dress is casual to the extent that we choose comfort instead of focusing on materialistic items. Social life is very accepting, since we are a small school everyone knows each other. It is a nice feeling to know the people in your school."
College Sophomore,4,I came to Ohio Dominican because of the education there. They have a really good program and the professors are very helpful. They are pretty good about giving extra help when needed through email or office hours.
College Freshman,4,"Anything you want to eat is within a few minutes from campus. Easton is down the street. Downtown Columbus is only 10 minutes away. And Ohio State is  five minutes away. If you want cheap food, you can find cheap food. If you want high-class, you can find high-class."

College Junior,4,ODU has many places to study on campus.  There are advisors to assist in the registration process.
College Junior,4,The professors at ODU are very knowledgeable and willing to provide support outside of the classroom.
College Junior,4,I am someone that drives to this campus and I don't think it is so hard to get here as the fact that you have to pay $100.00 to park here when this school is so expensive already and that should already be added in with all the other cost.
Junior,2,"Some professors are fantastic, others are mostly under paid adjuncts who couldn't care less about their students. The school is completely athletics focused, meaning there is literally noting to do besides play your sport and go home on your off weekends. The education department is the absolute worst and a complete waste of time if you are actually interested in being a teacher. The school claims  they offer classes but in reality thy lie to get you there. To make things even better there have been two shooting instances in the past year alone. But to have no fear because a ticket happy public safety division is there to protect you with their creeper vans and bicycles. Keep in mind this school is in a very dangerous area and the only student life is deriving to Easton or going to OSU"
College Freshman,2,Public safety is awful. Takes them forever to respond and they only care about giving parking tickets
College Freshman,2,They assume that your parents make more than they do and they don't take into account other expenses they might have
College Junior,2,the rooms are small and the dorms are really noisy at night
College Junior,2,not much partying on campus. it is too small
College Junior,2,Needs a night life.  You have to drive to Easton or Ohio State Campus
College Junior,2,I have yet to see any Greek life around campus. It's too small.
College Senior,2,its in a bad neighborhood.
College Senior,2,"you will get a ticket if you park anywhere you are not supposed to because public safety has no life, and all they do is drive around looking for violators."
College Junior,2,"Not much off campus housing near by. The closest ""fun"" area to live would be OSU and that is about ten minutes away."
College Freshman,2,The college is very expensive and my family and I are trying to figure out where I'm going to school next semester.
College Freshman,2,I'm really having trouble with financial aid.  All of these scholarships are really confusing for me.  I'm already in extreme debt and I need any aid I can get. 
College Freshman,2,"When I'm walking around campus with my ipod, the wifi constantly disconnects with it.  The printers in the lab rarely work.  They are never reliable."
College Freshman,2,I'm not a fan of this place at all.  There is nothing to entertain us.  The campus is always dead and silent.  
College Junior,2,"Many students commute, but the school shows effort in providing fun things to do: ping pong tables, pool tables, a movie viewing area, ect."
College Junior,2,"I see a nice mix of ethnicities, but I see mostly African American and Caucasian. Economic backgrounds definitely range, but religion is mostly Catholic and/or Christian. "
College Junior,2,"Printers are horribly outdated in the library. Computers provided for test taking are nice. Network reliability is decent, but not perfect."
College Junior,2,"Due to recent renovation of the dining hall, the selection of food available is limited. Food trucks on campus, though, do help the situation, and provide delicious options. "
College Senior,2,The area in which the campus is located does not offer close suitable housing
College Senior,2,"The cost of parking is extremlly expensive at Ohio Dominican. It cost students $100 every year for a parking permit and there is only one available lot to park in. I usually do not have a problem finding a parking spot; however, I still believe to cost is a bit over the top."
Alum,1,"I did not take any classes online, it was all in person studies. They do have a nice website though."
Alum,1,I spent four very lonely years there. Very few good memories as an 'international student'.  School is in a bad area and there was nothing outside of class to actually do. It was not a bright spot in my life. My degree never did land me a job in the area I studied.
Freshman,1,"Food terrible in cafeteria- kids going to hospital with food poisoning as a result.  Dorms are okay, no student activities so campus life is very boring.  Transferred out to another school to play athletics elsewhere.  Team trouble with NCAA violations... never a good thing."
College Freshman,1,"Very dangerous, no easy way to commute without a car."
College Freshman,1,"The food they offer is poorly made.  They try to make fancy things, but all the students want are the basics like macaroni.  The soups are awful and watery.  I would never recommend our dining hall."
College Junior,1,I haven't been impressed by the attention surrounding athletics. 
College Junior,1,"Any places worth nightlife fun are downtown, which is a haul. "
College Senior,1,Virtually Nothing â€“ There really is no greek life here.  There are no fraternity houses.
College Senior,1,"Men at ODU â€“ The guys at ODU are all athletes, but most of them are not very...cool.  The girls all want to be nuns."

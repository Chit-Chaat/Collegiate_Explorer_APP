Junior,5,When we went online for covid many professors cared and reached out it was amazing to feel there love and support. Online was good it was pretty simple and we had still a good work load.
Junior,5,"I love being at crown so much! I deeply feel like I belong here and that I bring lots of value to the community. Something amazing about crown is the welcoming community everyone wants to get to know you and there are so many amazing people who come here. Plus it is a place of huge growth academically, spiritually, and personally. I 100% recommend coming here. One area I would like to see change is in the diversity."
Sophomore,5,Crown does well at providing technological support and a sound infrastructure to help with online learning .
Sophomore,5,They make going back to school as an adult learner feasible.  From the onset they work hard to provide support and help at all phases and have a wide variety of interesting classes that allow for me to be challenged and engaged academically and personally.
Sophomore,5,"I did not take any online classes at Crown, however, during COVID when our school had to go online the professors did their best to make our classes doable and made themselves available for any assistance necessary."
Junior,5,"I have only taken one class online since attending Crown college. I took a nursing course called pathophysiology. Going into it, I was skeptical about this class being online because I knew it would be a difficult class. However, this class went very smoothly and the professor was great in teaching the lectures, along with answering questions and devoting time to us. I loved this class and I ended up with an A in the course."
Junior,5,"I loved the atmosphere of Crown College. It is a fairly small school and the family aspect of this college is one of its most valuable traits. I also liked to see how involved the professors are outside of the classroom. Because it is a small school, they can help answer questions and go over complex material in certain classes outside of class. I am on the basketball team at this college and also in the nursing program come this fall. I love how each student cares for the next and wants to see us all succeed. One thing I'd change is the meal plans and how strict they are about students living off of campus. For some, living off of campus makes the most sense but we cannot until we are 22 years old."
Alum,5,I finished my MBA online at Crown! It was a highly practical degree that allowed me to pursue new ideas and improve my business acumen. It was flexible enough to allow me to pursue my degree whilst working in the business world. This was extremely helpful because the course concepts were immediately practical and I was able to integrate my learning with my real-world experience.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Crown! I loved my undergraduate experience on campus so much that I decided to finish my MBA online as well. I cannot stress how formative and impactful the community at Crown is. 

The professors cared for me specifically, and I would joke with my colleagues that our professors cared more about our grades than we did! It was encouraging to held accountable to quality work and explorative assignments. Professors were always willing to help me specialize projects to my specific interests and passions. This was a huge part of the success of my MBA degree and the final capstone project. I was able to identify the industry I'm most passionate about and look at how my industry intersects with the different verticals of an enterprise. 

On-campus, the community was incredible! The events, student-led worship, and campus life was formative to my Christian worldview and enhanced my time at Crown by creating deep community."
Senior,5,"My experience at Crown College has been amazing! There are many reasons why Crown is an excellent college.  One, you create unforgettable memories and become close with the people that surround you on the campus.   The campus is small where you become familiar with the faculty, staff, and other classmates that are part of the school.   Professors have and open door policy where students are able to walk into their offices and ask questions about assignments.  Professors want to see their students succeed. Something else that I have loved is knowing that almost everything is in one building.  This is very nice especially in the winter months.  Crown even offers coat racks in the hallways for students to hang their jackets up in a safe place.  Another reason I love Crown is because it is a very affordable private college that is part of Division III Upper Midwest Athletic Conference. Student Athletes are able to play the sport they love and succeed in academics at the same time."
Senior,5,This is the best Christian College for seeking scriptural wisdom and knowledge and spiritual formation.
Freshman,5,Crown College is beautiful and the staff and students are great. I visited Crown a couple months ago and fail in love with the campus. They have a lake right on campus along with a beautiful softball field. This was my first college visit and my last. I saw and founded everything that I am looking for in a college. No way to fail feeling is the best way to describe how the staff and people made me feel while I was there. I spent the night with the softball team and attend alumni games are prayer with the entire campus. I recommend anyone looking for a Christian home for a college to look into Crown College. See you in the fall.
Graduate Student,5,"I received both my undergraduate and graduate degrees from Crown College due to the emphasis on infusing academics with biblical principles and Christian ethics. I would recommend Crown to anyone who desires to go deeper in their studies, friendships, and relationship with God."
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere of Crown! There are many options for majors. The Exercise Science program is amazing! The equipment is incredible!! Everyone I have met from Crown is very helpful and only wants the best for you.
Freshman,5,"The people are friendly and accepting, professors genuinely care about their topics and about their students, and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Christian beliefs and practices are a top priority. Professors and staff are kind and understanding while pushing you to do your best work for God, in and out of school."
Freshman,5,Crown is amazing and provides a wonderful religous experience for all who attend here. The professors are amazing and the people here are also amazing.
Sophomore,5,so far I love my school every question or concern I have being an online student they are always available and more than happy to help me
Freshman,5,"The enviroment is very welcoming and teachers are understanding. I have made friends here, and I never thought I could do that before. The classes are interesting, and I enjoy them. SAB events are also a lot of fun. My favorite events have been the Amazing Race during Welcome Week, clue with real people, and hide and seek at MOA."
Niche User,5,"I have only visited Crown, but I loved it. Everyone was very kind and welcoming and I am confident that I will find a supportive teaching staff and classmates there."
Senior,5,Crown College offered online study and the type of courses I wanted for my Psychology degree.  Their Academic program was also very conducive to my lifestyle and very flexible.
Junior,5,Crown college is an excellent college. The professors challenge you to learn in a way that makes fully comprehend what is being taught. They also make sure that they get to know each and every one of their students on a personal level.The community at Crown College makes you feel welcomed and loved. I am beyond thankful I decided to further my education at Crown College.
Sophomore,5,I love the school itâ€™s a great place to start your college career it gives great opportunities as a individual and the teachers actually care and want to see you succeed as you grow into your professional life
Alum,5,"There is so much opportunity at Crown College! I was a four year student and was able to be involved in so many things. I was in athletics, I served in student development and in our campus store as a manager. The support system here is amazing! The professors want to get to know you and help you in all areas of your life. The spiritual life here also helps you grow in Christ and the staff help you develop and make your faith your own. I highly recommend this college!"
Graduate Student,5,The spiritual support in all domains is encouraging!  No matter what the subject is it's always reinforced with spiritual concepts and scripture.
Alum,5,"I am a huge fan of Crown College. I graduated in May 2017 and look back with fond memories of my time there. A few things that stand out to me about Crown are the leadership opportunities on-campus, identity formation through faculty mentorship and discussion-based learning in the classroom. Not to mention a strong sense of community through on-campus events and actitivites."
Junior,5,"I love Crown College. I love the community, classes, and professors. Because campus is small, the community is great. The environment makes it easier for people to build relationships with one another. The classes offered are very interesting and make me eager to learn more. The professors are amazing! I have great interactions and relationships with them. They are very kind and understanding."
Sophomore,5,I go to the Nevada campus. I love that it is a smaller school and it is more personal. All the teachers know who you are and are concerned and willing to help with your grades.
Graduate Student,5,The professors are all very helpful.  At Crown I was able to gain real world knowledge and insight while also seeing it from a kingdom perspective.
Senior,5,I love the community at Crown. The faculty and staff genuinely care about their student's lives and try to work with students when unexpected circumstances come their way. It has also been cool to meet people from all over the world. Something I would like to see change on campus is the number of students around on the weekends.
Sophomore,5,"As a student at Crown College I like the experience as a whole. The professors want you to succeed not only in the classroom, but afterwards as well. The students and faculty were very welcoming to the incoming students even after Welcome Week."
Freshman,5,"I love that it is very small so that you are involved in a community. They turn out to be your family. However, it is still large enough that I won't always see the same people each day. The professors genuinely care about you, and they tend to pray over you before an exam. This has been very reassuring and has helped me focus and do well. I am earning higher grades here than I did in high school. I am thriving both socially and academically, and it is wonderful!"
Junior,5,"I love going to school at Crown College. It has a close knit and fun environment, and I can find a place where I fit in.  The professors and other faculty and staff care about you as individuals, and you can tell. I would recommend Crown to anyone and everyone, it is amazing."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Though some of the halls are older and in need of some updating (paint and carpeting, mostly), the environment makes up for it. The community created on the floors really makes it feel like home."
Recent Alumnus,5,Great small school with authentic people.
College Junior,5,"I love how eager to help the teachers are. The textbooks for the classes are some of the most insightful books I've ever read. If I could do it all over again, I would pick Crown College from the beginning."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Best professors there is. They genuinely care for the students in and out of class. The people are fun to be around and also very encouraging to each other. A lot of events take place throughout the year. If I could do it again, I would!"
College Senior,5,Very diverse and accepting of all cultures and backgrounds.
College Sophomore,5,Enrolling in school was easier than I thought. I received a lot of help from the faculty there and the application process was easy to understand.
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Crown College has been great. I have loved going to school and learning in my field of study, while also growing in my relationship with Christ. The courses I am/ have taken have all prepared me and are preparing me for the Nursing department program. All of my professors are very knowledgeable in their fields of study. The class sizes are all small and allow for greater learning opportunity."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Crown College. I wanted to go to a Christ-centered college, and Crown is exactly this. I would choose Crown College in my search for school if i had to do it all over again because they have well developed and growing programs that are taught by professors and doctors who are very knowledgable in their fields. Crown offers a wide variety of online courses along with there normal courses. Crown gives students to get a good education while focusing on a growing relationship with Jesus Christ. Crown has different activities that happen throughout the school year that are very fun to participate in."
College Student,5,We do not have any issues with security or anything like that. We do not have sexual assault on campus or anything like that as well. The guys dorms are located 5 miles away and the girls dormitories are near the church.
College Student,5,"We have dorms that are like our own houses. Each dorm has about 22 people living in it and we all have ""dorm duties"" that we must complete in order to not get demerits. I wish we would not have a curfew but it is at 10:30 p.m. and I can understand why we have one. The cost is very efficient and we buy our own stuff for it as well."
College Sophomore,5,I am content with everything so far. I think Crown is doing a great job.
College Sophomore,5,I could say that the campus in general is very safe.
College Sophomore,5,"I know my school has participated in many colleges sports all over the states and I know we have teams that are going playing and competing among the many athletes from others school. We also have best teams i could say, they are really serious about their games and practices and all that."
College Junior,5,"I have grown in my faith, knowledge, life skills, and overall as a person."
College Junior,5,"Very safe. First day of class professors talk about sexual harrassment, violence, and exit routes in case of disasters. Sexual assault is not tolerated nor is violence. I feel very safe on campus."
College Junior,5,"Small class sizes, friendly professors, outgoing students, very nice building, classes aren't too hard."
College Junior,5,"They are hard, but very affective"
College Senior,5,The classes I've taken have been full of students from around the globe and from different walks of life. The professors have been great and help the students get the best grades possible. I've particularly enjoyed the Bible/church related courses because they are not using antiquated materials like other Christian colleges I've attended/researched.
College Senior,5,I love Crown! It's been a wonderful experience for me.
College Sophomore,5,We have security around the clock
College Sophomore,5,The college really helps with trying to get the students jobs
College Sophomore,5,I love the way the housing is set up!
College Sophomore,5,We don't really have this at Crown
College Sophomore,5,The school is better than I ever thought school would ever be!
College Freshman,5,"It's very home-like and clean. Each girl in the dorm has a chore for the dorm and a chore for the room to keep it clean and smelling good. Failure to complete tasks results in demerits, which i think is a good way to make sure we don't have any inconvenient and gross areas in the dorm. However, sometimes they unjustly give demerits even when you do your chores."
College Freshman,5,My college is a very strict one. Since I have known about it there has not been any sexual assaults or even threats. I feel very safe attending this school.
College Freshman,5,"Super fun! Always something to do or some place to go! It's located about 10 minutes from Knoxville and about an hour from Dollywood and Gatlinburg. There are tons of malls, restaurants, and other fun activities such as The Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum. The local attitude towards the students is great. Everyone is super friendly and understanding."
Senior,4,"I have never taken an official online class with Crown.  However, during the pandemic, Crown's transition from in class to online was very impressive.  The college still provided a way to get ahold of professors while students had questions about homework.  This online learning experience was good however, being in class with friends makes the learning atmosphere better."
Sophomore,4,Crown College has a great online program. Although not all of your classmates will be super dedicated for the most part the professors are involved and caring.
Senior,4,"A close-knit community of students and staff form a welcoming environment to study, socialize, and work in. The years I have spent here are some of the best in my life. While studies might be challenging at times, the friends I have made, and the professors I learn from are there to help."
Sophomore,4,"Great Christian School.
For those who are looking to attend a small college, that has a good community of believers, Crown is for you!"
Freshman,4,"I like Crown College because of the community and the professors. The people here, including the professors, are so welcoming and caring. The professors here at Crown genuinely care about their students and their walk with Christ. The number of people here is just right, not too big or too small."
Alum,4,Crown has gotten better over the years the classes where a good  size and the Profs worked well with their students. I think that they need to work on their diversity and openness but overall a Great Christ centered Education.
Sophomore,4,I like the Christian environment and the acceptance of the students by other students. The staff seem disorganized and uncommunicative at times but the unique experience outweighs the negative aspects. The availability of scholarships and financial aid is not up to standard either. The Professors seem to have an interest in the students and a true desire to see them succeed.
Senior,4,"Crown College is a Christian school that holds its students to a high academic standard. It is expensive, but the quality of education is reflected in the price."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy attending the school. The area is an awesome. The professors are all students friendly and work hard to help each student achieve their goal of getting a college degree.
Junior,4,"The close-knit, family-style community made an easy transition from high school to college. The professors are always ready to help you learn, not just get a good grade. What Crown lacks in affordability, spirit, and general apathy it makes up in community. You'll find a home here."
Junior,4,"I love how closely knit the community is and how the professors genuinely care about their students and seeing them succeeding, not only in class, but in life. One of the things that I am not a fan of is, the building is a little out-dated, but that is to be expected for such an inexpensive private school."
Freshman,4,Small school gives a good ratio of teachers to students in classes and teachers are truly invested in their students' success
Senior,4,"I like how great the professors are and how engaging they are in the classroom. My time at Crown has been full of professors that care about me and how I am doing in and outside of the classroom. The topics that are discussed in class are intentional and prepare you for the career you are studying for. There is always some free event happening over the weekends on campus. There are multiply sports that students can be a part of. The entire campus is beautiful. Throughout the fall and spring, the grounds are maintained and encouraged to be explored."
Alum,4,I love Crown in that it is a Christ-centered Christian Bible School. The professors are wonderful and the people are very nice.
Senior,4,Community is great. Teachers are very involved. Open door policy is great. Lots of opportunities for hands on experience.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The teachers are very invested in the students, even beyond the class. They take great interest in how the students are doing in their everyday life."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Being in the location that we are in, there isn't much of a danger of people sneaking in when they aren't supposed to be here. In my time at Crown, I never felt unsafe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I love this place. I invested a lot of time and money into Crown, and I loved every minute and I value every cent spent. I will always look back at this experience as one of my most cherished periods of my life.

It is something different. And for me, it's home."
College Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my time at Crown College because it is a great environment. The students and faculty are very welcoming and kind people. It is a joy to go to school everyday.
College Junior,4,I really love the online program in psychology/counseling. I love how the school sees me as a student and not just a number. The textbooks are incredibly insightful for my major. I attended many schools before this and they took all of my credits which I am so grateful for. I am looking to grow in my faith and myself and I believe Crown is perfect for me.
College Senior,4,I love the professors passion for people. They are some of the most caring individuals I have ever met. I am in a place where I am loved and cared for. This college is a great community for a Christian to grown and thrive.
College Senior,4,"I think in the area of career opportunities, marketing to students can be improved. Social media is promoted and job opportunities are online."
College Senior,4,"I love Crown College. It is a great place to meet friends and to prepare to be a member of society. I am involved on campus and will be an active alum. If given the chance to come here, I would major in business rather than communications. Overall, I like Crown."
College Senior,4,"Crown College is a great school to go for sports involvement and missions work. It is mediocre for nursing, business, & teaching. Academically easy not super challenging. If you are looking to be challenged academically go to a state school or public university. Community is close-knit and caring. Warmth and Christian values and ethics are strong. Good chapels and good opportunities to volunteer in community outreach and churches. Great place for students training to be in the ministry. In terms of preparedness for the real world, not a strong suit. Could emphasis better real life skills such as job preparedness and less emphasis on looking ""Christian."" Overall I give Crown College 4/5 stars."
College Sophomore,4,"Crown College is a very safe campus. Located in St. Boni which is a small town, not a lot happens on campus. I do not hear of safety problems on campus. I feel safe in almost every spot on campus at almost any point in the day."
College Sophomore,4,Many students who graduate from Crown College do not have a hard time finding a job after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus at Crown College is nice. They offer a few different housing options all with different perks. Crown allows you to only live off campus if your are over 22 or married. This is not ideal for most students, but its okay. Crown does need to update a lot of their housing facilities. They are starting to get old and run-down. They are all close to classes and it makes it easy to get to the main building."
College Student,4,"It is one of the best Bible colleges out there right up with Bob Jones University, West Coast Bible College, and Hyles-Anderson College. We have missionaries visit us all of the time and we also have pastors visit us as well."
College Student,4,"I get along with all of the professors and so does everyone else. The quality of it all is just fantastic I love the classes and the professors as well. The variety of the courses are missions, pastoral, music, education, etc. We are based on Christ and that is our center here."
College Student,4,"My overall experience here at Crown College of the Bible is pretty wonderful, I am truly excited and relieved to say that the students and faculty here have made this place amazing and just like home for me. I love how the Lord works through the students here and the school itself. My favorite experiences would have to include the Valentine's Banquet that we had last week and just the program that I am working on is amazing as well! Many schools in the U.S. are not centered around Christ and I definitely would choose this school over again."
College Sophomore,4,Alumni are getting jobs either overseas or in their home towns.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is great and convenient to all students,"
College Sophomore,4,I am very challenged my self as I started because I am dealing with real stuff.
College Junior,4,"Very caring, and nice professors. Easy classes with adequate homework assignments. Love my school, would go back again because I really enjoy all of my classes and professors."
College Junior,4,I feel confident that this school will be a great asset to my success in the future
College Sophomore,4,Safty is first and they do care about our health.
College Sophomore,4,Good school that doesn't look at you as a number
College Sophomore,4,It is very good. New updates made girls rooms much pleasant are the room are close to the classrooms.
College Sophomore,4,Good teachers who care about you and the Nursing department is super helpful in helping anybody pass and make it through.
College Freshman,4,"Crown College is a private christian school, which I didn't care when I was looking, but I'm glad I chose it now. It is also highly praised for its Nursing Program, which is my major. I'm very excited to learn. It also has a vitamin D room. I can basically be warm all winter if I wanted!"
College Sophomore,4,LOVE Crown and all it has to offer.
College Junior,4,"Our school has rules, but very few unreasonable ones from my perspective. Any unreasonable ones (like wearing closed toed shoes to class) are not widely know and never enforced."
College Junior,4,"I did not apply, but I know many of the people in the office. It is a small school, so they will work with you. They actually care about individual students."
College Junior,4,"This is a Christian college. Okay, that is settled. 

That does NOT mean we don't have fun. It just means we might not have what you personally want (that is, if you want drugs and alcohol). We have lots of fun events (like when professors dress in disguises and hide all over the Mall of America). We have sporting events. We have many clubs. We have fun volunteering opportunities. It is a small school, so you can almost always find a friend to hang out it."
College Junior,4,Living on campus is wonderful. Everyone at the school really cares for you. The thing that means the most to me is relationships with professors. I frequently (probably once every other week) have a 30 min conversation with a professor. I talk to professors for 10 minutes at least once a week. They actually care for you.
College Freshman,4,"Like I mentioned before they are very strict, which provides safety, cleanliness, and builds character. However, some of the rules are pretty ridiculous and most of the students resent them and some even secretly break them just because they don't see anything wrong with whatever the rule is about."
College Freshman,4,The sports teams are very close-knit and have many die-hard fans. Game days are always fun and full of spirit!
College Sophomore,4,Many people who graduate have opportunities to work for the school in one way or another.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are the real reason why students attend. You just know you are going to be challenged and be taken to the next level in your academic career.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics are the best except for the athletic center. Coaches, teammates, and fan support are more than you could ask for. If it wasn't for the athletic center being so small it would be one of the best."
College Sophomore,4,"Every single part of the campus is great, except for the athletic center which is very small and not where it needs to be."
College Sophomore,4,I have not had an internship yet but I am not worried the business department really cares for each individual and wants to see them succeed.
College Sophomore,4,The business program is incredible. Everyone respects the professors and knows they are going to be challenged.
College Junior,4,"I'm just taking generals now, I apply for nursing school in the spring of 15. No concerns of finding a job in the healthcare."
College Freshman,4,The school makes it easy to help you pay for your education.
College Freshman,4,Student involvement is great within the athletics. Many people come and watch while the rest go to participate. Fan support is good. Athletic facilities are very nice but are in the process of going to be remodeled.
College Freshman,4,"Every aspect is pretty diverse except religion because everyone has a faith is Jesus Christ. We have international students, students of different color, different political beliefs, etc."
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of diversity to dive into and experience new things!
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of different dining choices, however the on-campus dining hall is not the greatest with variety."
College Sophomore,4,"I generally feel very safe on campus. People on campus are typically honest and are not likely to steal  your things or harass you in any way. Health services are okay. If they don't live up to your expectations, there are plenty of hospitals in the surrounding area, including a 24/7 urgent care facility."
College Freshman,2,Sporting events are fun to attend
College Sophomore,2,"This school is diverse in political beliefs, and economic backgrounds but it is not diverse at all in ethnic/racial diversity nor sexual orientation. It is conservative but free enough to talk about everything."
College Junior,2,"I don't like how much time the actual classes take. I wish the clinicals would be a couple weeks long, rather than alllllll semester long, so there is a work/school balance for those that need an income. Also, there is too much busy work involved so there isn't adequate time to read the coursework. I have a lot of anxiety even thinking about next semester and if I'm going to make it with my course load. I think it could be organized better."
College Junior,2,"Not much flexibility for dining hours, food is getting better, but still not very good"
College Junior,2,"The people in the local town are very nice, but there is absolutely nothing to do. Rural college just outside a small town"
College Junior,2,"If you don't have a car on campus, the only way to get anywhere is to borrow a friends car"
College Student,2,"The worst part of Minnesota is also one of the best parts. Winter!! so much snow and cold, yet it is so beautiful too."
College Senior,2,The school is kinda isolated so its important to have access to a car of your own or a friends car you can borrow.
College Senior,2,THe nightlife at my school is pretty slow. There are alot of country bars and family restuarants in the area. Most of the time people have to go into minneapolis to go to the clubs or bars which can cause problems with driving. But once your in minneapolis its a ton of fun and alot of options to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,There is none.  There is an honor's society and these students are respected and admired.
College Sophomore,2,Music Majors Are Judgmental â€“ The music majors have a tendency to be very snobish and unwelcoming. The staff is wonderful though. it takes more time commitment than other major and it is a lot of work but the music program is well balanced. they do not have a full performance degree and that needs to change.
College Sophomore,2,There is a major lack of scholarships. Music scholarships could be more inclusive and less about favoritism.
College Freshman,2,"There is no ""nightlife"" that most people think of when they hear that word. We don't go partying or to clubs. We just hang out with friends and maybe study. We invent our own sober fun."
College Senior,2,Must Live on Campus â€“ You're not allowed to live off campus unless you're 21. There aren't many people who live off campus and as far as I know there aren't many off campus options for students. The 2 towns nearby are really small and there isn't a whole lot of available housing.
College Senior,2,"Bad Wifi â€“ The wifi on campus here is awful, especially in the library where is SHOULD be the strongest. Going online is a hassle. There's a nice Mac lab in the basement, but it's reserved for certain classes most of the time. The computers in our library and regular computer lab are, for the most part, pretty old. We aren't allowed to have our own computers (aside from laptops) and a personal printer is a great thing to have. There are only 2 printers on campus and they're most crowded in the mornings. They're also used by both students and teachers."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much, however I do like the cafe options, Cafeteria options, and coffee shoppe options."
Senior,1,"(2/2)
There are a few genuine people here, but for the most part, I see a ton of fakeness. Pretty disappointing for a college that constantly brags about how uplifting and genuine they are. 
Spiritual development here doesnâ€™t come from the school; it comes from the student who is desperately searching for a hope of something better. 
This place has drained my bank account and my will to live. Donâ€™t go here if you value your sanity."
Senior,1,"(1/2)
I could write a 40 page paper on how much I hate this institution. The professors love to pretend that they care when they really aren't understanding of students at all. Nearly every staff member that I have talked to has been grumpy and unwilling to help me. 
Crown loves to advertise how open and friendly they are, but that's a lie. They only are friendly to the people that they decide are worthy of their time. They have created a sort of bubble too, where nearly every single chapel speaker is an alum. 
The food is terrible and the hours there are not created to work with someone who has a busy schedule (in other words, someone who has a real off-campus job and is gone during their open hours). The housing situation is also awful, as I have had to live through infestations of ants and other parasites, ginormous sheets of mold on the walls and a broken everything."
Senior,1,"Their administrative staff is terrible. They will wait until two weeks before your bill is due to inform you that you must complete more paperwork, somethat may require more than two weeks, before you are even told how much financial aid you will get. I am a senior and I don't know how much I'll owe because they decided that I need my dad's tax transcript, the same one we sent last year. This college is more of a hassle than it's worth."
Sophomore,1,"No sense of community if you are a commuter. If you plan to commute you had better be a perky extrovert so that you might develop some friendships otherwise plan to have a very lonely 4 years. I've been here 2 years as a commuter and have yet to make any real friends or be invited to any social events. The couple of social events I went to I sat uncomfortably alone and felt very awkward. Other than the occasional ""Hi"" in the hallways, I'm pretty excluded and lonely."
College Senior,1,It is non-existent. I do not know if we have ever had Greek life. If you are looking to get into a frat sorority Crown College is not the place to go.

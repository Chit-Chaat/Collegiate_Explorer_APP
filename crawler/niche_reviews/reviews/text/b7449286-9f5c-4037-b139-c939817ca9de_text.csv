Niche User,5,"Pacific offers an online Bachelor Health Science program for the working adults. 
 Which I am currently taking.  It's not easy being a full time parent and working full time all while trying to make it to campus for school.  Pacific makes it easy to earn my degree and still maintain my life outside of school.  
I am able to study from work on my breaks and at home early mornings or late nights and weekends.  I am extremely grateful for their program."
Niche User,5,"What draws me towards Pacific University is it's diverse population, interdisciplinary campus working alongside graduate students. Being able to learn from faculty who care about our success."
Alum,5,"The best part about Pacific University is the community of students and professors. Everyone works together in order to achieve the best results. The professors are interested and invested in students success, this make learning easier and fun. I enjoyed the small campus too."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Pacific has been incredible in some aspects and not so incredible in other aspects. I am a member of the Women's Soccer team and the coaching staff and my team members have been very cliquey and very judgmental, however things have been getting better and I feel more united with my teammates but it isn't quite there yet. Regardless of the negative experience, my knowledge for the game has increased and I have gotten stronger and smarter. My greater experiences come from friendships I've made and the music department. I am part of the symphonic band and it's broaden my musical experience. I also take voice and flute lessons and have started teaching flute lessons as well. It's interesting always being a student and being a teacher in someone's perspective, it gives me hope for my future."
Freshman,5,I love the community and the endless support that is given to everyone. Professors are always welcoming and the school is constantly adding in more courses to fulfill students' desires if not already offered. I am very pleased with the school's 3+3 program for pharmacy and many other health careers. Always providing study abroad for everyone especially opening an opportunity for STEM major students to study abroad even if it's just 2 weeks to a whole semester.
Freshman,5,"Iâ€™ve only been here for a week so far but Pacific has done a great job of setting up activities for kids to get to know one another, the professors all seem to really care about the students and it seems like a close knit community."
Junior,5,I transferred here after dropping out of my first university and losing faith in the education system. Every experience I have had here at Pacific has been an amazing one and my life is so much better after coming here.
Freshman,5,The faculty is incredible kind and helpful. It is always a pleasant experience to ask questions because I know they will answer tem quickly and accurately.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved everything, from the close community of my sports teams, to my classes, and to clubs that I have joined. Everybody is extremely nice and this school has the best professors you could ask for"
Freshman,5,"Lovely people, even better education. The environment is amazing. It is quite the good time whenever on campus."
Alum,5,"Love the small community, class size, and individual attention from professors.
At Pacific you're more than just a number, but an individual with the freedom to learn, explore, and experience everything college has to offer."
Sophomore,5,"Pacific University has such a great environment to explore yourself as an individual all while preparing their students for the ""real world""."
Freshman,5,"I just entered into this school and I'm already excited to see what I'm about to get into. They have so many opportunities for students to grow and mature. Not to mention it isn't far from me so, it's a win-win."
Freshman,5,My first year at Pacific University was a great college experience. The professors here were all very helpful and the campus has a lot to offer in terms on-campus activities.
Freshman,5,"Love the students, the music program and the location. It's a small school in a small town where everybody knows everybody else. My professors know me by my name and are always eager to help out because above all the professors care about their students' learning and are passionate about their jobs."
Junior,5,I like that much of the classes are smaller and that you get to know your professors very well. You get to know your peers very well as well as it is a smaller campus.
Alum,5,"Pacific University is a phenomenal school . The professors are all experts at their classes and are always available to help students both in their studies and in life. They REALLY care. There's plenty of job opportunities and their career development program is an excellent resource for both current students and Alumni. The school is located in the cutest small town. Their outdoor program was my favorite part of my experience there. The cost of the school is a bit high however, there are many opportunities for financial support."
Junior,5,"This school has been the best school I have been too so far, all of the professors are super engaged and they want to see you succeed. They make you feel like you can ask any questions and no question is a dumb question."
Junior,5,"Very clean, beautiful school with a great reputation! The school offers many health field degrees and most which you must learn a second language for. The faculty are great and very easy to get in touch with when you have a question. When you are accepted they even give you a checklist of things to do before the program starts."
Niche User,5,Pacific University has a very friendly college town vibe. All the staff there is extremely friendly and are there to help you with every step towards your degree.
Freshman,5,"While visiting, the staff was exceptionally helpful and kind. The campus is small yet beautiful, and the class sizes are small as well. Every staff member that I have contacted through email has been eager to answer my questions."
Graduate Student,5,Great Instructors and great staff. Pacific is an excellent school and the MFA in Creative Writing is an excellent program.
Graduate Student,5,The faculty and staff here are dedicated to student success. They work within the community to provide unique opportunities from students to both grow and serve.
Niche User,5,"This is one of the best schools, offering some of the most diverse communities and classes. The school is small yet very comforting. The support group and councilors respond almost immediately with the most up to date information."
Senior,5,"I have loved my time at Pacific University. I was able to succeed in academics and athletics. I have been very busy, but the professors are amazing in the way they work with their students and get to know them. If I could change anything it would be school spirit. We need more students participating in events! Other than that I love it and would highly recommend."
Freshman,5,I love Pacific University. The small campus really inspires a friendly and supportive community. There is something for practically anyone here. Plus the campus is absolutely beautiful! I have met some of my best friends here and I wouldn't trade that for the world. I feel that I am learning a lot here and my mind is constantly expanding. It's marvelous!
Freshman,5,I really like the atmosphere at Pacific. Professors want to help you succeed and everyone there is there to learn and work hard.
Alum,5,Pacific University has a very diverse student population and a lot of students from Hawaii. I loved being apart of NHOH and enjoyed luau every year. The small campus helped me be close with my classmates and my professors.
Freshman,5,"I love the experience I have had so far at Pacific. The academics are excellent, the people are friendly, and the environment is  immersive. I participated in new activities, and became a brighter version of myself."
Sophomore,5,I think Pacific is a great school and it has such a diverse student body. The professors love their jobs and they make it really easy to get study help whenever needed. Pacific University creates an amazing study environment and friends can be made by doing almost anything on campus!
Niche User,5,"I loved the size of the school, it was very small so you knew everyone and they all were very welcoming."
Sophomore,5,Pacific is a fantastic college with a desire to inspire their students and make a difference in the world.
Senior,5,"I love Pacific. I came here as a first gen having no idea what to do or what I was getting myself into. From the moment I got to campus, I haven't regretted my decision. The passion of the students and faculty really connected me to the campus culture, and opened my eyes to social, political, and civic engagement arenas that I hadn't been aware of before. The professors really care about getting to know their students, and I feel close to all of the professors I have chosen to engage with. While some things aren't perfect (Aramark and Forest Grove as a whole come to mind) I wouldn't trade my experience at Pacific for anything. "
College Sophomore,5,The campus wellness person (Kathleen) is the best!
College Freshman,5,"My school, Pacific University, is very diverse in culture but is an overall friendly environment where everyone feels safe.  Pacific offers many programs, and the professors make sure that you understand the topic, and really make time for you if you have any questions.  The unique and friendly environment is the biggest reason on why this small and diverse school is the best."
College Sophomore,5,Being on campus is so much fun and there are so many classes to take and the professors all love what they do and are passionate about teaching.
College Sophomore,5,"There is that typical small school atmosphere, everyone knows everyone and everyone is involved in at least 4 different clubs or activities. Everyone is friendly and all your professors know you by name by the end of the first week of classes. Class sizes are also small ranging from 10 to 30 max and it's really easy to get help from professors outside of class."
College Freshman,5,great athletics facilities and programs
College Junior,5,I always feel safe walking across the campus at night. It is well lit and security is very close if needed.
College Junior,5,"Professors are great. Intro classes can be large, but as it gets more specialized, the classes get smaller."
College Junior,5,The accommodation is awesome. Provides everything you need in our own space.
College Junior,5,Pacific is wonderful. Everyone is very inclusive and the professors do everything they can to help you out.
Recent Alumnus,5,"good professors registration can be hard but usually you can get the classes you need, classes are tough but manageable"
College Freshman,5,Professors all care about individual students.
College Freshman,5,Pacific has a lot of connections and cares about heir students individual success
College Senior,5,"Pacific is the best community I've ever been a part of. It is so easy to get involved (actually, it's really hard NOT to get involved... it just sort of happens) and the vast majority of students are hardworking, care about their education, and make the experience really great. I would absolutely choose Pacific again. The only thing I would say isn't the very best thing ever is the cost. Otherwise, the professors are amazing, and you get an actual real relationship with the professors here because of how small the school is. I don't love Forest Grove itself, but the town really loves Pacific, and the surrounding businesses have a lot of discounts for us."
Recent Alumnus,5,Career Development Center staff are hardworking and friendly
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved my professors and my courses.
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved living on campus and they continue to update
Recent Alumnus,5,I love my professors and had a wonderful time at Pacific.
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved being an athlete at Pacific.
College Freshman,5,Our school is amazing with staff and students. All of the work study students are always willing to help and recruiters want to make sure that every student is enjoying school and meeting lots of new friends. Pacific University is a dream come true.
College Freshman,5,The professors at Pacific University are always dedicated to their students success. I had a professor tell us that he would meet us at three in the morning if we needed help and that was the only time we could get it. They want us to learn the most in their class and enjoy it while working hard. All of my professors have been extremely thoughtful and dedicated to their job.
College Freshman,5,Campus Police do their job very well and they are very kind. If there is a problem CPS will address it as soon as possible and try to accomodate each party while enforcing the rules.
College Junior,5,"I am amazed at how many options Pacific students have off campus. Many of the shops offer student discounts as well. You get a lot of bang for your buck, which is great for a college student budget. Some of the options include Pizza Shmizza, Maggie's Buns, a little Thai restaurant, FG sushi, Domino's, some Mexican and Chinese restaurants, a McDonalds and a Jack in the Box are also fairly close. Plus, we have a Starbucks on campus and a Dutch Bro's off campus. I know that at least two of these places will deliver straight to your dorms."
College Junior,5,"The reason I chose Pacific was because of the financial aid options. They have academic and merit based scholarships, the scholarship competition, and even need-based. The financial aid office staff are very helpful and willing to meet with students to suggest scholarships and other forms of funding available to them."
College Sophomore,5,"In my experience, I have never seen so many different places that you could go to straight from campus. You have Pizza Schmizza, Taqueria Corona, The King's Head Pub, and so many other great places."
College Freshman,5,There are so many different options for food as far as cultures go. There is a Thai restaurant right outside of one of the dorm halls and there are pizza places right next to sushi places etc..
College Junior,5,"With a small program like Pacific's Woodburn MAT program, it is likely you will receive the large scholarship currently offered to all students accepted into the program. There was only a short (~ one page) essay in addition to the standard application."
College Junior,5,"I love the advisors at Pacific University. I attended a different university during my undergraduate program and never even met with an advisor once. Before I even began my program at Pacific I had met with advisors multiple times in order to plan out my goals and direct plan. They are supportive, encouraging, and always available. Honestly, the support from the advisors was the main reason I chose to attend Pacific University. The path to your Master's degree is a long and demanding one but it doesn't have to be lonely and that's what the advisors are there for, to lift you up in your failures and to celebrate in your victories with you."
Niche User,4,You will love this exciting environment. Thereâ€™s love at every corner and everyone is there for one another.
Junior,4,Everyone is still very much adapting to the whole online-thing. But professes have handed it well and are extending a lot of patience and assistance. The transition was rough but every week gets better. It is notably harder to keep track of everything though.
Junior,4,"The professors are amazing and they have given me SO many opportunities to do research and learn beyond the classroom. They go above and beyond. The university is also pretty good about scholarships but that being said, the are really expensive. I think that if their tuition was more affordable and the admin (specifically at the top) was less bureaucratic and political, they would be the literal perfect school."
Alum,4,the professors are always ready and eager to help. The professors i had were some of the best teachers i have had in my time as a student. The enviornment in campus always allows and makes questions feel welcomed and there is always a way to find help. whether it is contacting a professor or fellow classmate or singing up for tutoring session in specifc classes. The small campus in Pacific allows for good teacher-student relationships.
Alum,4,the enviornment in campus is always very welcoming i enjoyed my time here as a student though i had many unfortunate headaches with finicial aid.
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of the campus and faculty. The faculty truly care about each one of our successes and helps where they can! I really can't think of anything major I would want to see changed.
Freshman,4,"Due to the coronavirus, all classes were promptly moved to an online format and the professors were very helpful in making sure that students had the materials they needed to succeed in the class for the remaining semester."
Alum,4,With the covid-19 situation half of my spring semester was online and I thought that it was as good as it could have been. I enjoyed that I could learn at my own pace and professors were there to help.
Alum,4,"Pacific University is far from perfect. It could improve on food, administration, and communication between the students, but itÊ»s the people and the friends at Pacific that made it worth while. I loved that the class sizes were small so I was able to get to know my professors well and it overall improved my learning."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my professor, but online classes are really not for me. But other than that the professor was easy to reach and she laid everything perfectly. Everything was pretty self-explanatory. She was also very understanding of any issues someone might have or have been going through."
Sophomore,4,"I love having small classes. It is easier to focus, as questions, and as well as create a great bond with your professor. Professors here are understanding and worry about as a whole. There are a lot of resources on campus. The only things I'm okay with, but wish could be better is the food at the University Center (aka UC) could be better and the dorms are okay. The dorms have their pros and cons. Overall I love the campus and the teachers"
Sophomore,4,"Though there is some lack in school spirit, they have great facilities as well as a diverse campus. Some of the school spirit aspects are fairly good, but I do think some of the sports don't get as much recognition as they should, like tennis or golf. Both the staff and the students are very friendly and easy to talk to. Most of the professors there make sure the students are okay with their daily lives, especially those who aren't from the area and had to move from other states or countries. The groups and clubs on campus are very open to taking new members that it feels like when you step onto campus, you're being welcomed with open arms from a new family. The school lacks in the party scenes, but personally, I think it's because the school is very close by to a police station. The safety of the students and the campus is quite amazing as the school is located in a very quite and non-sketchy neighborhood. Plus, the campus security is filled with amazing people and keep us safe."
Sophomore,4,"Personally, I wasn't too big of a fan with switching to online school, as I've never done it before. But I still managed to maintain my grades keep a steady school life with the adjustment. It wasn't as difficult as I had expected because most of my classes had previously uploaded their lectures online instead of using zoom, so it was easier to study as the lectures were at the tip of our fingers."
Freshman,4,"So far, I love it at Pacific! The campus is pretty laid back and I love that none of my classes are more than a 10 minute walk away. Pacific is a small university and that comes with benefits and downfalls. I love the course options and I always feel like the professors really want to be there and want for you to succeed. I wish we were a more environmentally conscious and that money was distributed differently, but overall I have been very happy at Pacific!"
Freshman,4,"I have been attending Pacific University for a little less than a year. This school has been wonderful to me! But it is expensive, the scholarships do help cut the cost a decent amount and there are financial opportunities to help make the school more affordable. The quality of education is outstanding, the classes are challenging, the professors and the school provide great tools for learning. For a small school the student life is quite active, there are many ways to keep busy and entertain oneself other than with schoolwork. The school is aesthetically pleasing and generally well maintained especially with some of the older buildings on campus. The opportunities I found or am finding at Pacific are preparing me for the next milestone in my life which is to start my career. This is the right place to find chances to grow and to find my future."
Freshman,4,Even though this university is very expensive it is very worth it for their small class sizes. It also has a beautiful campus that is not too large. This gives excellent opportunities for connecting with your professors.
Alum,4,I loved the academic aspect of the university. The academics at this school are no joke. The classes are very rigorous and challenging. The professors are incredibly supportive but aren't afraid to challenge their students academically. The only thing I didn't enjoy about this school was its lack of diversity.
Senior,4,"It's too expensive for the quality and services provided. The professors are incredible and the classes are usually very rewarding. However, the food is horrible, especially for the price. Housing has been great for me for all but one year so far. It's often very safe and has a great wellness center."
Freshman,4,"I haven't gone yet, but I have been blown away by the support and communication from the professors. I have an email chain of about 50 messages with one professor, and he has been nothing but kind and helpful. Another professor called me on the phone to help with my schedule and give me a greater understanding of the classes I'm taking."
Graduate Student,4,"I am lucky in that my experience with Pacific had been a relatively smooth ride, although I am not entirely sure that is true for other student attending my program. However, solely based on my first hand experiences, faculty and staff have been gracious, helpful, and understanding through the difficult process of graduate school."
Sophomore,4,"Pacific University is very much an academic-based school. the professors are amazing, they want to teach you all they know about whichever subject that they are passionate about. the campus is also amazing. campus security does a great job making all students feel safe whether it's early in the morning or in the middle of the night. they are always there for you."
Senior,4,"My overall experience at Pacific has been very good. Professors sincerely care about their teaching and students, and the campus environment is quite supportive and friendly. Most issues come from administrative decisions and a lack of communication with the student senate/body about issues that directly affect us. Absolutely nobody likes the university president, and for decent reason."
Sophomore,4,"Was not originally my first choice for college but they definitely won me over. I love the weather, rainy and cool with scattered sunny days. I love the town, campus is literally right in the middle of downtown, meaning farmer's markets right on the edge of campus, several restaurants, a small movie theater, shops, pubs, coffee, and a fun walking area. The best part: student discounts! The campus itself is very nice, lots of trees, places to hang out, and you can get to class in five minutes. There are old and new buildings, including dorms and classrooms, but everything is kept up very well. I havenâ€™t encountered a professor I didn't like, as everyone is eager for you to succeed. I changed my major this year and my old adviser was supportive, helping me reach out and meet people in my new field. I found it easy to make a lot of friends too, so no worries about finding a social life. Itâ€™s a great choice for someone looking for a smaller school where they will definitely stand out."
Graduate Student,4,The community and acceptance are very good. The professors actually care about their students and provide plenty of office hours and help if the students need it. The community is very close-knit and it is easy to find a group to fit in with
Freshman,4,Pacific University is a very inviting private university. The campus is small and feels very safe compared to other bigger colleges. The campus safety is very away and always there to help when in need. The music program is also very good and the orchestra is great to play in. The dorms are a little old but the apartments up for raffle (based on credits) are new and very good to live in. The classrooms are a medium size and the professors are also good.
Freshman,4,"Pacific University is a great place to meet friends, try new things and continue your education. It's a beautiful place and the professors are really here to help and they really make it worth the money to get the education"
Freshman,4,I am a freshman this year. I appreciate  the quality of my education. The class sizes are small and we're very important part of my decision for attending this school. I have made good friends and look forward to the next few years.
Freshman,4,The professors are very good and since it is a small school you get to know them on a more personal level. Everyone on campus is very friendly. The food is not the best though.
Niche User,4,"I am about to go tour the college. I hope it is as amazing as it looks. I have done extensive research on their academic programs and athletic programs, and they look top notch."
Alum,4,"Pacific University gave me everything I would expect from a liberal arts college. I was able to delve into many different types and topics of classes. The tuition is expensive, but necessary to invest in the future."
Freshman,4,Pacific University was a really nice fit for me as an out of state student coming from California. I loved how everyone seemed to care about who you are. We don't value sports over academics. The teachers are great and the engineering program is awesome.
Freshman,4,"I liked the small classes and the requirements for science courses. The small classes allow you to build close, but professional, relationships with your professors, if you want. This can help you in the future when you need letters of recommendation, advice about school and life, and just someone to talk to. 
I would like to see an improvement of the cafeteria food. Eating the same food every day gets tiring and makes you sick of it after awhile. Sometimes, my friends and I don't eat there, because of that, or there's no good food that we like. And trust me, at least two of us will eat a variety of foods and aren't that picky."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, my impression of Pacific University is that they are dedicated to their students and provide an affordable opportunity for a quality educational investment."
Freshman,4,The class sizes are smaller on average allowing closer relationships with professors and even a better learning environment who do better in small groups of people.
Freshman,4,The professors are all really great and super willing to work with you! The class sizes are a lot smaller than public universities so that's also a huge upside. My biggest thing is the requirements to graduate. They're kinda difficult to meet if you are a science or math major.
Junior,4,"I love how invested the professors are in the success of their students. We all know how crazy their schedules are, yet they never hesitate to reach out to us or help us."
Freshman,4,I love the size of Pacific because you really get to know everyone around you. The class sizes are fairly small which allows for great learning opportunities.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman here at Pacific and so far I love it here. The start was a little rocky, our freshman welcome involved a long meet and greet on a very hot football turf in the direct sun but after that it has been really good. My teachers are all very nice and friendly the only problems I have had have been with my chemistry class because of the multiple sites and types of homework we are required to do."
Senior,4,Overall Pacific has definitely helped me through my journey towards my degree. The professors do a great job in making sure you understand all the material that is given. 
College Sophomore,4,"I had a hiccup my first semester here, but the support I got was very helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"All four residence halls for new students are right in the center of campus, making it an easy walk to all classes/dining options."
College Sophomore,4,"There aren't any Greek residence halls or houses on campus, but fraternities and sororities do exist. There's one lounge set aside for Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,"From the moment I first set foot on campus, I felt at home. Each of the advisors, student leaders, professors, and misc. staff really helped me feel comfortable. This school is big enough to have something for everyone, but small enough for you to still feel like you're an individual."
College Senior,4,I should be able to find a decent job after graduation.
College Senior,4,I love the school I just wish it didn't cost so much.
College Senior,4,I like it a lot though it's a little small sometimes.
College Senior,4,There is a lot of Boxer school spirit at Pacific.
College Senior,4,"Pacific is unique in its connections for Student Teaching, and for job searches post graduation."
College Sophomore,4,The alumni are all still really involved in campus and the community.
College Sophomore,4,"The rooms are small, but there are lots of common areas to congregate and hang out with people and there are always activities being put on by the RA's to get you out of your room. It's really easy to get to know people by living on campus and it is fun."
College Sophomore,4,"Going to football games has the same feeling as going to a high school football game, but with older kids. It's still fun though and everyone comes out to watch the intramural sports as well. Staying active on campus is encouraged and easy to accomplish."
College Sophomore,4,Pacific is great school that offers many opportunities. The faculty and staff are invested in our education and our success. The one thing I have issues with would probably be the food served at our campus center.
College Freshman,4,The location as well as the university both leave chances for interships
College Freshman,4,health and safety services are fine
College Freshman,4,Our facilities are great for a Division III school.
College Freshman,4,The food is very poor
College Freshman,4,They focus a lot on community service
College Freshman,4,So far I love the academics at my school.
College Senior,4,"Our Campus Public Safety officers are really great. There are a few places on campus that get kind of dark at night/aren't super well lit, and a CPS officer will walk you to your car or res hall if you feel uncomfortable. Our Wellness Center is super proactive with preventative measures against assault and relationship violence."
College Senior,4,"I was an RA for two years, so I'm a little biased about housing/res life. The best halls are upperclassman halls (Burlingham, Gilbert, and Vandervelden) on the north side. But I know plenty of sophomores that were able to get onto north side. Our freshman/underclassman halls are still fine, they're just a lot older and could use some updating. Hall community is really important to Pacific, so we're always doing programs and hall improvements to make it the best that it can be. The RAs are really related and genuinely care about what they do."
Alum,2,"Some teachers were great. The Dean does things that do not make sense. The food was bad my senior year. Also, information was misplaced so getting into graduate school was difficult."
Freshman,2,I came to Pacific University my freshman year to escape the cold midwest. That part of my hopes came true but for a high price. The tuition here is too high for just a pretty campus. You could get an equal education at half the price with way less of the weird people at a lot of other colleges.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I only give this specific rating versus ""it's the worse"", due to the school spirit of the students and staff of this school. Some of the school teams are not the best, but people of the Pacific community are very supportive of the varsity teams, which bumps up the athletics ratings for Pacific. However the athletic facilities of this university is astonishing. Half of the equipment in the exercise room is broken and a quarter of the ""functioning"" machines would be considered a safety hazard in a standard gym. It is really terrifying since many students do not have an idea on  what they are doing when it comes to lifting weights. I knew five different cases of people receiving ring worm from the gym's carpet since many people stretch and do core exercises on it. There have been cases of pink eye. What blows many people's minds is the fact that the student population keeps growing and no new investments are put into the student athletic facility to accommodate to the increasing rate of the student population. For how much prestige this university has on its health professions programs, it would make sense for the school to put some money to refurbish the facility."
College Freshman,2,The menu of the University Center has no variety and the way the food is cooked is unsanitary and unhealthy. There is hardly any taste in the food sometimes and other times we need to look for flies and hair in our soup. Sometimes we even have rotten produce being served to us. There needs to be more variety of restaurants on campus or restaurants that take flex dollars.
College Sophomore,2,"There are more people wanting Forest Grove apartments than there are apartments. Trying to find a place with some friends is difficult, especially when no one wants to pay all those app fees. I'm actually just going to try and find a one bedroom, utilities included, situation and call it good. Prices are high for this kind of area, similar to outer Portland prices because of the high demand and low availability, people can jack up the prices. No off-campus, University owned housing. No help from the school other than a one page pdf with names and numbers of apartment complexes - all of which are unavailable with mostly low-income families or other students. Everything by Pacific is close to public transport so that's a bonus."
College Sophomore,2,"Our school just built a brand new residence hall, which is great besides the fact that the rooms are small and were built to get us out of our rooms, regardless of the fact that we are paying to be in them, and that the one perk that was supposed to be above the other dorm rooms, the controllable AC/Heat units, don't actually work. The oldest hall is supposed to be knocked down because it's old, falling apart, and potentially dangerous, but instead they are remolding the worst floor so that they can shove more students in their next year when the school increases the incoming students without increasing the infrastructure. The rules are fine, the RAs a great (absent and quiet but good for laying down the law without being to bad about it), we have a pot problem in my dorm so it always smells disgusting, and the pool, bbq, 8 TVs that we don't need, study rooms and lounge areas are great. Of the nine washing machines, only two work right now and it's the end of the year so who's going to fix them? There isn't enough housing for upperclassman to get a room with a kitchen (which is required if you don't want to buy the meal plan). The cost of on campus housing is too high, much too high for the convenience. I can live almost two years worth of rent off campus for one year on campus. Too bad 2 years on campus is required."
Recent Alumnus,2,"No job prospects, the staff tell you can have a specific major and minor then A month before graduation say you can't"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not a lot of cheap options
Recent Alumnus,2,Not a lot of prospects and you hardly get recommended unless you're a professors absolute favorite student
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't a whole lot of communication between the offices and it's very disorganized.
College Freshman,2,"Don't go to the Thai restaurant, Don't get the Pad Thai"
College Freshman,2,"Food is expensive, and a requirement if living on campus housing without kitchens...and there is a lot of campus housing without kitchens.    Serving times are limited and food quality is questionable."
College Freshman,2,Very expensive housing cost for value and purpose.
College Freshman,2,"the food isn't anything that i expected to be good, but it's subpar to anything else. i've never had cafeteria food before, and if this is what it was like then i'm glad i never did."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not a lot of help finding internships and jobs. As far as majors go, most of your time is spent doing classes that have nothing to do with what you actually are supposed to be studying."
College Junior,2,"Old run down town. Nothing like a city. Great if you like that but as a young adult, it is pretty boring and seemingly away from civilization."
College Sophomore,2,"There is about three places to eat within walking distance, anywhere else you need a car."
College Sophomore,2,"Alcohol seems to be a big part of Pacific's atmosphere, unfortunately. The students are open with their drinking and don't seem to care if they are caught."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The local weather consists of rain and clouds on a regular basis, however, when the sun comes out it is absolutely beautiful. "
College Freshman,2,"Forest Grove is a really lame town with nothing to do honestly. It is only 45 minutes away from Portland and there are closer towns that offer shopping malls, but it's quite the trek to get to where the fun is at. My best friend is currently living in Portland and even with that extra incentive, I don't find myself in Portland too often"
College Freshman,2,The only reason I chose to go here was because I could cheer here. I wasn't really looking into all of my options and I really didn't care t the time. The college is in a really crappy little town and it feels like high school all over again. You can tell that the people who like the school a lot also really enjoyed high school and wanted to relive it in college. There isn't really an opportunity to start over because you know everyone within the first month.
College Freshman,2,"At first, it was tolerable, but as time went on I found myself dreading eating. There is barely any variety at all. You're pretty much going to eat the same thing every day because there is only one dining hall and they don't switch it up ever. The overall quality of the food goes down over time as well. Even pizza,  which should always be a safe option isn't good. It's actually gross pizza. I didn't know it was possible for pizza to be so gross. "
College Sophomore,2,"Overcast weather is very common, and it rains frequently.  It snows a little in the winter, but its usually slushy and icy, rather than soft and powdery."
College Junior,2,"They don't really have much in way of scholarships at PU. I did receive a small scholarship for my previous college GPA, but it is nothing in the grand scheme of things."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics are a big part of campus life at Pacific. Professors are very understanding when athletes have to miss classes for games and tournaments. However, football overshadows almost every other varsity sport and the football team is very weak. Sports teams that are more successful and stronger receive little to no attention from the school whereas football receives special meal plans and accommodations."
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot to do around Forest Grove. The night life on the weekends usually consists of house parties hosted by students with off campus apartments or at sports houses. Dorm parties are risky and usually get busted by campus security but that doesn't seem to stop people from having them. Clubs and sororities/ fraternities will host dances every so often on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"There is little to no nightlife outside of campus. Honestly, Forest Grove is a little hick-ish, so I don't personally walk around after dark."
College Sophomore,2,For the most part the campus feels safe but occasionally there is the random stranger who is known to be a sexual predator who has wandered onto or around campus...
College Junior,2,"If you like the rain, this is the school for you! If not, try considering somewhere else.  Everything is beautiful and green, but that is because of the moisture."
College Sophomore,2,"Though any extra expense is rarely greeted happily, the parking permits are not ridiculously expensive. The problem is when there are no parking spots. This is a common problem near the freshmen dorms and even in some of the larger lots by the gym and stadium, particularly during class. There are no assigned spots. To play it safe, get to campus 15-30 minutes early."
College Junior,2,"I don't generally do anything to get in trouble on campus, so my knowledge of the strictness of the campus is pretty limited. I hear that they usually give warnings for alcohol and lighter drugs such as marijuana, but then move onto more strict policies which include loss of scholarships and expulsion."
College Sophomore,2,"This past year the increased the scholarships by 5k for some. However, the increase does not translate across the board to every student with the same scholarship. The boxer spirit scholarship is okay but it just covers the annual increase in tuition"
College Senior,2,"There needs to be more day time parking in the visitor lots. Currently there are two where you can park all day, but these are normally filled very quickly and mostly by professors. The street parking is where students who do not live within walking distance end up. There is a constant fear that Campus Public Safety will give you a ticket for leaving your car for more than four hours, so students have to run out between classes and move their cars hoping that they will be able to find another spot. There have been plans in motion for a new parking lot, but ""budget concerns"" keep pushing the project further and further out of sight."
College Senior,2,"While they try to provide a wide variety of food options it ends up being majority of Hawaiian food to cater to the large Hawaiian population on campus. They always have pizza and grilled food, but with the long lines and poor options for healthy food, you are better off not have a meal plan."
College Sophomore,2,"Small Town No Life â€“ Forest Grove is a small town out by the farmlands. There is not much to do. Luckily, just an hour away via bus is Beaverton where they have everything you need to have a great time."
College Junior,2,"Not a Lot of Options â€“ Just regular sandwitch, salad, etc, nothing special"
College Senior,2,Hawaii Girl in the Oregon Rain â€“ It rains A LOT. The weather has a definite impact on my studies and willingness to walk out in the pouring rain to class.
College Junior,2,"There but Not â€“ There are greek organizations on campus, but they have limited exposure on campus and only a few members."
College Freshman,2,"I'm sure students do go out at night, but I don't. I pretty much focus on my studies and I have a family to take care of and can't afford to go out like that. SInce I have student loans I can't justify the expenditure."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Very Diverse, but Not Bad â€“ It's not a super diverse school, but it's not in a bad way. Student population is mostly white, asian, and Hawaiian students. It's probably not super diverse, because it's an expensive, private, liberal arts school. Hawaiian student population is a tight-knit community almost to the point of exclusion."
Sophomore,1,"Pacific University is a decent school academically, but its not worth the money. As a high school student looking at colleges, they will tell a lot of white lies about the school, making it sound like something totally different than it is. It is far too small, and it feels like high school because there are 1800 students, and you know everyone and there is too much drama. The food is absolutely terrible, as I was served under cooked chicken on a weekly basis, and the food just doesn't taste good. Campus security is extremely hardcore, and punishments for alcohol are far to extreme. This leads to the parry scene being terrible, as Forest Grove is possibly one of the worst college towns in the US. I would never recommend Pacific to someone i know, unless you're looking for a boring and depressing college experience. I transferred out after my sophomore year and it was the best decision I could have made."

College Sophomore,1,"Most often, when you visit they have catering. Everyone knows the catering is their best food. When we get good/quality dishes/desserts, we know it came from a leftover catering. The rest of the dining is bland, repetitive, and caters to Hawaiian student tastes. The Starbucks is ok, if you have the money for it anyway go ahead, if you have the ""dinning dollars"" for it anyway, go ahead. But it's Starbucks so the coffee isn't great. The bagel place is ok but moved to a location I don't go to often before it closes, and the ""POD market"" is less of a market and more of a snack food store. I want a market I could cook with using my declining dinning dollars balance. The price of the meal plan is incredibly high and stupid, I can't wait to be saving money by not being forced to eat the food."
College Sophomore,1,"Worst food ever. I stopped eating meat from the cafeteria. I got sick off the food twice. And they have the worst hours, making it almost a nuisance to find time to eat."
College Sophomore,1,The Greek Life at Pacific isn't taken seriously and many members of the Greek system give the system a bad name.
College Senior,1,No such thing as a fraternity on this campus
College Senior,1,"This place does not know how to party at all, terrible nightlife and a fun social atmosphere if youre in high school "
College Senior,1,There is no nightlife unless you live in Portland.
College Freshman,1,I am not a huge fan of Greek life here because what I have seen is that there are either party Greeks or the Nerd Greeks.
College Junior,1,Greek life isn't a big deal at Pacific University. It just doesn't feel the same like other Greek life at big school such as UCDavis. Frats and Sororities don't do much for someone on a resume; some even think it looks bad on a resume here. Not even good for parties. Good if you need a bunch of close friends.
College Freshman,1,"Barely Any Greeks â€“ It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one. We only have a few."
College Freshman,1,"When I got to Forest Grove, Oregon I hoped that there was going to be a lot to do and a lot of things to keep me busy. After being here for more than a month I have found little to do and a very easy curriculum. I wish I had done my homework when applying to colleges because essentially I picked this school for the opportunity to play on the varsity soccer team. Overall, the school has little to offer and you must enjoy the small school atmosphere to stay happy here."

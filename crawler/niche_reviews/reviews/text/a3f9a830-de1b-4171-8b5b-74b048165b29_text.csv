Freshman,5,"Love it!  Beautiful campus, freshman dorm (Saylor) is super nice and clean.  So far my professors have been amazing and supportive with a lot of feedback and help when needed.  It's a bit hard to get super involved with a pandemic going on, but BW is trying!  Can't wait to see what it's like when back to more normal! Overall, super happy with my choice for college."
Freshman,5,"Most of my classes are in person this fall.  I have one class that meets in person one time a week and on line two times per week, however, you can sign up to attend in the extra seats on your on line days.  Overall, the professors are doing a good job of on line and in person and keeping everyone on track.  It's tough, but I'd rather be in person some days than only online like at other schools!"
Junior,5,Online experience is good in this school since the professors are doing everything they can to help students even though
Sophomore,5,During the COVID pandemic All 5 of my spring classes were made into online classes. The university and professors adapted well to the new scenario and I was happy with the outcome.
Sophomore,5,Professors really are wonderful educators and people. So many opportunities on campus to get and stay involved.
Alum,5,"I loved my four years at BW! I have an amazing group of friends I still keep in touch with often. I was a student athlete and I wouldn’t trade that experience for anything.  The campus is beautiful, the professors are helpful, knowledgeable and thoughtful. Overall it was an amazing college."
Alum,5,I only had a few online courses in my time at BW but they were always simple to go through and understand. There was also always a professor that we could get in contact with if we had any issues.
Senior,5,I took online classes because of COVID-19. Each professor was extremely understanding of everything going on and made sure that each student would still be able to succeed. I was able to do my work in the comfort of my own home and also know that I have access to help at any time.
Senior,5,Baldwin Wallace was the only college I applied to because I knew that I would get the best education and I would feel at home. I love the small campus because it makes it easier to navigate classes and other important buildings. It helps a lot during the wintertime. The smaller classes and the close teacher relationships helped me learn the best and succeed in each course. Baldwin Wallace has ENDLESS opportunities to help each student fully succeed here at BW and also for post-graduation plans. I do not like the food but that is honestly my only negative opinion. You will succeed here and you will find your place.
Sophomore,5,"Baldwin Wallace University has changed my life for the better. Living on campus had helped me step out of my comfort zone and meet new amazing people. The professors are motivated to make sure that the students have great opportunities and are always there to help, academically, or personally. The campus is small which makes it easy for everyone to know everyone. It really is like one big family and my home away from home. It is located in a safe area and has great places to eat or just hang out with friends and do homework. There really are not many if any parties because it is located in a residential area. I really couldn't ask for a better college that fits my needs and expectations."
Alum,5,My experience at B-W was education with a personal touch. The professors were very approachable and were available on a daily basis. There were no student assistants teaching classes but the actual professor showed up to teach.
Alum,5,Baldwin Wallace provided excellent academics and athletics. There were plenty of opportunities to stay active in the community and campus. The school provided great diversity and culture. Overall Baldwin Wallace provided me with a great foundation to start my adult life.
Freshman,5,"I love the smaller size and the connections you make with the professors and your advisors. The small class sizes make this possible. I love the environment and the opportunities this school has to offer. No matter your program you will feel welcomed, accepted and like a family."
Junior,5,I really enjoyed my first semester at Baldwin Wallace in the fall. The professors are really nice and helpful. They really understand how hard it can be to go to college and are willing to help with deadlines and answer questions. I've gained a lot of knowledge just going there one semester and I cannot wait to see what else I learn.
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity and academics on campus. Athletics are very good and the students are very friendly and respectful. The campus has many things you can do or join that can help aid you in a successful college experience. One thing I would change is the food. The food isnt the best. Some of the food is not healhty and osmetimes not cooked fully. Students have been sick from the food and me personally don't eat at dining halls even though I live on campus.
Freshman,5,It is a very friendly and engaging community with tons of opportunities to get involved and faculty who truly care about students as individuals.
Sophomore,5,"Baldwin Wallace has been my dream university since i was in middle school. Not only are they an outstanding university in  academics, housing some of the best programs in the country, but they are a welcoming community to all."
Junior,5,"I am a junior at BW, currently studying abroad in Australia for the Fall semester at the University of the Sunshine Coast, their sister school.  I fell in love with BW on my first visit, telling my mom that we better check out some other schools quickly, as I was already taken with everything BW offered.  I have not regretted my choice to attend BW at all, despite opportunities and scholarships at other local and respected universities.  I love the beautiful campus, the caring faculty and all of the friends and connections I have made in my two years there.  Most of all, I am thrilled at the opportunity I have to study in Australia, my dream location, for Fall 2019.  BW was so helpful and supportive in making my dream come true.  They are truly committed to their student base, and I am proud to be a member of that group!!"
Freshman,5,"Although I will only be a freshman there this year, the few experiences I have had there were great. The best part about my experience there is the people. It is mind-blowing how kind the staff and students are there. The quality of education at Baldwin Wallace is also spectacular, especially in the area of music. Baldwin Wallace has staff who are also involved with the Cleveland Orchestra. Also, the school is small, so you can get to know professors personally and help is much more accessible."
Junior,5,"I love this school. It provides ample opportunity for students to get involved with not only the school but the opportunity too. The staff is incredible, in my time being here I’ve only had one professor that I was not too fond of. Other than that, every professor has a strong drive and is willing to help. I am an education major and all my classes and professors really take initiative to assure that myself and others are ready for the real world of teaching. The food is not the best but we are around a lot of restaurants/carry out places that make up for it. I am so happy with this school!"
Niche User,5,So far the experience has been quick and easy to find information out. Financial aid has responded very quickly to any questions and concerns that I have had. The nursing staff have all been very knowledgable and friendly. The campus was great and had a lot more sports facilities than I expected for the size of the school.
Freshman,5,"Its very welcoming, the aid office really helps you understand everything, all around great atmosphere."
Freshman,5,Im really enjoying my time here. I found some awesome friends and had some really great classes so far. If you want somewhere that has friendly teachers and good food I suggest BW.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Baldwin Wallace University has been amazing so far.  The Early Childhood Education program is outstanding along with the community here on campus.  I'm involved in FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes), Teaching Together Club, part of the Veterans Club, and a part of the Women's Volleyball team.  I feel like I belong here and always feel safe at this school.  The only change I would like to see is one where more students would get involved.  Being involved truly makes the college experience one to remember."
Sophomore,5,My overall experience with Baldwin Wallace University has been a tremendous experience. The small class sizes give me the ability to focus in and get one on one help with my professors . Something that I would like to see change in the future is the meal plans and tuition cost to go here. I have not been able to register for classes on time because of financial aid twice this year. The Baldwin Wallace community has a very friendly and exciting atmosphere to be apart of.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the conservatory a lot. All the faculty there has a real love for what they are teaching! Their Music education program is the largest in Ohio. They are also known for having a strong Musical Theater program.
Senior,5,"I personally love Baldwin Wallace College. The professors truly care about you. Because it is a smaller school, the class sizes are smaller which allows you to get to know the teacher and build a relationship with them. Baldwin Wallace College is helping me pursue my dream career in Early Childhood Education. Baldwin Wallace teaches you more than what the textbook says. Professors bring in their outside experiences and allow us to connect with what really happens in the classroom. This school has given me numerous opportunities to go into a classroom to observe or student teach. We work closely with a school nearby and this allows us to participate in school events or volunteer when needed. Without Baldwin Wallace College, I would not be as successful as I am today and pursuing my dream career."
Junior,5,Truly my home away from home!  It is so easy for you to be involved on campus.  They are the reason why I was able to study abroad!
Graduate Student,5,"As an adult continuing education student, BW's  advisors were there for me at every turn.  My professors took the time to get to know me and the passion for what I was studying.  Their passion for what they are teaching is felt and encourages to push yourself beyond your limits to discover yourself outside the box.  BW does not hold you back from what you want to study.  If you are struggling, they take the time to help reach your goals and then to step over your goals.  They do not believe in having to except someone into a program, but allow you to study what it is that sets you into motion. The professors  want you to reach your work in honesty and they want you think critically.  I found my time at BW to be  an enriching experince that can never be replaced."
Graduate Student,5,"I transferred to Baldwin Wallace after my freshman year and it was the best decision I have ever made. I have gain hands-on experience and met plenty of connections that will prepare me for the ""real world."" The professors, staff, and peers are very personable and bring out the best in you no matter what. Now being a BW alum, I believe BW has shaped me into an intelligent, hardworking, and respectful individual."
Freshman,5,"Baldwin Wallace is an amazing college. The teachers are kind and are very willing to help. The students have that same attitude towards each other too. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to join, so you never really feel left out and there's always an opportunity to find someone new."
Junior,5,"The only thing I would change about BW is the food selection. The food isn't the best and there is almost no variety. I have heard that the dorms aren't great, but I am a commuter. Other than that, I have loved every minute of my experience at BW. The professors make an effort to get to know students on a more personal level. They are always available to help. The student body feels like a community and is filled with mutual respect. The campus is beautiful and I have never felt unsafe there."
Freshman,5,BW is amazing!  99% of the professors genuinely care for each and every student.  It's a second home to me.
Sophomore,5,Everyone is very friendly and all of the professors I have worked with have done their best to help students as much as they can.
Freshman,5,This college is a small college so all the professors know who their students are and really get to know each student and really care about them.
Niche User,5,I am an incoming freshman and so far from everything I have seen I have fallen in love with BW. I can not wait to join the Jackets this fall.
Sophomore,5,"Baldwin Wallace is a great school with a lot of opportunities to grow and share. The small community feel isn't too overwhelming and very family like in a lot of ways. I love it here and would very much like to continue, however it is very expensive and I'm currently trying to get creative on how to afford it."
Freshman,5,I loved week of welcome. Its the first 5 days before school where you move in and they have all these activities you have to go to and I actually really enjoyed them and its an easy way to meet lots of new people.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and how close-knit and welcoming everything feels. I think the school will be a great, supportive environment to spend the next four years."
Freshman,5,"Every single member of the Baldwin Wallace community is incredibly caring and kind. Faculty, students, parents of students, they're all amazing people. Baldwin Wallace is more than just a university; Baldwin Wallace is a family. The only thing I would like to see change is how early the deadline is for SAT scores."
Sophomore,5,"Baldwin Wallace is an amazing university. It offers many amazing opportunities for its students to study abroad and conferences related to majors.  The campus is small and homely with the freedom of a major city just a quick drive away. If you want to find a part you always can. The professors care about the students and want to see them secede. The other students of my major feel like family, and we don't have to fight for the ability to grow as artisans and get experience. Students in my degree are required to do a senior capstone which allows all students to leave college with at least one great accomplishment under their belt with many other skills and projects completed. The program does need to grow a little we do not have the most recent technology or the best tools in the world. If you a willing to work hard and put time into your future, you will be amazed at how far you will go at Baldwin Wallace and into the world."
Sophomore,5,"Baldwin Wallace has truly become my home away from home. The classes are great with terrific professors who are always willing to help you out if you ask. The campus is beautiful with terrific dorms as well. The local area of Berea has such a rich history and there are so many new things to do nearby that you can never truly be bored. There are so many clubs and organizations that you can definitely find at least one club to join. The campus food tastes great and there are many different options but they do always have the same things every week so by the end of the year it can get kind of boring. All in all, Baldwin Wallace is a terrific place to go to school and I can't imagine going anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,The Baldwin Wallace community is inclusive and supportive and values the diversity of its students. I would like to see the university grow to include more graduate degree opportunities.
Sophomore,5,I love the energy of BW. Everyone on campus whether it be faculty or students is so welcoming and friendly. All faculty members are extremely helpful in all aspects. The teaching methods are amazing and very helpful for myself.
Freshman,5,Baldwin Wallace University is a great institution who puts forth the time and effort to make sure the campus is outstanding and a great place for its students. My experience here has been nothing but a great time in all aspects.
Niche User,5,"I love Baldwin Wallace! It is an amazing school! The faculty is extremely friendly. The music program is very strong at Baldwin Wallace, which is very important to me as a singer. They have so much going on there for the students to participate in like the largest collegiate Bach festival and the Beatles festival. Baldwin Wallace is a great school!"
College Freshman,5,Security can walk you to your dorm and are one phone call away
College Freshman,5,You ca tell that it is going to be awesome at freshman orientation.
College Junior,5,"The class sizes is small, which is great becuase the professor gets to know the students on a personal and professional way. All of the professors care about the students development, if they're getting the work done correctly and making sure we are stretching ourselves to learn more. Each professor is different but they know how to explain the material in multiple ways so that all students will be able to follow along with them. It is all difficult work but that is expected. If extra help is needed, we have tutors in Ritter and online! Pretty much everything is flexible."
College Junior,5,"Our schools moto is all able making sure graduates earn a job either before they leave the school or soon as they leave. They work hard to make sure we network over the years we attend Baldwin Wallace and they make sure we meet all requirements for jobs (resume, portfolio, interviews, experience, etc.) Our career center is a 15 our of 10 when it comes to helping students finding careers, experiences or internships."
College Junior,5,"Or greek life is a pretty big part on campus. Even if someone is not appart of greek life, they welcome people to events, they care deeply for the community around us and for people on campus. We have one building called Heritage that holds all of our greek life, which shows they are all in unity and know how to live toghether. Majority of the time many individuals set a warm welcome atmosphere to first year students and knows how to cheer everyone up throughtout the whole year. I love our greek life."
College Senior,5,Very easy to complete all of the application steps.
College Junior,5,They do a lot to help students find jobs
College Junior,5,best attendance in the OAC
College Sophomore,5,The Music Education program at Baldwin Wallace is amongst the highest in the state. Job placement and course work are great and the faculty are very knowledgeable and are there to help you.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very secure walking on campus, even after dark. Everything is well lit, and campus security is always available. Overall an extremely safe campus."
College Sophomore,5,There a Greek dorms on campus so partying isn't very big but there is a small social scene.
College Sophomore,5,Baldwin Wallace is a great school to go to if you don't like big cities and you're worried about making lasting relationships.
College Freshman,5,"In my specific program, I believe there are many opportunities to network in order to get a job."
College Junior,5,"Many alumni stay on campus and find jobs in the Berea and are there to connect with you about their experiences. Professors and advisers are helpful when trying to connect with careers and internships. There are many job fairs, and Baldwin Wallace is connected with so many different employers."
Junior,4,Baldwin Wallace University is a great university. It has a huge diversity within the students enrolled in this university. Academics is also great since professors are doing everything they can to help their students.
Senior,4,"I've had a great experience at BW, but I wish the administration cared more about the Film Studies major. We're located very close to Cleveland, which is growing as an entertainment filming destination, yet our administration refuses to give us the necessary resources to grow as well. Otherwise, my professors are amazing and I've enjoyed my time at BW."
Freshman,4,"Baldwin Wallace University provides a ""family feel"" to all students. Staff members treat their students like fellow humans instead of just another student they are required to teach."
Senior,4,"I can best describe BW in a singular word: ""ambitious"". From its students to its departments and administration, there is always a hard-working atmosphere at BW. It's both a good and bad thing, as it pushes everyone to improve themselves but can at times result in over-stressed students and bad planning decisions. The experience of students is also HIGHLY dependent on the department you are a part of. I can verify that the business and accounting departments are amazing at BW, however other departments (i.e. the economics dept.) are definitely not up to par."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at Baldwin Wallace are very knowledgable and willing to answer any questions and work with students outside of class to help them understand the material. The financials involved with attending this university are very frustrating because it can be difficult to get financial aid and many people working in the offices are students, so they often make false promises and get information wrong."
Senior,4,Class room size and student to teacher ratio makes it easier to gain connections with professors as well as getting to understand the material better
Freshman,4,"When I first moved into my dorm was really nervous about the what people would be like  when I see them again. Some of the people in my orientation group didn't really want to associate with me. You move on care about the people who care about you and treat you that way. I did meet new friends and became close to them. We hang out, listen to music, laugh, tell each other's problems and support each other like friends do. There are times when I need to be by myself to give me space from anything that is happening to me an when I do that I either rethink what is happening or I listen to music to be peaceful and be in the moment. My classes are going ok, I am starting to improve. I love my professors they are very supportive, patient, and organized. I also want to be a vocal major but since I didn't get in the conservatory I am a Liberal Arts Student having to minor in music. I do have interest in Psychology in which I want to minor in, Photography, Travel."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Baldwin Wallace are the Small class sizes, and professors that have experience in the field but are also good teachers. My one complaint is that the campus does a poor job of listening to student request such as longer dining hall hours."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the feel of the students that go to school there. I feel like im at home when I’m there, even though my home is an hour away."
Freshman,4,"A beautiful campus with lots of life. I found that I could talk to any of the teachers and professors. Even the financial aid strenuously worked with me to make my going there a reality. During my time there, I could speak up in class, contribute to the classroom and community, and learn with all the free tutoring, office hours and friendly advice I could get. They have incredible internship and study abroad programs that many of my friends took advantage of. It is a wonderful personable school. Small in numbers, great in heart."
Freshman,4,The university is very welcoming and the professors care about their students. The atmosphere on campus is nice as well and we are located close to a cute lake and park system to relax in after stressful days are over.
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed the community of BW and how close everybody is with each other. When I was getting accepted my admission advisor remembered me by name when she saw me on campus.
Junior,4,"I personally love that Baldwin Wallace is so close to home for me. As an educator, it is wonderful to have the chance to form bonds with those that have always been close in location. The sense of community at Baldwin Wallace is incomparable! Of course friends make the community wonderful, but professors are the ones that make it so memorable; the are always willing to help you in any way!"
Sophomore,4,"In my experience Baldwin Wallace is a wonderful school, however, recently it has made choices that burden its students. I also find that my specific major is not administered well."
Niche User,4,"I am prospective student for BW.  I have visited the campus 2-3 times and met with different people current students, admissions and coaching staff for 2 different teams.  I am very excited the opportunity to attend school here. I live in the area and really see nothing but a positive outcome here."
Senior,4,"I came to Baldwin Wallace University because all of the people I had met there were extremely welcoming and friendly. I felt that at this small school, where there were about 4,000 people, I would feel more at home than I would at a larger university. The classes for the most part are pretty good, and all the professors, for the most part, are very insightful and willing to work with you on whatever you need. The food is alright, but the meal plan that they have no is...not the greatest. It might be because I started on the a la carte system and got switched over to the new meal swipe system, but there was a lot of resistance. Also, even though half of the school is made up of commuters, the clubs and organizations are not Commuter Friendly in the slightest. A lot of them are late at night and don't take into consideration that a lot of commuter students don't have their own cars or can't stay out late at night."
Sophomore,4,Baldwin Wallace University is a wonderful academic and social community. The comparatively smaller class sizes allow for a real connection to the professor which benefits the learning environment. The historical look of the campus and the area surrounding it look nice. There are a great variety of organizations and opportunities for all students to engage in too!
Freshman,4,Madison enjoyed her first semester at Baldwin Wallace. When she struggled in classes they were professors and to help her. She likes being in a sorority.
Junior,4,"Baldwin Wallace university is very convenient with allowing students who live in the area to commute. However, the school is a small private college that does not have many scholarship opportunities. Also, the school could do better with renovations and student living."
Niche User,4,"Baldwin Wallace offers so many undergraduate programs, they provide something for everyone. The professors are invested in your learning and care about the furthering of your education. Also, multiple different extracurricular activities and groups are presented for you to feel comfortable and at home. They accommodate your needs and make you feel welcome."
Sophomore,4,"I love BW. If I could describe my school in one word it word be ""community."" BW students are often over-involved because of so many great opportunities that this small, suburban school offers. I have personal relationships with each of my professors and I genuinely enjoy their lectures. If I could change one thing about my school, it would be the food because it upsets my stomach. Included, they just recently changed the meal plan which now refuses students the opportunity of being refunded for whatever amount of money they did not spend during the academic year."
Senior,4,I am currently a conservatory student at BW. The programs and the faculty overall are excellent - they definitely prepare you for graduate school and beyond.
Sophomore,4,"Professors really care about student success in and outside of the classroom. Class sizes are really small and the community atmosphere is perfect. Plus, during the fall it is gorgeous"
Sophomore,4,"This college is very friendly, and it is a happy environment. I enjoy my classes and the professors are very personable. You are able to get a lot of one on one with professors, and if you struggle, they are willing to help you."
Freshman,4,"There are various  organizations and clubs on campus, you can always find the one you interested.  The school has strong awareness of student safety.  Professors in here are nice and always willing to help.  They also provide tutors for your writings and other academic works for free.  There are tutors provided before final exam to get students prepared."
Senior,4,The accelerated nursing program at Baldwin Wallace is an excellent program with a caring staff that works with their students for their success.
Junior,4,"The best thing about this school is its professors. They are easily some of the most educated individuals I have ever come across, especially in the History and Political Science departments. The overall classes in turn are great and very easily manageable. The local area and overall safety of the campus are pretty good. I can't really say I have ever worried about that sort of thing. The only downside to this school is the party scene, if you are into that thing. It is almost nonexistent. Other than that though, this school offers a great education with fantastic professors, with some of the best financial aid scholarships/awards I have seen at a private university.  This school has saved me a ton of money, which is always a great thing."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience at Baldwin Wallace has been very good. The environment is very welcoming and the students and staff are very friendly and helpful."
Freshman,4,"Was very impressed with the Conservatory - students, faculty, facilities and curriculum. I look forward to auditioning in February"
Freshman,4,I love BW's inclusive and diverse community. The professors are incredibly helpful and really take an effort to get to know their students.
Junior,4,I am a current junior at Baldwin Wallace University. I have enjoyed my three years at college becasue BW has a great faculty and community. I played volleyball my first two years at college. I am also majoring in chemistry. The one thing I would like to see change is better housing facilities.
Junior,4,"The professors at BW are, for the most part (there are exceptions to every rule, of course), fantastic. They, along with the college as a whole, care so much about their students, and take a vested interest in your success.  The proximity to Cleveland gives you opportunity after opportunity, no matter what field of study you're into. 
Honestly I can't say enough good things about BW. The price is pretty high, no lie, and it can be very difficult to justify spending so much, but the financial aid office is so generous and helpful, they all want you to have the best experience you can possibly have, and their resources are something that I personally have really appreciated. 
The area is gorgeous, too, by the way. Campus is about two stones' throws away from the Metroparks, a sprawling park along a network of roads that connect the surrounding cities together. 
Seriously, consider BW. I love it, and I hope you will, too."
Alum,4,"The school is in a great city and is a wonderful school. The science programs are getting better but are still a work in progress. The education program needs science professors. The drama and music departments are some of the best in the country. The campus is integrated into the City of Berea while still being a distinct entity. Most of the campus is beautiful old buildings and all the roads are lined with trees. The dorms are older buildings but are, for the most part, spacious. The Wi-Fi needs work but there are numerous computer labs around campus. The food has greatly improved but is still not the best."
Junior,4,"Baldwin Wallace University is a medium sized, 4 year university in Berea, OH. The campus is beautiful and situated just outside of Cleveland. It has a small town feel with large connections to various organizations in the Greater Cleveland Area. The professors, faculty and overall community are what I believe separates BW from other college campuses. With a 13:1 student to faculty ratio, you really are a name and not a number. Professors take the time to get to know you and really aim to help you succeed. BW has become a home away from home. There are updates that can be made though and always room for improvement. I would like to see a change in housing and some of the facilities. But the people certainly make up for the lack in other areas."
Sophomore,4,"BW is great! As a mid-year transfer student I was really nervous having to start everything over again. I went from a huge state school to a very small school. The faculty & staff are very kind. My professors know me by name and want what's best for me, in & outside of the classroom. From understanding the course work to finding an internship or getting involved on campus, they truly make an effort to make sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities that are provided here at Baldwin Wallace University."
Senior,4,"BW is constantly changing and wanting to be better. As a senior, a lot of the things that my friends and I complained about when we were a freshman are fixed, or on their way to becoming better. Since it is a small school, the night life is small and contained, but there is always something to do if you want to. Music program is everything I could have asked for and more. If you come here and it does not hit you right away, BW will grow on you and will feel like home."
Freshman,4,"Very diversity community filled with some of the most interesting and current time/issue classes and electives. Large campus but easy to navigate, with safety being a top priority. Tuition is expensive however they are very generous with their aid. The professors have been nothing but wonderful and their different methods of engaging the students create a variety which drives you to actually go to classes."
Niche User,4,"Baldwin Wallace Conservatory is a wonderful place to be. The campus is in the middle of a small city. Berea has everything you will need; grocery stores withing walking distance, a spectacular mall, hospitals, and the lovely MetroParks for outdoor enjoyment. Baldwin Wallace is small enough that students do not get swallowed up by large classroom sizes, but it is also big enough to have all the perks of a big school.  The only downfall I have found so far is administration. Being a transfer student, it seems that I have fallen into a difficult category and at times, get left out of important information. Several other transfer students have expressed the same feelings as well. Having said that, I have no other complaints about Baldwin Wallace."
College Freshman,4,"My room is kind of small, but I can manage"
College Freshman,4,"Great coaches, the school spirit is uplifting"
College Junior,4,Everything is publicized well and even the professors announce athletic events. Our teams perform the best they can and give their all into the sport they love and represent the school well.
College Junior,4,"Baldwin Wallace is a caring community and we all work together. We focus on important issues within our community and some issues that can effect all campus communities like sexual assult and dating violence for example. My favorite experience about our school is when we have events, everyone is aware about the events and support one another. I love the Mid Night Madness events because they are creative and thier events brings everyone together."
College Senior,4,Campus seems to take care of this issue and nothing bad as occurred from this.
College Senior,4,"I can rate this even though I don't go to this school, because my finance is in Greek life.  She is in Zeta Tau Alpha and all of the events I have been at have been fun and enjoyable to attend."
College Junior,4,"There is a great amount of resources in Career Services that help students get internships and jobs. A degree from BW, especially in areas such as education or music theatre, mean a great deal when one goes out to apply for jobs and allow for us to have a great name on our resumes."
College Junior,4,"I have only had a handful of professors who did not put in as much effort to ensuring their students' success as they wanted their students to put into the work of the class. The majority of professors truly care about their students and want to see them succeed, and will directly assist students in reaching their goals."
College Junior,4,"Overall, I feel very safe when walking across campus at night, and the officers on campus are very helpful in any situation, not only those involving crime."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is great because you have a great proximity to just about anything. No matter where you live, you are within a good distance of food, outdoor activities, and great study areas."
College Junior,4,Those involved in Greek life on campus definitely have strong bonds with those that they share a brotherhood or sisterhood with. In no way are those who are non-Greek treated any differently than those who are Greek. The Greeks are very accepting of everyone and have very diverse groups in their sisterhoods and brotherhoods.
College Junior,4,"The professors, students, and other members of the BW community are all supportive of each person's success and help one another reach their full potential. I have by far made the best choice possible in choosing this school as my second home."
College Junior,4,I've had a few I didn't care for
College Junior,4,"I liked living on campus, but cheaper to live off campus"
College Sophomore,4,I am very confident that because of the networking I am provided that I will be able to easily find a job someday.
College Sophomore,4,It's great if you can plan what housing you want in relationship to how close you are to your classes. You don't want to walk all the way across campus to your classes at eight in the morning.
College Sophomore,4,I am impressed by how many Greek organizations there are on campus as well as how willing they are to do things to support the community.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not a person who participates in varsity sports on campus, however I believe that the facilities for athletes and non-athletes are great for such a smaller scale school."
College Freshman,4,I feel generally safe while walking home late at night on campus.
College Freshman,4,"My professors (for the most part) are always ready and available to help me. As a con student, I don't have a lot of opportunities to explore other classes."
College Freshman,4,"Much better than average, although the safety of the area is due in large part to the location of campus. I haven't heard anything since my first semester about any active measures the school is taking to prevent sexual assault."
College Junior,4,"The health center is cheap. efficient, and easy to get into. They have actual doctors on campus during specific times in case you get very sick. Appointments are quick. It is easy to get a hold of counselors etc. Campus is generally very safe. I have been here for there years and I have not heard of any serious safety instances where anyone has been hurt, mugged, or sexually assaulted."
Freshman,2,"Baldwin Wallace has one of the worst party scenes ever. The academics are good and the professors are good, but there is not enough options for the students attending. The food is mediocre at best and all of the dorms and buildings just seem worn down."
Freshman,2,"Baldwin Wallace is a mediocre college, with suspiciously easy academics and a sad vibe. There is no sense of ambition or community, unless perhaps you join a sorority. But it's cheap and it's easy, so if you just want a degree and you don't wanna spend, then it's good. But if you want to learn anything, do not choose this school."
College Freshman,2,"Some of the residence halls, Kohler in particular, are dumps. There's an ongoing ant problem on the entire first floor, the rooms aren't very clean at all, and the showers are extremely old and outdated."
College Junior,2,"Need for major improvement, I attribute all my GI issues to this school's food. I am not a bunny I can't eat salad all day."
College Junior,2,Need for updated buildings. On one side of campus there are great housings and the other side haven't been updated in years.
College Freshman,2,"Health are you kidding me. I'm sure getting stomach issues from each a meal a day isn't healthy but that's just me. I my dorm, North Hall I do not feel safe. Drugs and alcohol are a big problem in this dorm. I also think because of the drugs/alcohol that violence has become an issue. My RA's are barley on duty which is very stupid especially when you don't feel safe. Next time I don't feel safe I need to either get safety and security, which actually isn't available all of the time, or I need to call Berea police. If you are a girl, never walk alone at night when it is nice out!"
College Freshman,2,"There are days when it is good, but in regards to the price and the lack of variety meals there are everyday, I try to stay away from it."
College Junior,2,"The athletes take sports extremely seriously, but nobody else does."
College Junior,2,If you want to party go to OSU.
College Junior,2,"Because the school is small, I think a lot of people are too afraid to admit to being sexually assaulted. It absolutely happens on campus, but if one were to speak out, the entire student body would know about it. There should be better ways to pursue health and safety confidentially."
College Sophomore,2,The security is not out at night often enough. The school is not really safe since there is a lot of drinking and there is a lot of theft around campus.
College Sophomore,2,They don't cite many people for drinking or doing drugs around campus. They are great with giving tickets though. I would like to see more of a presence of security and Berea police around campus and in the dormitory's. Maybe even putting in surveillance in the lobby's of the dorms and all the buildings around campus.
College Sophomore,2,The school has housing that is very old and not kept up. The streets at night can be dangerous with bum's and stalkers that look for girls that come outside of the dorms and go off campus to Walgreen's or downtown Berea. The housing is very close which is nice. I would like to see more bigger homes or off campus apartments.
College Sophomore,2,The teams performance is okay. The school doesn't promote enough. They should offer cash rewards for students to attend the games. It should be extra credit across the campus for students to be active with the sports.
College Sophomore,2,It gets boring after a while
College Freshman,2,"It is extremely cold in the winter, and it snows a lot. It makes walking to classes miserable sometimes."
College Freshman,2,There are several options of different foods but mostly chain restaurants and fast food and they are a good walk away unless you have a car. Maya is a good Mexican restaurant that offers a student discount. Mostly people just order pizza from Georgio's.
College Freshman,2,"There is no shuttle or anything. Upper class man drive from class to class. Most people have cars. The RTA system can get you around Cleveland pretty fast fast though. You just have to know where and when to be. Other than that, walking and biking are the main forms of transportation."
College Freshman,2,"Conservative, middle class, white students who didn't make it into their first choice. Most unconventional things cause fear and discomfort. 95% of the student body is heterosexual."
College Freshman,2,"Again, it depends on what major you're in, but most of the academics are mediocre. I wouldn't come to Baldwin Wallace University for a stellar education."
College Freshman,2,"Okay, they tell you that there is public transportation to Cleveland, and there is a bus stop, but don't let that fool you. It only stops at roughly 6am and 6pm. You pretty much need a car if you want to go anywhere off campus."
College Freshman,2,"It's cold, snowy, slushy, and wet. But hey, it's northeastern Ohio. What are you gonna do?"
College Freshman,2,You have to be Greek to join in things
College Senior,2,the weather sucks.  worst winter ever this year.
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have a car, it's hard to go anywhere."
College Freshman,2,"The college is strict with alcohol use, attendance, and noise violations, especially."
College Freshman,2,There are only a few places which are chains.  None really within walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,"It's Northeastern Ohio...Expect snow and rain and sunshine to happen all in one day. Sometimes in a matter of an hour. We get a lot of snow in the winter as Berea sits in the snow belt. It's fairly nice April and May. Summers can get really hot. Spring is generally fairly nice, expect rain. Bring an umbrella. Typical Northeastern Ohio weather."
College Freshman,2,"I don't like my hall, I'm in temporary housing and I was put in a sorority hall and I have nothing in common with anyone my floor"
College Freshman,2,Cleveland sports.... yeah. bad. Locals are usually pretty kind. The metro parks are gorgeous.
College Freshman,2,"We get a jacket express card with 2,300 on it each semester. The food is all al a carte and you can go to the cafeteria as many times as you want. The food is incredibly expensive and repetitive."
College Freshman,2,Absolutely no form of public transportation. Cars are definitely necessary if you plan to travel a lot.
College Freshman,2,"Berea law states that no more than 3 girls can live in a house or else it is considered a ""brothel"". Some landlords will let you get around that and others stick to the law. Few options and most of the options are incredibly run down."
College Freshman,2,The rec is nice but especially crowded during winter seasons. A new building was just built for the athletes.
College Freshman,2,The students are either conservatory students or athletes. Athletes are cocky considering its a bad D3 school.
College Freshman,2,Safety and security are everywhere. If you are being stupid with alcohol they will catch you. They are obsessive about making sure you aren't parking where you are not supposed to be.
College Freshman,2,Decent amount of computers even thought they are knocking down the one 24/7 computer lab within the next couple of months. wireless goes in and out.
College Sophomore,2,Not many options at all
College Sophomore,2,Dorms are dirty and old and not a pleasant place to live. Most of them do not have air conditioning and there are frequently problems with the heat styaing on in the winter.
College Freshman,2,"It's Cleveland. 'Nuff said. If you don't like snow, you will not be happy here. Rephrase- If you don't like weather, you will not be happy here. The way this works in northern Ohio is just crazy weather. You can be wearing no coat one day, the next day putting on every scrap of clothing in your dorm. It snows, it rains, it sleets, and in the summer, you bake. The summers are hot and sticky, the winters are cold and snowy. You'll be thanking your stars that it's such a small campus when walking to class. But on the other hand, when the weather is nice, it's BEAUTIFUL here. I love Ohio and it's crazy weather. Always have, always will. But it's a common complaint amongst residents. "
College Freshman,2,"Very few spots, especially for visitor parking. Freshman parking sucks. I don't have a car on campus, so this is just what I've heard. "
College Freshman,2,If you are not in greek life then it is very hard to find something fun on the weekends.
College Freshman,2,You need a car in order to get to any off campus food options. Also most people leave on the weekends so a car is necessary to leave and go to a better more fun place.
College Freshman,2,"Not all parts are that bad, I enjoy the friends I have made but the rest is very boring and bad. I want to transfer next year very bad."
College Freshman,2,"There are some very small parties on the weekends, usually only one night of the weekend. There are very few bars in which there are practically no college kids going to. It is overall very boring and bland, makes the weekends very long and not fun."
College Freshman,2,Airport and Greyhound bus station are nearby but the flights can be incredibly expensive. Almost everyone is from Ohio so trying to get a ride home is almost impossible.
College Freshman,2,Campus police are everywhere. We definitely aren't a party school. 
College Sophomore,2,There is some diversity but it is not diverse in the ways it should be.
College Sophomore,2,The boys here aren't great. Not only are they not very attractive but they'll holler at you from across the street. Very unappealing.
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of the faculty is very helpful and takes time to explain, others don't really care- it's sink or swim."
College Junior,2,"Most of our residence halls do not have AC. However, I believe that the 10-year plan includes provisions to fix this. 

We recently opened the Harding House, which is the sustainability house (""Green House""). The only bad thing about it is that it is nowhere near campus. We call it Alaska because it is separated by a large part of Berea."
College Sophomore,2,"Nights are very quiet. Not because they HAVE to be, they just are."
College Senior,2,"It snows a lot and the sidewalks are hardly ever clear, so some people end up walking on the streets. The snow turns into slush from the salt on the ground and it gets slippery, so be careful when walking. I've been told classes were almost never cancelled in the past, but my experience at BW has been different. Two years ago there were  two snow days within one winter. So be prepared to go to class, but be thankful if it gets canceled. Once spring hits, students come outside and do things like go to Coe Lake and play Frisbee. If you can bear the crappy winter weather, it's worth it to stay and experience the other seasons on campus."
College Junior,2,Pain in the Butt – Really hard to find a parking spot early in the morning when classes start and especially late at night when everyone goes back to their dorms. Have to park far away. The parking in Berea in general is a pain because you cannot leave your car parked in the street overnight or you will get a ticket.
College Sophomore,2,"They say that if you need an escort just ask and you'll get one, but I heard from a friend that she asked for one and never got one...so she had her friend walk her every night back from class. But it's such a small town, most people aren't too afraid. but i guess that just means everyone has their guard down when something does happen"
College Sophomore,2,"Depends on What You're Into – Their are a handful of cute guys on campus, however I wouldn't come into any college looking for a relationship. -"
College Freshman,2,"There is a 24 hour computer lab with plenty of computers. I've never had to wait in a line, probably because most people have laptops (including me). And the computers themselves aren't bad, better than the desktop at my house (but that computer is terrible..) really, the only bad thing about computers at B-W is the fact that the wireless seems to always be going out.  I feel like it was worse for me than for other people, but sometimes there would be no connection. Just don't wait til the last second. Usually if it's not working on one laptop, try another, it's weird like that. It's probably ghosts or something."
College Freshman,2,"A Small Town With Few Attractions – Ohio is a decent city. There are nearby malls, eating places  and of course Cleveland is also nice. There is many small colleges only 30 mins to an hour away from the college. The town Berea is what is bad, there s many older people who live there, and it is not that big. The small town can become boring on the weekends especially if you do not have a car."
College Sophomore,2,There really is no transportation. THere is no need for it.
College Junior,2,Social Life at B-W – I had a hard time finding my place at B-W. Most of the kids living on campus are in greek organizations and they are very cliquey.  The ones that aren't are usually on a sports team so they can hang out with those kids all the time. I actually have met most of my friends in classes.
Graduate Student,1,Do not attend BW for your MBA. The classes lack substance and there is no accountability until they put forward a new class; the new class being a test run for grad students paying $3000 for them to experiment. You will deal with more bureaucratic bs than actually learn and prepare yourself as a professional. Expect the entire curriculum to change and be expected to pay exuberant amounts that were not stated before applying.
College Freshman,1,No places are close to campus for students to get to and cannot get there if we do not drive.
College Freshman,1,I was served uncooked chicken wings with the blood still in it and was told that it was okay to eat.
College Freshman,1,"HORRIBLE. I complain all the time about noise. Fights in the stairwell at 1 am, fist fights at 4 am, god North Hall can't keep quiet"
College Freshman,1,Only allowed off campus housing when you're a junior or senior and 21 years old.
College Freshman,1,It's horrible. The police bust the Sport Houses on campus every weekend. There aren't any parties without drugs or alcohol which isn't fun. Drugs and alcohol is an issue
College Junior,1,The Union is the worst. Plus no matter where you are on campus you will pay more for your meal than you would at a restaurant. Because you're paying with Jacket Express (and paying the money back with interest for the next decade) they trap you and charge you an arm and a leg.
College Junior,1,I encourage anyone looking to live on campus to do an in depth financial analysis first and realize that you're easily paying double to live on campus as you would living off campus. The office of residence life contains absolutely awful people who will bully you and tear you down. If you have a problem it will not get resolved. If I knew as a freshman what I know as a Junior I would never have lived on campus.
College Junior,1,"Greek life here is absolutely disgusting. All of the chapters claim to be ""different"" and ""breaking stereotypes,"" but in reality they are nothing more than privileged kids acting like they're better than the rest of campus. They treat non-greeks poorly (if they acknowledge them at all) and half the events on campus are catered to only greeks. It's clique-y, and there is a lot more sexual assault involved in these groups than gets reported."
College Sophomore,1,The dining hall needs to be open later and have more options. I would like to see a healthier option for students that want to lose weight and not gain any. There should be lower prices for food that's healthier. I would like to see more food for a lower price.
College Sophomore,1,There is never anything open late. There is not a lot of drinking off campus. They are typically in freshman's dorms.
College Sophomore,1,the guys are not that nice or attractive. They think they are wealthy and they can have whatever they want since parents pay for everything.
College Sophomore,1,The process is very tricky. They don't provide much assistance.
College Freshman,1,"Bad, bad, bad. There's about two places to go."
College Freshman,1,None. Absolutely none. Unless your a music theater major. Everyone goes home on the weekends and everyone goes to bed at night.
College Freshman,1,It is so cold all the time which I am not used to.  It is always below zero and the winds are killers due to the lake being so close.  Thirty degrees is warm to me.  We have had so much snow too.
College Freshman,1,This school has a few bars that are only 21 & up. Parties are lame and hard to find for students who aren't athletes.
College Freshman,1,Welcome to the midwest. One day its sunny and 75 and the next day the temperature is 10 degrees. School rarely gets cancelled even if the campus is covered in snow.
College Freshman,1,Not very many options nearby. A few pubs and a couple of fast-food places. If you want something fancy or different its a hike.
College Sophomore,1,"With campus being divided by residential areas, the snow is bad because the residents don't shovel their sidewalks, so it's probably better to walk in the road then."
College Sophomore,1,"We get lake effect snow, wind and rain."
College Freshman,1,The only way you will get around town is if you have a car or if you have a friend with a car.
College Freshman,1,"Getting caught with alcohol or drugs is very bad here! Also they are very strict with who can have alcohol on campus, meaning even if your 21 no alcohol in your room."
College Freshman,1,"It's typical midwest weather. Cold, rainy one day. Hot and sunny the next"
College Freshman,1,"THERE IS NOTHING TO DO HERE! Berea is so incredibly small, and if anyone is looking for anything interesting, they have to head to Cleveland."
College Junior,1,"The University is 10 minutes away from CLE airport. There are no shuttles or buses, but we don't need them because the school's longest walk is 15 minutes. 

Freshmen can have cars on campus, but they have to park at the Fairgrounds. You can't park anywhere else without receiving a citation for $15. If you live in Heritage, Ersthausen, Carmel, or Constitution, it might be worth it, especially if you work. Any other residence halls are too far, and only worth the money for the parking pass if you work. If you live in Harding House, forget it."
College Senior,1,Very few scholarships unless you are an exemplary music major which I was not/
College Senior,1,"I haven ever seen the campus police, there aren't easily accessible emergency phones. The only building that has swipe access is the Lou Higgins and that is only because they want to keep track of people attending the gym, but don't actually care about people taking classes. Broken system."
College Freshman,1,Baldwin Wallace has a very diverse campus and takes pride in that. however i have heard from a lot of the ethnic people that they dont always feel accepted here.
College Freshman,1,you are placed into a parking lot and no consideration is taken as to where your dorm room is. I paid a lot of money to have my car on campus and I have to walk to the opposite end of campus just to get to it.
College Senior,1,"If you want to go off campus you better know somebody with a car. There is no bus system, no transit in walking distance. What is in walking distance are some grocery stores, convenience stores, and restaurants, but other than that you need a car."
College Senior,1,"Grade F. Dive bars, s****y house parties, and trashy clubs."
College Sophomore,1,"BW Is Strict – Like all other schools, plagarizing is punished severely, so the school policies are very strict about plagarizing. Also, people are continually cited for not having a parking permit. If you do not have a parking permit and you park in a school parking lot, they will ticket you. There is not many parking spaces on campus, so it is good that the administrators are so strict. Also, if you miss the class more than four times, it is threatened that you will fail the class. Some teachers are more strict about the attendance than others. Some don't care while others will fail anyone who does not attend regularly. Drinking and doing drugs is not supposed to be allowed."
College Junior,1,"Not Good – The food is too far away and a lot of people do not have cars. It only takes maybe 5 minutes to get to if you have a car however, It should be a little closer to the campus. The variety isn't great. Most people just eat Chipotle all the time. They also close up too early. After around 10 o clock there is basically nothing to eat except for pizza, and they are too starting to close earlier."
College Sophomore,1,Very Few Decent Halls – The resident halls are lacking to say the least. Only one dorm offers private bathrooms and there's an essay requirement before you are accepted and you have to take a class in that building. Ehause is the next best thing and its pretty great. Central air and a gorgeous lobby. However some rooms are bigger than others and the bathrooms only have two stalls and two showers. Everywhere else is just not up to par in my opinion. Much renovation is needed.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is horrible. The parking passes are way to expensive and there is not alot of student parking. There needs to be alot more parking.
College Senior,1,Rip Off – It's like a fight to get aid. BW would rather have poor kids come with gov't aid then intelligent ones.
College Senior,1,Hahaaha BW offers little parking for it's students. They are always getting rid of more and more parking spaces for some plan of theirs.
College Senior,1,"I HATE WINTER! When winter roles around, look out!  B-W barely closes for anything, it can be -1 degrees and classes would still be open.  They close once in a blue moon.  Classes may not be too far from the dorms, but its horrible walking to class trying not to slip on the ice or fall in knee-deep snow.  People don't shove their sidewalks, so students are forced to walk in the street!  When it gets nice, everyone cheers!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"You'd Best Have a Car – Pretty much, going somewhere off-campus: the RTA comes once in a blue moon, so that's out of the question.  The parking sucks, but if you have a car I guarantee you will be a whole lot better off get from point A to point B.  Otherwise, your hoofin' it or callin' a cab.  On-campus, like going to class, you can make it if you walk; takes no more than 5-15 minutes because the campus is small."

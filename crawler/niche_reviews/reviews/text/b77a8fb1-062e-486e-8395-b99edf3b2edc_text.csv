Sophomore,5,"I am attending Saint Joseph's College of Maine online, despite living near campus. It has been fantastic!"
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience with SJC has been very inclusive. I feel supported in my work and I don't feel as though the course load is too overbearing. While there are weekly lectures, materials, and homework to be completed each week, I still feel as though I have time for other aspects of my life as well."
Junior,5,Saint Joseph and the teachers who work there are amazing. They genuinely care about their students and make each person feel like they are important.
Junior,5,My entire degree is online. This is the best decision I have ever made. The online process is so easy.
Freshman,5,"This is the most welcoming college that I visited which is why, among many other reasons, I will hopefully be continuing my academic career as a freshman on campus this fall. Everyone on campus made me feel like I belong and that I will love it there."
Sophomore,5,"I like the campus which is small, friendly and supportive for growth. The professors are very interested in helping you to succeed. The athletics are very organized and great to be part of the Monks."
Senior,5,"I am finishing my BS degree this month, and am very happy I went with Saint Joseph's College of Maine Online Learning. The workload was heavy but manageable if you put in the effort. I feel that the staff and professors want you to succeed and are always willing to provide extra help. Tuition is reasonable and they use a lot of technology. I will be re-enrolling to obtain my Masters degree next year!"
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful, small campus with a vibrant student-based community. Saint Joseph's provides excellent academic resources for students and has a prestigious faculty that deeply cares about your success."
Freshman,5,"It is very fun and interactive. The staff is accepting to all their students. They are very organized and well understood.  There are many on-campus job oportunites that anyone can take part in. They are willing to train someone for a new position and are understanding. In all areas of the college, academics come first. All coaches know that academics come first. There are tutoring opportunities all the time for everyone. Professors are always willing to help their students if they need it. The food on campus is excellent and the staff is heart warming."
Sophomore,5,"I am going to be a sophomore at Saint Joseph's College of Maine this fall and thus far my experience here has been amazing. Because the school is so small (1,100 undergraduate) it truly feels like a community which makes me feel like I'm at home. The campus itself is gorgeous, and the location is perfect as it is only 45 minutes from my home town. Being right on Sebago lake, we get to swim in the fall and spring and ice skate in the winter. All of the faculty at SJC are committed to helping the students succeed, I truly feel like they care about making sure I learn as much as I can and are always willing to help even after class is finished. I have also been fortunate enough to get to play on the women's soccer team and see how the athletics at SJC are competitive, but also have helped me find life long friends. I could not imagine myself going to school anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,"When I came here I was greeted kindly and the campus was very hospitable, and the dorms were exquisite! The food was very good and they had a nice selection of things to eat. I loved it here and I would definitely recommend."
Sophomore,5,The school likes to change management a lot so adjusted to their subsequent changes can be annoying.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy my professors who take the time even though I am a remote student to connect with me and give me opportunities to delve deeper into the coursework. All of the staff are prompt on returning correspondance to me and making sure I understand what is needed before I move forwards.
Senior,5,Saint Joseph’s College of Maine has been an excellent college to attend on-line.  Professors are very understanding and the on-line courses are not as long as community colleges I’ve attended in the past. I strongly recommend it and encourage anyone who is not able to attend school to sign up to their on line programs- they have a vast variety depending on which degree you wish to fulfill.
Sophomore,5,"I love my school! Beautiful campus and wonderful, tight nit community. Its always a wonderful thing knowing that you have resources right on campus."
Niche User,5,The staff at Saint Joseph's College have been incredible to me. I have recently experienced some life changing events and the instructors as well as the faculty worked with me to complete my courses and gave me encouragement along the way.  Thank you all!! :-)
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman who lives in Cassidy dorm.  Everybody here is super nice and the classes are really entertaining.  I'm having a great first year and participating in the clubs is a really easy way to make friends
College Sophomore,5,"We offer a variety of programs from fine arts to business, to nursing. Since it's a liberal arts school, you will learn more than just your major which only helps you"
College Sophomore,5,"Campus safety is always around, you always feel safe where ever you're walking. You can call campus safety or the nurse at anytime"
College Junior,5,"The registration process is so easy, the staff are friendly and helpful. The workload is manageable and the professors are the best. I have not had a problem so far."
Alum,4,I think SJC did an outstanding job transitioning to remote learning despite what was going on. It wasn't perfect but all teachers worked extremely hard to continue learning and providing the support students needed.
Alum,4,"I was a huge part of the community, I was able to make amazing friends, be a resident advisor start my own club and participate in athletics. Saint Joes is a family, you know someone everywhere you go, and everyone is always so friendly and welcoming."
Sophomore,4,"I was drawn to my school for many reasons. The location of Saint Joseph's College of Maine is beautiful and is very connected with the outdoor life from which I am very accustomed to because I grew up in Maine. I also was looking for the best nursing program in my state and Saint Joe's is very well known for their well rounded nurses and 100% pass rate over the past 2 years. 
I have been going to Saint Joe's for 2 years now and before leaving due to the pandemic I spent lots of time on campus enjoying the sports and bingo nights with friends. The college has a very friendly and community based atmosphere that I really love."
Freshman,4,"I really love Saint Jospeh's College, the best part of this campus is the atmoshphere and community."
Sophomore,4,"The College has all was a nice atmosphere during all seasons. The community is great and you will all see people with a friendly face, and tons of groups/activities that you will not be bored on campus. Also, having Portland area nearby doesn't mean your out in the middle of nowhere. Teachers are also good maybe just a little homework heavy, but they have good office hours and love to help students understand what they are learning."
Niche User,4,It's a beautiful campus along Sebago giving the campus a lovely view and scenery. Saint Josephs also has excellent food.
Freshman,4,I’m a secondary Ed - mathematics major. St Joes is a beautiful campus but the snow removal sucks. Also some of the freshmen parking isn’t too great. Overall it’s a really great community and everyone is very friendly and welcoming.
Freshman,4,"Overall I've had a pretty good experience here at SJC! Their top strength is definitely Athletics as they have tons of consistent winning championship teams. If your a science, biology, or nursing major this is the school for you. some things I really don't like here is the food, diversity, and it's a massive party school for how small the campus is."
Freshman,4,"The environment is very welcoming and the campus itself is beautiful. The school is relatively small so its very comforting and easy to gain access to resources. The dorms are nice, the programs are fantastic and the food is great!"
Sophomore,4,"Although the campus is extremely small, it has its perks! The campus is beautiful and the view of  Sebago Lake is stunning. The short walk across campus makes the Maine winter months much easier, as well as helping us late risers get to classes on time. The sports teams all excel, but we could use more spectators at the games! Our academics are wonderful because our professors really get to know their students. The academic accommodations office is amazing at getting students the extra assistance they need in order to achieve greatness."
Sophomore,4,"I have only been there for a small amount of time, but in that time I can see that  everyone involved in the college is there to help you succeed."
Junior,4,"Saint Joseph's accepts students who are diverse in majors and offers the necessary classes to accommodate their needs. In addition, the professors and counselors are always willing to take the time to help each individual student to make sure that student succeeds academically."
Freshman,4,"This school is very small and close knit. The professors are always available for one on one time. The classes are small making it more personable. Sports are D3 and the whole school is there to cheer on every team. Only flaw is sometimes the food is not the best, but the veggies are almost always fresh from the farm across the street."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Saint Joe's. The students and staff are all very friendly and helpful. Because the campus is small, you truly get to know your professors and build strong relationships with everyone. The campus itself is beautiful, and on clear days there is a view of Mount Washington. The campus sits right on Sebago Lake, so if you enjoy the outdoors, there is a lot to do. The only down-side to this school is that there aren't many places outside of campus. To get to Portland, the nearest city, it takes 45 minutes to an hour."
Junior,4,"The teachers are great and they really help you to succeed. Very small college so I love that you're not just a number. Many great opportunities outside of the classroom. I would like to see the dorms be changed to more modern, include kitchens"
Senior,4,I am a student in the Saint Joseph's College's Graduate and professional studies program.  I am in love with the online format.  It is easy to use and allows me to continue living and working while studying. The professors are wonderful and provide helpful critiques.
College Freshman,4,Professors are so approachable and so caring.
Recent Alumnus,4,Suites and Pods are great.  All other housing is mediocre at best.
College Freshman,4,They try hard to prevent anything serious from happening and if anything serious does happen then there is proper punishment.
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman but so fair I've had a really good year here and hope i'm able to continue coming here for my next 4 years however, i would need financial aid to help with that."
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman but so fair I've had a really good year here and hope i'm able to continue coming here for my next 4 years however, i would need financial aid to help with that."
College Freshman,4,The house is well done with RA's being well trained to the house keeping dong a great job at keeping up with the cleanliness.
College Freshman,4,As the Assistant baseball manager I've come into contact with the Athletic programs here and I have to say they are well done. The coach is also very very good and always does everything in his power to help his men and others on campus.He expects us to help out around campus and be involved individuals that look out for the college community.
College Freshman,4,This college has been a very great time for me with everything on and off campus to do.
College Sophomore,4,"Since the class sizes are small, you get a lot of one on one time. Professors and other staff and students are always willing to help you out if you ask."
College Junior,4,I love this school. I participate through the online school. It is wonderful and I feel like the school truly wants me to succeed
College Junior,4,I love working with the professors. I am working toward my bachelors degree in Theology. I have found the curriculum wonderfully informative and appropriately challenging. CampusCafe has made registering for classes incredibly easy.
College Junior,4,I have loved attending this school and my two week session on campus was very educational. The school did as much as possible to make sure we had a lot available to us. The professors are wonderful and helpful.
College Junior,4,I am sure the school is very accepting to all students.
College Junior,4,"I am an online student, so I do not know much about the health and safety on campus. I am sure it is quite safe."
College Junior,4,"I am an online student, so I really cannot judge how good or bad the athletics are at the school."
College Freshman,4,I am enjoying the social life at St Joes very much. It has helped me bond with my teammates and other people on campus.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is great because I really have a sense of community with my fellow students.  The social aspects of campus life are very good. The campus is small so it's easy to get around. It is very cold here and we have had a lot of snow this winter.
College Freshman,4,There are many options within a 10 minute drive but if you are willing to drive a little more there are even more restaurants at a greater variety.
College Freshman,4,the administration provide a very safe and friendly environment.
College Student,4,They are very clean but kind of out dated
College Freshman,4,"Baseball and softball are the most popular sports on campus, whether its varsity or intramurals. Most students participate in at least one, sometimes more than one sport."
College Freshman,4,"There really are any campus crimes that have happened that i know of. It is a small school, where pretty much everyone knows everyone, or has at lead heard of, so i don't think people are willing to destroy their reputations for some as futile as a crime. I see security on a daily basis. They are actively engaged on our campus, and very friendly."
College Freshman,4,"We have things to do on campus, which is fairly small, but so many options outside of the campus. We live in a great college town, with a Walmart near by, restaurants, and some shopping stores. We are also a short drive to Portland, which is always fun."
College Sophomore,4,Few restaurants in windham but there are tons in the old port
College Sophomore,4,Personal safety is great on campus and you rarely hear of any assault issues
College Sophomore,4,Both the girls and guys are very friendly and everyone is looking to make new friends
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus in college is a must. You met great friends and create live long memories in the dorms together
College Sophomore,4,"Right on Sebago lake, it is beautiful during the fall and spring, however winter is cold and windy."
College Sophomore,4,"I am very satisfied with my education; however, Saint Joseph's College has limited courses within my business major. I can only afford this school."
College Sophomore,4,"Although courses offered are limited, the knowledge I've gain in just one year has been tremendous with the help of my very professional advisors"
College Sophomore,4,"As a nursing major it was pretty easy to get accepted to this program which is a big plus since this is a very competitive field. Unfortunately you are completely on your own in the graduate level for getting clinical placements which is very frustrating because you cannot finish the program until you complete three clinical rotations. The requirements for finding preceptors and the paperwork they have to fill out online is a bit of a headache too which makes it doubly challenging to get people to agree to help you. The classes are completely individual with readin gand writing- no video lectures, no interaction with professors except by email to answer specific questions you come up with about content and to let you know your payment was accepted. However, the books they use and the ability to complete the classes is a really nice feature when you want to keepw orking full time and attend graduate school."
College Freshman,4,Nearly all students get financial aid. The school is very gracious.
College Freshman,4,"Very understanding and know you're here for experience. Not going to go out of their way to get you in trouble. As long as you are being safe, and it's not openly obvious you will get along fine with administration and RA's. Judicial process is very fair"
College Freshman,4,Many of the guys on campus are very athletic and friendly. Many of the girls are nursing majors and are outgoing.
College Freshman,4,SJC offers free tutoring for its students and even provides an academic center where students can recieve help with writing essays and managing their time. These opportunities helped me succeed tremendously during my first semester.
College Sophomore,4,"70% Girls, 30% Guys. Largest major is nursing, which expains the high population of girls."
College Sophomore,4,Never have felt unsafe. Security is pretty visible and very friendly.
College Senior,4,It does not matter what type of food you like you have a choice for everyone.
College Senior,4,Their atheletics programs are great and have a lot to offer.
College Sophomore,4,Very high school spirt - especially for the basketball and baseball teams. Soccer also gets lots of recognition. Very good fan support. Facilities are nice.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are clean, room size is good, cost is average."
College Sophomore,4,"Not too far from Portland, ME. Lots of outdoors activities with Sebago Lake and the mountains close by."
College Freshman,4,You can find alcohol and marijuana really easily. Anything else I have not heard about but you probably could find if you looked hard enough.
College Freshman,4,"As it's been said for most guys there's a nice ratio of girls to guys being 7:3. Vast majority of people on campus are at least reasonably attractive. Very few and far between do you see/meet someone who you completely dislike. People will usually hold the door open for you if you're going in/out of the same area. Still are a few annoying sluts, stuck up guys and basically annoying but the nice people vastly outnumber the rude ones."
Sophomore,2,The dorms are terribly old and not updated. The student population acts no different then in high school and wont survive in the real world. The classes are incredibly poor with only a few good professors and non existent logic. The school offers no legitimate programs for furthering or preparing for professional careers. It's incredibly overpriced and not worth it. Find a better private university for the same price if not less.
Junior,2,"Very costly school, students will need to apply for lots of scholarships. The academics are quality, and professors teach well, but the directors of the school aren't fantastic. The way the school is run, it will be run into the ground within 5 years. There has already been a substantial amount of budget cuts in the 3 years I have been here. Make sure to pay attention to itemized bills. I have found many charges that aren't supposed to be there and have gotten my money back. Makes me wonder how much money students are paying because they aren't paying attention, and how much extra money the school is making off of us."
Freshman,2,There is not a lot going on for student's at this school. I did not find it academically challenging or rewarding. It is very much a commuter school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Security was initially laid back and would only take action to break up parties, etc. if they absolutely needed to.  By senior year, security would search for reasons to write-up any and everyone they could.  Security is too power hungry."
College Freshman,2,"There's a couple fast food chains around 10 minutes away, but other than that there's nothing."
College Freshman,2,"The whole financial aid department is around five people in the basement of a dorm. The school has a stated tuition of 40,000, but they give everyone ten to twenty thousand off as long as your not worth millions of dollars. The office is overworked and very difficult to communicate with. They will use money from your tuition checks and scholarships to pay off things like parking fines or building fees without asking. Basically it's bad."
College Student,2,"It's possible to get an apartment in Portland, but it's a pretty long commute."
College Student,2,"It's Maine. Your lucky if you can see the grass,"
College Student,2,"They don't care if you get drunk, but god forbid you park in the wrong spot during a massive snowstorm. Security and the RAs partol every two hours until 2am so if you have anything going on in your dorm or it smells like weed they'll let you know. You get written up 100% of the time a party gets busted, and have to go to a judicial meeting every single time. If there's one empty beer in a room with eight kids every one will get written up. One kid got kicked off campus for making a water bottle explode. Kegs are also completely forbidden on campus. They almost never search the rooms, so casual drinking is common, but if the rooms over capacity they'll crack down."
College Student,2,"They keep the dorms clean, but the rooms (especially the freshman male dorms) are incredibly small. You can usually touch both walls at the same time in the smallest dorms. It gets slightly better after freshman year, but your always going to be sharing a bathroom with at least a couple dozen people. The water comes straight from the lake and has a weird taste, so you'll definitely need to bring a filter."
College Sophomore,2,"Good restaurants about twenty five minutes away, not right near campus."
College Sophomore,2,Not much of a community feel at all.
College Sophomore,2,"We have terrible athletic fields, not one turf field on campus, spring sports forced inside until the sun cooperates."
College Sophomore,2,Not very diverse at all.
College Sophomore,2,Business Department hires adjuncts who are terrible and just read of slide-shows all class.
College Sophomore,2,No quality control from professors same dead beat professors year in year out and no formal review.
College Sophomore,2,Not many people do it.
College Sophomore,2,"Not many options, and meal plans do not equally pan out for the amount of meals you get to the amount of ""flex"" dollars you should receive for the plans in which there are fewer meals."
College Sophomore,2,"Old and dated computers, wireless access is testy and sometimes does not work at all."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is constantly changing. It could be warm one day and snowing the next, which really throws you off sometimes if you're coming from out of state. When it does snow a lot, everyone seems to aviod venturing off campus because of the slippery roads, which aren't plowed that well. When the weather is pretty warm out, most students go down to the lake and enjoy soaking in the sun and going for a dip."
Graduate Student,1,"I am going into my last semester of the FNP program. If you are considering SJCME for a graduate degree, look elsewhere immediately. This program is an absolute joke. Each semester is just copy and pasted from the semester before. There are SOME good instructors but overall, the rest are pretty horrendous. The instructors don't even make the quizzes they test you on and unfortunately are made up by a ""higher up"" individual who uses her 25 years experience as rationale compared to evidence based practice. If you are good at reading through 30 pages of textbook to study without ppts, you may benefit from this program. Also keep in mind, there are no weekly meetings just ""discussions"". 

I just want to put on the record I am doing well in this program, I just think overall this program is an abomination to medicine and would have quickly transferred if I knew it would have been this bad"
Freshman,1,"This school is a joke... campus safety officers all act like wannabe cops who find any and every reason imaginable to ticket you or get your vehicle towed away. Academically, I’ve wasted so much of my money on classes where the professors just don’t care. While there are a few good ones here and there, many of them couldent care less about your education and now with so few courses available to take, there’s really no choice. The food here is a joke as well, some of the nastiest looking meals I’ve seen. In regard to the party scene here, it’s non-existent. All you’ll find are a bunch of untalented and arrogant division-3 baseball players who think they’ll be in the MLB one day getting wasted, trying to get any girl with a drink in her hand to leave with them. To all prospective students...look else where. There are plenty of better schools for the price, don’t let them fool you during any visits or orientations!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have one because it is a small campus, but if we did, I only think we would benefit from it"
College Freshman,1,"It's the whitest catholic school in the whitest most catholic state. The school actually promotes LGBT and alternative sexualities, but the student body has their own opinions."
College Freshman,1,"Security is insanely overbearing and the school is in the middle of the woods so off-campus parties aren't an option. There are a few parties in the suites, but they get shut down and written up too often."
College Freshman,1,"The school requires freshman to purchase the most and expensive meal plan with the least variety, and they make it very difficult to change afterwards. The meal plan has an absurdly low amount of flex money and a ton of unredeemable meal swipes so you're forced to eat in the cafe. The cafe has fairly good food, but they only serve food during scheduled classes and stop serving at 6:30 p.m. So it's very difficult to get 3 meals a day. The cafe staff are either work-study students of incredibly rude and jaded adults. Over the weekend they actually lock students out except for a few hours and they only serve two meals. Unless you skip class to eat or buy you're own food you'll probably starve."
College Sophomore,1,The Suites and pods occasionally have a couple people but security cracks down a lot and its difficult to have any fun unless there's an R.A. over your shoulder the whole time.
College Sophomore,1,"You can't bring anyone on campus at all, unless you bring them through to security every single time they show up. They go through the parking lot and bill your student account directly if you park anywhere near the grass. The patrols will knock on your door for playing music anytime after 9p.m. and any kind of non-school related gathering gets shut down almost immediately."
College Sophomore,1,"Security harasses and abuses students. When it comes to issues about sexual assault and theft they couldn't care less. If you have more than seven people in your room or are smoking a cigarette in your room you can bet they'll be there, but if you get robbed they'll run to the police and say it's not their problem."
College Sophomore,1,"The school bough up almost all of the local land and they will not rent anything nearby to students. Portland is around half an hour away and its possible to get an expensive apartment there, but its not really worth it."
College Sophomore,1,"They state an insanely high $40,000 tuition so it looks like they're saving you money, but in reality the school is cheap. If you're paying less than community college prices to go here your getting scammed."
College Sophomore,1,"The school puts on a good show for campus tours and visitor weekends, but at the end of the day the food is usually poorly prepared and the same exact things every single day. They force religious food on you and claim to be Eco-friendly even though only 30% of their food is local. They also force certain groups of students to work on a campus farm for no pay."
College Sophomore,1,"Portland is in driving distance, but unless you have a car there's no way of getting off campus to do anything. The local area is all woods and quite rich housing."
College Sophomore,1,"Some dorms have asbestos in them, security loudly patrols constantly, and most of the walls do nothing to diminish the loud sounds."
College Sophomore,1,Every baseball player thinks they're better than everyone else.
College Sophomore,1,"They don't exist, the school would never allow any groups outside of sponsored clubs."
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,Most everyone is white and from the New England Region
College Sophomore,1,"Not diverse at all. Small Catholic college in a small town in Maine. Some diversity, but not much at all."
College Freshman,1,"Almost a caucasian (white) population. Very little diversity in race. Religon, it is a catholic college and does lean that way but it is not in your face. We do have people from all faiths deffinetly. Sexual orientation is pretty diverse for how things go and no one I know judges them. Political beliefs, we do lean democratic and liberal being in the north but there are deffinetly conservatives (from new hampshire) and rebuplicans here."

Niche User,5,"I went on a field trip to Florida Polytechnic University and let me just say that I loved the school. Most people would complain because of its small size, I how ever find it outstanding. Florida Polytechnic University is a tremendous advanatge over others in state Florida Universities. For starters, its small size allows professors to interact with students on a 1 to one basis. I saw this when I went their. Another advantage is the fact that its a 100% STEM school. The reason why thats great is becasue it sole purpose is to focus on STEM related attributes nothing else."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Florida Poly! I'm a '18 alumna and the university provided me with so many opportunities that any other state university just wouldn't have been able to provided simply because of their large size. This university allowed me to make life time connections with not only my peers, but with professors and staff members. The equipment that I was able to use was top of the line, but my favorite part was working on projects from the get-go. Being part of the inaugural class, many of my high school teachers and classmates were skeptical of the university. They questioned my decision of why I would attend here and turned down my acceptance at UF, but I saw the vision and believed in the university. I don't regret my decision one bit."
Alum,5,"N/A. I didn't have any online classes in my time of being a student. I know they have different option for students during the pandemic between in-person, flex, and completely online which is great for those students."
Alum,5,"I did not take any courses online, but I enjoyed all of my professors when I attended in person.  I would recommend to anyone."
Alum,5,I enjoyed my time at Florida Poly. I feel like it is a great place if you are interested in STEM and want to study in a small environment.
Graduate Student,5,I did not take any online courses but the online resources avialable while I was a student were helpful. Having access to a completely digital library made completing my thesis a simpler process.
Graduate Student,5,"I greatly enjoyed my time at Florida Poly but most appreciated the environment of support. My faculty were engaging, intelligent, and helpful. Having attending a small private institution for my undergraduate degree, I was shocked to experience the same student-centered approach at a state university. I am immensely grateful for my time at the university and how it has set me up for success in ym career."
Sophomore,5,Great flexibility and professors allowing for the right mix. The rigor is there but at the same time I feel safe in the pandemic.
Sophomore,5,"The curriculum pushes you to be a bigger and deeper thinker, while at the same time taking skill levels to high industry standards. Love the lack of typical distractions like fraternity row to focus on creativity."
Freshman,5,"I love Florida Polytechnic University for how adaptable it is. There are so many opportunities to grow within an area and if there is one that's not available but you want to seek it is so easy to start and many will join. Since it is a small campus, you make friends with almost everyone and each person is so nice and helpful. When you talk to staff, they are very polite and kind and comfortable to talk to. The only downside is there aren't a lot of food options on campus. Doordash and Postmates are not available due to location being in the middle of nowhere and you are stuck with a meal plan of less than average food if you live on campus and most students complain about it."
Freshman,5,Florida Polytechnic University is great for students who are looking to improve their understanding of a specific stem field such as electrical engineering. The project driven curriculum helps many stem focused people to learn hands on in the classroom.
Sophomore,5,"Florida poly sees me for me. At poly I am a person, not a number. There’s so many things to be involved in, take charge of, and change for the better. Everyone is open to all ideas and is all inclusive. As a freshman I created a club, became a member of 9 others, having different roles on executive boards, and traveled to two assemblies across the country, meeting some of the most important women in the space industry and in the United Nations."
Sophomore,5,If you are pursuing a STEM-degree this is your place to-go. Florida Polytechnic University is a place fulfilled with opportunity. This university will end up becoming one of the most challenging places on earning a STEM degree.  I believe in it.
Sophomore,5,"Florida Poly is the state's 12th and final public university, that strategically focuses solely on STEM and entrepreneurial education. As a student of this new university, I am proud to claim experiences that the vast majority of my peers at other institutions cannot attest to. The excitement of innovation, and the freedoms of that,  is powerful here."
Niche User,5,"The campus is simply amazing! They have two supercomputers, some maker labs, stuff for videogame design, video production, and probably other things that I am forgetting.
However, while they are a STEM only school, the course selections as of 2018 are rather limited. But, in the future, they should be a great little STEM colledge to attend. The classes, campus, and dorms were absolutely stunning as well."
Alum,5,Great specialized 4-year institution if you're looking for a STEM degree. Beautiful campus with small class sizes and your professors really get the chance to know you and what you're interested in.
Junior,5,The classes are all really interesting and there are unbelievably amazing labs and resources on campus. Lots of great research opportunities on campus as well. There’s also a focus on entrepreneurship and a lot of startups are on campus.
Senior,5,"Hoping to be a future student.  visited the campus and was very pleased with what they had to offer.  Security onsite, campus clean and in order.  Many majors to choose from. Professors are accessible through out the day. Small class size means better communication"
Niche User,5,Great school. Classes are small and very  challenging. They are lots of ways to get help on campus. Professor’s are excellent!
Freshman,5,Love the small classes and it is a lot less stressful than other bigger universities! I am much happier here than I was at my previous university in Florida.
Senior,5,"Florida Poly is a great university with tremendous potential, it will for sure rise in ranking and become one of the state's best universities."
Junior,5,"Very nice, modern, high tech university. Main building is an architectural gem, built by Santiago Calatrava. Hope it becomes more prosperous and prestigious as time passes."
Sophomore,5,"I've only been a student at Florida Poly for 1 year, but I already love this school and what it offers. Everything about the school promotes a close, student-focused approach to nearly every aspect of student life."
Senior,5,"I love Florida Polytechnic University! Everyone is really nice and helpful. I love the small classes, lab projects we do (example: building a heat exchanger), and learning to program. We get lectures and hands on experience."
Niche User,5,"Going to be attending there next year, so I haven't actually lived on campus yet, but from several visits there and input from my friend currently attending there, everything seems awesome. The campus looks beautiful, the professors are involved with the students, and the main academic building is absolutely fantastic! I honestly can't wait to go there and begin my studying."
Freshman,5,Great university if you're interested in the stem field. Very supportive in implementing new student ideas.
Sophomore,5,It has its growing pains and limitations but it offers a top notch education and experience. The innovative design of the classrooms and the small ratio of student to teacher makes getting an education meaningful.
Niche User,5,"Based on when I had come there by school field trips, the school is very advance in classroom technology. WIth these advancements the students are able to have a flexible education in out of the classrooms. Also the design of the school is also very amazing. The teachers are also up to date on the advancements in the technology. This the helps the students succeed in their studies."
Freshman,5,"Great school, meal plan not the best, expensive dorms so try to go somewhere off campus. Excellent teachers, ans small class sizes."
College Freshman,5,"For college courses I was a bit nervous at first, however it feels a lot better than high school."
College Sophomore,5,We have officers patrolling our school all day. Our school grounds are very open so you can see quite a lot in every direction which gives people a sense of openness.
College Freshman,5,They're pretty good. Small school with 0 crime whatsoever.
College Senior,5,"Small, interesting classes.  Professors go out of their way to be helpful."
College Senior,5,"Police are across the street from the dorm, buildings are locked with multiple levels of card access, rape buttons all over campus, and security staff survey the campus after-hours."
College Senior,5,"The dorms are new the appliances are great.  These are the best dorms, seriously."
College Senior,5,"Florida Polytechnic is great.  The lectures are always interesting enough and my peers are smart.  People complain about the food here, but they don't know how great they have it -- way better than pretty much anywhere.  It'd be nice if there was a swimming pool and they might have one next year but I'm not sure.  Lots of activities.  Like other universities, you get out what you put it.  Amazing facilities."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe at this school. We have an on-campus police and security force that does their best to protect us. If there is ever a problem, the proper authorities on campus are quick to resolve it."
College Student,5,"There are always University Police officers patrolling the area, which mostly they offer rides on golf carts to be nice to students and staff.  There is also a Safety advisor who goes to every lab class and discusses risks involved with the lab and safety procedures. All in all they are good people to know on campus!"
College Sophomore,5,All of my courses and professors have been great
College Sophomore,5,Great school. Everything is new and super innovative. Best decision I've ever made.
College Junior,5,"The professors I've had so far have all been of the highest quality, and a marked improvement over the previous public university that I attended. Classes are held to a 30-student maximum and taught in smaller classrooms, allowing students to have a hands-on learning experience. Every one of my professors this semester hold PhD's in Engineering-related fields and come either with hands-on industry experience or experience at a high level of academia."
College Junior,5,"I'm very happy that I chose to attend Florida Polytechnic University. The small student body and easy access to professors in office hours or at the various labs makes it a good environment for learning and studying.

The only negative I'd say is the lack of a physical library with private study rooms. While there are study rooms available, the facilities are lacking in comparison to most other state universities. The idea of having a ""bookless library"" is alright for doing research and accessing articles online, but I'd like to have more recreational reading opportunities on campus. 

That being said, from the time I walked in the door at the IST I was in awe of everything about it. The classrooms are state of the art, the research labs are easily accessible, and the professors are all very good at what they do. The focus on project-related curriculum and industry-level design is unlike anywhere else I've seen. I'm very happy to be attending Florida Polytechnic University and I believe the school is on the right track to become the top tech school in the region."
College Junior,5,"The school is designed to be very open and public no matter where you are. The campus is well-lit at night, the main building is open 24 hours and there is always some sort of faculty or security nearby in the event of an emergency. The school is top-quality."
College Junior,5,"When I applied to the school as a transfer (which was outside of their application dates) I received a phone call from the transfer admissions officer within a week of my application letting me know that they accepted me to the school. My transfer GPA wasn't anything to be desired, but they saw that I had recently improved and looked at my application on an individual level. I even received a 75% scholarship to the university.

I couldn't have asked for a better application process."
College Freshman,5,"the financial aid office is pretty nice about working out payment plans to get things paid for, most current year students have all of their classes paid for by school scholarships"
College Freshman,5,They have awesome engineering facilities here at Poly. The whole school is set up for engineering and software majors. I'm doing computer engineering/
College Freshman,5,We have transfers from Stanford and a few from MIT.
College Freshman,5,"Top notch professors and classes here, a lot of professors have their own companies and what not. They're incredibly intelligent and are all willing to help each student out."
College Freshman,5,"amazing local recreation, beautiful lakes, and social hot spots. cheap gas."
College Freshman,5,The inaugural scholarship covers the entire tuition. The school also accepts bright futures and has a bridge program for Fl Prepaid
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are a little on the expensive side but they are incredibly nice. Everyone has their own bedroom, each suite has their own washer/dryer, the bedrooms are spacious for being a dorm. The common areas are super nice and come with a tv, a full sized fridge, a microwave, and a decent kitchen area."
College Junior,5,"Because of it being a new school there starting from a new slate. So they want to make students happy and have a good college experience. but they do make school come first. Attendance policy for most of my classes are strict but as long as you show up and do your work they will help you with anything you need.

Plus they are very open to ideas so if you have an idea just let an administrator know they are very open with students."
College Junior,5,"Very Luxurious. Apartment style, Bigger beds, 42in Flat screen TV in the living space included. THATS AMAZING. A lot of students love hanging out not just in the dorms but the clubhouse. which include ping pong table pool table and like a 60 in TV where students are always playing games on. IT AWESOME"
College Junior,5,Health and security is very good. We have our own private security on campus (24/7) along with our own established police force. Multiple police cars and carts. You always see a presence of safety every where you go.
College Junior,5,The off-campus Housing is some of the best selection of apartments that lakeland has to offer. Great and safe environment.  Very affordable and the Landlords or management try their hardest to get you in the for the most reasonable price
College Junior,5,Students all together are very active makes it alot more fun. we dont have Competitive sports but Intramural's will definitely be a big deal here. the workout facility and sports complex will be and are top notch equipment.
College Freshman,5,Off-campus housing is under 5 minutes away and very reasonably priced
College Freshman,5,The social life is super awesome
College Freshman,5,"I'm not one for arts, or sports, so this university is the best option and is ideal for me as an engineering student."
College Freshman,5,I have friends in USF and UF and they're in the same programs that I am.  In one week we have covered more material and learned more here than in those two universities.
Sophomore,4,"I have been a student at Florida Polytechnic for three semesters and have taken numerous different types of courses from physics to programming. In that time, I learned that this school has a lot going for it. The campus itself is small compared to other universities because it is still brand new and expanding which is a benefit because I do not have to spend thirty minutes walking to and from my classes and the campus community is also more connected due to the smaller amount of students. The professors are incredibly helpful and have helped me and other students when we needed extra help when we asked them for it. This school also makes sure that its graduates are able to get jobs in their dream profession by having it be a requirement to complete at least one internship before graduating.  If there is one criticism I have, it is the fact that they do not normally have online courses which surprises me due to how small the campus is as well as how many people live off-campus."
Sophomore,4,"Interesting students, the teachers mostly know what they are talking about,  however the social life definitely needs improving as most students aren't sure on how to make friends or even where to begin when starting a friendly conversation. The female to male ratio also could use adjusting as the current female percent ratio is about 14%."
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID 19, I have recently  started taking my summer courses online and that immediately stunted my motivation and growth as it can be hard to focus on and even enjoy my learning as there is a literal pandemic going on that causes such anxiety for the community as well as the BLM protests which I do agree with."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very quiet. There are many student activities throughout the semester, which makes up for the campus' localization. Classes are small and easy to focus and understand."
Freshman,4,Florida poly is a pretty good school. The classes are small which makes it easier to actually know your professor. I also feel like i'm actually learning something. Some of the course material can be bland but the professors try to make it more enjoyable.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I really like Poly for everything they try to do. It is a great choice for anyone looking for a STEM degree that prefers smaller class sizes and a (sometimes) more hands on experience. Most of the staff and faculty are very nice and helpful, the campus is gorgeous albeit small, and the overall vibe of Poly is pretty unique and fun. With it being a newer school, there are some growing pains, but it is in most situations understandable. Here's hoping that they can sort out the few poor aspects soon, because Poly has so much potential."
Freshman,4,"The small class sizes make it easier to interact with the professors. There is also a huge focus on projects which is a great way to prepare STEM majors for the work force, but the school definitely has some growing pains that need to be addressed. The best thing to do is not complain and try to take part in improving the school as a whole."
Junior,4,This school is a phenomenal school for engineers. Easy to get to your classes. Even though the classes are tough the professors will get out of their way to help you one on one.
Sophomore,4,Incredible campus with nice dorms and very sophisticated classrooms and labs for students. Great professors with office hours every week and experience.
Freshman,4,"All I can say is that the pool finally opened. Its a newly made small campus, with a new wellness center being built next year to improve on the gym. It fun and small, but with it being a STEM based college, some of the classes can be tough."
Junior,4,"I am a student at this University and I have to say that I am excited for the future of this college. Although there have been some rough patches with scheduling and hiring new faculty (which is to be expected with a brand new university),the entrepreneurial spirit is abundant here. I am only a junior at this University and I have already filed a University supported patent, won a University engineering competition, headed and shaped the Women in STEM Leadership program, started the SWE chapter, was a treasurer for the ASME chapter, spoken at University donor events, and know the University’s president personally among many other achievements. My point is that at this University the sky's the limit, the University staff are extremely supportive of student’s ambitions and, due to small class sizes, are able to provide help individually if needed. Here I can get a good quality education and gain leadership experience both of which are vital to my success as an engineer."
Sophomore,4,"I love the personal feeling with professors and the close nit groups that are here. Party life is either non existant or a sausage fest, it's in the middle of no where and has a good staff."
Sophomore,4,I have found the classes and professors of Florida Polytechnic to be some of the best. They challenge the students with technology related work that relates to their chosen fields of study.
College Freshman,4,Its a small campus at the moment so security is easily accessed at all times.
College Freshman,4,For dorms these rooms are more like miniature apartments. Cost and all....
College Freshman,4,"A lot of aspects need to be improved on since this is a fairly new school, however I believe it can turn out great."
College Sophomore,4,"In terms of ethicity and economic background, there is diversity. In terms of other categories, it is very difficult to determine how diverse it is."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is small and most people are either not social or too busy with classes or campus involvement. If there was a problem with drugs, it's either discrete or off campus."
College Sophomore,4,The courses that are offered are geared towards STEM degrees. You won't find any easy classes. You must work hard for them. Environment is good enough to handle the workload.
College Sophomore,4,"As far as I know, there is very little campus crime. The campus police are friendly and make you feel safe. They even offer rides to your car when needed."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is very diverse, and all the students are really good with accepting different races, ethics and religions."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel really safe all around the school, I thin the police officers are amazing and everyone do a great job while taking care of us."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the dorms and all the people that work, the RA's are great too and help us students a lot."
College Sophomore,4,"I really liked it so far, but I do believe that there are a couple of things that the school needs to work on it, but we know that the school it is really new and it will get better with time."
College Sophomore,4,Can't complain. New school with new opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,The courses are very cool because everything has been handpicked and narrowed down to just the things that you need to know. Also the class sizes are nice and small.
College Sophomore,4,Quite often my school invites a person from one of our partners and has them talk about their profession. This allows students to get a sense of what they will do out in the field.
College Sophomore,4,The school has a nice big soccer field with basketball courts and tennis courts off to the side. There is also a sand pit for volleyball. The Fitness Center is very nice as well.
College Sophomore,4,The school is very forward thinking with it's curriculum and classes. There are 50 3D printers available to the students.
College Freshman,4,I'm succeeding with the help of friends and professors.
College Sophomore,4,"Florida Polytechnic University was a great decision for me.  The classes are small, and professors are generally very helpful.  Unfortunately, we are located in the middle of cow pastures - which I don't mind, but some students do.  The small size of the university certainly makes for an intimate atmosphere, but makes choosing classes difficult with so few students to fill them."
College Sophomore,4,"This school is still working on accreditation, so obviously we are all taking a huge risk by coming here. Poly has promised to connect students with job opportunities and internships as well, which is a huge plus."
College Sophomore,4,"All of the professors I've had are mostly great. I've heard some complaints about some professors, but have managed to steer clear of them. The ones I've had all seem to care very much about the success of the student as long as we're willing to put forth the effort."
College Student,4,The school has a job preparation site called purple briefcase that helps to get those with concerns on track for placement when they graduate.  The down side of the school at this moment is that it is still seeking accreditation so some internships are unavailable to the students at this moment.
College Student,4,"Being in the school of Electrical Engineering the class load is difficult as expected.  Being a new school only one or two classes and class times are offered for some core requirements, which makes scheduling difficult.  The class sizes are great for getting to know your professors, and the professors care for how their students do.  At this moment the school only has about 1,000 students so it is hard to go unnoticed.  For the classes there has been lots of competitions to make them enjoyable and you have to present your understanding of topics and or designs for a lot of the engineering classes.  Only downside is the size of the school since the last University I attended was 45,000+ students in Buffalo, NY."
College Junior,4,"While I haven't been through the internship process at the school yet, things are shaping up to be very industry-oriented. There are a number of industry events held at the school and it seems like there are always professionals touring the facility or giving talks during the school year. The school's design curriculum (which starts up next year) allows students to work on actual industry projects with companies in the area. At this point, I'm happy with how it is set up."
College Freshman,4,"Though it is super small and in the middle of nowhere, it is a really nice school so far."
College Sophomore,4,"It was the first year the University opened and we were the Inaugural Class. It was such an honoring experience to be a part of that and shape history for incoming students. Of course there were fallbacks and failed projects, but that is like any new school that opens. I'm so glad and proud to be a part of Florida Polytechnic University. I was a part of the choosing the official mascot, the Phoenix. I am excited to see my university grow and I can't wait to visit in 10 years and know I was the first."
College Freshman,4,The college is a homely place that is fun to experience.
College Sophomore,4,A living person has always been in contact with me.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a city bus that takes you to some places nearby, but it's better to have a car around at your disposal. There are very few clubs options, but haven't been there to see how they are."
College Junior,2,"There is a lack of an actual devotion to athletics. While the sports fields have gone in, there has not seemed to be a very focused effort on forming a college level team for any sport."
College Freshman,2,There's no set athletics yet.
College Freshman,2,We don't have any Fortune 500s recruiting here. Lack of accredidation prevents us from doing alot and prevents students from participating in certain programs/jobs.
College Freshman,2,"Small class sizes. However, no jobs or night life within 10 mile radius. No greek life. Campus isn't diverse. You need a car or it's going to suck."
College Freshman,2,"Lack of accredidation is the biggest burden. Students are ignorant and school is not diverse at all. Lack of name recognition, kind of embarassing to be here."
College Freshman,2,"Super nerds, but you get what you come for, so I'm one too."
College Freshman,2,"I've heard plenty of complaints about water temp, wireless access, and noise. but the architecture and build quality re top notch."
College Freshman,2,Not many parties going on at all on campus. I can't speak for off campus though.
Junior,1,"I have never had the displeasure of having to work individuals that are this incompetent. The staff at the university has no clue what any one else is doing and they act like it. If your goal is to run around trying to get information from a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off, attend Florida Polytechnic. Their incompetence is unrivaled and anyone that says different has their head up their ass."
Niche User,1,"This school does not give the proper support to students.  They are more interested in making sure all the students boost their GPA's to be sure the school looks good.   I am disappointed at how much this school gets away with.  I believe they create a more toxic environment for the students, faculty and staff.  Everyone has to go with their rules, no matter how unreasonable they are, and they ignore feedback."
Junior,1,"Corrupt school. The school is a rip off and doesn't care about its students. Not to mention the fact that the school is surrounded by cow pastures, meaning you have to drive at least ten minutes on I-4 or on highways to get to town."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only events rather than parties. If there are any parties, it would be off campus"
College Junior,1,"The school was not ready to be a school when they admitted students. Lack of accreditation notwithstanding, most of the professors are unable to effectively teach their subjects and when those who lie higher on the ladder of power, if you will, are approached they claim there is nothing they can do to fix this. The school itself is located in the middle of nowhere with nothing for quite a while leaving students with little options as far as decompressing after classes. The bus system is extremely flawed with the busses occasionally not showing up around the scheduled time if at all."
College Freshman,1,No Greek life at all.
College Freshman,1,There are no sports teams yet.

Junior,5,"My first two years of college has been an experience that no other college could have possibly provided. Because of this school, I have received state and national awards and am currently working with analysts in D.C. to help spread the word that continuing education within community colleges is crucial. There are few things I would change, but most of them are mechanical and have nothing to do with the staff inside the school. The instructors care more than anyone else about their student's success."

I love all the courses they offer and they really help you plan for your future and give you steps to make those goals happen! I couldn't have picked a better college to attend.

Junior,5,"Lake Washington Institute of Technology doesn't just make you feel like one student in a sea of thousands. This school employers great staff, advisers and educators, and you can see the affect this has on those that attend. For a smaller, more personable feel (with education as great as any university, but perhaps more opportunities for practical, hands on experience to help you in the workforce - LWIT might just be the school for you!"
Junior,5,I have been to a few community colleges and Lake Washington is great. Their campus is new and up to date. I am going to be in the Dental Hygiene program and their clinic is one of the best I have seen. Their teachers are great and really want to make sure the students are succeeding.
Sophomore,5,"I began going to Lake Washington Institute of Technology as a Running Start student during my senior year of high school, and I am currently finishing up my final class requirement to obtain their Business DTA. Overall, I have been highly satisfied with the experience that I have received at LWTech. The smaller class size allows for greater interaction between students and instructors, which I believe has helped me and my classmates to get a better understanding of the subjects we are learning. Most of the teachers here have worked in the industries they are teaching about, and many of them have also taught at other colleges and universities. Their experience has allowed them to enhance our learning experience and to provide us with career advice. LWTech has many helpful resources, including tutoring and financial assistance opportunities. I think that LWTech does an excellent job of making sure that every student has the resources and support that they need to succeed academically"

College Freshman,5,"I'm extremely impressed with the professors I've had the chance to encounter so far.

College Freshman,5,"I come from the opposite environment, so it was an amazing feeling to attend school again.

I am really happy to be in college."

I have met some of the most interesting people there that are all about helping others and giving back to the school. I am very encouraged by this and I am currently looking for my own direction. In the past, I ahve not done much community service, now that I see the importance of it, I plan to change that. There is not an actual atheletic center and no school sports teams, but we do have a fitness specialist/personal trainer program on campus. This school has everything I need to get my education and advance my career."
College Junior,5,"My specific classroom actually has amazing computer resources including some software you will not find many places. There is also a medical wing that has the most advanced technology on campus. The electronics lab has more individual labs than I will have time to complete in my 2-years. The library has just about every software program that you could need in a technical college, and even a few things you wont find in many schools. My guess is that upon further inspection, we could easily find many technological resources here that aren't widely available. "
College Junior,5,"I have had my tuition covered with financial assistance and federal grants from the start, and since I have been applying for scholarships to help cover my living expenses and material costs. I spoke to an advisor who directed me towarsds some other finacial assistant programs, including grants. They have been very helpful and have helped me to get one quarter of tuition paid as well as covering some book costs. "

College Junior,5,"I have heard several students talking up the school, and I didn't want to sound that way, but the truth is that it is a great school. The price for residence is awesome and less than half comparable private school rates. The teachers are very knowledgable and many are former professionals in the fields we are studying. My electronics instructors come from the real world as electronics professionals, and one even worked as an electronics techician in a nuclear submarine. My psycology teacher was also a military trained professional, and they give new insights to their fields you wont find very many places. "

Graduate Student,1,Literally the least empathic teachers EVER during COVID!!! I had such an amazing experience with pre-requisites and thought that I would have a similar experience in the Dental Hygiene program; but that is FAR from true. The worst place to go for hygiene school. Money DRIVEN and disgusting!!!!

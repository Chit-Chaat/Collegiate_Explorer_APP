Freshman,5,"I am a current Freshman and so far, it is a great experience. Despite the issues with Covid, the staff and teachers have made me feel comfortable to attend classes in person. The dorms are nice and safe distances in the dorms are required. The education is rigorous; however, there are tutors available and study groups too."
Freshman,5,"I attend classes in person but the technology to study with peers via Zoom has been great. I also can ask questions to my teachers via online media or Zoom. Students I have classes with have said it a great opportunity to have classes online and communicate with peers and faculty. I am still learning the campus but again, it is a great experience and I do recommend future students to look into this campus and determine if it fits their education needs."
Freshman,5,Great academics. Wonderful options to combine undergrad and grad programs to save time and money.  Admissions and academic counselors are so helpful and genuinely care.
Sophomore,5,My experience at STLCOP has been positive. All the professors are helpful and considerate. Everyone is so nice and friendly. I like it here.
Junior,5,"I love this program so far, even though I'm new. The thing I love best about STLCOP is that the professors care so much about how their students are doing and the grades they're receiving. It makes it a very comfortable environment to go to school in!"
Niche User,5,"I recently visited St.Louis College of Pharmacy for the first time during a Preview Day, and I was no less than satisfied. I loved the environment that this school had to offer: it was clean, organised, and just the perfect size. I hope to one day attend this school."
Sophomore,5,"This college is so amazing. The people there are so generous and helpful. They make you feel like family there. All of the curriculum is based on pharmacy, so everything you need to know about becoming a pharmacist is there. I highly recommend to anyone out there wanting to pursue pharmacy as a career."
Freshman,5,St. Louis College of Pharmacy is full of caring students and professors. This school has a close knit bond that does not ever fail to help struggling students.
College Student,5,"We don't have a health center, but we're literally surrounded by hospitals, so it really isn't an issue. We're a tiny campus with tight security and as far as I know, there are very few (if any) incidences of sexual assault, none of which occur on campus."
College Student,5,We're smack-dab in the middle of St. Louis. Really?
College Student,5,"As a good kid, I like that they're strict about things like alcohol and drugs (we're going to be pharmacists, come on.) If you show up drunk, you just have to be able to make it to the elevator without giving the front desk a reason to get you in trouble and you'll be fine to go back to your dorm. There's very limited parking. Honor code is law and life. Attendance usually isn't a big deal unless it's a small class."
College Sophomore,5,"While some places you'll pay a pretty penny, the school being directly beside the Central West in means a LOT of different restaurants, and with how big the city is after that the possibilities are endless."
College Freshman,5,Academics are taken very seriously at STLCOP. Everyone is in the accelerated program for Pharmacy. Going to a school with everyone with the same major makes it convenient.
College Student,5,"Although the area isn't the best in St. Louis, there are plenty of security officers and lately, we have implemented several security devices."
College Student,5,"I absolutely love the given laptops! They work amazing and since everyone has the same laptop, it's easy to help each other out with technical difficulties. Most of the time, however, tech support is available. Printing was a hassle at one point but it is now smooth and reliant. Wireless networks work great too."
College Student,5,This is a very diverse school.
College Freshman,5,The entire school is centered upon pharmacy so upperclassmen are very helpful and easy to talk to. The school has a very warm and welcoming atmosphere where students are encouraged to talk to upperclassmen and professors for help and to work together to solve problems.
College Freshman,5,Majority of the professors have a doctorate degree and are beyond qualified to teach the students. The workload is a lot but is centered upon student rather than homework so students can best determine when and how to study. 
College Student,5,"I never heard or seen drugs in school campus.

Our college is small so most of students won't try.
"
College Sophomore,5,The majority of the organizations on campus are professional pharmacy-based. They allow great opportunities for students to get involved in pharmacy and the medicinal aspects of society.
Sophomore,4,All of the professors are very considerate of their policies when we went online school because of COVID-19.
Freshman,4,"I am currently looking to go here. Itâ€™s a smaller school, but is in a really nice area. It also has a great community with a lot of clubs and Greek life. The opportunities are endless. I also like it because you still have time to change your mind. They have other health care professions, and are opening up even more in 2021."
Graduate Student,4,"St. Louis College of Pharmacy is about the journey AND the destination. Everyday you are forced to be better. It's all about the small victories piling up to one huge victory on graduation day. A good number of times you will wonder if you can actually make it; I believe with friends, hard work and a bit of luck you can too. Overall, a very good institution prepares you for the real world and encourages you to be the best you can."
Sophomore,4,Stlcop has a beautiful newly constructed campus. Everyone here is very welcoming and helpful because they all want to see you succeed. Classes are made easier because peers are always there for assistance as well. Teachers try hard to teach effectively and overall do a great job.
College Student,4,"There are know issues with safety when you are on campus, there are security guards everywhere. That is mostly because of where the school is located, so do not be alarmed campus is safe, just use common sense late at night. If you want food have it delivered many places deliver to campus."
College Student,4,"There are some courses you will wonder why you have to take them, but they usually aren't too bad. The professors are helpful when you ask questions. The class sizes vary from a few people to every one in your grade, 200ish people."
College Student,4,"So far at STLCOP, there are good things and bad things like any other school. One of the bigger draw backs is that most people are focused on studies rather then making the most of college. Although, if you come to the school realizing that this is a pharmacy school and you are expected to study and do well to more on. Here you do not have to compete with other students for spots in the professional program so everyone is willing to help each other out if they need it with tutoring or study guides for exams and even getting jobs. So for me the benefits out weigh the drawbacks because even if I went to a different school I would not have done much else besides studying."
College Student,4,"The courses are difficult, but professors try to be as helpful as possible."
College Student,4,There is a good alumni network. Job prospects are very high.
College Student,4,"Sororities and fraternities are not huge, but they are some of the biggest extra curricular activities available."
College Student,4,"No one here judges you if you do awful or fail a class. Everyone is here to help. It's a small school so it's easier to stay focused on the big picture, especially since all the students or working towards the same degree."
College Sophomore,4,"The past 3 years at St. Louis College of Pharmacy have been the most difficult and rewarding years of my life. I went there straight out of a small town high school. StLCoP is a small college in the middle of a rather large city, but it still manages to make each and every student feel unique and valued. However, the college just changed from a 6 year program to a 7 year program. In light of that, I would not have chosen to attend StLCoP."
College Student,4,I love how everyone is working towards the same common goal.
College Student,4,"Nobody really cares if you are part of it or not. There are no sororities, but there are two all-female fraternities and one co-ed fraternity. There are one or two all-male fraternities, but as a general rule, none of them get too cliquey. You also can't pledge until your second year."
College Student,4,Less than a 5 minute walk from rolling out of bed to being in class. Tiny campus means that I can look out my dorm window and see every building. Only one res hall. Very expensive but it's the only option.
College Sophomore,4,"While the actual diversity may seem to be a little lacking (or at least we were told it is....), the campus is extremely accepting of various everything and has many multicultural events and organizations, as well as groups for different religions, and a GSA."
College Sophomore,4,"Since I am very certain I want to go into pharmacy, I can't think of anywhere else I would want to go that would offer me the same things.  STLCOP is difficult, but we all get through it together."
College Sophomore,4,"Since we are future health care professionals, it makes sense that we are held to certain standards."
College Sophomore,4,"We all understand one another, that's for sure - one of the best benefits of being a sole-focus college.  It is definitely extremely strenuous, however."
College Sophomore,4,"STLCOP is definitely unique in that it only offers pharmacy degrees and their related classes, while also offering us some outside enjoyment in the arts and athletics."
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life is a huge part of the college experience. Personally, I think joining Greek life at STLCOP will make the overall academic challenges easier because of the greek support system."
College Freshman,4,I am not a Greek but its good to learn Greek culture & get to know them closely.
College Student,4,It's a dry campus and it's enforced through hefty fines.
College Freshman,4,"The school offers students a parking garage, which is right on campus and extremely convenient to get to classes and the dorms. Although it serves as a convenience, the cost of the parking permit is a bit on the high side, which can deter students from applying for one. For those who don't have a parking permit, the parking enforcement team offers rides to nearby locations. Overall, the parking at school is very much accessible. "
College Freshman,4,"St. Louis College of Pharmacy does not have a problem with drug safety. We are a dry campus, so students are not allowed to bring alcohol onto campus. Those who do are faced with immediate consequences. Also, the school requires a drug test from each student, so this deters students from partaking in any drug related activity. Due to the lack of drug activity on campus, peer pressure is not really an issue. Although there are very few students who use drugs, it is not to the point where it would put the entire campus in danger. St. Louis College of Pharmacy is a very safe place to be and it reinforces strict rules and policies against drug and alcohol use. "
College Freshman,4,"St. Louis College of Pharmacy is a great school for those who are interested in a pharmacy career. It provides students with excellent staff and faculty and prepares students with rigorous courses that are challenging and thought provoking. The smaller class sizes give an advantage to all students, as it is more likely for more one-on-one student and faculty time. The program is designed so that all students take the same courses. This is beneficial in that students have multiple ways to get academic help if needed. Because of the challenges of the program, students are supportive of one another and help each other get through the program. It is a great school to learn about pharmacy, community, and empathy. "
College Student,4,"I like the teacher, students and the atmosphere of the college."
College Student,4,No matter what weather it is there is always places by the campus to relax and take a break
College Student,4,There is a lot of diversity on the campus and most of the students are accepted to who they are.
College Student,4,There is a metro station right behind the school so it is easy to go for shopping.
College Student,4,personally I have not gotten into one but the people in each frat have seem to be helpful and really great.
College Student,4,Everyone is strict to make sure you have got the job done right.
College Student,4,They got a variety of choices.
College Student,4,It has the feel that involves everyone no matter what race or how you behave.
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of apartments around the campus and are in walking distance. The price is reasonable but is a lot cheaper if you share with other roommates.
College Freshman,4,"There are always security guards situated around campus and they are all very friendly and willing to help. However, there isn't even a nurses office on campus. However, there are hospitals around that security can drive students to."
College Freshman,4,It's very convenient to live on campus because all of the buildings are nearby so you don't have to worry about being late for classes. It's also a great way to meet new people and know more about people in your year as well as upperclassmen RA's.  
College Freshman,4,The city where our school is located is very nice with lots of stores and shops to look around. There are a ton of things that students can do off campus and can easily ride the metro link to go to other places. 
College Student,4,"My college offer to most of enrolled students who has certain SAT/ACT scores.

It is awesome because it reduces weight of tuition.

But they require GAP 3.0 every fall semester, career GPA.

Since our school is pharmacy school and students who are not study enoughly enough easily loses it."
College Student,4,"The college is located in the central west end, which in my opinion is the best neighborhood in St. Louis. There's good access to public transportation, museums, Forest Park, and some shopping centers, but parking is hard to come by and it's very expensive. Because it's located on a medical campus, there are always people around and it's a very safe area, but it can be inconvenient for people who prefer a quieter life style."
College Student,2,"This is more of a medical school. Not too much of a focus on athletics, more focused on academics. We are getting a new athletic complex tho, so that should make it better for athletes."
College Student,2,our school is mostly focused on studies
College Student,2,The people are not that friendly and thefts have seem to happen around
College Student,2,The outside neighborhood is not friendly and has a lot of stealing and theft
College Student,2,"The school is not very diverse. If you are looking for diversity in a school, STLCOP is not a great choice because it is so small and they don't accept people based upon ethnicity or race. However, the school does have a wide range of economic backgrounds, though I feel most students here are from more wealthy backgrounds, especially with tuition costs being so high. The school is accepting of others with all religious beliefs and sexual preferences. There are clubs like CRU, for Christian students and CSO for Catholic students. There is also a GSA for students with any type of sexual orientation"
College Freshman,2,We all have our own computers given to us by the school. We have all up to date software and a moderate IT department. We always have a great deal with printing.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a parking garage but not everyone gets to use it. The off-campus lot is about 4 blocks away, but usually students only have to use it for a year. There is another lot available for use right next to the campus that is available for students after a certain time. It's not the greatest, but the school is working on making it more convenient."
College Student,2,"The weather is very random. One day can be hot and humid, and the next could be cold and snowy. Very unusual weather."
College Student,2,Student Discounts â€“ I am truthfully unaware of student discounts in the surrounding area of my school.  It would be beneficial that if certain places have student benefits to broadcast or show they have them. It would also be good for some places to offer them if they don't already.
College Student,2,I've only lived on campus so far so I don't know how helpful I will be.  On campus is safe.  I'm a little concerned with off campus housing because the area isn't very safe.  There are two other large universities close by so the off campus housing is competitive.
Graduate Student,1,"The tuition amount reported is highly inaccurate. I was just charged over 20,000 for this semester ALONE. Base tuition/semester is ACTUALLY $17,878. Plus cost for summer rotations, an additional ~4K. Add 800/yr for a laptop that isn't worth that; 1K/yr for parking; I also get to fight over space w/ students from Goldfarb that don't pay tuition to go here. Add in fees for student activities, a MANDATORY orientation EVERY YEAR, a health clinic that you'll never use. The fees rise every year (parking increases $100/yr), tuition increases every year; the VALUE significantly DECREASES each year. President cares more about athletics (we are NOT an athletic university, stop trying to make it one!). Unless you are part of LGBTQI community, member of a minority, or part of athletics, you will most likely get denied scholarships. The amount awarded in financial aid is minimal, & I will have 200K+ in loan debt. STAY FAR AWAY FROM HERE. Professors are great, President/Board are among the worst."
College Student,1,"We're a pharmacy school. We don't have a gym, and our sports are sad. They exist, but that's the extent of it."
College Freshman,1,Not much goes on fraternities and other organizations try to have activists but they are few and far between
College Freshman,1,"Awful we have one dining hall that is expensive and often has the same food over and over again. It closes early so your only late night options are bringing something, vending machines, delivery, or leaving and picking something up (all a hassle)"
College Student,1,There is a parking garage and an off campus parking lot. The garage is nice but not everyone gets to park there. The off campus lot is terrible. You have to be shuttled over by a bus because it is so far away and not in the best part of town. The parking permits are pricey too.
College Student,1,Social Life â€“ Social life or should I say lack of it.  Too busy studying.

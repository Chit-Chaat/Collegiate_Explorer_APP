Sophomore,5,"Tiffin University has created a positive learning environment for student off all their different academic schools. They provide good opportunity for financial help between Aid and Scholarships to provide student to receive a good education at this private school. My first year at TU gave me amazing experience and I learned so much from my professors and fellow students. I would absolutely reccommend Tiffin to student looking for a smaller school. And as a Student ambassador, I also know a lot of the ins and outs of the school, and I absolutely love all aspects of this University"
Sophomore,5,"Tiffin University is all in all a great school to attend! It is a small school with easy to access professors, and you get to meet a lot of great people along the way! I cannot speak on the online classes experience as I have not wanted, nor had, to take any online classes, but from what I hear it is just as nice!"
Sophomore,5,Tiffin University is a home away from home experience. The university staff is very friendly and everyone there tries to make sure each other is comfortable and taken care of. A wonderful place for introverts to go spread their wings and grow their roots to be a wonderful person in society.
Junior,5,"I currently attend Tiffin University and during this difficult time in the world everyone is distance apart, but Tiffin University has never left their community to leave their gasps. Every professor and faculty member has opened out, created videos, and allowed the students to interact with them as if we were still in the classroom. The TU family has confidence and this has allowed everyone to stay together even miles apart. Completing my year at Tiffin University has allowed me to realize that you are never alone. Someone is always there to help you out and wants to watch you succeed."
Freshman,5,"At Tiffin University I really like how the professors engage with the students, and give the students a better understanding of what they are learning. I also like that there is equal opportunity for everyone."
Sophomore,5,I love Tiffin University due to how nice the community is. The campus is big enough to where you don't know everyone but you won't get lost.
Graduate Student,5,"My graduate experience at Tiffin has been very promising so far. I enjoy the trip-mester format for getting more than half of the degree completed in one year. The set up allows for proper time to complete at least two graduate courses per session, and not feel overwhelmed with course work. The professors respond to inquiries in a timely manner, and they do take time to explain any information that might seem complex. The administration staff are very helpful, and will provide you with the proper information for any circumstance."
Freshman,5,I liked the environment and the people around campus. I also liked the football team and their coaching staff
Freshman,5,I Love TU. I met my girlfriend here and met great friends here! The music program is very fierce and one of the best in the country!
Senior,5,"I am an online student with Tiffin.  I have visited the campus, very beautiful place and well maintained.  The staff is amazing and super helpful with answering questions and steering you in the right direction."
Freshman,5,I love the campus! It's very open and there is a welcoming atmosphere. The arts program is also very intriguing and has many opportunities to join an arts group!
Senior,5,"Tiffin University is the institution of opportunity. If you take advantage of all the programs, assistance, and advice they can offer, you will have the groundwork for life after graduation all planned out!"
Freshman,5,"Not only is the campus beautiful, but you sense the genuine unity from students and staff, but your own experience during you duration at Tiffin is personalized for you as an individual, and your own individual interests in study, and extra curriculars."
Freshman,5,"I  am attending Tiffin University this fall and on my visit I had a great time. The students were friendly and helped me on my tour the campus is beautiful, it isn't too big nor too small. There is no class on Wednesday and the class sizes aren't too big I had a great time there."
Senior,5,I am currently taking online courses to get my bachelors degree. I love it and have great experiences. It is easy to contact the instructors if you have questions. I love this because I can work on my schedule because I needed to take classes in the evenings and weekends.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy Tiffin University. I like that this University is very diverse in everything students get involved in. Something that I would like to see change is more visitor parking.
Freshman,5,Tiffin is a great opportunity for everyone. There is stuff for everyone to do. Everyone gets along in Tiffin its a small town and a small university. The classroom sizes are small and so are the lecture halls. They have a great technology building also.
Senior,5,More options for online students... Great school and teachers but It would be nice if they partnered with Tri-C to use the gym and provide bus passes.
Freshman,5,"I've only been on campus for 2 weeks for football camp, but the atmosphere is amazing. The dorms, students, and everything else is amazing. I live 2 hours away from home and I thought I would be home sick, but truthfully I don't, this campus will be your home away from home."
Junior,5,"Overall, the people are, nice, the town is nice, and the campus is a nice place to be. I feel secure at Tiffin and it is small enough that I know most of the people so if I need anything, there is always someone around that I can ask."
Freshman,5,"Tiffin is such an amazing place, everyone is outgoing and nice. Campus is so small and very easy to get around. My major is criminal justice and the two professors was either a police officer or dectective so it was really nice to receive real life situations from someone whose in the CJ field."
Junior,5,It has been great! I have had so many opportunities to join and do things on campus. The people and professors on campus give it a homey and comfortable feel.
College Sophomore,5,The Greek life on my campus is by far the best.
College Sophomore,5,My school is practically built for the athletes.
College Senior,5,Great place to achieve your goals!
College Freshman,5,"Overall, it is a great campus with very helpful professors and nice people. There is always someone that is willing to help you to make your college experience that much better. A lot of the professors have experience in their field that they are teaching which makes it nice when you want to ask questions that may not be able to be answered with a book. Sometimes you need the answer from someone who has been through it in real life."
College Freshman,5,"Overall, Tiffin has been very helpful to my edycation and even helping me grow as a person. The professors are super helpful and are almost always willing to help you. Some of them are sometimes hard to find, but if you just visit their office during office hours then they will be able to help you with anything you need."
College Student,5,Everything is up to date!
College Student,5,I've only been there to visit! I'm moving in in August!
College Freshman,5,The classes are on the smaller size my largest class is 40 students. The school was accommodating to students that needed to take General Chemistry 1 and offered it again in the spring when it is usually a fall class.
College Freshman,5,Not enough space for the amount of people in sports
College Freshman,5,Tiffin takes pride in its safety and tries it's best to protect everyone. We have a great campus security and a wonderful sexual assault investigation team. They really care about safety because we are a criminal justice school. Tiffin is a super safe school and city. I'm not afraid to walk alone at night on campus.
College Freshman,5,The job internships are great here. Criminal justice majors get the opportunity to intern in Washington DC and locally if they'd like. We also no offer the police academy training that you can complete before you even graduate so you can get a job right away.
College Freshman,5,The professors are great! They work around your schedule and understand athletic commitments. If you have a game they'll figure out a way for you to do your work. You just need to communicate with them and let them know you. They take the time to know each of their students by name and there is opportunity for one on one. They offer really interesting courses and class is defiantly worth you showing up.
College Freshman,5,"For your  first three years  at the university you have the opportunity to live in  one of our seven residence halls or one of our many houses. You will have access to our programming such as ice cream socials glow bowling, movie nights & other hall activities. No matter which hall or house you live in you can leave your quarters at home. The fee for using the washer and dryer is included in your housing costs."
College Freshman,5,"I love going to Tiffin university its a great small campus, you should never be late to class, unless you live off campus. Its not that hard to me, especially with all the help we have. My only problem is the money issues I can't afford it. But I really want to stay in school, I don't want to go to no other college I want to stay at Tiffin, hopefully by me doing this scholarship it will help for school. So I'm begging please help. There's a lot to do around campus and everyone you meet is amazing, fun, & helpful. Everyone likes to hangout & go blowing, there's never nothing to do."
Recent Alumnus,5,This was only of the few schools to offer a degree I was interested in for a Master's program and certainly one of the very few which offered it fully online.  The coursework is interesting and ties nicely in to the field that I was pursuing.  All of my studies related in some way to my interests or helped to begin a new interest in a subject I had not explored before.  Great instructors and great environment to learn.
Recent Alumnus,5,Having this first degree helped me with my career and now my second will only help to secure my position.
Recent Alumnus,5,This is my second time at Tiffin and it was just as enjoyable the second time as the first.  Being a graduate student means a hefty work load along with working a full-time job and I never got to the point where my work slacked.  My instructors were supportive and actively engaging.  The work was interesting and intense.  The students I worked with online were just as involved as I was as a student.
Recent Alumnus,5,Application process is quite easy and the offices are extremely helpful if you reach out to them.
College Senior,5,"From my experience, I have had several professors that went out of their way to teach me. They used more resources to help students understand the materials and gave extra time than was required."
College Senior,5,"They have good advisers to help you find internships. They also, have professors working on campus that can be over job placements"
College Senior,5,The professor will go out of their way to help students understand material
College Senior,5,"I always feel safe, when I am on campus"
College Senior,5,I don't see either type of students treated differently.
College Senior,5,Tiffin University truly cares about the students.
College Senior,5,Tiffin University considers the academics the most important part of the school curriculum. The students participate in sport events and activities. Sport activities are used to help students have a better self esteem and more of a school spirit. It helps keep more students interested in being part of school activities.
College Freshman,5,The parties are controlled and a lot of fun
College Sophomore,5,"If you're doing good with grades, they will give you soooo many scholarships. That's definitely a plus because the school is small, so if you go to the finaid office and ask, they'll give it to you, rather than a big school who has to pick and choose who to give it to."
College Sophomore,5,"It's the best out of every other school I've considered. Based off of speaking to other students about their schools, our housing is the absolute best!

Freshman year, you get a dorm; sophomore year, a house; junior year, a house/apartment; senior year, a house/apartment.

The cleaning people keep it clean all of the time. When there is snow, they make sure to clear walk ways. We have the best campus housing ever and on top of that, laundry is free. Not every school has free laundry!"
College Senior,5,The professors are easily accessible and provide adequate feedback on assignments
College Junior,5,One fraternity on campus is Theta Eta Omicron and they do more community service than they get recognized for. They are changing the outlook of fraternity's on campus. They have a strict no hazing policy which is just one thing that makes them a non-traditional fraternity.
College Sophomore,5,school is very active in helping
College Senior,5,Good school. Easy enrollment. I would suggest applying online.
College Senior,5,"I work for the administration as well, so I'm a little biasd."
College Sophomore,5,Campus life is get especially for first year students. The facilities are well kept and there is loads of facilities to help students with whatever they need.
College Sophomore,5,"The diversity on campus is exellent. Students get to meet lots of people from different backgrounds, states, and countries."
College Sophomore,5,The school is pretty great once you get past the trains that pass by the campus everyday.
College Freshman,5,It's there but it is not forced
College Freshman,5,Smooth sailing easy to find
Sophomore,4,"Tiffin University is all in all a great school to attend! It is a small school with easy to access professors, and you get to meet a lot of great people along the way! I cannot speak on the online classes experience as I have not wanted, nor had, to take any online classes, but from what I hear it is just as nice!"
Sophomore,4,"Professors work and make the online experience just as it would be in a classroom. The professors help and work around schedules and online problems and make the online experience fun, easy and stress free."
Alum,4,Loved my experience at Tiffin and all of the career-prep provided. There were obviously accommodations I wish were better but am overall grateful for my time there.
Junior,4,"Absolutely love the flexibility of the perforated online courses which are allowing me to complete a second degree quickly. However, administration and advising has had some hiccups and communication could be clearer. Classes are engaging and I feel that I am learning in every course."
Sophomore,4,It's nice to have small class sizes. The professors know the students in their classes. They all have been willing to work with me in any way that I needed.
Freshman,4,"I play soccer for Tiffin University and I love it so much. My team is like a family and we do pretty much everything together. However the soccer program is not the only thing I like about the university, we don't have classes on Wednesdays! The campus is just big enough for me not to feel like I'm stuck. Their law enforcement program is top notch and it allows you to gain an internship by your junior year. I am so happy I made the decision to attend Tiffin University."
Junior,4,I loved this college its small and the professor care about you. its a very small school which is a good thing for me because i like to focus and Tiffin University keeps me focus on my goals and i run track at the university overall the sports here is amazing and very good the coaches are cool and are willing to do any thing for you to become an better athlete and finally the diversity the university is very diverse from people different cultures and country and that's what makes Tiffin a good University.
Freshman,4,"Although I am only just finishing my first year at Tiffin University, it was definately an enjoyable one. Coming from two states over, this is the perfect place to learn to start living on your own, as the campus is easy to navigate, safe, and diverse. While I have heard there are some less than perfect profs on campus, mine have been nothing but kind and extremely intelligent. I am a part of TUs choirs, and my experience there has also been positive, however on the athletics front, although I do not care for sports, I have heard from friends who are involved that they're not the best, namely the Equestrian Team. The food also gets tiring and disappointing, but they have their days, i.e. Taco Tueaday. Overall, my first year on campus has been successful, and I would recommend this uni to my friends."
Graduate Student,4,Great school. Professors are knowledgeable and really care. Some student resources are not available all the time.
Graduate Student,4,This is an stand out university set in rural area. everyone in here are friendly and helpful in every aspect. this university is all about what you expect from it and there are no limits for what you get out of this university.
Sophomore,4,"I like that the professors actually seem to care. It is a relatively small college, but it still is a great place to go if you are into criminal justice. I would change the student involvement with the frats and sororities and also with the athletics."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the smaller class sizes. It is much easier to learn and process information in a class where the professors know you by your name. I am part of the swim team and you have mandatory study time to help you learn. This is very helpful.
Junior,4,"Tiffin offers Small class sizes therefore your professor knows you and you are not just lost in the crowd.  Professors are. Willing to meet with you if you are having any problems.   Faculty cares about you and wants you to succeed.  There are several help geoups that can be utilized to assist with writing papers, tutoring, etc.   I would like to see more diversity and diverse activities in which to participate"
Junior,4,"I have been at Tiffin for the past 3 years. All of my classes have been online. I have been happy with most of my classes and instructors. The biggest complaint would be the advisors. I am on my 5th advisor in the past 3 years. I get little help when asking questions. Plus, the financial aid office can be rude."
Freshman,4,"As a commuting student, my experience at Tiffin has been a unique one. Tiffin University is a small campus that is big on athletics. Through the different clubs, activities, and work opportunities, I have found my place and feel at home. I feel safe on campus and I am not afraid to walk alone at night. The faculty and staff actually care and want to help students succeed. Though Tiffin was not my first choice school, I am very happy it is where I ended up, and I can not imagine a college experience elsewhere."
Junior,4,"Tiffin University is an excellent college with great professors and an engaging and beneficial curriculum that will not only prepare you for your career, but also get you started along the way as it has various connections that will allow you to reach out an access nearly every profession provided. The main downsides are within the community itself being relatively lackluster but is starting to boom and the University's meal plan is less than satisfactory most days."
College Sophomore,4,Classes don't have that many students anywhere from 20-35. Professors are passionate about their subjects and want you to learn.
College Sophomore,4,The campus has security and resident assistants that do rounds at night. I personally feel safe. Biggest crime on campus is burglary.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small school which enables you to have a close relationship with your professor who has experience in what they teach. The school is pretty boring not sure if I would choose it again for that reason, not to big on greek life here either."
College Sophomore,4,I have never had a problem getting in contact with my professors
College Sophomore,4,While going to Tiffin networking is key making relationships with people and keeping them going out and doing a internship is a great way to do so.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Sophomore,4,When I first got to tiffin it took a little bit of adjusting considering where I was coming from but I'm happy I stuck it out because it was a great decision for myself.
College Senior,4,Great people who want to become leaders in our society
College Senior,4,"Tiffin University has been an amazing experience. The professors are knowledgeable, and the staff is even better. They go out of their way to keep you on track, and make sure you succeed your goals everyday!"
College Freshman,4,"The criminal justice degree is very valued from what I can tell. It is not a big school, but we have a lot of professors that worked in the criminal justice field so the information you receive is very valuable. I cannot speak for other majors however since I do not know how those degrees translate when trying to find a job."
College Freshman,4,The feeling of security is very good and you do feel safe walking around on campus even at night. There are a few places you get the feeling you want to avoid occasionally but it's not too bad. There are very few incidents that I can recall where myself or others have had any security issues that I know of as well.
College Freshman,4,"The rooms themselves are not bad, but are for sure the usual college size, so very small. I think they are a little overpriced for the things that you get when you pay for that, but it is a very safe campus so I assume that is where a lot of the money goes to."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the athletics are very popular at Tiffin and there are many teams that do very well. Varsity sports definitely overshadow the club sports but most of the sports are varsity sports anyways. The facilities are very nice as well for all of the athletes."
College Freshman,4,"I have never felt unsafe on campus, security is alright."
College Freshman,4,I lived in Clay street dorms and have no complaints.
College Student,4,"As far as i know, its great."
College Freshman,4,"As a member of one of the sororities, I found it easy to join. However, being part of the sorority means that there is more opportunities to get involved with the community. Each of the house in Greek Life known for a certain study of major. Mine is International Business so we tend to deal with issues that are pressing to the country and the lives around the community."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is fairly small. It is easy to get in contact with a professor. Since it is a small campus, everyone knows everyone. The classes are worthwhile. Tiffin University is a great school, but since it is a private school it is more expensive. That is the main downfall of attending this university."
College Sophomore,4,"While this school isnt Ohio State or University of Cincinnati size, the people and connection with the staff and faculty is wonderful!! Everyone is around to help everyone! There's never nothing going on. Students are always involved somehow. International students love it here, we continue to show our appreciation of them as well! Tiffin is so welcoming every one who visits and attends. This school is for people who want to be treated like the adults they are and can depend on support from multiple sources. This is the real world experience with all the peices offered in the world, all over!"
College Freshman,4,"Tiffin is a small town of about 20,000 people and two universities. There is little crime and not a lot of it is severe"
College Freshman,4,"To graduate from Tiffin University, you have to take an internship. There are often employment/internship fairs throughout the semester."
College Freshman,4,"Tiffin University's athletics has a very broad variety of different sports, varsity and intermural. Most of the student body are involved in a sport"
College Freshman,4,"Tiffin University is a small school that has many professors that have work experience in the field that you are pursuing. The professors have office hours and are willing to help you through email too. The classes are small and close to on-campus living, the farthest I have had to walk to a class is five minutes"
College Freshman,4,Some professors just do not care about their students
College Freshman,4,Not that many on campus
College Freshman,4,Has higher expectations than anticipated.
College Freshman,4,Housing is nice.  The people you get in the dorm are pretty cool. The cleaning ladies do really good and the dorms are very clean. You have a few limits of what you can and cannot have in your dorm but every college does. The dorms are nice but friedley  and cray craft are right next to the train tracks so you do hear the trains at night but you get used to it.
College Freshman,4,Our Greek life does not revolve around parties they revolve around helping the community by doing different things. Our Greek life is involved in our campus in a good way and they make differences that actually mean stuff. The hardest part about getting in the Greek life is memorizing all the information during initiation.
College Freshman,4,Tiffin is a great school with professors who had careers in the things they are teaching you. You don't only learn from a text book you learn from your professors stories and experiences. The best part is your professors have a great connection in the career world which makes a difference when it comes to getting internships and jobs.
College Junior,4,"I only take courses online, but the experience I've had through Tiffin's online program has been great.  The professors have been very helpful and experienced.  Anytime I've needed help or anything I've never had a problem getting it.  The administration was very helpful through the registration process.  I didn't go to Tiffin for my undergrad degree,  but I wished I did. Everything about this university is great."
College Freshman,4,"At tiffin we have free tutoring, the computers and prints are open 24hours for free, we have study tables you can come to if you don't want to be in your dorm. We have a great lobby with a TV and a vending machine on each floor. We have twobhuge gyms and track if you want to take a run but not outside to keep warm."
College Freshman,4,"At tiffin university if you have a night class, and don't want to walk in the dark back to your dorm or house, you can call the campus security they will be right there. The campus security walks around the dorms and house every single day. You will always feel safe at tiffin university."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have not been on campus but the school gives the impression that they are passionate and caring about their students, including in the matter of sexual assault."
College Sophomore,4,The sports are ever evolving at Tiffin as we get better the sports and recruiting gets better
College Sophomore,4,I love the School.  The Professors are very helpful and accessible. Student to teacher ratio is about 24 to 1 so it's a great environment for learning.  The community at the University is like one big family. I would recommend Tiffin to anyone.
College Freshman,4,"Small campus, more personal attention, student mentors for freshman,"
College Junior,4,"Tiffin University is a great school in a great town. As far as academics go, this school is challenging and also fair. When it comes to student life, you have to make your own fun."
College Student,4,They are very helpful and welcoming.
College Freshman,4,The housing is very nice and affordable for students
College Freshman,4,The food is so good and has a good price
College Freshman,4,The administration keeps a close eye on the students
College Freshman,4,The food is very tasty and there is plenty of it
College Freshman,4,I get away from my parents and I meet great people
College Freshman,4,"Academic Scholarships seem easy to get, just work for it."
Niche User,2,Unless you're into athletics you won't really be noticed much. The dorms are average and there isn't much to do around the town. Nightlife isn't very fun either.
Graduate Student,2,"Tiffin is a school mainly catered to athletes and to some extent diversity. The area surrounding Tiffin is rural and generally depressing for a young person. If you do not plan on playing a sport I would recommend looking for another school. Students who go here generally are not that bright, hence the 96% acceptance rate. Nightlife is generally non existant or below mediocre at best."
Sophomore,2,"If you came from a suburban or urban area, Tiffin is a bit of a culture shock. There is hardly anything to do here if you aren't involved in athletics and the police and university security are strict and annoying."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is pretty terrible, we only have three fraternities and three sororities. Greek life has no effect on campus they have separate housing."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is mainly focused on athletics and minorities. If you are not either, you're just a number. I'm only here for my program, because they are highly ranked for their criminal justice program. I like the small class size and being able to live at home and save a little bit of money. The reason I would choose this school again if I had too, would be because of the small class sizes and that I can live at home and same money. I would not choose this school if I would have chosen a different major and I do no feel accepted because I am not apart of a sports team. The way this school puts athletics before academics is not right."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much of a Greek life on campus
College Freshman,2,"small town, just not  a lot to do."
College Freshman,2,It is basically all fast food...
College Freshman,2,they are all very strict
College Junior,2,Admins do not enforce drug policy.
College Freshman,2,Mostly townies are the problem with drugs
College Freshman,2,I don't even know how to get a hold of campus transportation and there is no public transportation.
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing is very poor. The houses look old and not replenished. Also the school doesn't allow for freshmen and sophomores to live off-campus.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life at my school is almost non-existent. The only time they make a noise is during the pledging period.
College Senior,2,"I think we have a campus shuttle that takes students to the grocery store once a week and then also to the airport on breaks or to school functions.  Aside from those things you either need a car, a friend with one, or you have to call a taxi.  There is some, but not much in walking distance."
College Freshman,2,Basically there is just a Subway.  Otherwise you need a car to drive to McD's and other fast food places.
College Junior,2,"Most of the off-campus dining options are chains, such as McDonalds. There are a few local hangs, but they are basically all the same thing."
College Junior,2,"I love that the campus and town are small, but you have to drive about 30 minutes to get to a town that has a good variety of restaurants and a shopping mall with more than four stores."
College Freshman,2,Pretty much everyone drinks or smokes pot and none of the faculty seem to care.
College Freshman,2,No strictness whatsoever. You can get away with almost anything.
College Freshman,2,Not much to do. Parties kind of suck and the bars and clubs are all really crowded and super claustrophobic and not fun.
College Sophomore,2,"The Weather is so Bi polar. but it is not too bad, it gets really cold"
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not really that important on our campus
College Freshman,2,Extreme weather extremely effects the campus 
College Freshman,2,If you don't want fast food it's a 30 min drive.
College Freshman,2,Same food over and over again
College Freshman,2,Not the most attractive girls
College Senior,2,"Tiffin doesn't necessarily have ""campus police,"" but they have a student body-enabled system called Nightwatch, that aids students walking home after late night events."
College Sophomore,2,"Off Campus housing is annoying because the police is always around,"
College Sophomore,2,This is a small town and transportation is not a priority
College Sophomore,2,"I have lived in Ohio all my life so I am use to it, but for a lot of the students the weather is very unpredictable. During the fall and spring it is hard to tell whether it will be a nice warm day or a cold and windy day. The winters are freezing most days. Classes still continue on, but if necessary some professors will cancel class for that day. A positive about class buildings is that they are not very far for most of the students who live on campus. When it is really nice outside you can expect to see students all around campus"
College Junior,2,"Athletics is ok at Tiffin.  Everything is about average about it.  Nothing too big, but not ignored."
College Sophomore,2,I wish tiffin had a bigger gym. im a person that loves to workout and sometimes i cant because the sports teams HOG the gym! it frustrates me and its not fair becauseother people thats not on athletic teams cant really use it.
College Freshman,2,"Welcome to Ohio.  In one weekend we expierenced snow, rain and 60-degree-kickball weather.  You never know what you are going to get here.  Be prepared for anything."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms at Tiffin University are fairly close, due to a small campus. The dorm rooms are small for freshmen and they do not have air conditioning, but the cost of the dorms are still expensive. The social atmosphere is low. Best housing options are to stay in a house with students you know or your teammates."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to do in Tiffin. Most people head to Findlay or Bowling Green in order to do something on the weekends. The mall has a few stores, but not much. Thankfully, Findlay is only 30 minutes away."
College Sophomore,2,"Tiffin is a very small community with not very many apartments. They may be hard to find, but they probably aren't too expensive to live in since it is such a small town."
College Sophomore,2,Be ready to not get much financial aid unless you're playing a sport.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much in Tiffin because the university. The mall is bare and has a movie theater at best. Most shopping has to be done 22 miles away.
College Junior,2,"You Can Get Away With Anything – From my experience, the policies are not very strict when it comes to punishment. I know people who got caught underage drinking and were in sports and NOTHING happened. I do not agree with this and feel like people easily get away with things."
Junior,1,"I went to Tiffin with high expectations and to begin with I was pleased with what the university had to offer. However, when I started to run into financial issues and asked for help and advice the faculty were not forthcoming with any assistance. Also, as an international student I hoped to have assistance throughout the semester, but I felt that as soon as I arrived on campus I was forgotten about, I was just another number on a database."
Niche User,1,"I gave this place the  benefit of the doubt after reading all of the reviews. And I immediately regretted it this place was so unimpressive that I was honestly super annoyed that I even bother to go visit at all. I really don’t suggest going and visiting if you have any doubts. I was completely  miss lead on not only the Track program, and what I was being offered. But also the major I want to pursue that  they don’t even have. I was told that they had it and whenever I arrived I learned that they do not. Overall not impressed ."
Freshman,1,"I would not suggest TU. I will be transferring.

I was misled and lied to about the college
Most of my profs cannot teach
TU’s degree rankings are significantly low
No substance here
Problems with roommates rarely get fixed.
One of the lowest growth in college development
Housing on campus is sub-pair
Technology is terrible
Food is bad
Some of the classrooms are shared public buildings
Dean of students is all talk
Family atmosphere. It is all smoke and mirrors
Tuition mostly goes into paying utilities and profs
TU's full-time profs are significantly below average.
Security is terrible. People get robbed, vehicles damaged, and threats happen without reconciliation. 
TU is ranked 93rd out of 173 in the region. State wide, 50 out of 57
Student loan rates are 0.18% more than the National Average
Freshmen retention is below national average
When you have advisers and professors telling you it is a good idea to leave, there is a problem
Cost and return are not even close to being equal"
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is pretty bad, not many people attend or care about them."
College Freshman,1,Its obvious with the smell but people don't addressit
College Freshman,1,no Greek like at my school
College Sophomore,1,Food plan is way too much and the food is terrible.
College Sophomore,1,Just getting off campus housing is a chore and a half. The schools policy is to stay on campus for three years but for some students who financially cannot afford it the school is very strict and would rather you leave the school for good then have you be off campus and attend school.
College Freshman,1,There is rarely anything to do around here. The other local college doesn't really interact with us.
College Freshman,1,Nightlife is bad. The only time it is good is when the local clubs have something special.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing but cornfields for miles and the town is really small with almost nothing to do.
College Freshman,1,"There are no safety measures on campus. Tiffin doesn't have any campus police, just a student run service which can't do anything other than give warnings.  A few of the on campus living places aren't actually on campus and the walk is down a creepy back ally with known drug dealers and alcoholics - for girls especially its really creepy."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial Aid wasn't really that much of help, each semester it was more problems. "
College Sophomore,1,the campus cafe is terrible. The food is always the same and terrible quality.
College Sophomore,1,The police force is really strict. It is a big criminal justice school so the police is really big on breaking up the fun.
College Sophomore,1,"Yes there are many options of off-campus dining to choose from in Tiffin, but there are not many restaurants that allow student discounts for Tiffin University."
College Junior,1,It is hard at times to find a parking spot and sometimes I drive around for awhile to find one a long way away from the school or my class.
College Junior,1,"Sometimes they have really good food. And there are different groups to choose from, however, the food is really gross most of the time. The pizza gets old, hamburgers are dry and have no flavor. They have nasty rice with almost everything. But they do let you have as much as you want."
College Junior,1,There really isn't anything to do at my school. There are a few bars and clubs but they are lame. My school is very small and in a small town. Not many house parties and cops are always checking out the area for college students.
College Sophomore,1,"The Food Is Disgusting – The food is horrible, they seem to give us food like they don't care for us. Some of the students get sick from eating the food and a lot of us go out to eat rather than eating the cafe food."

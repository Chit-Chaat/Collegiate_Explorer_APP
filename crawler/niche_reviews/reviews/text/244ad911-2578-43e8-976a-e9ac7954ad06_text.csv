Senior,5,Great HBCU and enjoyed the learning experience. Professors and staff are extremely helpful. Loved the campus
Freshman,5,when I visited the college it was exactly what school I was looking for because it was a very secluded area where everyone knew each other and I didn't have problems with making friends at the volleyball tryout.
Freshman,5,Jarvis Christian College is a very good college.  Everybody at Jarvis no matter what department they work in put you 1st an make sure that you have everything you need to be successful in the field you chose.
Junior,5,"The professors I’ve had over the past four years have truly made my college experience that much better. They are always willing do help me with a project, stay after office hours or, come in early to meet me. My professors are always reaching out to me with information about job opportunities and other networking information. When I graduate I will miss many things about Jarvis Christian College but the professors and the relationships I’ve built with them is something I will definitely remember forever."
Sophomore,5,"This is my second year here at Jarvis Christian College, my experience so far has been the best, my freshman year they made me feel so welcomed it was like I was a home with people I already knew. What I like about Jarvis Christian College is that if you need help someone is there to help you, fun activities, and loving people all around campus . What would I like to see change is that we have more programs to attend so people can be more interactive and meet more people."
Junior,5,"Their staff/faculty members are organized, understanding and very helpful. Great experience thus far."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Jarvis so far has been very exciting and diverse and the campus communication and activities allowed me to meet different people from around the world that has the same challenges and adventures at me and i have became really close to some of the people i see everyday.

Freshman,5,i really love Jarvis Christian College. the campus as a whole is very family oriented. we are all a family here at Jarvis Christian College. One thing i like is how the classrooms are small and also the teachers work hands on with you and make sure you are understanding the material at Jarvis. The college is very social and the facility is very interactive with us . I would really recommend Jarvis to anybody who asks about my school. I would not change anything about Jarvis.
Recent Alumnus,5,Great professors who are very helpful and supportive
College Sophomore,5,Security come exaclty when you need them
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone seems to have a sense of fashion and sporty. The school is filled with athletes that are good at almost every sport from basketball, football, volleyball, baseball, and even ping pong. Mostly everyone has a good friendly competitive spirit."
College Freshman,5,The teachers are great. They know you by name and spend ample amounts of time making sure you understand the criteria.
College Freshman,5,The academics are very good . It teaches you new things as well as review the things from secondary school.
College Freshman,5,"There are students from pretty much all over,but we all seem to get along.Majority are black,but we make sure all races feel comfortable being at Jarvis."
College Freshman,5,"Student Union/Gym/Grill – The student recreational/athletic center is great! I love the new addition to the campus THE GRILL,is where they serve classic burgers and sandwiches. You can hang out with friends,WI-Fi is available all over campus. The LLC building is also very nice and adds to the campus.Students are able to hang out in the lobby and play board games or just converse and watch TV."
Senior,4,Online classes were very haves on as of you are in a classroom with the professor. The ability to turn in assignments were easy.
Niche User,4,The staff has been very helpful in getting me on the right path to graduate.  I have been out of school for over 20 years they haven't judged me at all.
Senior,4,Usually small classes which provides better access to information.  Campus is better for people who like a small one.
Sophomore,4,"I love this college, it's only my second year but I enjoy it and the people there are great and are a lively bunch."
Freshman,4,"Jarvis is a OK school. The professors work with you and it is a very small campus so they are very hands on. They have 24 hour security so you are safe. The students are very friendly. The old dorms are not up to code, they are building more dorms for students to live in. The only problem with that you have to have a high GPA to stay in the new dorms. My adviser always kept up with me to make sure I was making my grades. Jarvis Christian College is a good place to attend. My overall experience is good> I would recommend other kids to go there."
Senior,4,Jarvis is an institution with a rich history. Unfortunately Jarvis Christian College has not kept up with the times in terms of its campus. I do see changes coming in the future. The professors that I have had at Jarvis have been excellent all of them.
Sophomore,4,"I love Jarvis Christian College and I think it is an excellent school, I really love how the staff is always willing to help and I also feel that the teachers actually want to see you excel. But just like any other school there are some things you wish you could change, the only thing I would change about Jarvis is the really old dorm rooms and how they are other than that GO BULLDOGS, I love my HBCU!!!"
Senior,4,Jarvis Christian College is a good College. I like my major department because all my professors where great and will help you with everything you needed. I liked the pride everyone had for the school colors and all the sports. It was a great experience.
Sophomore,4,"The things I like at Jarvis Christian College is , the way some of the teachers are very hands on and very understanding about different projects. I also like the way the classes don't feel overwhelming. However, I feel that the school should have more groups that involves the different majors that they provide."
Junior,4,"Jarvis Christian College is an all black school, which I like. They have a lot of great opportunities for you to achieve and participate in. You can grow a lot by be at Jarvis. The staff are very friendly and also are involved in student activities and help student also."
Sophomore,4,Jarvis is the best student for me. I love going here. There is no other place I rather be. I'm thankful for all of my instructors and peers.
Senior,4,I have enjoyed my time so far at Jarvis.  The professors are awesome.  They are very helpful and concerned about us taking getting our education seriously.  They always make time to see you.  Very easy to make an appointment with them.  Have so many ways to get help when needed.  Buildings old but that is made up in the classroom.
College Junior,4,the class size are great the teachers enjoyed what they teach.
College Freshman,4,They would try to help you in everything they can and they love for you to ask questions.
College Freshman,4,The professor take their time in order for you to understand the topic.

College Freshman,4,Jarvis Christian College it's great place to go to school because not only the students are friendly but also the faculty and staff. They are so many activities you can join so you can never be bored. They also try to involve you in supporting all their athletes.

College Senior,4,There is all ways someone there if you need it

College Senior,4,The Greek life is good on campus
College Senior,4,I would choose the school again.
College Senior,4,The athletics are very good and I love to watch them play.
College Freshman,4,"For the student career prospects and the value of a degree from college, I would say that the career service manager is very active on making sure that students are getting the internship recognition that they need. Also, the degrees are applicable for those who want to find high and weekly paid jobs."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I love where I am starting my new beginning at. I don't know about everyone else, but it is a blessing for me to attend a college to where there are most people who look out for you, and to make sure that you are able to get the help that you need in order for you to be able to pass your classes. And not only that, but to make sure that you have some money just by working at whichever department that you would love to do the most. College is great for some people who feel like they need the experience that they really need."
College Freshman,4,"It is the safest way to know that you have most of the people that you can look up to that will understand where you are coming from, and to make sure that you are safe on campus and to protect yourself from being sexually assaulted."
College Freshman,4,"I am a non-Greek myself, and the way the fraternities and sororities are engaging into the college environment, they are growing with parties and socializing with others."
College Freshman,4,"I like the idea of the admissions treating us like the individuals that we are supposed to be. We needed to be recognized as a person, instead of being recognized by numbers. It is very insignificant to be called by numbers, rather to be called by your government name."
College Senior,4,I feel safe for the most part on campus.
College Senior,4,They actually take care of the student body.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have learned so much about my major in this first semester.  I am very excited about my choice.
Recent Alumnus,4,Not until I arrived here was I sure of my career tract
Recent Alumnus,4,Heard of no issues been hear for 6 months
College Senior,4,The summer education program was the one and only program that helped me as a student.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I went to a HBCU and it was a totally different experience because, I came from a town with the majority being white. I was the only black girl in most of my classes, and I would get asked about the difference in my hair and how I have to keep it. however coming to Jarvis I was encouraged to try new stuff with my natural hair and saw difference shades of beautiful black women, and they weren't ashamed of it!"
College Student,4,"I have on campus through the Upward Bound Program for the pass three years. I had great time while living on campus each time.

Thank you,

N'Teeshia Tribble"
College Student,4,I have enjoyed the food for the past three years.
College Sophomore,4,My financial aid process was smooth and hassle free.
College Freshman,4,The Greek life is coming a long ways. It's a working progress by far. I think they should put more lines out before everybody graduates an leaves off campus.
College Freshman,4,It's a nurse on site.
College Freshman,4,It's diffir degree plans you can go with right alone with Dual degree
Freshman,2,"I felt like I was in High School again. Very restrictive, very babying, and over all not a good experience. There's a very large lack of communication and organization, and the academics (freshmen ones at least) were extremely easy, to the point where I was bored and didn't feel like they were worth my time. The facilities really need to be updated (Though to be fair some students were pretty disrespectful to said facilities, thus why they were like that) 

I only went there because they gave me a full academic scholarship, and I was still disappointed. The whole time I was there I felt sorry for everyone who paid anything in tuition. Please save your money. I know the staff there mean well, but it just doesn't work out."
College Junior,2,Living conditions are below average. Many students do not enjoy their living spaces and conditions. We deserve better but we make do with what we have.
College Sophomore,2,I personally just don't like Jarvis's food.
College Freshman,2,The apartment looks horrible and run down.
College Senior,2,"Hawkins is a small town , with not so much to do. To have fun , you have to mingle with other , go to program , and step out of your box. You have to make your fun by bringing your own entertainment or meeting friends. There is really not much to do if you are a city person but it really teach you the principles on how to survive and enjoy what you have in life.  When you first arrive at Jarvis you see a long white gate like you entering a state college prison for bad students who want better there education inside the gates. I know that's not very nice to say but its a first impression of what I saw and view the school.
There really aren't any attractions around the area. But about thirty minutes up the road there are shopping malls and centers. There is always room for improvement, however, the security on campus is pretty good. I have yet to hear of anyone being in danger on a late night campus walk.
Personally I'm not in any of the sports or sport clubs they have here at JCC, but I do know several people that are on the team. Our varsity basketball team isn't too bad you have to keep in mind that the school is small, so tailgating and basketball games aren't as big than the other universities. I know they offer a lot of sport activities at the rec center which is the gym we have here on campus. My roommate and her friend are on a volleyball team they made with a group of there friends and they have games regularly.
We do not have campus provided transportation."
College Senior,2,"Quit, dusk balls behind old Jarvis white gates. Unfortunately I'm not a party person at all so I never see the scene or know anything about them."
College Sophomore,2,The last 2 years I've been getting to school by catching a ride with a fellow student. It would not be that bad cost wise because my at fills up on 40 dollars. So those long distance rides are not always bad.
Recent Alumnus,2,Students without their own means of transportation had to greatly rely on fellow students to get around town.
College Freshman,2,The computer labs are not updated  .  The WIFI is very weak. You can find a spot somewhere on campus .
College Freshman,2,The financial aid I received was not enough to cover my tuition.
College Freshman,2,I came to Jarvis Christian College for its business program . The campus is a standard campus. The professors I have are always available also willing to assist students at all times. Class discussions are lays the highlight of class.
College Senior,2,there is no public transportation. the train/bus station is about 30+ miles away. you will need a car.
College Junior,2,"Travel for Quality – Off campus housing are mostly some distance away from the school, however they are pretty affordable. Nonetheless, because Hawkins is a small town there is not much to do and the rental properties available do not have community involvement unless you go into Tyler (the city)."
College Junior,2,Computer Labs – Here at Jarvis we're doing some improvements but it's going slow. Our computer lab consist of only one printer with a slow connection. I'm a student who's also a parent that has no wifi signal in my apartment. So without a babysitter i have to bring my son with me. I wished I had a computer so I at least could pick up a signal in the library sitting area.
Alum,1,"One of the absolute worst and disgusting institutions I’ve ever been involved with. For a SMALL 11,000$ tuition you receive a campus that looks like it hasn’t had anything done to it in years( aside from the new dorms which are actually quite nice), staff that both is rude and incompetent, and struggle with the English language and a mandatory chapel to attend to along with mandatory religious courses. The dorm rooms are awful and the RA’s hand out fines like they are candy on Halloween, and the food is the worst I’ve ever had. The staff in the cafeteria are rude and incompetent, and you can tell that nobody in the place gives a damn. This school is also notorious for doing shady shady stuff. They have shut the school down entirely due to fear of a lawyer in the past, ( because a woman fell through the floor on campus) and they will not hesitate to continue  shady entics. DO NOT SEND YOUR KIDS HERE."
Junior,1,"I hate this school, they trapped me I'm just trying to graduate. I hate this school so much it depresses everybody, the staff are perverted, The students are horrible, I hate this school. A girl fell through the ceiling last year and nothing was done, they moved somebody else into the same room. I hate this school so much. This is a terrible school, do not go here or send your kids. There's a graveyard on campus, the school is haunted with dead people."
College Sophomore,1,Its no resaurants out here
College Sophomore,1,Its always something with the financial aid .
College Sophomore,1,"The food dont be all the way cooked sometimes, the food will be old and mold will be on them."
College Sophomore,1,"The dorm rooms have very poor maintenance, the AC continuoisly blows out causing it to be ridiculously hot at night. The water sometimes doesnt get hot and we have to find other alternatives to take showers, the cable is iffy and works sometimes."
College Freshman,1,There is only one place you can eat at Jarvis and that is at the cafe. Its only open three times a day which makes it hard for me as a runner to stay fit if i can barley eat.
College Senior,1,"Nothing to Do – My school has the Divine Nine but many do not do too much of anything because of the strict rules in place. When our school is able to get together, we have a great time. The problem is, we are not allowed ample opportunity to enjoy ourselves because student activity on campus is nonexistent unless it has something to do with partying."
College Freshman,1,Black Power – There are a lot of black studnet at the jarvis its rare you see somebody else another race
College Junior,1,"You would expect a smaller school to be a tight knit community. Wrong! Not here at Jarvis! Many people have their own cliques (like high school) and they do their own thing. There is NEVER much to do on campus because there are less than 5 clubs/organizations here on campus. All the girls wear weave, which is something I could never understand because I personally like my own natural look. Most people are friendly though, but it gets to be a burden attending a school that has absolutely nothing to offer."
College Freshman,1,"There needs to be public transportation.  If you are w/o your own vehicle then is hard to get around in Hawkins,TX unless you have friends with cars."
College Freshman,1,Bring Your Own Food – We only have one dining hall and the food was great at first then its like all the good things got tooken away. I would not recommend this.
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Offer a College Student in a Small Town : / – Hawkins is a very very small town. It probably takes all of five minutes to ride through the entire city. Some stores included in Hawkins is Sonics, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Brookshires, and some small mom and pop gas stations and stores. Another city that is nearby is Big Sandy and that is about the same size. The Mall, movie, and walmart are about 25 to 30 minutes away. So expect to have gas money if you want to do something fun after class.

However, if you like the being in the country this is the place for you!"

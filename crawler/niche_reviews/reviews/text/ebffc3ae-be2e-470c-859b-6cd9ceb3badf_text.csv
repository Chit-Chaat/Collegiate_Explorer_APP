Junior,5,"Being apart of Dillard's film program has extremely increased my knowledge and has prepared me to work in the field. Apart from that I love the small community and family atmosphere on campus between the students and the faculty and staff, the loving and empathetic teachers and lastly all of the different ways to be involved on campus. Dillard also pushes is students to be involved in the surrounding community of Gentilly and gives us ample opportunities to do community service."

My first year experience at Dillard university was a great experience. Throughout my first year I learned many things and made long lasting friend ships. At the prestigious Dillard university it feels like home. Which, I feel that every transition high school student should feel.

Junior,5,"I'm a junior transfer student from a community college, this is my first semester here at Dillard's University so far it is a very nice school, I enjoy the professors I have because they are very eager to help you, also Dillard University has a more older crowd and younger generation too, but I feel very comfortable by being boldet than 35 and returning to a university after 20 years, I love the campus and staff is very helpful, security is scarce you can't really see them unless you just happened to see them sitting in a car ,this is due to construction taking place now on campus, but overall it's a very good school for someone looking to get a BSN or Masters degree."
Junior,5,I really love the school because it is a part of my history being black and really not able to afford college yet I am pressing on because this school was built by people like me pushing on because they knew that people that looked like me need a education to live the America Dream

My Professors are very engaging and helpful and I am so pleased that I had the honor of being accepted to Dillard."
Alum,5,"I am from New Orleans and when I thought of colleges, I wanted to stay home but I also wanted to have a real college experience. I chose Dillard because of it's great academic program and the small classroom dynamic. I wanted my professors to really know my name and face.

The campus is not very large, everything is literally in walking distance. Then, it's in close proximity to French Quarter and everywhere else you would want to go in New Orleans."
Freshman,5,"While attending Dillard, I have had a great experience. Dillard, overall, is a very academic bound HBCU. This university has students and teachers pushing each other to succeed and strive higher in life. I would recommend this school for mostly locals. This school generally doesn't have a high diversity in race nor culture. Dillard mostly consist of African Americans with a New Orleans culture. I would recommend it to locals because I think they would feel most comfortable here. Academically, I think that Dillard performs well. From being in class with these scholars, Dillard shapes and molds excellent students with a motivation to succeed. Dillard represents HBCU's well and I am glad that I was able to to tell you how."

Alum,5,"My Dillard University experience was challenging, rewarding, fulfilling, and world-class!  Dillard prepared me for bright and brilliant future.  I would not been as successful as I have if it was not for the dedicated and challenging professors, the rich community, and my astute, creative, and unique fellow students.

College Freshman,5,I chose Dillard University and I would definetly choose it again. As an HBCU it's their mission to help African-American students succeed in the real world. Dillard University does that. All of my professors strive to make sure I know the material being taught. My academic advisor makes sure that I get all the help that is needed. The President of Dillard University insures that every student is cared for and is helped so that they can graduate and be prepared for the world.
College Sophomore,5,"My school is the best choice for me because it provides me with the necessities I need as a student-athlete and a future Entrepreneur. Dillard University's small environment allows me to get a one-on-one connection with the professors on campus and receive the help I may need in a specific course or guide me in making good decisions for my personal life, which may lead to a successful life outside of college. Dillard's love for it's students has inspired me to want to make a difference in society; academically, socially, athletically, spiritually, and most of all in the American society. I'm glad I made the decision to attend Dillard University and achieve my Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and if given the option to choose another school, I would happily turn down any offer."
Junior,4,"Although, the pandemic caused college students to start taking all classes online, Dillard’s faculty was extremely helpful and understanding during this time."
Junior,4,"Being at Dillard only for a year, I would say my experience was eventful dealing with being a “new kid” and eventually Covid-19, I would say my experience was different yet memorable. 
What I liked about Dillard was how friendly the people were even though I was new, I still felt like family. That was the best feeling because transferring from PWI to HBCU, I did not know what to expect but my situation turned out good. What I would like change about Dillard is adding a football team and a band."
Sophomore,4,"In light of Corona virus Dillard, like many other campuses, opted to move their courses online. It felt like a seamless transition. The instructors were available whenever I needed them to assist, online tutoring was available, and above all else the work was manageable."
Sophomore,4,"It's an amazing HBCU experience. As a sophomore I am positive I have made friends, networked, and made connections that will last for many years, if not the rest of my life. This college offers a beautiful campus, instructors who care, and myriad of resources to assist with learning and studying. To say the least I love this college."
Freshman,4,When I first got to Dillard I really did not like it but as I came more involved on campus I started to really enjoy myself.
Freshman,4,The sense of community and fellowship among students is amazing. Anyone can find their group at Dillard University and it's numerous majors and electives.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Dillard was the dorm rooms and how they live plus how the Tour went too
The campus was well put together so far of how Dillard need to be in order for me to get around the campus and get back to my dorm"
Junior,4,My experience at Dillard has been one of kind and unforgettable. I can say I have met some of the most interesting students but also some amazing staff. This is definitely like a small family  that cares for the most part. Its small classroom sizes and campus makes it easy to get that one on one attention that is great for everyone.
Freshman,4,"For a small university, Dillard University has a very family orientated environment. You get one on one time with your professors because they actually know your name and they want what is best for you. The faculty and staff of the university actually want you to finish in four years. As being a family environment, everyone supports you and you do not have to shy around anybody."
Junior,4,It’s a very tight knit school that make sure their students have fun both inside and outside of class.
Sophomore,4,"As a Sophomore, I am noticing a lot more about Dillard. It is a great school to attend. If you are looking for a family oriented college, Dillard is the school for you."
Freshman,4,"Dillard is a great college for a window of opportunities and growth. Dillard has alot of good connections and resources. Alot of good speakers and guests come to speak at the college. I enjoy the events that they host, its good for the community to come out and see."
Sophomore,4,It was very comfortable and welcoming. Professors and students are very helpful. Campus is nice and spacious. Maintaining leaks and power outages should be worked on more in the future to prevent constant inconveniences to students throughout the semester. I appreciate the different clubs and student events on campus that allow us to engage and connect with each other.
Junior,4,It's my first year being at a HBCU and it's so different from a regular university. I do not regret my decision in attending this school. I would recommend an African American to attend an HBCU because it does add something to your life and you meet people just like you that are trying to make something of them selves. The faculty and staff want everyone to succeed and graduate.
Junior,4,Dillard University has a very family-oriented environment. Student actually believe in what their learning and they believe that their professors truly care about them.
Sophomore,4,"Traveling to a different state for school wasn't easy for me. Leaving my family and learning to live on my own really set me apart from my comfort zone. Because Dillard is a smaller HBCU, I felt at home being there. I was always comfortable. My dorm was clean, physically up to date, and accommodating. The food is good, of course after being there for a couple months you will get tired but it is not bad at all. At least there is a selection and its tasteful. Campus is SAFE, it is gated and we have ""top flight"" security. I can actually say that professors at Dillard are great, they really care about your well being. It is always important to get to know your professor, make a good impression so that when scholarship come around they have no problem writing recommendations for you. I can't say enough about my HBCU, you'll have to take a visit some day!"
Junior,4,"I love Dillard University. Dillard University is a private, liberal arts college that has a strong sense of family and makes sure that you receive the best college education possible."
Alum,4,"Dillard University offered a broad range of backgrounds, demographics and still provided the sense of family.  I enjoyed all 4 years of my education and wisdom the history of the university and city gave."
Sophomore,4,I like Dillard University because they have endless opportunities for you to venture off into a great career with a great network. Faculty do what they can to meet your standards. I don't like the infrastructure or cleanliness for I feel like it can be improved.
Junior,4,"The illustrious Dillard University is a uniquely excelling historically black university in New Orleans, La. Dillard life is a family-oriented academic experience. Dillard students achieve together, go through trials together and continuously uplift ourselves and our colleagues. African American students from all over the country attend our prestigious university to experience different cultures, different understanding of our education and deeper hunger to change the world."
Junior,4,"What I love about Dillard University is what anyone would love in the institution.  It embodies the home and family feeling that anyone who’s away from home would love to have.  The individual’s there are friendly, comforting and fun to be around.  Honestly it’s like being in the movie “Alice in Wonderland”, some many different personalities to take in."
Junior,4,"Being that I am a very shy and quiet person, it was easy to adapt to the environment. The staff and students are very welcoming. The classes are small therefore there is more time for students to communicate with the teacher."
Freshman,4,"As a Freshman student here at Dillard University, I have gained experiences and knowledge that I will continue to build upon. Dillard is a great school with wonderful Professors who tries their best to help you excel. they also have many opportunities for extra help outside of classes. Dillard has hosted a great amount of successful business Men and Women as well as a few well known celebrities to speak with our students encouraging us to never give up and to believe in ourselves."
Freshman,4,I like the environment of Dillard. Dillard has a positive environmental and the people are extremely helpful. Everyone is very personal and the campus is very family oriented.
Niche User,4,I can honestly say that overall enjoyed Dillard University for everything they had to offer. My trip wasn't as thorough as I had hoped but I still managed to gain an broad outlook on the university. I got to talk to one of the students and also gaze over the dorms and campus.
Alum,4,"Dillard University is an amazing overall experience. From the beautiful oak trees to the caring and giving professors, the school will fit the proper person for this school. I am an alum of Dillard University. And I still communicate with my classmates all the time. I can still call up with my professors and get it advice, wisdom, or just remember old times. Dillard is growing in an amazing way and implementing new and innovative programs in their academics. Dillard University is a survivor."
Sophomore,4,"Dillard University provides a great learning environment. The school itself is small, with  a limited amount of students because it is a private college, which helps students to focus more on their academics rather than partying."
Sophomore,4,I just completed my first year at Dillard university and it was amazing . The professors and other faculty members are always open and wanting to help. The students are active and smart . Literally everyone enrolled is destined for greatness .
College Sophomore,4,A vast majority of graduates go on to graduate school or direct careers
College Sophomore,4,The level of severity for health and safety is high at this school

College Junior,4,Dillard University Athletics are fun! its the battlefield as we call it we play hard and go hard
College Junior,4,Dillard University is a very family oriented university that cares about their students success.
College Sophomore,4,We are aware of multiple internships that we can apply for.
College Sophomore,4,"We only have volleyball, track, and basketball, so I try to attend as many games as possible."
College Sophomore,4,Dillard University is extremely welcoming and it is very easy to get involved in clubs there.
College Freshman,4,Instructors have been very helpful.
College Freshman,4,Both parents are members of Greek organizations. Pursuing membership is something I will look into in the future.
College Freshman,4,I'm attending an enrichment program and enjoying the (early) experience here on campus.
College Sophomore,4,The alum network is great. There are always alumni on campus that are willing to help undergrads move forward with their career choices.
College Sophomore,4,"The bad thing about the athletics at Dillard are that there are not many of them because of how small the school is. So unlike other big colleges, we do not have a baseball team, soccer team, football team, etc. And like other big HBCU's, we do not have a big dance team, a band, color guards, or any of that. Just a basketball team, a swim team, a dance team, a cheerleading team, and we are trying to start a softball team."
College Junior,4,Being able to graduate from Dillard will be great. The president of Dillard University is such a fantastic president who has a lot of connections.
College Freshman,4,I feel like Dillard does a good job with career opportunities and setting u up for success
College Freshman,4,I have a lot of school pride
College Freshman,4,The Greek life is great the people are nice and fun they throw awesome parties and really involved with community school and there organization
College Freshman,4,Athletics aren't the bulk of the school however the school does support our athletes and athletic events we show our devil pride
College Freshman,4,I haven't attended the school yet however I've met students and staff and all of them are lovely and willing to help however I feel like the room and board fee is way to much no offense but Dillard's dorms aren't 5 star suits i don't feel we should pay for them like they are such I think it can be lowered and made more affordable for students
College Freshman,4,"Everything is great here, just some of my fellow classmates do not belong."
College Freshman,4,"I hear this is a very prestigious school, and I am excited to see what my future degree gets me."
College Freshman,4,"I love my room, but some of my friend's rooms are relatively small."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy the campus' atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"This is a closed campus, and upon entering the campus, there are several speed bumps that prevent the possibilities of reckless driving."
College Freshman,4,"The value of campus housing varies depending on what residential hall you're housed in. The best are Camphor and Straight Hall. Williams has its disadvantages, but has some advantages as well."
Sophomore,2,"taking online courses is very frusting and confusing.  when taking an online course the workload piles up fairly quickly, you are expected to learn the material on your own and ask the professor any questions you may have. other than that you take a quiz and test in front the professor which is the only time you see your professor in person unless you plan on tutoring . if you are not ready to be responsible for learning the material and its demanding workload  just  stick to in-person class."
Freshman,2,"I'm only a freshman but the workload hasn't been awful but the school life itself is incredibly boring. There also anything on campus that I have any interest in. Commuters seem to be very underappreciated or overlooked from my viewpoint, nothing is taken into consideration for them. I understand that those living on campus need to adjust but commuters have problems and needs too."
Freshman,2,"They keep secrets, everything is dirty with mold. They eat up your money and then waste it. They don't let you know anything until the day of!"
Freshman,2,My experience at Dillard has been dusty thus far . I’m a second semester Freshman and I don’t like how unorganized the staff is in general . The campus police cares about the irrelevant situations and lets anybody on campus . Dillard does anything to keep their name held high instead of thinking about the favor of the student .
College Junior,2,"The process to sign up for your room this year was extremely unorganized and unfair. The apartments on campus need to be renovated as well as Williams Dorms. The housing on campus is way too overpriced for the condition they are in. With that being said, a lot of students are moving off of campus and living at another university while still attending Dillard."
College Senior,2,i need a money to finish here at Dillard
College Senior,2,Volleyball and track are good! basketball....
College Senior,2,"lack of quality, high prices!"
College Senior,2,"Great attractions in the downtown; other than that, just shopping malls, parks & restaurants."
College Junior,2,DU dining has not been the best for me. I order out.
College Senior,2,It is difficult to get the aid that you need. Keep your paperwork in order and follow up regularly.
College Freshman,2,I would advise you to bring your own laptop because the computers on campus are broken or they run extremely slow which can be very frustrating.
College Freshman,2,"You have to pay for parking, it is $150 I think which I think is dumb and there is barely anywhere to park but you don't want to park your car off campus."
College Freshman,2,"The basketball team is horrible. There is a basketball, volleyball, and track team. The volleyball and Track team only seem to be good."
College Freshman,2,"The school would prefer students to stay on campus. I'm almost sure they wouldn't recommend somewhere for students to stay, but on-campus. Where students live off-campus vary. I've heard of so many places."
College Freshman,2,"There is barely any nightlife here. We rarely have campus given parties, but there is always a party or a kickback in someone's room or the on-campus apartments."
College Sophomore,2,Repetitive food selections. Not very tasty meals. It just simply gets the job done.
College Senior,2,"The good thing about Dillard is how close and friendly everybody is, we're like a big family. And because we are like family no one (be it Greek or Non-Greek) imposes there beliefs or viewpoints on to the next one. When Greeks ""step"" on Dillard campus it's ALWAYS fun to watch & see how they diss or mock the other Greeks. Very entertaining, but very down to earth."
College Sophomore,2,"My school does not have a football team, our basketball team sucks, and we have tennis courts but no tennis team."
College Sophomore,2,"My school's athletic program could definitely use some improvement. The only teams that are highly sponsored and recognized are basketball and volleyball. We have no football, baseball or soccer teams, but we do have dance, cheerleading, and track and field teams, all of which have decreased in size due to injuries from lack of proper equipment and training facilities. Our trainers tend to ignore any athlete that is not from basketball or volleyball and it has been addressed several times."
College Junior,2,"Although I have not recieved a decent amount of money from Dillard University, the finanacial aid and scholarships are great. When it came down to getting my financial aid I knew to call in before school started for the fall. I knew I had to stay on Dillard. Dillard University needs to offer more assistant with the help of distributing financial aid."
College Junior,2,"The Freshman dorms are not too great, but the off campus apartments as well as the on campus apartments are great. They need to stick with the old living arrangments and not the new."
College Senior,2,"Dillard University is a private school, times it can be difficult to get a scholarship because of no support from the public unlike pubic universities."
College Freshman,2,"The process of getting into the nursing program is not very hard. All it really requires are the prerequisite classes, a test, and a nice GPA. The only difficulties I have ran into was a problem with scheduling that anyone would refuse to fix. To my current knowledge there are no abnormal application processes"
College Freshman,2,"Nursing at Dillard University. Before I started to attend the school I heard that it would be very hard to graduate as a nursing student, but as always I was ready for the challenge. What no one told me was that my advisors would provide little to no help. I have learned that is not very hard to get into the program if you have the right schedules, in most cases the students did not which will cause them another year of school. It is a very good program but scheduling is something you have to stay on top of."
College Freshman,2,I personally feel they could do more for the community.
College Freshman,2,Usually when I'm  coming from out my apartment. all the spots are full and I take 8 am classes. Its first come first serve.
College Freshman,2,Some of the teachers at Dillard University are excellent they try their very hardest to teachto the best of their capabilities and they care about you and your education. But most of the faculty at the school are very unorganized and this unorganization tends to rush and put a feeling of a stress among the students.
College Sophomore,2,"At Dillard people have great spirit whether our team wins or loses. The track team and volleyball team are known for their many wins and the student body really supports them. Another sport such as basketball is an okay sport because they rarely win games, but the students still support them."
College Freshman,2,"Being that Dillard is a historically black college, the majority of the campus is African American. There are a few international students and students of different races. Even though everybody is mostly the same race, there are a lot of different beliefs present on campus. This causes a lot of conflict between students."
College Freshman,2,When it rains really hard and fast its like a lake throughout the entire campus.  Trying to avoid puddles is like walking around an olympic size pool.
College Junior,2,"I have been to other university campus and the areas surrounding, and they have a bigger variety, than we do. There is only one restaurant that gives student discounts, Subway. The prices are pretty average, however, for a college students average is to much. It would be great to have buffets around, but there are none around."
College Sophomore,2,Kearny Dining Services can be a disappointment at times.
College Freshman,2,I am still in the process of solving some of my problems with registration and others have their own problems with professors and registration process
College Freshman,2,"At first it was hard dealing with the financial aid office but after bugging them they started to do their job and help me out, but they mess up everyones money and overcharge people."
College Sophomore,2,"It is comfortable but expensive. For the price you are paying, I believe the dorms should be better. Some rooms do not have air conditioning and you would have to wait for it to be repaired."
College Sophomore,2,"I gave it a C because it's not too bad because there are parties and stuff that go on on bourbon, and places like Magazine street are cool to visit on a weekend, but it's not like it's going to be a blast if you're really looking for some fun."
College Junior,2,"the weather in New Orleans,La is fairly well but you have to definitely be prepared fpr the Unknown the weather down south is very bi polar and you must be prepared at all times."
College Sophomore,2,"Now You See It – Many students openly discuss their usage around campus. Although, it is not done out in the open, a non-drug or alcohol user would easily be able to locate where he or she could get drugs and alcohol from."
College Junior,2,Being Under Pressure – It really depends on if you are under pressure or just like to do it just to get by in the day. No one is stopping you from drinking it or from buying it. It honestly is on a matter of self control.
Freshman,1,"If you have online you're basically your own teacher. I have a spanish course which is fully online and have yet to have an actual conversation with my professor. She gives about 15 assignments which are due every Sunday and that's just that , no zooms nothing."
Freshman,1,"Dillard overall is TERRIBLE and when I say that I truly mean that! All the staff are just lazy and you can tell they never get in trouble because all their actions are the same. Coming from someone who actually cares deeply for their education, Dillard isn't it.The security workers don't do their jobs neither, there's no reason for them to even work nor have a gate because they just let anybody in. If you have online classes prepare to be your own teacher because those teachers are just as lazy as the in person teachers basically just getting a free check. In all do not come to Dillard they give me very much community college vibes rather than a private school."
Freshman,1,The students not friendly and I had a horrible experience. the food is nasty. the professors are so unorganized. the dorms are too small and very nasty. they paired you with the worst roommate ever. and the security is wack. anybody get in the door because the door are always open. trust me. chose a better option. my  adviser was horrible. Don't go to the evening program. THEY ARE NOT FRIENDLY. They will also keep you a freshman even if you went to two colleges.
College Freshman,1,Coming from California I wasn't used to the humidity which was horrible. If you're not from the south you will hate it.
College Junior,1,"Campus police officers are never really around, and they don't pay attention to the students."
College Junior,1,The houses off-campus last year (they are closed now b/c the school is now trying to move all housing on campus) was not the best. Mold was still very relevant and rodents were still around.
College Junior,1,"The Drug Safety here at Dillard University isnt really big, although many students take part in the Drug Using it doesnt really have a factor on the university. Many students at Dillard UNiversity take part in small time drinking then doing other Drugs."
College Sophomore,1,Greek Life could do better for the school and community. They could be way more active. Have more activities for the student body to participate in along with the community.
College Freshman,1,"Campus dining is very different to me and was not at all what I expected to get out of a college dining experience. There is one dining hall and one on campus fast food restaurant. The food is good sometimes but is not always available and after a while gets old. I suggest having a well stocked dorm room because after seven on campus dining is not available, so late night snacking is not an option, and if you just so happen to have one of those three hour classes that seem be during dining hours dorm food is again a great option. If a student lives on campus they have no choice but to purchase a meal plan which they might use only sometimes during the year."
College Freshman,1,"Dillard University's facilities are very lack luster and does not match the cost of tuition. The tuition with the school is around $28,000 year and all of the facilities are either mold redden or new and the faculty expects you to keep their newly renovated places extremely clean to where it is unlivable. Also the education at the school does not match the cost of the tuition,teachers and faculty are all pretty much unorganized and everything is last-minute and all the students feel rushed"
College Junior,1,"The City of New Orleans does not allow you to believe in the news station. You never know when it is going to rain or when the sun is going to be out, you just have to be prepared. On Dillard University's campus, when it rains, you figuratively have to swim to class because the drainage system is horrible."
College Freshman,1,"The girls here are very judgemental and messy. They are not very accepting of people from other states, especially California where I am from. The boys here are mostly homosexual and stay to themselves. They are just as messy as the girls."
College Freshman,1,The events here are few and far in between its pretty much a dead campus.
College Freshman,1,It is horrible barely any scholarships or grants available.
College Freshman,1,Dillard only has two entries on the campus and if one of the gates are closed you have to go all the way around the campus to get to where you need to go.  So don't be late.
College Freshman,1,Rodents and/or squirrels.  The females in this dorm leave food everywhere which attract rodents.  The males leave food out that attract racoons.  These things carry diseases.
College Sophomore,1,"No computer lab for Chemistry and some of science majors. 
Print facilities are available only at library.
Speed of network, wireless access is fair."
College Sophomore,1,Its very hard to get any kind of financial aid/scholarship/awards at Dillard university!
College Freshman,1,The dining hall on campus is very vaugue. It provides almost the same meal every week. It becomes predictable after awhile.
College Freshman,1,the cafe people are really nice but its the same think every week nothing really changes...for the price your paying there aren't many options.

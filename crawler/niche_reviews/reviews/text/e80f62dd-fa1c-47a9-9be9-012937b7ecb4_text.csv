Freshman,5,"I really enjoy Penn State Brandywine because I am a commuter. I think that it is a great school if you want a small environment with big school resources. I don't think I would enjoy living there, but I am always excited to get on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I had a really good experience as a freshman at Brandywine. what I like about Penn state is that it is cheaper than many other colleges, students are nice and friendly, many of the professors are also nice and always there to help. I don't think there is anything that I will want to change about Brandywine."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken all my classes online since the COVID19 pandemic started. It was a really new experience for me, and it was difficult to get used to online learning. I couldn't focus, study, or get the help I need like I used when I was on campus. However, most of my professors tried their best to help us and made sure we can get the help we need to succeed and pass all of my classes."
Sophomore,5,"It was fairly easy to navigate online classes, but I still prefer in-person learning. My professors were good at using online learning but I know they too wanted to go back."
Sophomore,5,I really like how understanding/caring the professors are. I wish that the textbooks wouldn't cost so much.
Freshman,5,"Excellent Undergrad Advisors, they kept me updated on my application and next steps after accepting their offer letter."

Freshman,5,Professors and staff are very friendly and class sizes are very good so I can experience one on one with my professors. Work load is manageable. Many chances to go to different events on campus each week and food is always provided at most of the events. Changes I would make would be to have a little better wifi because it is sometimes hard to connect depending on where you are.
College Freshman,5,Being at campus makes you feel like your in a safeguard.
College Freshman,5,On campus and there to help!
College Freshman,5,Students come and go so it makes it hard for people to know about the sporting events.  But not everyone pays attention to athletics.  Others focus on their needs.
College Freshman,5,Penn State Brandywine University makes you feel like family.
College Freshman,5,"Every person on campus is treated equally no matter what race, religion, or sexual orientation."
College Freshman,5,"There are regular patrols by campus police every hour or so. The walkways are open and brightly lit for people with late classes. The atmosphere is very safe and friendly, and the patrolmen on campus are approachable and kind."
College Freshman,5,"Each team, no matter what sport, is like a family. The coaches and players have fun with their sport. The support for teams is overwhelming. School spirt is the greatest aspect of Penn State."
College Freshman,5,The faculty and student body are very welcoming and helpful in every aspect. The professors are encouraging and helpful when needed. The diverse activities are fun and inviting.
College Freshman,5,Penn State has an excellent safety and security policy.  I feel very comfortable while on campus.  Administration in the financial aid and tuition office are also very helpful and make things much easier to understand.  Teaching staff has been excellent and truly take an interest in the lives of their students.
College Freshman,5,A lot of students goto sporting events to help support Brandywine. Everyone is so excited to see their fans.
College Sophomore,5,There are no drugs that I know of on our college campus.
College Sophomore,5,Our campus has a big diversity and no one is ever left out.
College Sophomore,5,The academics at Penn State are exceptional.  The classes prepare students for all majors and life after graduation.  Having a strong alumni support is a major advantage in attending Penn State University.  This allows you to connect with graduates for internships and jobs in the future.  
College Senior,5,I have always felt safe on campus. I have never heard of any crimes on campus.
College Junior,5,"Pen State Brandywine has a no hate policy. White, Black, and all other ethnicities are welcome. It has a pleasant and welcome atmosphere where students can learn. At Penn State Brandywine, I feel at home. It is an excellent school with many activities. There is no drinking in school. The school do not tolerate discrimination and injustice. This school is all about learning and apply knowledge in the classroom and outside the classroom. There are excellent instructors to help students. These instructors use different methods to teach."
College Senior,5,Simply perfect and less expensive than living on campus
College Freshman,5,"The majors are exciting careers, and there are lot if good professors teaching those majors."
College Junior,5,"The atmosphere here at Penn State is enlightening, clean and friendly."
College Sophomore,5,"Up to Date – At PSU Brandywine, the computers may be only slightly behind the times. However, everything is always in working order and they are fast and you don't have to look far to find one. They do a great job."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is provided to you. If you need help, you get it, no questions asked. There are some limitations since it's a satellite campus of University Park. Mostly, the teachers are great and the staff is nice and respectful of the students. I personally have only encountered one problem  in my time at Brandywine."
College Sophomore,5,"Not Too Strict – Since PSU Brandywine is a commuter school, there aren't too many big rules to follow. I don't think they technically care about what goes on outside of the campus, but inside, of course- no drugs or drinking. That's a given. It's more or less common sense to be tactful on campus in every aspect (dress, tasteful words, no loud music, etc.) and it's upheld those policies from what I see."
Freshman,4,"I think Penn State Brandywine does as much as they can do with the online learning. Online education is never the same quality as in person, but the professors really do try and put effort in. Also, PSU Brandywine provides Zoom rooms on campus if you want to do your online classes there!"
Freshman,4,My first year I've had a blast at Penn State Brandywine. It's a perfect way of meeting people if you plan on doing the 2+2. You have so many opportunities to get involved and is a great stepping stone between high school and the enormity of University Park. It is easy to get help and ask questions. My largest class was around 20-25 students. You get to know the professors and they get to know you.  There are so many activities on campus and was a very smooth transition for me.
Sophomore,4,"I love that Penn State-Brandywine is a small school that allows students to focus on their academics. The campus is about forty minutes from Philadelphia, so if students wanted to enjoy a party scene, it was possible. I also like that there is a good amount of professors that really care about the students. They will go over the material several times for the students to understand it. The dorm is very new and very up to date, and I love it. It is super comfortable, and has very inclusive ideas.   I would have like to see more things to do on the weekend. Many students went home on the weekends, so the campus was very quiet then."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school, it’s a small campus but with so much diversity. A community where everyone knowns and interact with each other. The fitness center is worth going to if you love working out"
Junior,4,PS Brandywine is a great commuter campus. The only thing I dislike is their course selection. Most classes are only scheduled for one time rather than a range of times throughout the day.
Freshman,4,"Penn state Brandywine is so far a good school is you want to do the 2 and 2 program that penn state offerst and then transfer to majn campus. It saves you about 15 to 20 k a year including the room. If you don't like 200 to 500 size classrooms then Brandywine is great option. But it can get boring, otherwise it is a good place if you want to just actually go to college"
Freshman,4,"Penn State Brandywine is an intimate campus with a few students but amazing faculty. Due to the small size it is very easy for a student to get a one on one meeting with professors to clear up doubts or to ask advice,  something that I often did.  Every facility is well thought of and provided.  Moreover the diversity at this campus is vast which is a refreshing experience for an international student. The courses are very interesting and the teachers make it even more so. There are regular field trips which amount to an amazing, very American experience to people who are new to this country. I would definitely urge future students who have chosen Penn State today least spend a year here!"
College Sophomore,4,"I like Penn State Brandywine because the class size is medium, and   is not a large number of student in the classroom."
College Junior,4,"The professor at Penn state (Brandywine) make the campus unique. Most of the professor were past students at Penn state.The professors understand the feeling of being a student, and how it can  be overwhelming. They were once seated at the seat the students are now seating. Therefore, I would choose Penn State (Brandywine) again."
College Junior,4,"Its a small campus, so there isn't much school spirit."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus and if I needed anything campus security would help if I asked
College Freshman,4,there is a varity of athletic sports and events for the students
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very accepting and willing to help if someone had a question.
College Freshman,4,The camps is right in the middle of of a lot to do. If you need food and you have a car you can go about anywhere within ten minutes.
College Senior,4,"The scholarship office will send emails letting you know if you are eligible.  When taking into consideration that you have to be returning to Brandywine for the upcoming academic year, how many people will actually take the time to apply, etc. your chances of be awarded a scholarship are pretty good.  You just have to make sure you fill out the application on time."
College Sophomore,4,Nothing bad really happens on our campus.. Ever. But I think that the faculty and students are prepared of something does happen
College Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus. Not too large and not crowded.
College Sophomore,4,I get an academic scholarship from Penn State. It's not that large but it's still a great help. There's also other scholarships you can apply for in the spring semester depending on your grades. Keep good grades and help paying for school will definitely come your way.
Recent Alumnus,4,We have had at least one professional day where about five or six agencies came in and collected resumes and spoke about their companies. It has been mentioned that a degree from Penn State is very valuable. I guess I will know for sure once I am applying to jobs.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I enjoy Penn State Brandywine and the area in which it is located. Many of my professors are very much interested in the field of Human Development and are very helpful with issues related to course material or personal (such as jobs, parenting, etc). I have had at least two or three professors that I love and find that their students mean a lot to them. The sizes of my classes were always very good. I enjoyed my courses because they are all so different, and for the general education courses there are so many to choose from."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are various options, such as sit-down, fast food and various ethnic cuisine restaurants."
College Student,4,"Theres many computers on campus everywhere. Printers are available, everyone is given 200 pages each semester and if you go above that limit, which you hardly won't but if you do, theres charges."
College Student,4,"We have a lot of international students and diversity, its great to see everyone get along and learn from each other."
College Student,4,I love the major I picked but it obviously is hard and difficult. I'm just worried that I won't find my dream job but lets hope for the best.

College Student,4,Engineering is great at this campus. All the classes I need for my major are available on this campus.
College Sophomore,4,"i am new to the campus this semester but as of now it seems like the athletics department are very involved with every student on campus, at least they try to be. we do not have a football team but we have both men's and women's basketball teams I have not been to a game yet but from what I hear the games are good and they get a lot of support."
College Sophomore,4,There are clubs meetings and many opportunities to talk to professors that specialize in your particular major.
College Sophomore,4,There are many opportunities for students to get involved.  The major hangout that I know about is the Lion's Den.
College Sophomore,4,"Student involvement is crucial at the college I attend.  Even if the students are not playing in a sport, involvement is still encouraged as well as the presence of the students."
College Sophomore,4,Depending what time you arrive on the college campus the parking situation is very easy and manageable.  
College Sophomore,4,Not the worst but it's ok for a small campus
College Sophomore,4,"There appears to be a large diversity of all these things and no one really seems to care so much about it, rather they just look at them as another person"
College Senior,4,"I like that I am being taught by professors that love teaching. Their passion shows and it is great. We get individual attention from the staff when we need help or have question. The workload is a lot, but if you really want to teach you will be on top of everything."
College Senior,4,"It is required that I have an unpaid teaching internship every semester. My school always finds me an internship.They are very nice and allow me to gain valuable teaching experience. Sometimes, however, it is a lot with a full course load."
College Senior,4,"I am very happy with my program and my major. I would do it all over again. Since I am going for teaching, I am concerned about finding a job after graduation because teaching jobs are hard to come by."
College Senior,4,"There are a few majors at Penn State Brandywine. I have only had a few professor because of my major, but the professors outside of my major were very nice and they loved what they taught. The workloads were average too."
College Senior,4,"I love the program and the staff. The staff s helpful and they love what they teach. The workload is not too much. I do not like some of the times the classes are offered, but other than that it is great."
College Senior,4,You must pass the Praxis 1 and have a 3.0 G.P.A to get into the program. I would say take all the recommend classes before hand and do well in them. Also take the Praxis early.
College Sophomore,4,"I came to PSU Brandywine for the psychology program. Professors are very helpful, registration is simple, and the university's Angel site is very useful as professors will often post presentations and important documents online."

College Junior,4,"I commute by car, but I always see public transportation on campus."
College Junior,4,"I believe that Penn State brandywine is not only known for a research school; it is also known for great athletic school. Penn State Brandywine has a   great women basketball team, however; the women basketball did not make it to the final they are still a great team. Most of these women are intelligent students.  They are friendly and  they are role models for other students.   Penn State Brandywine has an excellent fan to cheer them up. Men football team is also great because they have the ability to win despise previous issue. These athletes are excellent and so their coaches."
College Freshman,4,The financial process was good for me. The tuition office held me with any trouble I had and pointed me to the right direction. But the school didn't inform me that one of my grants didn't go through until I went there and found out for myself.
College Freshman,4,"Penn State Brandywine doesn't really have much shops to go dining, but the is a mall down the road and some restaurant chains around the mall. If you don't have a car then you have to take the bus to get to the restaurants.  The only convenient place to eat is at the cafe, the food is good but is to expensive."

College Sophomore,4,"Good, Not the Best but Not the Worst. Some teachers seem very knowledgeable. Some do seem like they are there only to get paid. I would have to say the vast majority are honest, they don't sugar coat the difficulty in classes, they help, and are really well versed in their respective subjects that they teach. There are a few professors that don't really care if you have trouble, they'll say ""pay attention next time"" and not offer help, but this is a small group."
College Freshman,4,"The diversity is very good at Penn State Brandywine, there is a good amount of students that are different. A good mixture of different cultures and religions."
College Freshman,4,The professors cater to the students. The classroom has a more individual atmosphere. The campus also offers tutoring in classes for free. The ITS department also helps with any computer problems and is willing to lend free software
College Sophomore,4,"Never Had a Problem – I receive a good bulk of my tuition from financial aid, and making payment plans were simple if you go to the financial office in the main building."
College Sophomore,4,Finamcial aid assisted me on my education. The school inform you on dates to apply and make sure you do before the deadline by sending emails on your account or reminders.
College Sophomore,4,penn State Brandywine parking situation is very strict and free. Security is helpful because they are protective. They are vigilant and aware of visitors on campus. The availabily of parking space is perfect because their is unlimited space.
College Student,4,"Penn State Brandywine is such a great place to be! It has successful sport teams, intellectual professors, delicious food, state-of-the-art equipment, and great peoiple to be around. You may feel awkward at first, but once you emmerse yourself, you will wish they had dorms so you would never have to leave."
College Junior,4,"The Campus Life – You'll find many types of students with many different backgrounds/styles and ethnic groups on our campus. However, because most of the students are from the city we all sure the same tease in clothes, girls and guys alike. Everyone seems friendly for the most part and you can always find help from a stranger on campus. Our campus is very welcoming"
Sophomore,2,"Most of the faculty is very nice. If you are looking for college-lite this is for you. There is no social life and the campus is very dry. The cafe food is most of the time only fried food and if you do not have a car is your only option. The people here are great, but the campus is just in the middle of nowhere."
College Sophomore,2,"I chose to go to this campus in the hopes that it would be easier to learn the material for the Smeal college of business, but I was not expecting on a small campus (smaller than my high school) that the professors would be so stuck up and unhelpful."
College Freshman,2,Very bad professors and the academic level of this college is very poor
College Freshman,2,"Unless you are currently living without your parents or relative, getting housing is very pricy. Most student commute from cities nearby."
College Freshman,2,"Good soccer and volleyball team, that's about it."

College Sophomore,2,"It's not bad but, right now there have been a lot of snot storms which effects class time."
College Sophomore,2,"They have a bus late night for transportation, but there really is nothing to do late night"
College Junior,2,"The only options on campus is the cafeteria and vending machines in the buildings. It is limited. Although, just a short trip down the street is a mall with plenty of options."
College Freshman,2,A commute community therefore it is hard to establish a stable atmosphere
College Freshman,2,"Bon Appetite – There is not much of a variety of food. Same food every day, but there is a Wawa 5 minutes from the school"
College Sophomore,2,"There are many opportunities for scholarships, but getting them can be a little difficult due to numbers of students applying, etc."
College Senior,2,"Driving Is Best – While there is some public transportation, it is just the SEPTA buses.  There are only a couple routes that run directly to the school, so it may be necessary to take multiple modes of transportation to get to campus. Your best option would be to drive to school."
College Senior,2,"Attendance Policy – The biggest rule that is campus-wide is the Attendance Policy. This policy is either followed very strictly by some professors, or not really at all by others. The general rule is that a student may miss as many classes as the class meets per week (3 classes for a 3x a week course.)"
Freshman,1,"If you want to l experience any bit of the college lifestyle do not come here , this place is awful. Teachers do not teach most of the classes are self taught without any guidance. There is absolutely no sense of community. students including myself present themselves as robots just going through the motions. Not a single redeeming quality at Penn State Brandywine."
College Freshman,1,"Academically, this school meets the needs of most, but only because it is so closely affiliated with the Penn State system. This is basically a very small step up from community college. The teachers are passionate and caring and there are many resources and travel oppurtunites however that you won't find at community college. But, like I said, the only reason this is possible is because of the University Park Campus and the Penn State network as a whole. Social life is entirely non-existent. Nobody talks to each other because nobody wants to be here. It is really quite depressing. I'm a very social person and am here because my mom would not pay for tuition to a school that I would live at for fears of me not succeeding academically.  At first I thought I'd be fine and make some friends but this is The. Worst. College. Experience. Ever!  Zero parties, terrible class times, horrible food, and you're surrounded entirely by trashy people. There are a few normal kids (typically freshman in a similar situation as me) but beyond that it is mostly introverts, war veterans, or people rambling on about going to main campus. I hate this place with a burning passion and the only reason I am doing well here is because of my desire to transfer ASAP. Penn State is an amazing university as whole, this is just a boring campus. If you can't get into Penn State - University Park, either pick a major that will get you there after one year like Athletic Training, or go to Altoona. If you're a social person and you're friends are all off at other schools I can guarantee you will hate this place. This is the worst year of my life and I fear it'a really beginning to hold me back. All I can think about is how I should be of having fun, making new friends, and surrounded by oppurtunity. But here I am, I just hope it's not for much longer. F this place :)"
College Freshman,1,Unless you have not been accepted to any other schools or you're facing financial problems I would definitely suggest a different school to you. The overall assessment of the school is very poor for both academic and social wise.
College Freshman,1,No parties available. Most students have friends outside psu brandywine or visit other colleges for parties.
College Freshman,1,There is no campus spirit
College Freshman,1,Unfortunately the admission is very little to no help to the students
College Freshman,1,Not many internship programs available
College Freshman,1,"Biology - terrible professors, except for one, discouraging advisors, professors are not helpful"
College Freshman,1,No parties. They attempted to throw a homecoming dance which ended in a complete waste of money
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid like stated above is an headache. I am right now considered not registered because my financial aid got messed up from me transferring schools last year. the school doesn't care much weather you have enough financial aid to get through school and because of this I had to take an entire school year off just to be able to pay for college, I am a year behind and still struggling"
College Sophomore,1,There are no dorms on campus.
College Sophomore,1,By Far the worst decision I have made was attending this campus.
College Sophomore,1,no one talks or cares to be there. Very rude
College Sophomore,1,By Far the worst decision I have made was attending this campus. The professors do not do anything to help at all. They grade overly hard and do not help to explain themselves. They leave all the learning to your research and your books
College Sophomore,1,It was one of the worst decisions I have ever made by going to this school and I regret it everyday I think about the place. It makes you feel like your back at high school which no one in college wants to feel like. They are the most unhelpful staff in any college. I advise anyone looking to go here to look else where.
College Sophomore,1,It is a commuting college so there is nothing to do at night.
College Senior,1,"There is no help. It must be done all on your own. Scholarships are clearly not given based on academic achievement, they are given based on if the scholarship committee like a person."
College Senior,1,There is really nothing to do except a run down mall that no one goes to.
College Senior,1,The Lion's Den on campus is horrible. It is over priced and they do not offer any variety or options for those on special diets (Vegan). They serve mostly fried finger food and old fruit cups.
College Senior,1,The boys and girls at my school are not attractive and they have no drive to amount to anything on life. They pick the easy majors so they can glide by in school.

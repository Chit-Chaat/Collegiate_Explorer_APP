Freshman,5,They're doing the best they can and they're succeeding! The professors are great and they actually care about their students.
Freshman,5,So with Carthage the first week of classes were online now all of  my classes are in person. Week one we mainly got to know each other and get into what we will be doing over the course of the year.
Freshman,5,I've only been at Carthage for a few weeks but I already love it. The teachers are so understanding and whenever I have a problem they always make sure to ask me about it. I love how we have small class sizes so the teachers are able to connect with me more and the campus is so beautiful. Being able to see the lake in the morning everyday is amazing. I was having a lot of doubts before I committed due to financial issues but I'm glad I get to call myself a Carthaginian!
Freshman,5,Carthage is such a beautiful campus and right on Lake Michigan. All the professors and students are very nice and friendly. The professors want all of their students to succeed and be prepaid for their future careers. If a student need help they can go to the tutoring center in the library or get help for their professor during the professor's office hours.
Freshman,5,Some of my classes are hybrid right now. The professors do a great job of making sure that everyone online that day understands what is going in class and makes it feel like you are in the classroom with everyone else.
Freshman,5,I like the classes and the teachers. I love the sense of togetherness and community. The awesome athletics facilities.
Junior,5,I had to go online due to the virus. All my professors were so willing to help any time they could. They responded quickly to emails and were willing to set up zoom calls to meet for extra help.
Sophomore,5,"The teachers are amazing in both their knowledge and passion for the subjects they teach.  My teachers are very supportive with my double major in Musical Theatre and Music Education Vocal, and my Dance minor.  Last week my voice teacher told me I could ask for lessons in the summer which I really appreciate.  As a freshman I had eleven classes in my first semester and all my teachers we supportive and understanding if I was late to class by a few minutes.  The community on campus with all the students and teachers feels like a big family.  I have three staff members in different departments that act like moms to me.  All of the teachers really know their field that they teach and it is amazing that I can take all this information.  I love learning new things and being challenged with new things, and my teachers are always throwing new material an information at me.  I have always wanted to go to college since I was three years old and I am so grateful to be at this college."
Freshman,5,It’s my home. I have fell in love with everything about it since my first day on campus touring. I only have good things to say about it and I truly believe Carthage has made me a better “me.”
Sophomore,5,"I love it at Carthage. Very welcoming and the teachers are fantastic. I was a transfer from an out of state, state university. The education doesn't even compare to the education here. I am challenged here. Even through this pandemic, my teachers have been on top of things. Zoom classes each class meeting, assignments and with grading them as well. I would highly recommend this college."
Freshman,5,The experience I have gotten by visiting was amazing. One change I would like is to see more involvement.
Junior,5,Choosing to go to Carthage was one of the best decisions I ever made. The professors were all very knowledgable in their fields and challenge you to think. Plus the campus is beautiful!
Freshman,5,"Carthage College is a very nice and clean looking school. I've had a great first two weeks here, met a lot of new people, the professors are very nice and helpful. I like Carthage because they push you to get out there and create great experiences which you will remember forever, they also love to have their students get involved in activities and they love to help you get more social. I have no major problems with this college, but if there was anything I would like to see change it would most likely be for Carthage to offer better meals in the cafeteria."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment of the school. I would just like better food in the cafe. I also love the how you share a bathroom with your roommate in the dorms instead of the whole floor on a community bathroom.
Alum,5,"Carthage gave me everything I could have hoped for in a college experience. From the small class sizes to the amount of student groups I could join, I felt right at home. I was able to connect with my professors on a personal level and make friendships that will last a lifetime."
Niche User,5,They were amazing working with me about different opportunities at the school and affording it as well.
Junior,5,"I like how Carthage is so close knit. For a smaller school, it still feels like there are multiple opportunities. I enjoy being able to speak with professors very often and have a good relationship with them (they know your name, you aren't just another student). The community is great and you'll always know at least one person walking down campus drive."
Freshman,5,"I loved how everyone was so friendly. The campus was clean, the building were newer, and it has a beautiful view of the lake."
Freshman,5,"Carthage is an amazing and inviting place. People are nice and professors are willing to help. Challenging but rewarding, you are pushed to be your best self."
Sophomore,5,"Great community, and plenty of ways to be involved and keep busy throughout the school year. Quite a variety in academics as well."
Junior,5,I currently transferred to this school due to the faculty is great. They encourage and inspire their students to have a happy and successful future.
Sophomore,5,"The lake view is beautiful! I like the small class sizes. They allow me to connect with my professors and classmates. I enjoy being on a small campus, especially in the winter. The athletic programs are strong and the athletic facilities are great!"
Junior,5,"My review might be different than the average college student since I am also a parent of a current college student.  I love attending Carthage!  They have an amazing campus, good food options for people who have to eat there, and the staff is outstanding!  I have had some excellent teachers."
Niche User,5,"Great nursing lab, best I've seen. The skills lab has so many mannequins 
To practice all sorts of different skills from tracheostomies to urinary catheterization to if lines, including adults, pediatric patients and newborns.  Facilities are newer, as it is not an older campus. The sports facility is awesome for all the sports. I was impressed with the swimming pool, basketball gym, and golf simulator. The dorm rooms are average size of colleges. The dining room has so many different variety of foods available. The campus is smaller, located on the Lake Michigan and is beautiful. Classroom sizes are also small and professors are more readily available than a larger school."
Sophomore,5,Your class sizes are super small so you get to know your professors really well and are able to get a lot of help.
Sophomore,5,"My overall college experience has been great so far. I am finally able to study things that are of interest to me, I have had the opportunity to meet many wonderful new people, and transition into college life was almost completely painless."
Freshman,5,It is a really good collage. Professors really help you when you need it the most. Its a small school so you can develop a good relationship with everyone.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Carthage so far has been one of a kind. The lake is a fantastic attribute that Carthage has to offer. It makes for a unique atmosphere. Beyond that, the classrooms are small and great for student teacher relationships and allow for a personalized experience. The facilities and building are state of the art and very comfortable. The sports programs and coaches are dedicated and focused to success. Overall Carthage has all the aspects that you look for in a school"
Freshman,5,"I love it here at Carthage! The campus is beautiful, the classes are intriguing, and the students and faculty are some of the best people that I've ever met!"
Niche User,5,Carthage is one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever been on! Right on Lake Michigan. It is a small liberal arts school. The student success center has amazing people working in there!
Junior,5,"Carthage College is a campus which allows for students to be prepared to either pursue future education, or enter the work force. Organizations on campus appeal to all backgrounds, and faculty care deeply on the subjects covered."
Sophomore,5,I am having a great experience attending Carthage! I have very nice professors and there is a great atmosphere here.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy Carthage College because the atmosphere encourages creativity. I am an art student and I appreciate that this school does not push the arts to the side; rather, they highlight them."
Niche User,5,I think the staff is extremely helpful and kind and excited about their job. The students are very welcoming and great to be around. The teachers seem like they care about your successes and want you to improve. I liked the idea that class sizes are small so that allows more one on one time with your teacher.
Freshman,5,I love carthage because the Lake is right there. You know quite a few people and have your close friends. The professors are always willing to help too.
Niche User,5,"I had an enjoyable experience at Carthage. Professors were friendly and taught well, classmates were a pleasure to be with, and the location of the school is right on the lake which is awesome. This school gave me so much in terms of setting me up for the future, an easy 5 stars from me."
Works Here,5,I currently am employed and will attend classes in February. The campus is wonderful along with the staff. This is a school I feel very safe and welcomed at and can't wait to start here!
Freshman,5,Student life is very present on campus. Something I would like to change is the old furniture in some of the dorms.
Freshman,5,"Although I haven't yet attended Carthage College and will be attending in the fall, I chose Carthage, because of it's beautiful campus, great academic programs, wonderful staff, and their strong communication with me.  They are easy to contact with any questions and truly want their students to feel comfortable and at home at Carthage."
Sophomore,5,"Carthage College is a beautiful campus  that sits right next to lake Michigan. What I enjoy the most about Carthage is the class size, no class is bigger than twenty students. It gives the students, as well as the professor, the chance to connect and really get to know each other. Something you couldn't get on a bigger  campus.  The dorms come with a lake view, and weather is almost always perfect."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Carthage College has been an extraordinary institution with staff and faculty who excel at their professions. The class sizes, and one - on - one relationships with staff and faculty really help to engage me in my studies, and help me focus and stay active in the campus community"
Niche User,5,"I love Carthage College because it's such a small campus that when you're on campus, you feel like you matter, and it feels like you're apart of a community. Everyone there that I've talked to is genuinely nice, helpful, and extremely intelligent. Their music program is really strong. They have many professors that have played all around the world and who come from different countries. Also, 91% of professors hold a PhD in the subject that they teach. They also have a lot of ways to get involved. They have over 120 clubs that you can join, and they encourage people to make new clubs. Also, the campus is very beautiful. It's right on Lake Michigan."
Niche User,5,"Carthage College is a small liberal arts college with tons of charm.
The professors are awesome and outgoing, the students are involved and spirited, and the alumni are very generous.
On top of that, Carthage is dedicated to improving its future as well as its students' through investment in new facilities. All of Carthage's facilities are state of the art and brand spankin' new. 
Everyone I've met in the community is incredibly nice and the view of Lake Michigan is gorgeous."
Niche User,5,"Food is amazing. Dorms are really good. Professors are well qualified. All athletes are super nice and fun. Athletic center is amazing. Everyone is very intelligent there. lots of clubs to get involved into. It is right on the lake, so it is a gorgeous campus."
Freshman,5,"Carthage College is a wonderful school. The students are very nice and inviting to new students. They have many majors and minors to pick from, and the professors are very open to helping students if they are confused."
Junior,5,Carthage College is a great campus. Its a small community and makes you feel right at home. Each staff member is really helpful and will reply to emails right away. There is almost no wait for any professor or office. The campus if beautiful and right on the lake. Recently they have renovated all of the buildings and they all high tech equipment. This campus is so wonderful.
Freshman,5,"At first I was hesitant on going to a small school, but I can confidently say that I absolutely love Carthage. My experience here has been so unique and life changing that I feel like it is unreal. Going to a small school means that you are instantly a part of a community that is accepting and open minded. I feel welcomed to Carthage in every aspect, whether it is my on campus job, my classes, the floor I live on, or any clubs I decide to join. There is always something to join and I absolutely love it. My classes are all hands on and manageable. My professors all know me and will help me with any questions I have. I feel like if I ever need any help, there are faculty members willing to assist me in any way possible. Denhart is always clean and it is easy to make friends on your floor. Kenosha is a beautiful city and I love to go explore as much as possible. There are always parties happening, and they’re always great. Carthage was definitely the best fit for me."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors and courses available at this school is remarkable.  All of the required classes are very enlightening and I now see why they are necessary.  Those required classes open up your eyes and helps to shape you into a intelligent adult.  All professors have their own teaching styles and are passionate about what they teach, but so far all of the professors had easy to follow plans for each semester.  The class sizes are perfect because the teacher knows you by your name which is a significance part of the reason I went to Carthage."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not graduated from Carthage yet, but when I go around telling people I attend Carthage they have nothing but good things to say about it and it has a good representation around the country.  This small private college gets students ready for the real world and there are many resources that will help with careers and helping students find a job after college."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love housing at Carthage College, this is why I am filling out this survey for the scholarship.  I am filling out multiple scholarships so I can live on campus for one more year.  I love housing at Carthage because I will be living on the floor of my sorority so I will be living close with all of my sisters and we would be able to interact everyday.  The cost to live on campus is a little bit expensive and it is a little small, but with scholarships it will be so much easier for me to pay for it.  I love the social atmosphere of living on campus because you are close to everything and everyone."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is wonderful at Carthage College. It was honestly one of the major factors that caused me to stay at Carthage.  It allowed me to make great and meaningful friends for life.  The sorority that I just joined last semester allowed me to see and be involved in a close knit community.  Joining greek life was the best decision that I have ever made and I will always have these girls for life.
College Sophomore,5,"The school spirit at Carthage is remarkable.  All of the fans are diehard fans for Carthage sports.  We will show up rain, sleet or shine.  The fans know that having them their increase the confidence of the athletes playing and almost guarantee a win.  The Athletic department is a major part in Carthage College."
College Sophomore,5,"The quality of the courses depending on what exact course you are taking is of great quality.  So far, classes that I have taken have been very educating and they have been very helpful.  Some more than others of course.  Class size is just the right amount and the style in which professors teach vary in what professor it is that is teaching the course."
College Sophomore,5,"GREAT, very involved alumni. Lots of wealth."
College Sophomore,5,"Truly enjoy attending Carthage, great atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,I love the small class sizes because the professors truly care about each individual student. Every prof I've had is willing to help and easily accessible.
College Sophomore,5,Just about all of the professors have incredible experience and are great for networking. There are always emails sent out about networking events.
College Sophomore,5,I've never felt unsafe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Carthage is a place which you can truly call home. There's a great mix of people from all walks of life, and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and get integrated with this close-knit community."
College Freshman,5,"I have not had any problem with safety of myself or of my items, nor have I heard of anyone that has had a problem with theft or with safety problems on campus."
Freshman,4,"IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING GOING TO CARTHAGE PLEASE READ MY REVIEW.
The professors are so great and are doing the best they can in this online school situation. 
The campus is beautiful. Yes, it is small, but the buildings are so nice and modern. The dorms ARE ACTUALLY NICE. I'm in Denhart Hall and I love it. My roommate and I didn't have to do bunk beds by setting up one of our beds vertical and one of them horizontal. The bathrooms are nice, too. There's no AC, but if you get a fan you'll totally be fine. 
The food at the Caf isn't great. They have good days and bad days. And that's why I'm only giving my review 4 stars. The other food is really good, like Baja, Starbucks, Einstein's, but you have only 400 points to spend on those per semester. You can use Caf points only at the Caf and at Lentz during lunch, and Lentz is actually good. 
Carthage actually listens to their students. The things that need to change are changing, and they address the problems that need to be talked about."
Freshman,4,"The College is extremely welcoming to anyone of diverse background, and very adjustable to situations involving lower wealth families such as myself. The only dislike to imagine was some controversy regarding students being less than ideal, yet that doesn't necessarily interlock towards the schools raising. As a liberal arts school as well, I recommend those who can make the attempt to gain various scholarships for the education you will gain."
Freshman,4,"The online side was nothing outstanding, very fitting for a college trying their best in a hard time."
Freshman,4,The process of being welcomed and integrated into a new home is made stress free! The tag price is a bit overwhelming but they do everything and anything to help with it! Such amazing faculty who care about each and every one of their students.
Freshman,4,Half of my classes are online and they truly do take the time to make the lessons more approachable and easy to stay on task with. My in-person classes are the sciences and I feel like that was a good decision made by the college.
Sophomore,4,A very warm community feel and I love all of my professors. My professors really care about me and if I ever need anything there is someone or a center that I can go to.
Sophomore,4,"Love the class sizes and professors, but the financial aid office is terrible to deal with. They constantly change your tuition without reason."
Junior,4,I love Carthage. I love my professors and the friends I've made. The only thing Carthage needs to fix is the tuition and helping students afford the school. They do not help you if the cost is too high.
Sophomore,4,"I have taken online classes online in grade school and in high school so using zoom and uploading my work online was not that new to me.  However, since my classes are performance based my teachers and I had difficulty when trying to do live practice over the computer due to lag or signal.  My teachers did a great job of working around that with asking us to send recordings or have us listen to recordings in the main school submission site."
Freshman,4,"Online learning is new for all of us. We were all thrown into it and it made teaching as well as learning extremely difficult. I feel as if all of my teachers took their time to understand different online platforms for lecture/learning and I believe almost all were on top of grading, responding to questions and overall help."
Senior,4,"Carthage gives students an opportunity for a small school setting but big overall outcome. Professors and academics are great. Campus is beautiful, and many different ways to get involved."
Freshman,4,"I fell in love with this school the moment I stepped foot on campus. It has hard being a first gen student and not really knowing anyone or how to make friends in this new setting. The professors and the Res-Life staff were so helpful in the adjustments! You'll learn to have a love/hate relationship with the caf, but the views never get old."
Freshman,4,I liked having the view of Lake Michigan. The buildings are close and do not have to walk far to get to classes.
Senior,4,"My very first semester at Carthage College was rough. I struggled making new friends, getting along with my roommates, and academics. I even thought about transferring at the end of the semester. However, I remembered why I chose to attend Carthage. The lake, my independence, the dance team, and the direct admit nursing program. My second semester, I told myself I was going give Carthage a better chance. I got involved in new , and met my best friend through one of them. From then on, I became more involved. I became a Resident Assistant, a Student Ambassador, joined a service sorority, performed on my dance team and much more. I created a community I now call home. Now that I am graduating this spring, I am so sad to leave the home away from home. Carthage has taught me far more than how to become a good nurse. It taught me life lessons I will hold onto for a lifetime."
Niche User,4,Carthage college was one of the best schools I've been at. I got the privilege to stay overnight with the cross country and track team. They entertained me very well and helped show me why I should be a red man.
Freshman,4,"I very much enjoyed the dedication on behalf of faculty, advisors, and professors. The college really cares about the success of its students."
Junior,4,"Carthage College is a small, private, midwest institution that focuses on their student/ professor ratio. The campus overlooks Lake Michigan and is sandwiched in-between Chicago and Milwaukee."
Junior,4,I like the opportunities that it offers to students and the amazing connections and resources that are available to us.
Niche User,4,What I liked about Carthage College was that it was very nice and neat. The area was beautiful and the campus was as well. For the most part the whole campus was pretty much clean which is a great thing.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and all of the staff is very friendly and they make it clear that the students’ success is their main priority, and they willingly make sacrifices so that can happen. The location is convenient and the work load is manageable. Unfortunately, the cost of attendance is very expensive, however many graduates say it was worth every penny. I’m hoping to say the same once I graduate in 2022, but so far I see that becoming true."
Senior,4,"It's a small campus with a lot of great and supportive people. The professor to student ratio is small enough that professors have the means to get to know you and the classroom, and cater to specific students needs. Very unique area and community. It can feel a bit isolated from the rest of society at times- but a quick drive downtown will show you what Kenosha has to offer!"
Sophomore,4,"Love the campus, and small class size. Great teachers, caring staff. It would be great to have more parking for commuter students."
Sophomore,4,"Carthage excels academically and athletically. As a D3 school, the athletics are competitive and not too much of a commitment to disrupt school work. Small class sizes result in close student-teacher relationships. Carthage winters are very cold and windy because of the lake. Carthage will also find any way to charge students extra money, such as charging more for a dorm with a lake view."
Sophomore,4,"Although Carthage College is a small private college in Kenosha, Wisconsin there is plenty of activities and stuff to do. Everything is what you make out of it, so make sure to get involved, this school offers a variety of sports, clubs, and Greek life. It's a given that all my professors truly care about me and teaching.For me I not only loved the location of the school, the beautiful out Lake Michigan but also the convenience of being so close to Chicago and Milwaukee."
Sophomore,4,The professors here are great and all willing to help outside of class! Carthage is right on the lake so you can stare out into the lake while you do homework. Lots of great places to eat. Although the Caf isn't the best.
Senior,4,Carthage College boasts a large number of qualified  professors who are ready to help you when you need it most.  They take pride in making sure no student is left behind.
Alum,4,I went into Carthage thinking I was going for 5 years to get a BA and an MA but I only got my BA. But I got in three and a half years so I guess that kind of makes up for it. I had professors who helped me find the real me and learn about my strengthens and weaknesses.
Junior,4,I am a junior and so far I have had a great experience at Carthage. I am a science major and all of the different professors have greatly helped me in figuring out what classes I need to graduate school and truly care about your overall well being.
Sophomore,4,"Carthage has given me a great academic experience. Teachers are usually very involved and are seeking to help students improve and learn. Dorms are not the best, but they are very close to everything. Sports are a huge part of campus, not very good but fun to play in."
Freshman,4,"I like the small classes, the beautiful campus and the science program. I would change the cost of tuition for all schools."
Freshman,4,"Carthage is a wonderful college with wonderful experiences. Coming from a small town and a school of just 300 students, Carthage is welcoming with open arms. It is easy to fit it here. People are friendly and professors are easy to connect to."
Junior,4,"I love Carthage for its small classroom sizes. There are about twenty students to a classroom on average, and this makes it very easy for students to make a connection with the professor and receive the personal, detailed help on assignments and classwork that they deserve. However, Carthage has slim options when it comes to the food served on campus, which many students (myself included) wish to see changed."
Junior,4,"Carthage is located on Lake Michigan. It’s a beautiful location. It’s located between Milwaukee and Chicago, so there are opportunities to see the things major cities have to offer. The student body is friendly. Most of my classes are in the business building. It’s a great building. The business teachers have real world experience and I really appreciate that.  I do feel some of  the professors in general classes play favorites. The cost has risen quite a bit, but I feel stuck at this point as transferring would just delay graduation and force me to take more in loans than I already have. I don’t feel I have gotten the assistance from the finance department or my advisor that I need. I’ve asked for help on numerous occasions, but often get directed to another department that doesn’t help me. Overall, I feel I’m getting a good education. I’m just concerned that I won’t get back my investment."
Junior,4,"I love the small classes, the small campus and the lake view, but i wish it was more inclusive and the food could be better"
Alum,4,"What I really liked about Carthage was the small class sizes, which allowed you to develop a personal relationship with professors.  All of the Carthage professors are genuinely invested in the success of their students both in the classroom and in life. Furthermore, the campus is beautiful year round as it sits directly on the shores of Lake Michigan. Carthage is a close knit campus and its small size allows the fostering of friendships that one wouldn't have come across or expected at a large university. I truly believe Carthage gave me a one of a kind experience and provided a phenomenal learning environment."
Freshman,4,Carthage College is a great liberal arts college with really great professors. I am really enjoying my time here. The views are great and so are the people. The only things to complain about are the attitudes of security but we are getting a new team. As long as the fellow residents in the hall all have the same concepts they want to live in the dorm life is really great. 7
Sophomore,4,"I like the small class sizes and being able to create connections with professors. The dorms are old and need an uplift, but we still pay around the second highest room and board in Wisconsin. Only one food plan instead of providing different options. The food is cafeteria is very poor but we still pay for an average of 17 meals a week."
Sophomore,4,"nice small liberal arts college, in a small town so little to do, great athletics facility, nice academic program and staff, dorms are average nothing special for the price students pay to attend the school, high tuition but overall nice school."
Senior,4,"Loved the small class sizes and professors. The campus is amazing being right on the lake. The reason I would give it 4 stars is because the social life is just ""okay"". The school also has a lot of athletes so if you are not an athlete it is hard to find a group to fit in with. They are making a lot of improvements to the buildings to make them nicer. The dorms are average besides the ""Oaks"" and ""The Tower"". I found that I was challenged in my classes to a good point where I am still about to succeed."
Niche User,4,A wonderful experience working with my admission councilor made going here this fall an easy decision. This has been a wonderful college search experience.
Sophomore,4,Quality school with great professors that want to help everyone with their future. Diversity is present but there could be more. Student life is very nice and the campus is very friendly and family oriented. There is campus spirit shown at different events and especially sport events. Campus is overall very good.
Junior,4,"I love the professors and small school environment! It’s very easy to find time with professors to help you with a class outside of class. Many professors offer office hours when you can stop by and ask for help on anything. In my 3 years there I’ve never had a problem with getting help from a professor. On top of that the student body is really nice. Almost everyone I run into is really freindly and it’s very easy to make new friends! The one complaint I have is the food, it’s not necessarily the healthiest or best priced. But other than that I love the school!"
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love being a student at Carthage. I enjoy being in classes that professors know my name and my background and my life goals. Many of the clubs here have a community orientated feel because it is almost like a  family away from home here on campus. The students at Carthage all seem to have similar motivations and work ethics as I do, and that definitely makes it easier to try to achieve my goals inside the classroom and out. If I could change one thing, I would ask the Food Services team to add some more variety to food options on campus because we currently only have 7 or 8 restuarants."
Sophomore,4,I love how small the campus is because that gives me more one on one time with my professors. Also the academics are amazing. Student life is good too. I would love to see change in the food area. Food needs to be healthier plus less expensive. Also the WiFi seriously sucks at times and that needs to be change.
Sophomore,4,"The school is small, and mostly focused on it's students. Most of the professors are extremely helpful, and are more than willing to help their students. It can get a little cold, and the food takes a little getting used to. Overall, I love Carthage."
Senior,4,"I enrolled at Carthage spring semester of 2016. I enrolled in the school because, it was a small university with an amazing view. The faculty here are amazing and helpful. I am a senior now and I will be graduating in 2018 with my bachelors degree. It took  me forever to find a school that was right for me and once I found this school I knew with the support of my family,  adviser, staff, and peers I could make it. 
What I would like to see changed is lower tuition cost for out of state students and in state students. I believe that education should not be expensive and keep you in debt after graduation."
Freshman,4,Carthage is a great school with a wide variety of programs for all sorts of majors! Their new science center building offers a brand new learning environment and the school's location near the lake and the city make it a school with so many unique learning and research opportunities!
Junior,4,"The people at Carthage are honestly some of the best people I've ever met. Everyone is welcoming, friendly, and helpful - especially the professors. They will go out of their way to make sure students have everything they need to succeed - even so far as to help them secure financial help. Some problems with the college is the music building and the theatre. The practice rooms are so small with so little sound dampening technology that instrumentalists require ear plugs wile practicing and vocalists can't belt without hurting their own ears. Beyond that, one can hear everyone clear as day outside the practice rooms which doesn't encourage practicing something at which you know you'll fail. The theatre is terribly constructed and the students deserve better - especially considering they have sent a show to the ACTF (American College Theatre Festival) the last 8 out of 9 years which is better than any other program in the state. Food is TERRIBLE. View is BEAUTIFUL."
Alum,4,The teachers and staff are very invested in seeing students do well. There are a lot of diverse classes you can take (which doesn't really make up for the lack of diversity in the school body) and the campus is beautiful. There are a lot of clubs you can join but most have a small attendance rate. The nearby town isn't much but it has enough to keep you satisfied until you can hit up a bigger city like Chicago or Milwaukee.
Senior,4,"Carthage's location, just an hour away from both Chicago and Milwaukee and on Lake Michigan, offers a beautiful and practical setting. However, it is not a college town by any means and the party scene is lame.

The campus is not very diverse, though there is a growing population of minority and international students. I've never been to a sporting event, but we're a D-3 school.

Carthage has a host of capable, friendly, helpful, and inspiring faculty members. The college boasts about small class sizes (and they have every right to) because students build intimate partnerships with their peers and professors. 

The food is iffy at best. And the security team is often hiring new employees, which means almost no one ever knows what they're doing, which is a bit of a hazard when it comes to safety. But the campus itself is quiet, small, and well-lit. All in all, Carthage offers a good education, but it is a bit overpriced. (At least they offer a decent amount of financial aid)!"
Senior,4,"In my time at Carthage, I would say I feel that I have grown as a person, and I have made many valuable lessons. However, I would also say that I am attending at a time in which the school wants to make changes happen. Diversity is a major priority at the moment, but is still facing an uphill battle. Sodexo catering is doing a better job serving the needs of students, but some of the food options for those who are gluten free are up there in price. Residence Life makes it a point to make sure the Halls are home to everyone who lives on campus. There have been controversial issues that have occurred on campus, but Carthage security is also making an effort to help students in need. There i also always a way for students to be involved on campus through an org, on an athletics team, or an honors society."
Junior,4,Carthage is an overall academically rigorous school with it's main focus in Academics even if the money is spent on sports. Many students find that Carthage offers them a diverse range of academic opportunities and club involvement however sports are limited.
Freshman,4,Very pretty and serene campus. Professors are very helpful and there are so many resources here. Dorm life is clean enough to be acceptable and I was able to join the golf team.
Freshman,4,"Carthage has a very positive environment. The population of students is very nice and easy to make friends. There are quiet areas in most of the buildings that are designed for studying. The campus is small, but very beautiful because of the view of Lake Michigan it offers. The class size is like an average class, with about 20-30 students, and it gives the students and professors more time to interact with one another. This helps students fully understand the content and have questions answered. Overall, Carthage is a great place to study and there are many great advantages that they have to offer to students."
Sophomore,4,"Carthage College is a beautiful, small campus with a heavy focus on expanding the Liberal Arts education experience. They provide a wide variety of courses for students to choose from with great professors and thousands of advancement opportunities. The school is improving quality on campus every year and is attempting to modernize, which is especially impressive. However, it would be nice to see more diversity on campus, increased Asian and Hispanic populations would be nice. It would also be a great addition to have a Political and Social Science Center on campus so the non-natural science and language departments would have a place to call home for classes. Student activism and organizations on campus are plentiful and there are plenty of options for both Greek Life and other clubs, student life is really what this school prides itself in."
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and since it's small it's very personal and easy to walk to classes. The classes are small which is wonderful if you need help from professors. Dorm life is interesting sometimes but not too bad.
Freshman,4,"Overall, it's pretty amazing. Lots of things to do, small campus, and for the most part, the people are very friendly and open as well."
Freshman,4,My experience thus far has been very good. The community in this college is diverse and friendly no matter who you are. Everyone is welcoming and are willing to help with anything. It is a small school with ambitious professors and hard-working students. The campus is lovingly  small and the lake is the best scenery anyone can ask for.
Senior,4,"Carthage is great in the academic range, could use upgrades on student life on campus, this is the reason I moved off campus. The resident halls need upgrading as well as the food they provide. Sodexo needs to go. "
Freshman,4,The dorms and food both could use improvement. Academically Carthage is awesome and being right on the lake the view is amazing.
Senior,2,Trying to complete tasks for your major is organized in a way where it is hard to graduate in 4 years. Many classes are not offered for entire years in order to make students stay at the college longer. I’m not sure if this is how other colleges work but it’s definitely how this one works.
Senior,2,"[Attended 3 years] [Transferred in] [Commuter]
Carthage has a severe problem with its student body. I cannot in good conscious recommend this college to anyone attending college primarily for an education, which a significant part of comes from one's interaction with their peers, so it is essential to make sure the student body (in addition to the courses) challenges and inspires you. 
The friendly, accessible, and highly qualified faculty are forced by economic necessity to dumb down classes so enough students can pass to sustain the college's finances (based on off-the-record conversations with over a dozen faculty members from a number of departments). A number of the classes are complete jokes, total blowoff classes (most likely to increase GPAs). Some, usually the smaller niche ones, can be great.
The campus is isolated from the local community. The campus's walkability with Kenosha is properly poor. If you plan on frequenting the downtown, get a bike or skateboard."
Sophomore,2,"Being completely honest, I would not be filling out for grants if I went to this school. I was trapped into going and lied to and being held accountable for more years than I need. Attending an expensive school because of baseball was not enough."
Freshman,2,I went to Carthage for one year and after the first semester I decided to transfer. I went to Carthage initially because I really liked how small the classes would be. I got involved with sports but it turned out that Carthage wasn't for me. The shuttle taking you to your car takes forever. There aren't a lot of choices of food on campus so be ready to order take out. If you don't have a car or have a friend with a car you'll be bored. Literally half the campus goes home on the weekends. There is honestly no diversity. Classes were fairly easy as well. I stayed in Madrigano Dorm building. There's no air conditioning so the summers are super hot and the elevator broke every once in the while. Campus security SUCKS. It's not worth the money. If you have the chance to change and go to a community college please do and try to go to another school. The lake views aren't worth it in the winter. Half the class of 2020 left so save yourself.
Niche User,2,"Carthage College is a good school, however, you should be prepared to fully embrace campus life in all ways. Your life outside of campus is very limited unless you are able to pay for a $1000 parking pass to have your car on campus with you. I was quick to learn that this was not the environment that I wanted for myself, as I enjoy my life off campus just as much as I enjoy on campus student life."
Sophomore,2,"I like the professors, they care about their students and are always there for them. The campus is small and there is not a lot to do there. It is isolated and the beach is covered with rocks which makes it hard to enjoy it. The food is not the best and the meal plan is terrible. Many students would love to see them provide more points."
College Freshman,2,"Hardly any diversity. Most people are from the midwest, so there is a big white crowd. I'm latina, but I don't feel discriminated against, and their are clubs for minorities which you can join so you feel less alone."
College Freshman,2,"The gym for people uninvolved in Carthage sports sucks. It's small and there are only 6 treadmills from like 1980. A lot of people are involved in athletics though, and they are passionate about what they do, but people outside the sport don't tend to care about it like they do."
College Sophomore,2,"There was a mouse in my room, and the school didn't help me remove it."
College Sophomore,2,"I was falsely lead to believe that the campus was more diverse than it appeared and supported diversity but that was not the case; Fitting in with peers was extremely difficult not only because of being a minority but also because economic background; The school claims that 99% receive financial aid yet  did not meet anyone during my time there whose parents weren't very successful, educated, and rich. This of course caused much debate when it came to discussion in class because wealthy , sheltered , spoiled kids don't understand the same; I felt really excluded and that affected my social life and acceptance , a factor that led me to transferring among many."
College Sophomore,2,Class size are small and thats great but that doesn't  mean the professor actually care. Variety is average. You would be better off going to a city college then going here. The academics was easier than my highschool.
College Sophomore,2,I did not graduate from here ; I transfer as soon as I could.
College Junior,2,"Cafeteria food is of low quality and does not vary. It's always the same things offered every single day. There is a severe lack of healthy options. If there are any healthy foods, they are extremely expensive. There are barely any options for vegans, vegetarians, or other food restrictions."
College Freshman,2,Too pricy for athlete schedules and cant last long
College Sophomore,2,"as an Athlete the accessibility to updated and well cared for equipment is available. but for the average student wishing to use the gym, the equipment is outdated and not cleaned on a regular basis. The facilities are too small and access to workout groups are few. It is difficult to join a group and even harder to ask for a personal trainer."
College Sophomore,2,Kenosha is not exactly a college town. the variety of restaurant are truly limited and only known by the locals. the distance from carthage college to local restaurants are a car ride away. no local or college transportation may take you to any dinning off campus. the next town over is Racine where there are great restaurants but they are not advertised on social media and difficult to find
College Sophomore,2,"it is a hassle for everyone unfortunately the financial aid received freshmen year usually does not carry over for the next 3 years. on the other hand, the price of carthage college goes up every year and the scholarships do not go up with the price of the school. If students were grandfathered into the price of the school starting freshman year."
College Freshman,2,Security is very strict in every aspect. They are also extremely slow.
College Freshman,2,Didn't get what I expected and just discovered what I got was only good for the first year.
College Junior,2,"There is no school spirit. No one stands up at any of the games. I have been told that the athletes have nice facilities and weight rooms, but the non-athlete weight room is junk. Teams are not very good. The football team had a ""good"" season by winning only 3 games this year."
College Junior,2,Attendance should not be mandatory for classes. I had a professor that dropped my grade down an entire letter grade because I missed more than 3 classes (although I had to to attend my cousin's wedding) and I was sick
College Senior,2,"Every year there at a lot of 911 calls because of alcohol poisoning. It is supposed to be a dry campus but most people keep alcohol in their dorm, and there is always underage drinking."
College Senior,2,Both my freshman and sophomore year I lived in dorms that had mold growing in the showers.
College Senior,2,"Most students who attend Carthage come from the Chicago area.  As a result there is a lot of bias and difference between people.  It is almost like there is a social class difference between the students who come from the Chicago area and those who don't. Also, if you do not like to drink, smoke marijuana, or attend parties it is very hard to meet some one of the opposite sex, let alone friends. Many students also go home on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"So, the food that is provided in the cafeteria is definitely affordable. At the cost of 5.1 points per meal of which we are allowed 50 points for the week AND all-you-can-eat buffet style, it is extremely convenient. The problem with that is the fact that the food in the cafeteria is not always that good and it is more or less a ""natural laxative"", if you will. As far as other options go, it's extremely difficult to eat somewhere that is affordable and doesn't cause you to go into your rollover points for the year. For example, if you go to WOW and order a wrap or burger or salad, it will cost you more than if you went to the cafeteria and ate there. On top of that, it costs about $2.50 to make it a combo and have a small amount of fries and a fountain drink. I feel that it is very close to being highway robbery. I understand that Carthage is a ""private college"" and they can do whatever they want, but the prices and quality of the food on campus is simply outrageous and unpalatable, most days."
College Freshman,2,"The idea I got from living in this place is: I can handle it for the year I payed to go here. 

Classes are nice, professors are great, the atmosphere itself is pleasant. The school is high quality indeed. 

Social life is lacking, everybody is the same, it is hard to relate to people unless one lives a relatively ignorant lifestyle. If you are happy with small town life and lack of knowledge of life, but love to learn, Carthage is a fine institution."
College Freshman,2,"Nearly the whole campus is white people from small suburban towns. Acceptance is a favorable trait for all things, including wealth, religion, political beliefs, and sexuality, but there are only a handful of these type of people. It is very hard to truly accept these people and understand them if there are only maybe 50 to talk to. 

Most people are upper middle class, Christian, liberal, and straight at Carthage. It is a place with potential to have diversity but there is none."
College Freshman,2,"The parties are tame, they're lame, they're filled with angst and close-mindedness. Yet, they are one of the only things to do on weekends. Most people love them and appreciate them, as they are a slight stress reliever. Even the parties end up being the same thing over and over. 

There are plenty parties to choose from. The sports houses are usually exclusive. Track isn't and the frats are not either."
College Freshman,2,"The people in the area are pleasant, and the neighborhoods are not run down. There are no museums or attractions other than the Michigan shoreline, which is gorgeous. Near campus there are a fair amount of parks, the nearest being 2-3 miles away. These parks are vast and green, open in the air, fresh. It is definitely safe and sound. It is notable that if one searches in the right area, one can easily find a homely nature experience.

There is nothing to do in the city. One could stop by the vape shop or maybe the nice tea store down the way, which is wonderful! However, that is all that is easily accessible. There is no night life, few intellectual attractions, no music, everywhere is closed. If one is 21, one can enter the numerous bars around town. 

Nature is pretty nice around campus, city is not."
College Freshman,2,"Quaker Steak is about 20-25 minutes away, a fine establishment. There is one restaurant near campus, a nice place to go for Mexican cuisine. The next nearest non-fast food place is a 10 minute drive to a Chinese restaurant.  Both of these places are nice, costly, good quality, and welcoming. Neither has a student discount and both close pretty early. The only options left are the fast food places in the parking lots of mini-malls."
College Freshman,2,"I come from a high school with a killer pep club and was disappointed when i attended a homecoming football game. The football team sucks as well as the ""redhots"" dance team. My high schools dance team would easily embarrass them."
College Freshman,2,"The guys here are mostly athletes and very attractive. The girls are all a little strange and I am still having a hard time finding girls that I would like to be friends with. Most students here are mostly interested with science or the theatre. Most people here don't have relationships, and if they do there significant other goes to a different college."
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to find a cheap place to live that's close enough.
College Junior,2,"Kenosha is a fairly big city, but the neighborhood surrounding Carthage is not the greatest. I'm actually scared to walk around town by myself, especially if it's nighttime. The one time I did walk by myself when it was dark, I was harassed for two blocks by a group of older men, and I have no idea what would have happened if I hadn't been close to the police station, but I know it would not have been good. It's not as though there isn't a lot to do in town, it's just that the neighborhood isn't the safest."
College Junior,2,I have to apply to Financial Aid every semester for school and I run into problems/issues every time without fail. It is always a very long stressful process that requires multiple phone calls and meetings with people that eventually help me in getting the FAFSA I need which is very much appreciated in the end. I wish the whole financial aid process was a lot easier and ran a lot more smoothly for me though I must say.
College Junior,2,"I personally attempted to join a sorority and actually got in but after the first meeting I went to I decided that Greek life was not for me. My personal opinion after attending that first meeting and observing other Greek life organizations on campus was that  Greek life can be a very exclusive group of people who tend to stick to their own kind while judging others who are not apart of their org. I also think that Greek life has some perks to it tho, you are able to form life long bond with people all over the world as well as put yourself out there and get involved in the College activities."
College Junior,2,It's always unfair. Athletes get out of most punishments if they have some sort of connection. Whereas straight A students can't find a way out of trouble if they get caught one time.
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes while working in the lobby, my computer does not even see the network."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining options are very expensive based on the meal plan, and the cafeteria is often very disappointing with their food options."
College Sophomore,2,"The regular dorms are old and need to be refurnished ASAP. The amount we pay for that is ridiculous compared to quality you receive. The view is AMAZING though. We have fairly new buildings called ""The Oaks"" which are apartment style, more secluded, but much more expensive. It's hard to ask students to be paying these prices for dorms that are not top of the line after we are already paying ridiculous amount to go here. The tuition for our school was $2,000 less than Stanford this year and we are not getting the perks they have. It is also the biggest hassle to get off campus housing and even a lot of trouble to get into ""The Oaks."""
College Freshman,2,"Campus dining for me is bad for I am on a limited diet.  I am gluten intolerant and a vegetarian as well.  Most of the time I have to buy groceries at walmart or pick-and-save, which is inconvenient because I am spending extra money on food.  There are not many options for gluten free or vegetarian people on campus.  Furthermore, my campus does not offer the most health options for meals.  It would be great if they could make available some fresh vegetables and fruits to students, but that is limited.  Also wish there were more gluten-free options.  Before college I was in good shape, I was not considered overweight by any means.  But in my first semester I lost fifteen pounds because I could not find enough food for me to eat."
College Sophomore,2,"Being on the lake, the whole winter is miserable."
College Sophomore,2,"There are VERY few restaurants close to campus. If students do not have a car, there is not really any off-campus dining accessible. Maybe a taco bell or burger king 10 minutes away."
College Sophomore,2,"If living on campus, students have most things they need. If I didn't have a car though, I would feel very isolated from the rest of the community and since I work off campus, it is necessary for me."
College Sophomore,2,It's a big deal when the football team ALMOST wins a game.
College Sophomore,2,"Nobody really drinks on campus, sometimes after midnight but not too much. Security and RA's are pretty strict."
College Sophomore,2,"Not very diverse at all. Most students are white, have somewhat Christian beliefs, come from middle-class to wealthy families. Students are pretty accepting of others though."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is low key, most students don't know if others are part of a Greek organization."
College Sophomore,2,"The security on campus is not the best, considering they only get along with the students if the student is polite in return. "
College Sophomore,2,"I think it's pretty average, considering Carthage is a private college and most people can only afford to attend because they come from at least middle class to high class backgrounds."
College Sophomore,2,"Since campus is on a lake, it is always windy. This makes for a hard time to stay warm and to keep the hair out of the face."
College Sophomore,2,"The Wifi at Carthage is not very reliable. The printing is not very easy to work with and can only be found in the library, even though most students do not have their own printers. The computers are easy to work with, but most people have laptops and it is hard to get good Wifi access."
College Senior,2,"There is barely an off campus housing, and the little there is is not very nice. It is very cramped and a little bit scary, location wise."
College Sophomore,2,Transportation off campus consists of a shuttle to and from campus parking lots. Otherwise there is the city bus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The academics are not the worst at Carthage, but it's not a very comprehensive or intensive education if you're looking to be groomed for more ambitious goals like political office, upper management in business, Wall Street, cream of the crop medical institutions, the hall of fame of the NFL, MLB, NBA, MFL, or other sports organizations, prime time TV shows and media, Hollywood, Broadway, or even to become a New York Best Selling Author/Publisher, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, or on Forbes' Magazine's wealthiest people.  The reason I give these kind of very ambitious things is because the spoiled rotten students claim that there are their goals... While that isn't necessarily a bad thing either, it's just it's not practical when you see how poor and average their work is and then see them flaunt how great they think they are.  The faculty of the school are also no better, most of the time they have an alternative agenda to maintain public relations, $100,000 donor's checks (mostly from alumni who have children who go there), and basically ""keeping the peace,"" so as to allow the kids who have parents who donate money get exactly what they want: school leadership positions which no one couldn't care less about, easy pledging into greek fraternities, undeserving recommendations from professors, some of who are trying to tenure for job security (which comes from the satisfaction reviews of students), and the empowerment of average students at the expense of exceptional students.  And why?  Because the school isn't a school, it's a business that is paid to give a fancied degree to spoiled children and to push those who threaten their success out of the way, so as to attract more average students with wealthy parents who will pay thousands to allow their kids to get what they want."
College Sophomore,2,"Until a few months ago, we have always had an on-campus nurse who was available to provide any kind of lower level medical aid that did not require being rushed to the Emergency Room. I never had to utilize this service but I felt assured that if anything were to happen to me, I knew right where to go.

Like I said, that was a few months ago. She has since been FIRED for undisclosed reasons so I am actually somewhat glad that I never had to utilize her services. Now if someone is sick, one of the shuttles in charge of bussing kids to the off-campus parking lots or off campus dorms (the Best Western Hotel) has to run them to the local hospital which is roughly a half hour away, which off-sets everyone else's schedule who needed to use that shuttle to get to work or get home.

Bottom line, I thought I felt safe here, but with more knowledge of how things are run here, I don't feel as safe anymore."
College Sophomore,2,"My Philosophy department consists of two very old and uninterested tenured professors who are not at all involved in the school or even their department for that matter. The other department (Great Ideas) I'm involved in consists of several equally aloof professors who are not involved at all. There are many outlets the school provides for recognizing excelling students and my professors take advantage of none of those. I am one of the most involved students in my grade in both departments and nobody in my departments has received any of the scholarships, fellowships or grants offered by the school that require faculty nominations. The professors are all very intelligent, well read and helpful from an academic standpoint. 

If I were given the chance to reapply to this school, I am not sure if I would because I received a large scholarship, but the financial aid department is equally as uninterested in helping students and is completely indifferent to our abysmally low freshman retention rate."
College Freshman,2,"Extremely cold winters and a lot of snow. When it does get nice outside, campus is beautiful."
College Freshman,2,"We have a shuttle service that runs every half an hour to the surrounding parking lots, but it does not drop off/ pick up anywhere but the lots. It is very inconvenient transportation wise unless you have a car on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The food and dining options are mediocre. They could use a Subway or noodles, some fun, well-known restaurant like that. The Street corner has a big variety of foods. The cafeteria isn't the best all the time and somedays doesn't have many options to choose from, and the options you DO have to choose from aren't always good. During the weekend, only the cafeteria and two food places are open. It would be more useful if the others stayed open a little bit also."
Freshman,1,"I attended Carthage for one semester and immediately transferred out. It is not worth the money you pay.
First of all, the food there is absolute garbage. I ate at the cafeteria for the first month of classes and then stopped going entirely. Not only is the food tasteless, but it also runs right through you in half an hour. I was getting zero nutritional value from the food, and I was on one of Carthage's athletic teams. 
The only other places to eat on campus weren't much better, and I ended up going through my points quite quickly.
Secondly, the residence halls are awful. Most students live in the traditional residence halls, and the rooms are smaller than closets. They are not comfortable to live in. The college that I am at now has small rooms, but they are comfortable to live in. This was not the case at Carthage. My roommate and I could barely fit the bare minimum that we needed in our room.
They said I could come back whenever I wanted, but I told them not to hold their breath."
Alum,1,"WASTE OF MONEY. People in the office are beyond unorganized and will find any way to take more money from you. Compared to other schools, there is not as much networking opportunity. Some professors are great, but a lot of them are rude to their students and do not care about their growth. Way too expensive for such a poor experience."
Junior,1,"The worst school I have ever been to. They are inflexible. So don’t count on ever getting sick, and definitely don’t have a preexisting medical condition because the teachers won’t work with you. The theatre department is awful. If they don’t deem you worth their time they won’t teach you. I learned much more and felt appreciated at my community college. You’d think when you’re paying overboard $40,000 a year that they’d work with you a little more but no. Very difficult to work outside of campus because of the way that they have the classes scheduled. So basically don’t have a medical condition, don’t get sick and don’t have a life outside of classes. The absolute worst school. The campus is beautiful but when that’s the only thing that you have going for you you might want to do some renovations on the culture."
College Freshman,1,"I don't like that Greek life is so loud on campus. They are obnoxious. As individuals they are all great people, but put them in a group and it's just awful."
College Freshman,1,"I have no words. House and greek parties or dirty bars. If that's your scene, that's cool, but as someone from a big city I am not used to such limited and boring options. Also keep in mind that Carthage is a dry campus, so there's that."
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing to do at all and there is not transportation out past 8 . So, unless you have a car and an I.D to legally drink there is not fun to be had here."
College Sophomore,1,"The parties are awful , the music is typically white music . These people do not know how to have fun unless there is poor quality beer there."
College Sophomore,1,"Not worth the money , the curriculum is too easy and I found myself slacking because of this leading me to being bored. Registration for freshman was the longest and most unorganized mess with idiot students trying to do heir job. Workload is extremely easy , they teach you like elementary school children."
College Sophomore,1,"It is too small for a city kid ; I felt when i attempted to reach out to my professor in my major about issues with test material , I was shot down because ""I did not need the point"". There was nothing to do there and this is coming from someone who was involved in 5+ clubs. The school lacks diversity ."
College Freshman,1,don't give aid to people that deserve/work for it
College Junior,1,"Greek life is the worst thing that could have happened to Carthage. Sorority girls will not give you the time of day if you aren't a frat star. Carthage's social dynamics are basically a high school's, only if a high school had Greek life. We have 2500 kids here. We do not need Greek life. It only compartmentalizes the school and creates an ""us vs. them"" mentality between Greek organizations. Carthage was recently rated the ""frattiest school in Wisconsin"" as 60% of their students are in Greek life. Greek life can be a good thing for people that go to bigger schools as it helps them make friends, but it is terrible here. Again, it feels like all of the negative stuff that we hated about high school. People are obsessed with their social status, and yet they don't even have frat houses."
College Junior,1,"If you go off-campus, you are not allowed to live on-campus again. No off-campus apartments are houses are within walking distance, so you will need a car to get to school and back, and then it is a major hassle having to park and all. Plus, if you live off-campus, you don't experience the same kind of community of living on-campus. Sometimes you don't see people anymore. A lot of the time people will go off-campus and not like and try to come back on-campus, and they will not allow them to."
College Junior,1,"There are some nice places in the area, however you have no way of getting to them if you do not have a car. And since it costs $1,000 to park on-campus, you will have to wait until the top of every half hour to access the shuttle that will take you to the off-campus parking lots (which still cost money). It takes a half hour to get to your lot, and a half hour to come back, plus you have to wait to get on the shuttle or wait for the shuttle to come pick you up. Oftentimes a quick 10-minute trip to the local Walgreens or Taco Bell, will take an hour and a half."
College Junior,1,"Someone I know applied to Carthage with their sights set on going there. She had a 3.6 in high school. She applied for scholarships, and the school offered her a measly $300 off. This is absurd because most students get at least $10 grand off, and their grades are not that good. But because Carthage knew she lived in a very wealthy area (the North Shore of Chicago- New Trier High School), they figured they could low-ball her and get more money from her family because of their financial status. That strategy did not work, and because of this the family was offended and she decided not to attend Carthage."
College Junior,1,"There are no frat houses. Parties are never within walking distance of the school. If you ever do go to a party, there will be no room to walk, or breathe for that matter. Parties get busted by the cops quite often. Also they will typically have someone outside that asks you ""who do you know that lives here?"" in order to get in. One fraternity even lies to their own fraternity brothers and tells them ""the cops are coming"" so that some of them will leave, in order to make more room for people that they would rather have at the party instead of them."
College Junior,1,"The food is awful. Sodexo is our food service, mainly because it is the cheapest for Carthage to get. But if we are paying $40 grand a semester, I would like to eat something better than dog food. One of my friends had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance after he got food poisoning from eating food in the cafeteria. In my freshman year I dropped 15 pounds because the food is so terrible I could not put it down, and they do not give you enough points. They give you enough points for 10 meals a week. The cafeteria closes at 7pm, which really complicates things for students that have night class or athletes on sports teams. Nothing is open past 10 pm, and there is nothing within walking distance of campus. Also, the school has no ovens or kitchens in lounges and you are not permitted to have anything other than a George Foreman oven, so you have no way of eating better food. It is nearly impossible for athletes, or anyone for that matter, to eat healthy.

Einsteins is the only good place to eat on campus. However, it costs more to eat there so it is difficult to afford and you eventually grow tired of eating the same food again and again. Sub Con is like a poor-man's Subway, except for the fact that it costs double the price of Subway. It also gives you less than a standard meat amount (they have a scale to weigh their meat). They also weigh the pasta at WoW, and you will never get a meal from WoW that will fill you up."
College Junior,1,"Housing sucks. While many schools have a department dedicated to assuring their students find themselves living in happy environments, Carthage just has one person in charge of housing. I did not get along with my roommate at all last year, and I hated living with him. I was never able to switch roommates. Coming in to this year, I was all set to live with one of my friends, and weeks before school started he informed me that he had to move off-campus because his family could not afford for him to live on campus anymore. The woman in charge of housing placed me with a random roommate, and would not allow me to switch roommates until I threatened to transfer. Also, as a freshman I was placed in ""the Oaks"", which is where the private suites are that cost an extra $1,000. while it was certainly cleaner and better kept than the other residence halls, it was not worth paying for. I did not meet a single person in my building, and I am a very social person. One night when my roommate and I were asleep, security pounded on our door, woke us up, and proceeded to come in and search our room for weed (neither of us smoke or drink). 

As for the other residence halls, they are very dirty. Someone dropped an ice cream cone in the stairwell, and no one cleaned it up for a whole month. For a whole month, there was a nasty, decaying, ice cream cone embedded in to the floor. The fire alarm gets pulled constantly, and Carthage has no way of preventing it from happening. They have no security cameras or anything. We are only halfway through the year, and one residence hall has had it pulled 32 times! 

On top of that, none of the residence halls aside from the Oaks get air-conditioning, and oftentimes the heat doesn't work in the middle of the winter. One residence hall has been experiencing problems with hot water. The hot water has been working on and off in the middle of winter."
College Senior,1,"Freshman year they have students attend a seminar on sexual assault. That is their only preventative measure. A friend of mine was sexually assaulted on campus, and the school did everything possible to cover it up. They kept everything very hush hush to save face."
College Freshman,1,"I do not like the scholarship process they have at the school. They made a mistake on my grants provided to me on my financial aid and basically wanted me to pay $2000 out-of-pocket so that I may attend the school. Also, they frequently ""forget to mention"" other expenses and ""forget to include"" details as far as payments go on the loans and others. I can't stand the financial aid at the school."
College Freshman,1,"Social life is like high school over again. It is impossible to not see somebody again due to the tiny campus. There is significant drama among friends for most people. There is a strangling nonverbal set of norms that are eerily similar to high school society. It is difficult to meet somebody that is vastly different than most. 

Social life outside of clubs or performance is mostly going to peoples' rooms or going to a different building on campus. There are frequent CAB events, which consist of movie nights and small concerts from local artists. There are scientific seminars/speeches once or twice a month and there are plays given by students. The social life is extremely dependent on students themselves. This is a blessing and a curse, as it gives people the opportunity to create their own entertainment, but lacks professionalism and a sense of completeness."
College Sophomore,1,Scholarships are not announced early enough.
College Freshman,1,"There are not many parties here, and if there are they are almost impossible to find. I believe most kids drink in their dorm rooms or on the beach."
College Freshman,1,We scored a touchdown this year!! That's a big deal!
College Junior,1,It's disgusting what food they offer and how it's handled. The only time there is a good quality of food is if it is a tour day.
College Junior,1,"It is disgusting. For example, my sophomore year for the majority of the school year the bathroom above my floor leaked into the hallway. My dad is plumber and let me tell you I know for a fact how disgusting that is. The laundry is nearly inaccessible and the bathrooms are gross and outdated. Carthage needs to step it up before they build a new science building."
College Sophomore,1,"I feel there are some visitation rules that are completely annoying.  My example being that the lobby in the dorm buildings can not me heterosexual after visitation hours.  I feel that when it is later at night all people should be allowed to work in the lobby barring any noise complaints.  I know from my standpoint, i do not want to keep my roommate awake while i am working on homework at night, so i try and work on it in the library, unless there are females working, in which case i am not allowed to work there."
College Sophomore,1,"I really should go somewhere warmer. Our school seems to be the only one that doesn't cancel school when the wind chill is -50 and its a snow storm outside. They do not provide safe ways to class and we do not have underground tunnels connecting our buildings. I really belong somewhere that is warm and sunny all year around, makes for more positive energy and people."
College Sophomore,1,"They should focus more on the people speeding down campus drive rather than someone harmlessly parked outside their own dorm moving things in or out. They also need to take it easy on the parking tickets, or at least construct more on campus parking so that students do not need to park on the side of campus drive. We are a dry campus, but that was instilled long ago and I think needs to be rethought so that security doesn't spend all their time hunting down people drinking alcohol even if they are of age."
College Sophomore,1,Very over priced for the quality of living.
College Sophomore,1,"We have a lot of transportation options at our disposal, yet none of them are all that great. The shuttles are usually late to pick up students and there's no student discount for riding the city bus."
College Junior,1,"It costs $1000 for a permit and even then you get ticketed all the time ex: moving into your dorm, dropping off groceries etc."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The campus administration is full of some of the most far-out and radical school administrators I have met, it's very easy to be pulled into a dean of student's office to be asked to give a statement about a punishment and then get it anyway despite how well you defended yourself.  Furthermore, it's also very easy for the RAs to bust you for merely saying ""that's retarded,"" or ""kiss my ass,"" as the Dean of Students and Hall Directors believe that it insinuates inappropriate stereotypes and sexual harassment respectively.  Most of the people in student government are also as radical and extreme as the administrators, and they get a partial say in what rules are made, repealed, or enforced.  They are all part of the spoiled rotten and WASP kids that I've talked about earlier in other reviews.  They only do it to make a loophole to get back at their rivals, because then they play the ""I'm scared because I think this means I'm going to get hurt"" card, because now perceived threats without very solid, legitimate evidence are made punishable not just by some of the most radical government administrations and schools, but by some of the most radical-thinking students.  It's basically a convenient weapon they use to make their enemies bend the knee to them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"All I can say is that marijuana is everywhere, even in the most unlikely of places.  And it's done in the utmost of secrecy.  There have also been recent uses of heroine since it's price has significantly dropped due to both the strict enforcement and even the legalization of marijuana across the country.  Also worth mentioning is that because alcohol is in short supply, the kids turn to cigarettes and cigars.  There isn't a place on that tiny campus where there isn't enough cigarette smoke that could choke you, and cigarette butts litter the campus, even on the green grass and at the little chapels.  Even worse is that the students have turned to chewing tobacco, and so you see them all over campus with water bottles filled with the gross, brown tobacco juice that they spit out.  It's because of this that there aren't many students that don't have baggy eyes, horrific gums and teeth, or dry pale skin."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There may be blacks, hispanics, gays, jews, and others at Carthage, but that only accounts for about 10% of the student population.  The other 90% of people are mostly WASPs: straight, caucasian protestants with Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian, Dutch, or Northern German last names and very hickish first names or even worse, names from the Bible.  Which isn't necessarily bad, but if 90% of the students have these qualities and thus judge and ostracize others who don't have absolutely all of these qualities, it can get very ugly and fake around there.  People will either flat out reject you or bait you with superficiality until they have the opportunity to screw you over for their entertainment.  Without a concept of diversity, there is no respect between different groups, and without respect and unity, there is no harmony.  So personally, Carthage can get very lonely and even unsafe if you don't possess the qualities I stated."
College Sophomore,1,"We have little to no internship opportunities at this school. Out of all the people I have ever met at Carthage, only about 2-3 have had internships and I'm almost certain they had to go out of their way to find them. The ones that have had internships have found them in their home towns or majors cities far away during the summertime.

The school also does nothing to incentivize internships and you do not receive credit for working one."
College Freshman,1,"The permit costs are reasonable, but there needs to be more parking on campus. There also needs to be more parking where students feel safe walking to and from their cars. If you want to go anywhere off campus, a car is pretty much essential. The ticketing and fines for student parking is very unfair. Parking rules and locations need to be changed and addressed promptly."
College Sophomore,1,"Lets just be honest.  There are a lot of white students, faculty, and teachers. And most of the black population is male and sports players. Stereotypical? But they do hv a good amount of Asian and Hispanic but we could always use more."
College Sophomore,1,"If there was one thing I would change, it would be the transportation system. If you don't have a car or know someone who has a car, you basically aren't getting anywhere! Our parking lots are off campus about a mile down the road, and there is a shuttle that drives every half hour to the lots, but the public bus rarely comes to campus, and taxis are unreliable here."
College Junior,1,"The winter time is HORRIBLE. If it snows, it's hard to get around because Carthage doesn't shovel and Kenosha barely plows and salts. It's really dangerous during the winter time."
College Junior,1,"A lot of people I've talked to do various drugs or drink a lot because they feel there isn't much else to do, especially off-campus."

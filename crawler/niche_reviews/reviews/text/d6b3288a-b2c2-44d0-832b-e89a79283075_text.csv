Freshman,5,"The connections this school has for the business and medical programs are outstanding and should really be considered for those thinking about applying. Due to COVID, its hard to get the full college experience but the professors are always willing to help and are understanding."
Graduate Student,5,Most of my professors were really nice and helped me learn a lot. I was a history major and all of the history professors were knowledgeable and helpful.
Graduate Student,5,I didn't take any online classes when I was an undergraduate student but I have taken several as a graduate student and they were all good.
Freshman,5,my online experience was very smooth with no difficulties. Hofstra staff works hard to make sure they are there to help when needed.

Niche User,5,"Located in one of the most coveted places on the face of planet Earth, one need not imagine too hard as towhy one might consider Hofstra University in the first place. Through Hofstra's numerous Research Programs and the Center of Innovation, I find that my ideas and passionprojects could be closer to realisation than ever before. What I lack in resources due to my personal background, Ibelieve that I can gain in the newly equipped laboratories, diverse clubs,co-op company job opportunities,conferences and internship programs at Hofstra.  The spaces that Hoftsra creates for women in particular in both STEM and humanities are of particular interest tome. I found the Women Writers Conference to be remarkable and inspiring for a girl such as myself, who isinterested in pursuing a male dominated degree.  I am deeply touched by how much Hofstra cares for creating safe and diverse environments where people fromall cultural backgrounds can learn and create."
Sophomore,5,"My time at Hofstra has truly been amazing. I have grown immensely, not only as a student but as an individual, dancer, and artist. Being a dance major, Hofstra's environment and professors, have truly made me a stronger, more educated dance professional. Outside of my major, I have made life long friends. I have made a family away from my family. Hofstra has granted me so many amazing, life long opportunities, experiences, and memories that I will forever cherish."

After my time at Hofstra, I will have a BA in Drama, BA in Psychology and a law degree from Hofstra Law! The faculty and students are all so friendly and I am so proud to be a member of the Pride."
Alum,5,"I give 5 stars based on the PROFESSORS I was lucky enough to learn from.  Two economics professors in particular.  Professor Guttman, (Head of economics at OXFORD UNIVERSITY! at the time I was there,  he speaks 11 languages!) Professor Mazzoleni, now the chair.  He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University and taught at Columbia University as well as.  One more little fact he has been a consultant for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the World Bank."
Freshman,5,Hofstra is home. It's such a positive environment all around! All the faculty and staff are there for their students with anything they need. There are many resources available to Hofstra's students. The campus is filled with many opportunities for every student in and out of the classroom.
Sophomore,5,I love Hofstra with all my heart! I met so many great people from all over the world and I wouldn't be the person I am today without Hofstra. The faculty is amazing and they really pay attention to my personal needs. I definitely feel prepared to enter the job market because of all the great preparation Hofstra has given me. I highly recommend choosing Hofstra!!
Junior,5,"As a Publishing Studies Major, Hofstra was automatically at the top of my list for the unique program it offered For my interest. However, faculty members have made the experience 10x better. Their office doors are always open. I have had phone calls and lunch with them just to connect and discuss their experiences in publishing, so that I can plan out my future. Furthermore, being so close to NYC has given me an amazing opportunity to have internships through the semesters. 
Outside of my experience in the classroom, I have just had an amazing time as a student. There are a vast number of clubs to get involved in, which offer an opportunity to explore your interests, gain new skill, and meet new people. I have experienced NYC through free university sponsored trips to broadway shows, museums, food tours, and more. And the staff and students have truly made what was once a foreign place feel like home💙💛. 
No to mention the sushi on campus... *chefs kiss*"
Freshman,5,"My freshman year was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I had so much fun with all of my new friends and learned a lot from all of my professors. I am so blessed that I was given the opportunity to attend this University. Even though we are online due to Covid- 19, all of my professors and very understanding and helping as much as they can. The campus is very diverse and offers many different clubs and programs that everyone can feel at home and make friends. Many of the sports games are fun and almost the whole campus attends. I can not wait to see what my next 3 years are like."
Freshman,5,"Great school, greater faculty. The vibe that you get when you step on campus is such a warm homey feeling that you almost never want to leave. Everyone their genuinely cares is is there to help you succeed."

The campus is beautiful and I enjoyed my time attending Hofstra."
Niche User,5,I love the campus and the educational experiences hofstra can provide blew all other colleges out of the water for me. Hofstra enables me to get a head start in my forensics career while being able to work on my general educational requirements at the same time.
Freshman,5,"I like Hofstra University because of their facilities such as their science labs, recreational centers and classrooms.  I also like that is it very easy to navigate your way around campus.  Its a place where I can call home!"
Freshman,5,"I love Hofstra. The community and the atmosphere is alive and great. There are many ways for students to get involved on campus. The staff is very helpful and always in the best interest of the students. There's a wide range of sports from division 1 to club and intramural teams and whether your in the games or a spectator it's always a fun time! The arts are also great at Hofstra from many different dance opportunities, even if your not a dance major, to musicals and plays, and different singing groups, and even more. 

The campus safety is great and they are their to help you with anything whether you feel like you are in danger, locked out of your dorm, or need someone to kill a bug!

Overall, Hofstra University is a great campus for all."
Freshman,5,"Hofstra is everything I had ever dreamed of in a university. Warm inviting. I love it all. Professors are extremely easy going , staff is amazing and helpful."
Sophomore,5,"In two years at Hofstra, I have made my home here.
The moment I stepped on campus, I instantly felt like I belonged. The green space made me feel comfortable and cozy, like this was a place I could be at home at, not just another cluster of dorms and classrooms. The faculty instantly made me feel welcomed, and it didn't stop when I paid my deposit. I was not a walking tuition, I was a real, unique person.
I can't picture being anywhere else but Hofstra."
Sophomore,5,"No college is perfect, but Hofstra is the closest to what I wanted in a school. My first semester, I was eager to get involved. Hofstra gave me the opportunity to join many clubs and activities and I really got out of my comfort zone. I really appreciate how receptive the school administration is to listening to what the students want. They just put in a brand new Starbucks because the students asked for one! Also, the community at Hofstra is very supportive. I made the right choice in coming here!"
Sophomore,5,"Initially, I was unsure if I would fit in here at Hofstra. But I quickly realized that the college has become my home.

The campus is absolutely beautiful, and simply walking through puts my mind at ease. I love the atmosphere that the students have cultivated, and the energy they give off. During class, I always feel that I am engaging with the course material. Professors are always willing to help students, and discussions are always beneficial.

If I could see any change, I would like for more students to take advantage of the fact that they are so close to NYC! I feel that some of us take the Big Apple for granted, because it really is so easy to travel to. So, students forget to go and explore the city. Which is quite sad because the city has so so so much to offer and is only a quick train ride away."
Niche User,5,"The Campus is nicely spaced out but still feels like a classic campus(home like vibe to it). Professors and coaches truly prioritize students above everything, want the best for you and will try and support you in any way you need. Food is very good, made to order and fresh."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus and the fact that it is very diverse. Everyone is very friendly as well. When I walked onto the Hofstra campus, I knew it is where I want to spend my next four years."
Sophomore,5,"Hofstra has taught me a lot in the last 1.5 year attending, and the experience here has been amazing. Despite the cons of the school's location, everything else has been great!"
Freshman,5,"The Hofstra community is very welcoming and the professors are very helpful and have a great understanding of what may be happening with students. All classes are within walking difference of each other. You are given a special freedom to build your schedule freshman year unlike many other schools. There are tons of organizations to join and help get involved in. The campus life is great and all residence halls are very close to each other. One of the greatest conveniences is the amount of choices of food not only in the student center, but also around campus such as bits and bites, Au bau Pain, Dunkin Donuts, and HofUSA as well as dutch treats. These aspects of campus allow for easy access to all types of food 24/7. Another wonderful service is the shuttle which allows free transport on and off of campus to target as well as Roosevelt Mall. Hofstra has everything students may want or need down to a science and does their best to make all services available."
Sophomore,5,"Hofstra was the perfect choice for me. I honestly couldn't imagine going anywhere else. I, because I major in dance, will speak more on the dance department. It was rated in the top 30 in the country, and I can attest to it! in just my one year here,  my dance teachers, professors, friends, family, and I have all noticed a huge improvement in my knowledge and technique as a dancer. I can only imagine how much potential growth I have in the next two years!

Outside of the program, Hofstra has many opportunities and support networks to help you succeed as a student. You never feel like a number, even in distribution (general education) classes, and it is super easy to find your place and friends here. Could not recommend attending Hofstra more!"
Alum,5,I went to Hofstra for Pa school and I absolutely loved my experience and the professors!!! Being a PA is very rewarding and I am glad I started my journey at Hofstra!!
Freshman,5,"I like how Hofstra university accepts all types of people no matter their race, background or gender.

Hofstra is a safe place where everyone is given a second and equal chance to be the best version of themselves."
Niche User,5,i love Hofstra University because of the many undergraduate classes there are to select and location is great for me so it will be near me. It has the career i want which is a nurse and its great for me to be able to live near by and make it to that school on time.
Freshman,5,"My experience in Hofstra is going well, they help me and tell me the things I need to know. I still wish that they give me thin when i get into Hofstra because they don't give us nothing just a paper say congratulations in that it."
Niche User,5,Tell others about your experience. What did you like about Hofstra? What would you change about it? I loved the school.
Junior,5,"Hofstra University offers a diverse and friendly environment as student strive to receive a higher education in the 100's of majors that are offered at the school. I love the multitude of clubs and organization that are on campus. There is a place for every individual, no matter what your interests are. I also love how the professors are always open-minded and willing to help you succeed. They always dedicate whatever time that is needed for you to understand something you are struggling with."
Junior,5,So far I've completed two years at Hofstra and I really do like it.  I've made some great friends and I hope to keep those connections later in life.  I do plan on joinning more organizations in my junior and senior years to have the true college experience that I would want.  The teacher to student ratio is great and you really feel down to earth when talking with your teachers.
Junior,5,"Hofstra University has a beautiful campus and welcomes people from all countries and ethnicities. With small size classes, it allows you to interact with the teacher and other students in a setting you wouldn't be able to in a large university. There is a wide amount of support for all the sports teams and clubs on and off campus. Hofstra University is a well-known school that sets you up for the future, especially with so many opportunities close by."
Sophomore,5,"Hofstra is a rich, diverse campus with many facilities. We have had some great successes over the past few years, including our Hofstra Basketball Team, going on a 14 game streak- longest ever in college basketball history. Also, this university held the 2016 presidential election, which i had the pleasure of going and experiencing it live."
Freshman,5,"It was so easy to apply didn't even require an essay. I adore the campus and its culture, overall has a very diverse minded people which i enjoy and a lot of student activities."
Sophomore,5,"Hoftsra University truly becomes a second home. There are so many activities to do on and off campus, especially with the city so close. The people are so diverse and friendly, so it is easy to find a close group of friends. The teachers are also very approachable and are always looking for a way to help you with any career or life questions."
Sophomore,5,"Choosing Hofstra has been one of the best decisions I have made so far. After my first year, I have felt so at home despite the fact that I am a commuting student and do not live on campus. The courses are difficult depending on your major, but the professors are more than welcoming and truly want you to succeed.  There is so much to do on campus- the more I became involved in the more I felt connected to the school as a whole. The campus is beautiful especially in the spring when all of the tulips come out! There is something for everyone here and I am so happy to be a part of the Hofstra community."
Senior,5,"I'm heading into my final year at Hofstra and I could not have picked a better school for me. A lot has improved during my time as a student here, and every semester the faculty are listening to the desires of the students more and more."
Alum,5,"Beautiful atmosphere and a very ""green"" university. Professors are always willing to help. I feel advisement could be a little improved."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Hofstra is that the campus and the people there make you feel like Hofstra is home. The majors they have are very good and I am pursuing a PA major for Dermatology and I can't wait to start my career of at Hofstra. By going to their tours and information sessions they have, you can learn so much. The college makes you recognized as a person. You're never left out, your never unsure about what you want to do, the councilors are very helpful and so are the professors. I have heard a lot about many professors and how they work well with their students."
Freshman,5,everyone is so helpful and kind!! Teachers we willing to offer advice and a willingness to help you no matter what level you’re in. Campus is intimate which makes seeing familiar more often.

Niche User,5,"Hofstra University is an amazing school. When I visited the campus, everything around it was beautiful and everyone there was incredibly friendly towards me and my family. Although just a touring senior in high school I felt like I fit in. Hofstra provides students with hundreds of opportunities and I believe it would be a great place to go to school."
Niche User,5,"The exciting action and competitive spirit of Pride athletics is a significant part of campus life at Hofstra University. Hofstra University is home to 21 intercollegiate sports that compete at the NCAA Division I level in the Colonial Athletic Association and Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association. These sports include Baseball, Men's & Women's Basketball, Men's & Women's Cross Country, Field Hockey, Men's & Women's Golf, Men’s and Women’s Indoor Track, Men's & Women's Lacrosse, Men’s and Women’s Outdoor Track, Men's & Women's Soccer, Softball, Men's & Women's Tennis, Wrestling, and Volleyball."
Freshman,5,"Hofstra University promotes a diverse atmosphere, I have felt accepted and challenged since my first day on campus."
Freshman,5,"It is currently my second semester at Hofstra and I love it! The people here are super friendly and I really love my classes and professors.  I feel that my program specifically allows for a lot of opportunities to grow and make a lot of connections during my time here.  I am a resident and I love living on campus.  The dorms, especially compared to others I have seen, are really quite nice.  I definitely recommend Hofstra to anyone who wants to attend a school with a lot of spirit and opportunities."
Niche User,5,"I am just applied to Hofstra University, I do not attend that school, but hopefully I will very soon. I went Hofstra to visit the campus, and the campus was very clean and pretty. I visited with an admission counselor and she was very helpful. I receive emails from her very often, and she makes sure I know what's going on at the school. I just recently received an email from her letting me know that she received my application. Hofstra is well organized."
Sophomore,5,Its an amazing school that is very inculsive. There is a lot of international students and infulence. More of an acadmic school than a social/party school. Since it has it's own Medical and Law school a lot of students enter into combined programs.
Sophomore,5,"This school all around is just a fantastic place to attend. I genuinely enjoy my experience here so much, and the only complaint I would have is how expensive it is, but even then, there are so many people there attempting to help with finances and make things as available as possible. It’s a beautiful campus with lovely professors and students and I don’t regret choosing it one bit."
Freshman,5,"Hofstra University has a wonderful academic program. All of the professors are very knowledgeable, and they care so much about the students. Class participation is partly expected, but it helps learning more! The campus is also gorgeous especially during the Holiday season where they put lights throughout the campus. I have enjoyed my first semester at Hofstra, because I have been able to make friends easily and it is small enough to feel comfortable, and you never feel lost in the crowd."
Niche User,5,"Academics are excellent because every college receives enough funding from the university and is led by professors who are passionate about what they teach and care about their students. The students, as well as the staff, here are, for the most part, very friendly and they help create a beautiful, welcoming environment."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, dealing with COVID is hard because I cannot get the full college experience but the professors here are understanding and are willing to help and be available for those who have a harder time adjusting and dealing with this very unique time."
Freshman,4,"I loved Hofstra! The campus was huge and beautiful, and it didn't feel at all like there were 11,000 people there. My only concern is that there isn't much to do directly outside of campus, but the location is still really great and just a train ride away from NYC!"
Freshman,4,"Once the Coronavirus hit, all of our classes went online very quickly as the school is in New York and the pandemic hit hard there. All of my professors were very diligent in getting all their plans for the rest of the semester moved online, and made the transition very easy for me."
Junior,4,"As a result of Covid-19 every class, this spring semester continued online. Online learning included zoom classes, a lockdown browser, and much cooperation from both the students and the professors. Most professors were extremely understanding when it came to difficulties such as personal situations, software malfunctions, and time-zone differences. Our faculty was more than willing to work with students to ensure they felt that they were receiving the best education they possibly could due to the circumstances. Many professors began creating discussion boards which allowed students to engage with the professor and their classmates to share their opinions on important matters or topics within the class. I believe this was my favorite part of online learning because due to this system I was not only able to learn from my classmates but I was able to have many important conversations with people I probably wouldn’t have said much too if it weren’t for those discussion boards."
Junior,4,"Starting college begins an entirely new chapter of your life and Hofstra goes above and beyond to make sure you feel welcomed and secure in this new environment. They provide endless resources including academic and financial advising, free tutoring services, and office hours for every professor, which are all extremely useful resources.  The faculty truly cares about their students and goes out of their way to help students resolve any issues they may have whether that be getting into a class, creating a schedule,  or working with a student privately to help them better understand a subject. Hofstra also offers Greek Life which is where I developed some of my life-long friends and internship and jobs connects I could have never imagined. One suggestion I would make would be to expand our food options. Living on/off-campus means you will be eating the same few choices of food a few times a week. I think adding additional restaurants to our campus would make a  great difference."
Sophomore,4,"I have just finished my first year of school at Hofstra and I honestly loved it! The food was diverse and good, amenities are nice, the library is great and my professors were all mostly fair and taught great lessons."
Sophomore,4,"I am a rising sophomore at Hofstra and so far my experience has been amazing! The campus is gorgeous and m classes have all been very engaging and interesting. I like how Hofstra develops a well-rounded education, by encouraging students to take classes beyond their major and explore new areas of study. There are a wide variety of clubs and activities for people of widely different interests as well, from creative writing, to public advocacy groups, to STEM. The atmosphere on and around campus is very diverse. You could have a quiet day in the library or a quick shuttle ride to Barnes and Noble, or you could hop on a train and be just less than an hour away from New York City."
Junior,4,"Hofstra is only good because of the type of people who go to the school. Otherwise it's a basic college with an outdated campus and arrogant professors who wish they could tech at NYU. I rate my experience very good, because I have met a very diverse group of people; diverse in thought and background. 99% of the kids you run into at Hof are extremely friendly & upbeat. My biggest issue with Hofstra, and the reason I wrote this review, is the way they handle MENTAL HEATLH. I genuinely believe the woman who runs SAS doesn't know what the word ""depression"" means. If you miss class or assignments because of mental illness, no help. Their only solution to that, is a ""different testing environment,"" which won't help me get through a rough time in my life. It's hard to reach out to professors when dealing with depression or anxiety from school. If you struggle with mental health issues that even occasionally interfere with schooling, DO NOT GO HERE! I have my issues, luckily"
Sophomore,4,Hofstra University has several courses of study that I am interested in and I'm able to take full advantage of campus resources. The only downside I've experienced is the poor communication by campus administration overall.
Senior,4,"A good school that i enjoy going to, its rather expensive I would say. The campus is nice and most of the students are pretty friendly. The classes they offer are varied and suit all different types of specifications."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes got converted online, even my anatomy lab and dance class. It was an experience that was very different. The professors were very understanding and tried to accommodate us as best as they could."
Freshman,4,Going to Hofstra University was an experience like no other. The professors that taught me were willing to help as best as they could. My time at Hofstra has changed me as a student and an overall person. I developed better time management and learned how to adapt to the pressures of college.
Sophomore,4,My professors tried their hardest to still give the same exact feeling and material as if we were in class and I still learned a lot.
Sophomore,4,It was pretty good I enjoyed it and I actually still learned material when learning from home via zoom.
Alum,4,"The university comes equipped with qualified, caring professors who spend the time to ensure that the students learn. The clubs are fun and the social life on campus is really fulfilling. I wish it was cheaper to attend."
Freshman,4,I’ve enrolled at Hofstra for my freshman year and another semester. I took many different types of course there throughout the years. Hofstra provides a fairly great resource for students to use in terms of different technologies and labs. I enjoyed studying and eating on campus with friends because the environment was very well for staying there if the whether was comfortable to chill outside.
Sophomore,4,"The food options at Hofstra is amazing! You can tell they care about your allergies and health with the options they provide. They recently updated the student center with a larger Starbucks for students to sit down at. It is very well kept up in appearance, you'll always see someone cleaning, the grass, and trees being taken care of. Hofstra cares about the environment, they removed straws (you have to ask for one by staff if needed), they have recycled bins for plastic/glass/ and regular trash. The professors care about students, with constant reminders of extra help, keeping up with online classes during Corona. The libraries are vast with many places for study ranging from computer-oriented places to study, quiet studying, study rooms on different levels, a mini cafe, and floors for tutoring. You can tell Hofstra cares about students and staff."
Senior,4,"As a senior, I feel so prepared to graduate and begin my professional career. My professors have been extremely engaging, and I have had amazing on and off campus experiences including an internship abroad. The students here encourage one another and push others to succeed, and I feel proud to call myself a part of the Hofstra Pride."
Niche User,4,"The admissions counselors have been very accomodating and helpful, which made it easy for me to choose Hofstra university"
Sophomore,4,"Hofstra is an amazing school. This is going to sound cliche, but it’s really the feeling that life on campus gives that makes Hofstra feel like home."
Freshman,4,"Hofstra has a lot of really good opportunities for its students. With copious amounts of internships and job opportunities, it is very easy to find a path that is right for you. The campus is beautiful with lots of nature and soothing areas to relax in. The food is very good and there are many options to choose from, catering to students dietary needs. The professors really care about the classes they are teaching and are very accommodating to their students. Overall, Hofstra is a wonderful university to attend."
Freshman,4,"As a Drama Major, I couldn’t ask for a better community than the one I’ve found here at Hofstra. The faculty and student body are so welcoming and passionate about what they’re learning. My one complaint is that Hofstra is not a very sustainable campus, and the food is not always great quality. But the community more than makes up for the administrative faults."
Freshman,4,Hofstra is a great school with a beautiful campus! The food options are limited and not the greatest quality though.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the food, the forming I was placed was great! Welcoming community. Professors are fantastic, they care about our education. Something I’d change is that we had to shame them into offering a sort of refund given that we all don’t live on campus anymore and we had to shame them again when they favored athletes to choose if they wanted to do a pass/fail option for up to 3 of their classes while the rest of us only had one class to choose pass/fail."
Freshman,4,I'm going to be attending in the Fall 2020 but I'm very excited from how welcoming the students and staff are.
Freshman,4,"Hofstra is a great school, don't get me wrong. The nightlife is just not exactly what I wanted for my college experience for the price that I pay."
Senior,4,Hofstra has countless opportunities to be academically successful. The small class sizes allow for personalized and up-close instruction.
Freshman,4,My freshman year at Hofstra University had been amazing. The professor here at Hofstra honestly care about helping you do well.
Freshman,4,"Hofstra University is an institution where you can have a vibrant social life, as well as start your academic career. Hofstra is a school that cares about the success of their students. The learning environment is nice and professors are engaging.  The student life at Hofstra consists of various events the university plans that all students and even family can attend. Hofstra welcomes all!"
Niche User,4,It’s a great school but very expensive. The “return of investment” is arguable depending on your financial situation.
Niche User,4,I love Hofstra and it's been a nice experience. Many people may not know about the university but it's a hidden gem!!
Freshman,4,I love the campus so much. Growing up in West Virginia where nature is very prominent and leaving for school in New York was scary because I wasn't sure if I would be surrounded by nature as much. The trees and greenery on campus are amazing.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love going to Hofstra University. The culture around the school is so supportive and the campus is stunning. The only thing that I would change is the Chemistry Department is understaffed and students often miss out on taking labs alongside the class related to it. With the hiring of more Chemistry teachers, these classes could be more accessible to students."
Freshman,4,It is a great academic and social environment as a first year student to immediately be immersed into such a diverse and positive environment.
Senior,4,"Hofstra is great!!! There are pros and cons to the school, like every other university. The location of the school is not the best but overall, the school is safe in itself. There is a lot to get involved with on campus, and to actually make the experience the best it can be, it is important to join at least one of the many many clubs the university offers."
Sophomore,4,"There are many resources on campus for both commuters and residential students. The campus itself is beautiful, and there are many activities to engage in (includes clubs, and separately organized events such as plays, seminars, etc.). Campus dining is a bit expensive, but the atmosphere of the school itself is good."
Freshman,4,"As a first year commuter student, Hofstra has been the perfect school for me. Hofstra University has made it more than easy for me to make friends and become involved. The first thing I noticed about Hofstra is the class size. Class sizes average about 25 students per class, that is perfect for students like me who benefit from relationship with their professor. In each class I have taken the professors are more than helpful and have appealed to the style of teaching that is good for all students. Next, the class rooms at Hofstra university promote a hands on education, which is beneficial to most. The diversity at Hofstra is another great thing about the university. People from all over come to Hofstra for their education. I have the privilege of meeting these people, learning their culture, and being able to really understand their way of life. Hofstra has allowed me this opportunity. It is really such a rewarding experience. And lastly; the campus is absolutely gorgeous."
Junior,4,I love my experience thus far at Hofstra. The professors are really great and helpful. The campus is beautiful and relaxing. All and all i would recommend Hofstra as a university that looks out for their students.
Freshman,4,"The admissions process is a bit messy, my advisor left months before I was accepted and the only way I was able to reach the school was by entering a totally different zip code into the phone system (not the best first impression). The academic buildings are of wildly differing quality, with some being old and rather dirty and others being absolutely pristine. But, what matters to me is quality of life and academics, and this school has both in my opinion. The majority of my professors are awesome, and the classes feel well paced and fair. I live in a suite here and it's plenty comfortable with a good amount of space. There are plenty of good food options, including a Starbucks and a sushi place. Sports or parties aren't really my thing, so I won't comment on those, but the variety of clubs is great. If you know where to look there's a ton of stuff to do. I've really enjoyed my time here so far, and while there are some issues to be aware of, I honestly think it's a great place to be."
Alum,4,Love this school!  Went here for undergrad and now graduate school.  The Division of Student Affairs is amazing and really goes above and beyond to make for a great student experience.
Sophomore,4,"Hofstra University is filled with faculty and staff members that want to see you succeed. It is a wonderful environment filled with welcoming people, groups, and organizations. Hofstra has an active student body, whether it's attending lacrosse games, basketball games, tailgates, special seminars, you will always be surrounded by welcoming people. Hofstra offers assistance in almost all aspects. If you struggle in writing, the writing center will be able to help you out; if you struggle with a specific subject, you can attend group tutoring; and not only that, if you ever need an escort to you dorm after a late class, public safety will provide you with one. Even better, if your car doesn't start up, public safety can help jump start your car. On campus there are many locations you can eat, and if you have any dietary restrictions, a dietitian can help cater your needs. Near campus, a 10 minute drive, you can head out to the mall, target, and eateries."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience with Hofstra University has been great! I love the people I have met at this diverse school, whether it be through clubs or classes, and most of my professors have been very helpful and understanding."
Freshman,4,Very great college to reach your academic and social goals; very supportive faculty with a lot of resources at your disposal.
Junior,4,"Campus food definitely requires improvement. However, overall the school has excellent academics and offers quality extra-curricular activities (hence its status as a D1 school)."
Junior,4,"Hofstra is a pretty good school overall, but does have its issues. It tends to favor the business school over the others, the school seems quite money hungry, and the food and dorms aren't anything special. That being said, the campus is pretty nice, facilities in STEM are good, most of the professors care about what they're teaching to us, and I've had a pretty good experience coming to Hofstra."
Graduate Student,4,I loved the friends I made in the classroom and my internship experiences. I had multiple internships where I was able to really apply my learning and create great new experiences.
Freshman,4,"Hofstra is next to Hempstead which is a not so safe place for students to go. The tuition is also very expensive. However, those who work hard will be high achieving."
Sophomore,4,"During my fall semester of freshman year, I really didn't like Hofstra University because I am a commuter and I couldn't find anywhere where I belonged. But, that all changed at the beginning of my Spring semester. I decided to rush and see if I could find a sorority where I fit in, and I did! I am not a part of Alpha Phi at Hofstra University and joining this sorority has brought me so much joy and love for Hofstra. I'm so happy to be involved at school now instead of just going to class and going home."
Senior,4,"Hofstra has been great for me. The faculty really care about you excelling if you put yourself out there and do the necessary work. There are many leadership opportunities on campus. As someone who has been on the executive board for more than three different clubs, I can say that Hofstra helps its students learn valuable communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills. I am also a commuter but I was still able to find my voice at Hofstra! If I were to change something, it would most likely be its tuition. Many capable individuals decline Hofstra's acceptance due to their very high tuition - it is about $52,000 this year (2019-2020). If this cost were to be reduced, Hofstra would see an increase in its academic averages due to more motivated individuals accepting their offer."
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful. The teachers really want to help you to succeed. Ask them for help with internships, they have been in the field."
Alum,4,"Proud to have graduated from this university. Things I loved: the beautiful campus, many knowledgeable and caring professors who want to see you succeed, made a lot of great friendships with my fellow students, lots of fun on-campus extracurriculars and events, food selection's pretty good. Things that could of been better: my academic adviser did not seem to care about my success (I can probably count on two hands how many times I've met up with her in the four years I was there); area outside the campus isn't the greatest (near the lower-income part of Hempstead)."
Graduate Student,4,"Well I'm currently a new accepted student for Hofstra, but I am looking forward to what I can gain from a school such as this.  I look forward to gaining as much experience with accounting and better myself now and in the near future!"
Junior,4,Hofstra University has a very beautiful campus and active student life. There are constantly events going on so there never is a reason to be bored. Students walk freely around the campus.
Niche User,4,I was a visitor of Hofstra University for an assignment and realized of how much of a good place it really is and how everyone I meat is very nice.
Graduate Student,4,Hofstra has been excellent in guiding me through the decision making process with regards to my choice of degree.
Junior,4,"Hofstra University is a tough rigorous academic school, with caring professors who do their best to help you succeed. It has a highly diverse student body with people from all over the world coming from all different kinds of walks of life. Hofstra is a beautiful campus and has great people."
Niche User,4,Hofstra has some quirks and it is very expensive but classes are good and the campus is nice. the professors are very nice and will work with you to pass classes.
Freshman,4,Was my first choice as a school. People are really nice. Private institution so it's expensive. Very active and involved students. A lot of clubs to join.
Freshman,4,"I'm currently a freshman here and i love it so far. It's so far from home, but the people and proffessers make it worth it."
Freshman,4,Great School! The professors truly care about your academic success in and outside of the classroom. Beautiful campus too! There are plenty of programs designed to help students succeed and thrive in their major and to prepare them for future career paths.
Niche User,2,"At the time, online learning was new. Some courses were mandatory cameras and microphones, others didn't really mind it. Depends on the department and the professor themselves. Some courses are better completed in person than online, such as art courses or lab classes."
Freshman,2,"The professors at Hofstra are either terrible or wonderful. Many professors do not know how to teach. My major was dependant on very specific courses, and the head of the department encouraged us to take 17 credits to see who would switch out due to the workload and amount of stress. DO NOT TAKE 17 CREDITS. The food is average. Living on campus as a freshman was very stressful because you were barely allowed to have anything in the dorms. The RAs like to visit late at like 10pm or 11pm, and my suitemate was asleep but they wouldn't leave until she woke up and signed something. That being said, the professors and housing department were very inconsiderate. I do not recommend going here for the amount of money you are paying. I decided to transfer out of this school."
Sophomore,2,Most of my teachers were not considerate. Being a STEM major I was expecting otherwise. We did not get any refunds back from our tuition.
Alum,2,"I went to Hofstra briefly, but ended up transferring when I changed my major. 

I went back a few months ago to look with my daughter at the school. Most staff members in the admissions department were not helpful or friendly, but there was a young lady who worked in the Spanish department who was extremely helpful and pleasant to us. Can't remember her name- I think her first name began with an L. She was the only reason my daughter ended up deciding to apply to the school. Without her taking the time to really help my daughter there would have been no reason for her to apply. I really hope the university recognize and realize that the people like her are really what help students and what keeps it going.

The problem is the surrounding area of the university is less than stellar, and always in the news for high crime rates. If I'm going to pay $45k for my daughter to receive an education, then it should at least be at a university that is in a safe area."
Senior,2,The people who work at the University don't care about the students. The campus is very nice though and they do try to get the students involved in many activities held there. There isn't enough parking and the traffic in the area is terrible. The penalties on people who pay their tuition late is ridiculous and there is pretty much no help from the financial aid office. There also is no football team.
Niche User,2,I was an athlete at Hofstra last year and thank god i transferred. There’s not much to do in the area they emphasize the proximity to the city but honestly it’s expensive and time consuming to get there. Did not enjoy the culture between the athletes and the social life is below average. All the bars got shut down and parties are average. Would not recommend if you’re looking for a highly academic or social environment.
Junior,2,Not a great school.  If you are from the area and know how Hofstra truly is then it's fine.  It's definitely a way different school than they advertise.
Freshman,2,"Hofstra, by far, is the best university on Long Island. Good merit scholarships, pretty campus, close to NYC, etc. If you're looking for these things, you're not from LI, and can afford it, Hofstra's for you. However, support for commuters is meh. Difficult to get involved, overbearing commuter services staff, getting to campus is a hassle. Stay out of Hempstead unless poverty/violence appeals to you. Overpriced for what it is. Overall, not impressed. Unless you want/have to commute, locals should look elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,"The worst part about here is the social life. Most people mind their own business and go home at the end of the day. No one talks to each other in the dorms, especially the towers. You need to be in greek life if you want a decent social life."
Niche User,2,Not at all getting your money's worth. Lots of professors who just don't care about you. Gave it an extra star for diversity and being very accepting.
Junior,2,"Hofstra is an okay school, but for $62k a year, I expected more than okay.

The Towers are awful. Bathrooms are rarely cleaned & there's only central heat/AC, which means that after one cold day in October, they'll turn on the heat & refuse to switch back to AC even though it's 80 degrees for the next few weeks. Laundry is a nightmare. 6 washes & 6 dryers for 11 floors of people, & at least 3 machines are broken at any time.

Don't be a TV major if you're interested in anything other than production. If you're more interested in writing or anything else, courses are limited. With one exception, my professors have been lackluster, & the ones in the RTVF department tend to have high opinions of themselves.

I transferred here & got little aid (even though I graduated high school with honors and was on the dean's list at my last school), so I pay a lot of money to go to a mediocre school. Hofstra simply isn't worth the hefty price tag to me."
College Junior,2,I don't even know what to say about the athletics... if you're not an athlete you aren't a part of it.
College Junior,2,"They are forced off campus and the parties they do hold last until 11. They suck. It's boring at the parties as well. Very little beer and no music. Plus they all take place in dingy, run down houses far away from campus. Yet they feel they are the elite which is fairly funny."
College Junior,2,Sometimes you won't know where you are living or who you're living with until last minute. If you aren't a freshman it is difficult to get into the building that you want to.
College Sophomore,2,"Not part of it, but they throw loud parties which are distracting if you're trying to study"
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing terrible has happened on Hofstra's campus, but the academic side is basically in the middle of a not-great neighborhood with literally no gates or fences to keep out non-students. You also have to cross small roads to get to certain classes where people (students) will sometimes ignore their stop signs and speed past. 

I have never felt unsafe on campus, but I believe Hofstra desperately needs to do something about how easy it is to access our campus."
College Freshman,2,It's a hot mess (I think)
College Freshman,2,"Hofstra is placed in a terrible neighborhood. Greek life hosts all the parties and the bar is nearby if you want to go out, but Greek housing and the bars are a walk from campus and near dangerous parts of the neighborhood so public safety can't even protect you then. It's close enough where you can casually walk to these events but far enough where public safely can't watch over you."
College Freshman,2,"I live very far away from my classes. The rules are never enforced in my building. Several things have been broken and the school will not replace them or fix them. A house of 50 had to share one washer for more than a week. No one listens to the RAs. Everyone in my house acts like their in high school still; there's so much drama. Simply put, the 

Netherlands is the last place someone should stay."
College Freshman,2,"The dining is super expensive and I ended up with a lot of unused dining points. They only offer salad as their ""healthy"" option. Their fruit is gross and poor quality."
College Sophomore,2,"Lame. Hofstra Greek is not like Greek at other schools. Most of the Greeks here are kids who weren't cool enough in high school and are trying to make up for it. Guys are meat heads and obnoxious, girls are annoying and vapid."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty lame. Same 3 bars, same 3 frats. All are dirty, tacky, and SKETCHY. Travel in groups and watch your drinks is all I can say."
College Freshman,2,The bars are sketchy and its not the best area to be walking around at night
College Sophomore,2,"Went to parties for the first  two months of college, then stopped because all everyone did was stand around and drink beer.  Best ""party"" is fall fest, which is basically a music festival that Hofstra has every fall at the beginning of the semester."
College Freshman,2,I did not receive nearly enough financial aid and i am still in the process of trying to get more money to pay for school loan free.
College Freshman,2,There are only fast food restaurants
College Freshman,2,Sloppy drug girls and jocks trying to get laid. Not a good scene.
College Sophomore,2,Hofstra does not help much with guiding you in the right direction for scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,Options are pretty limited. Starbucks isnt real starbucks.
College Freshman,2,Most houses are extremely overpriced and you are paying for very poor quality. It is better to live on campus.
College Junior,2,"I heard Hofstra was expensive, but I didn't realize how expensive. I'm looking for scholarships now because I'm just starting to realize how little the school offered me, and I'm seriously thinking of transferring once I have enough credits here."
College Freshman,2,"there aren't a lot of options when it comes to off campus housing. for the most part, those who live off campus mostly live far enough that they have to drive to school, so a car is a must. also, there just simply isn't that many places for college kids to rent nearby. the cost i heard is reasonable though, so if you find somewhere, it's a more affordable option than on-campus housing. the safety of off-campus housing depends on the area you live in, hofstra has a mix of sketchy and nice surrounding areas"
College Freshman,2,"we live basically on a highway with a few fast food restaurants along it, so there are very few options of off-campus dining, unless you are willing to either go into the city or take the shopping shuttle during the weekend. but yea, the only things in walking distance are mcdonalds, popeyes, and chipotle. i wish there were more options though."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of options on what to eat, but the thing is that there isn't a lot of HEALTHY options. Also, they have no dining halls with buffet style, which i personally don't mind, but other people do. also, a lot of the options are really expensive, especially the convienence store. the hours for a lot of the places are limited too; half the options close over the weekends. Au Bon Pain is great. It's easily the best place to eat on campus, but they aren't opened during the weekends really, and it's far to walk to."
College Freshman,2,"STAY away from the sciences here. The professors make majors like biology even more demanding as it is with their so called ""knowledge"". My advice: STAY away or transfer out!"
College Freshman,2,"There doesn't seem to be anything fabulous in the surrounding community aside from Dunkin' Donuts across from campus and the Roosevelt Field Mall about a mile away. Students are often warned to stay away from Hempstead at night, and never travel alone. Few students have claimed to have been mugged or beaten, and the Campus Alerts send out texts about robberies in local houses quite often. I've received two in the last three months. I feel safer going to NYC than I do walking within a mile of campus."
College Freshman,2,"Many classes I have start to drop you a letter grade for every two classes you miss. I feel that is unfair, because ultimately I know my ability to do well in a class whether I am present to participate that day or not. If I have an extensive paper due the next day, I'm going to spend my time working on that than going to my history class that I will get an A on the test next week regardless if I am there or not. I think if you aren't going to show up to class and can't keep up your own grades, that should be your own fault. There shouldn't be grade penalties based on attendance."
College Freshman,2,"The main Dinning Hall is like they put KFC, McDonald's, and a bunch of other substandard, unhealthy restaurants into one place. It's like the food court at the mall, but more expensive. They force you to buy a high level meal plan in the beginning of the year, if you don't use your money by the end of the Spring  Semester, they will ""donate"" your leftover money to the School. Really unacceptable for the 50K plus tuition"
College Freshman,2,There's really only three or four places you can actually walk to if you feel up to it.
College Freshman,2,"The housing is old, dirty, and expensive."
College Freshman,2,"They're kind of petty, they live in horrible housing, and they don't do much community service, especially the frats."
College Freshman,2,"I have worked so hard to find an internship, but yet, I continue to fail every time."
College Freshman,2,I wish there were more attractive guys of my liking here.
College Freshman,2,I wish it didn't cost so much to go to New York City from Long Island.
College Freshman,2,The lack of a football team really seems to lower the school pride
College Freshman,2,The area is pretty awful and to live off campus you have to find housing fairly far away.
College Junior,2,"In general Nassau and Suffolk county are two of the most segregated counties in the U.S. So ,the ethnic make-up is not too diverse around campus but it is definitely better than other colleges."
College Junior,2,Im  frankly not sure what the job outlook will be when I leave with the masters from Hofstra.
College Junior,2,"I receive an e-mail or text message about a shooting or robbery on or near campus nearly every week during school.  Hempstead is an awful neighborhood, I would not recommend ever walking alone in the neighborhood.  Police and Public Safety, however, seem to be quite quick in tracking down and arresting suspects AFTER the event."
College Sophomore,2,"WORST OFFICE ON CAMPUS. They offer little to no help to you especially since each counselor has hundreds of kids to deal with. If you earn a scholarship, DO YOUR BEST TO KEEP UP WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR SCHOLARSHIP."
College Sophomore,2,"The only factor which caused me to choose a rating of ""it's bad"" is the winter. As I am a native Long Islander, this did not come as a surprise to me. However, commuting from as far a distance as I do in the winter is extremely cumbersome and difficult. This is, of course, not the school's fault. One problem on the campus during the winter is the icy and slippery sidewalks on which I've fallen several times. Perhaps ice melt would be a simple solution to this. Spring at Hofstra on the other hand, is one of the most gorgeous sights you will ever see. The tulips (as well as other flowers) all around the campus create such a vibrant, beautiful, colorful environment and the pink trees in full bloom are glorious. Walking around, lounging in the sun, all of these activities are absolutely delightful in the spring."
College Sophomore,2,"the frats on campus are obnoxious, basically like a cult."
College Freshman,2,The local atmosphere is nonexistent. NYC is great. Campus is lovely.
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman the housing process is extremely easy. However, once you become a sophomore you literally fighting for rooms."
College Freshman,2,"They do help people who get locked out, but if it's anything else they take forever to get there. My car got stuck in the snow they plowed and when I asked for assistance they gave me a broken plastic shovel.  The boys who work for public safety are some of the biggest douche bags on campus too."
College Freshman,2,"The rooms themselves are small, the bathrooms don't get cleaned on the weekends, and the room change process is like getting teeth pulled."
College Freshman,2,"Most professors at Hofstra teach at a high school level, which results in paying obscene amounts of money to learn very little."
College Freshman,2,Most of the Greeks seem arrogant and like they're somehow better than non-Greeks.
College Freshman,2,"Hempstead is a terrible area in general, and the rest of Long Island isn't much better."
College Freshman,2,"Long Island is windy, and winter is usually cold and a combination of rain and snow."
Alum,1,"I did not take online learning during my time at this school, so I cannot speak as to the online learning experience. I went to this school back in the late 1980s, when online learning was not an option, and very few people even owned a computer."
Junior,1,"Hofstra needs to improve their communication.. The administration is very poor. I've been and I'm still facing severe discrimination. The only good thing about Hofstra are the academics and Hofstra public safety, which are by far the very very very very best department on campus. If you are aspiring a career as a first responder, especially in the police force or military personnel do not go here. They will treat you as such when you are a professional. Be prepared to be watched under like a microscope and have even small action scrutinized."
Alum,1,"First things first: Hofstra is a ""non-profit"" university that brought in more than a half a BILLION dollars in revenue last year, according to their form 999, and pays its president a million-dollar salary, plus perks. Keep that in mind before you bankrupt yourself on their worthless degrees.

I majored in Public Relations. I graduated with more than $100,000 in student loan debt - a surprise to me when I graduated because they misrepresented my financial aid package while I was a student. By the time I'm done paying, I'll have paid almost twice that.

And here I am, six years later, and I’ve hit a complete dead-end in my job. I’m insultingly underpaid, and I’ve been interviewing elsewhere for over two years. I got one offer, at $10,000 less than I’m currently paid. And I've received more than 25 rejection letters. Hofstra Career Services refuses to even talk to me about career guidance unless I pay them. They're super eager to send me donation requests, though."
Senior,1,"""18 mi from the city"". You have to walk to the one place on campus, take a 20 minute shuttle ride and then wait for your inevitable delayed train that takes 45 minutes to get to the city costing you $18. The surrounding area is NOT designed for a college. Nothing is in walking distance, you HAVE to drive and the shuttle is such a pain to use. There is NOTHING TO DO HERE, everything costs A LOT of money. Can afford to build a brand new ""state-of-the-art"" business school building next to a BRAND NEW state of the art business school building but almost every other building has grungy, windowless, broken desk, and dirty class rooms? If you are having a problem, you go to someone who refers you to someone else who refers you to another person who refers you BACK to the first person you talked to. Nightlife is nonexistent. There are nasty frat parties where girls AND boys are drugged, people are arrested, and guns are shot. I only had 1000 characters but I could go on."
Niche User,1,"This school lacks helping students who get hurt/assaulted. They say they have a ""process"" of investigating things brought to the public safety, however, the process is piss poor. Just telling the truth of my one day experience dealing with the school."
Sophomore,1,Do not be fooled by Hofstra's advertisements. Its retention rate is low ESPECIALLY for people in the sciences. The school is overpriced even with scholarship. The area is SO dangerous and the biology and chemistry department SUCK with awful teachers. If you are choosing to go into the STEM field beware of this school. Do not assume its science undergrad classes are good just because they have a medical school either. premed/ PA students are transferring out left and right. Be careful.
College Junior,1,"We have a stadium without a football team. The other sports are not D1 so very few people care. No crazy rallies like the movies, sorry."
College Sophomore,1,"Assault happens anywhere and unfortunately, Hofstra is no exception. There are resources for after the fact, but it is not keen enough on preventing assault."
College Sophomore,1,The campus' greek life is subpar and those who are members act as if it is not.
College Freshman,1,"Expensive, not worth the value, and where I dormed was a 10-15 walk to my class/ food."
College Freshman,1,"Very expensive and you either get a lot of homework ( like my friends ) or no homework at all ( like me ). Some teachers have a very thick accent and don't bother to reiterate. The culture is very diverse, from the food to the arts. However housing is very average for paying $60,000. Greek life seemed to be amazing at first, but I ended up getting sexually and emotionally harassed by some ""higher ups"" in Greek life because I didn't give them what they wanted. Also, there are 18+ bars nearby so many of your friends, or even you, can come home very late and drunk and it distracts everyone from school whether or not you go to the bar. School spirit is non existent. Hofstra seemed like a dream school for the first month but the spark declined exponentially. It was a terrible choice to come to this school and I will be transferring."
College Freshman,1,"This school is extremely cliquey. Students make friends in the first day or two then are no longer interested in making more friends. Clubs don't start right away leaving weeks of empty time.  There is nothing to do on or near campus for fun. The only thing to do is go to the city, which is expensive, if you go a lot, and it takes about an hour maybe more to get there."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office is terrible and extremely confusing. I received good financial aid but had to ask the right questions to get any answers about how it was helping me. It seems that the school is only interested in making money off me instead of helping me get an education.
College Freshman,1,"We have absolutely zero school spirit which is sad because we are a D1 school. Nobody goes to the games. Nobody ever knows whats going on in hofstra athletics. It's literally non-existent. Intramurals are pathetic here. My tour guides told me Hofstra had awesome intramurals, but thats far from the truth. I played 3 sports in high school: field hockey, softball, and basketball. I got here and went to the first few field hockey practices. There were 7 girls, no coach, and half the players were beginners. It wasnt even technically a club because they couldnt find a coach!!! It was ridiculous. Then I found out the softball intramural was banned a couple years ago because one girl got hurt!!! Wow who knew getting hurt was a possibility of playing sports?!?! And last but not least they didnt even have a womans intramural basketball team.-__-"
College Freshman,1,I dont live off campus but I dont know why anybody would want to honestly. Hempstead is a very dangerous area.
College Freshman,1,"DO NOT COME HERE. Not only because the party life sucks (which I'll get to in a minute), but the social atmosphere is awful. People are not friendly here. Everybody minds their own business all the time. This school is extremely anti social and it's near impossible to make friends.  All people ever want to do here is go to the bars. The bars are not fun! They are grimy, pricey, crowded (no room to even walk), and straight up disgusting. The frat parties are just as bad. I used to party in high school a decent amount and when I came here I just stopped. And that would be fine if there was other stuff to do on campus, but there isnt! Theres also nothing to do in Hempstead."
College Freshman,1,"Au Bon Pain is good but they arent open on the weekends. The student center food is pretty bad and it gets really old really fast. In the student center you can either get sh***y chinese food, fake chipotle, fried food and burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Your choices are already limited and once you actually try some of the options (like the chinese food) you won't want to eat it again and your choices go down even more. I end up eating the same thing like 10 times a week..."
College Freshman,1,"The Netherlands are horrid. They are very old and no matter how much you clean the bathrooms, they are still disgusting. Towers are a better option."
College Sophomore,1,"Nah. Not good at all, unless you like fast food. There are some really cool late night diners and coffee shops if you are willing to drive"
College Sophomore,1,"Don't get me started. The whole process was terrible, I am pretty sure I almost unenrolled it was so much of a hassle."
College Freshman,1,"Being in Hempstead is very dangerous, I plan to live on campus all four years"
College Student,1,People aren't friendly. Its hard to make friends. Not many fun things are going on.
College Freshman,1,"If you're interested in the sciences here please do yourselves a favor and avoid this place. Hofstra emphasizes everything on their school website. Half of the stuff they mention is virtually non-existent. I'm a biology major and the worst mistake I made was deciding to come here. The professors make the major even more demanding, curve the exams based on other professors and research opportunities are difficult to get. Internships-dont get me started. The city prefers NYU and Columbia students and Hofstra really cannot compare to those schools. As someone who is serious about her academics, take it from me personally and avoid this institution. It shouldn't even be a private school. This school is far from diverse as well. Students here are either A) Privileged and not serious about academics. They can be found hitting up the local bars quite often and they think they're the best. B) Students who are on every source of financial aid possible and attend the school while bickering and complaining about expenses. Do yourselves a favor and get out instead of complaining. OR C) Commuters like myself who constantly complain about parking space and traffic and lack of school spirit, commuter facilities, and on campus activities which are inconvenient to our schedules. Man can't I wait to get out of here."
College Freshman,1,"Hempstead is extremely dangerous and far from nice. I went to a store there once and got insulted by a beggar in the parking lot. I know people that have been stalked, and almost CARJACKED at GUNPOINT. Last year, a girl got shot and killed by a random drug dealer that broke into her sorroity house. I have frequently gotten alerts from Public Safety about students getting robbed off campus, and other robberies and assaults occurring. By the way, this happens RIGHT OUTSIDE OF CAMPUS. Seriously, be careful when in Hempstead (try to avoid leaving campus at all costs). LOCK YOUR DOORS WHEN GOING THROUGH HEMPSTEAD!"
College Freshman,1,"My dorm is in serious need of a renovation. There are cracks in the walls, missing floorboards, patches of what appears to be ripped paint, etc. It's also very small. The worst option is the suite, which has two rooms (with two people in each room), a small common area, and a bathroom. It's inferior because unlike with residence halls that have bathrooms in the hallways, private suite bathrooms aren't cleaned by housekeeping, which means they don't get cleaned at all...or if they do, one person does it (usually me). Also, the dorms got painted during the beginning of the semester, which is really inconveinent (should have been done during the summer)."
College Freshman,1,"If you like Popeye's, KFC, McDonald's, then it's great. That's about all the options available."
College Freshman,1,"The School is helpful at finding students off-campus housing, but this is Hempstead, NY - one of the most dangerous cities in America. I know people that live off campus that have been followed home by creepy strangers, almost carjacked at gun point, and harassed for money. Last year a girl in a sorority house was shot in the head by a random drug dealer that burst into their house. DO NOT LIVE OFF CAMPUS IF YOU VALUE STAYING SAFE (NOT GETTING KILLED). Seriously dangerous area."
College Sophomore,1,"Hofstra won't give me any institutional aid because I am going for my second Bachelor's. For that, I am extremely pissed off and disappointed and if City College accepts me, bye bye Hofstra."
College Sophomore,1,I am always worrying about if I am going to get the money I am entitled to. Hofstra is very sneaky with money.
College Freshman,1,"Athletics at Hofstra are a joke. No one goes to any sporting events other than lacrosse, and even that isn't the greatest."
College Freshman,1,Multiple people have actually had to stop coming here because they could no longer afford it. This should not be happening especially since these students were receiving over a 3.0 and the school did not help them.
College Freshman,1,Every weekend is the same thing nothing special.
College Junior,1,Public safety makes me feel as a student of color like I don't belong on campus and seem to treat me like a criminal not as a student paying money to attend.
College Freshman,1,"The first few weeks, we received e-mails almost every night about students getting mugged on their way home from parties and not much goes on besides the frat parties. The cops shut them down before they really get started, but dozens of kids end up making themselves look stupid walking back to campus high and drunk anyway."
College Freshman,1,Very oppressive. The Frats haze and are awful.
College Freshman,1,The on campus housing is in a very bad area. Not safe in my opinion.
College Freshman,1,"The Hofstra bus is existent but if someone needs it to get home from a party at night when they're drunk, they aren't gonna be able to look at their phone and know exactly where the shuttle is on the GPS provided. Kind of useless."
College Freshman,1,"Hempstead, New York is one of the poorest, high crime areas on Long Island. If someone is worried about off-campus safety, I would not choose Hofstra."
College Freshman,1,"Public Safety tries to come off as a powerful entity, but they don't do much for the safety of our students. The surrounding area around Hofstra is a high crime city and that's where students can be harmed."
College Freshman,1,hempstead is a dump that i would not want to live in. 
College Freshman,1,"co-ed greek life. yup, I said it. "
College Freshman,1,"You can't go out without worrying about getting jumped.  This year is particularly bad, if you're looking for a school where you can go out and party, this is not the school for you."
College Senior,1,"Hempstead is a scary town, not suitable for students. We have robberies and other problems nearly each week. It's ridiculous."
College Senior,1,"The parking at Hofstra doesn't reflect the large commuter population on campus. As a commuter, I have to leave for class almost 30 minutes early just to get a parking spot, super far away."
College Sophomore,1,"I was offered a large scholarship, but the rest of my aid came in the form of loans. The financial aid office was not very helpful and they lost some of my paperwork in the process. There is a huge gap between what I should be expected to pay and the number that is on my bill and it is an issue that I have been struggling with all summer. As a top student, it is very frustrating to go to a school where the president is in the top 5 for highest paid presidents and I have not been offered the aid I need."
College Junior,1,"The school does nothing to help students find scholarships, it is up to the student."
College Freshman,1,Very few places to go off campus unless you head into the city. Other then that its a pretty bad neighborhood so stay on campus or in the city as much as possible
College Junior,1,"I received a scholarship my freshman year, which required an unreasonably high GPA to keep. It is extremely difficult to appeal the scholarship once lost and Hofstra appears to just give you money for your freshman year to increase their enrollment rate, then take it out from under you to keep the money in their bank account. They are not free with financial aid whatsoever, instead, they're beyond fee-happy."
College Freshman,1,"When it comes to the process- it's alright. When it comes to actual aid awarded- horrible. They give these small scholarships which are fine, but when requesting additional aid, it's a whole different story."
College Senior,1,"I was offered a full scholarship after high school, however I chose to attend a different university. My grades there were not spectacular, so I decided to transfer home and boost my GPA. I was offered next to nothing my first year here, and even though I now have a 3.7+, they still refuse to give me anything.

If you didn't get any money after high school, good luck getting a 1/30 of the tuition in scholarship after that."
College Junior,1,"Off campus dining near Hofstra is horrid! The only things terribly close to the school to eat is a small strip mall with a burger joint, pizzeria, Quizno's, a Jamaican restaurant, and a Chinese restaurant. Over on the Turnpike east of campus there is a Subway, Chipotle, McDonald's and Papa John's. Only the Chinese restaurant and McDonald's are open late. If you want to walk a little farther away from campus there is a yummy Jamaican restaurant on Front Street and a low priced Dominican restaurant. Neither are open late at night."
College Sophomore,1,"Food Sucks – I recommend everyone who plans on coming here to earn a lot of money and eat off campus.  The Au Bon Pain isn't bad, and neither is Bits n Bytes, but everything else is repulsive.  The ""sushi"" is gross, the late night foods are all fried, and the little mart is wayyy overpriced.  In fact, everything is overpriced.  Ex. A Redbull anywhere will cost $2, at Hofstra it costs $4."
College Freshman,1,"It Doesn't Help – The financial aid process at Hofstra is a joke. Only kids with parents who make a fortune can go here and it alienates those who come from low income families. Its just not fair, those of us who are trying to make a life for ourselves can't because we don't have the same financial opportunities as our peers."
College Junior,1,"No School Spirit – theres more hoodies and tshirts of other schools here than hofstra stuff. Most likely because we have no football team, forgettable basketball, etc. lacrosse team is in contention for top 10 team in the nation... wohooo, yea that definitely reels in the students, pshhh"
College Freshman,1,"Money Hungry – Everything on this campus is just too low end. At first, you might think the campus and everything is alright. However, once you're here for at least a month, you'll realize how the school is just a money hungry school."
College Junior,1,"Get rain boots. Everything is flat and you'll be wading through small ponds to get to class. Also, no one on Long Island knows how to deal with snow/ice. I have no idea why because it happens all the time. You should get some super high traction snow boots because you'll be sliding all over the sidewalk."
College Junior,1,Greek life at Hofstra is awful. None of the housing is sanctioned by the school because of horrible incidents of hazing- sexual assault and pistol whipping to name a few.
Recent Alumnus,1,Im Not Rich – Financially this school has been hell. I am a good student with good grades and for some reason I never get private scholarships so I am stuck filing for loans and still a balance due for my school. I feel like crying everyday. Most of these kids pay tuition like its nothing because they are fortunate enough and have the money for the school. I thought I would have great aid but it turns out i dont.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Rich and Snotty – There are so many fortunate students attending Hofstra. You can just smell the wealth off of each individual. The majority of the students who are well off are very snotty and ignorant. I dont come from a fortunate background and I am Hispanic. It seems that they aren't very friendly as well and there is just so much segregation in this school. The faculty all seems the same as the students. The guidance councilors are surprisingly different and helpful. I feel that many of the students fall under republican influence and religion is mostly in the Christian Catholic category. This school although very diverse, is very segregated and completely boring. Everyone ""sticks to their own kind"". I don't feel welcomed, i have a very bad feeling when i get on campus. Some professors are amazing, but that some is a very small number."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The student population is generally very local. International students and students of different races/ethnicities are small in number and tend to keep to themselves. Most schools in NY are known for their diversity, though sadly Hofstra is the exception."

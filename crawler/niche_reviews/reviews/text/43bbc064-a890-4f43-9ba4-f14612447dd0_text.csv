Junior,5,I have taken several classes online and needless to say the professors did an exquisite job covering all materials needed to succeed.
Junior,5,"When I applied to Columbus State University while still a senior in high school I was overwhelmed with emotions. The process of applying was in fact pretty self explanatory and stress-free. I have been here for two years now and it has been a life changing experience. I have been able to grow as an individual, make new friends, and learn how to become more independent. I think the University is a great environment for those who wish to have closer relationships and who thrive off of smaller classes and face-to-face learning."
Freshman,5,My experience has been amazing at CSU. I love all the professors and the people on campus. The atmosphere there has been very amazing. The thing I would like to see change is more places to see where your going and easier ways to find classes.
Freshman,5,My online experience was okay. I personally am not a fan of online classes but they were administered great and very organized. The one thing I would change is easier ways to communicate.
Junior,5,"My professors made sure that I didn't fall behind in my studies. It felt as they really strive for the students to be active in the class. Because of this, I always go the extra mile when I do my online assignments. I even have some professors that I feel as they go the extra mile with their students, too."
Sophomore,5,I have taken summer classes online through CSU and so far I have really enjoyed it. The teachers go above and beyond to make sure the class is well organized and easy to navigate online.
Sophomore,5,"I love that CSU is so student-involved. Every staff and faculty member there truly cares about the success of the students. There are so many teachers willing to help you and care for your overall grade in their class. Additionally, there are so many on-campus ways to get involved at CSU and job opportunities."
Junior,5,"The professors have been wonderful with lectures, handing out accurate learning materials and their response time is fantastic. Appreciate their willingness to help and unbiased grading."
Junior,5,Professors are very accommodating to one's needs. Provide easy to understand materials and reach out when she/he thinks you're falling behind.
Junior,5,"I really have only taken one class online, but it was a pleasure. The class was well organized and the teacher responded to questions quickly."
Graduate Student,5,"Columbus State University has been a great choice for my online schooling experience.  Having a demanding career as an Operating Room nurse didn't allow much time for getting an advanced degree.  However, Columbus State University made it easier by offering part time, instead of only full time courses. The professors are always readily available by email and even via phone.  Although I am considered an online student,  I have had the privilege to visit the campus (which might I add is by the river)and it is breath taking! In December 2020 I will have earned two degrees with Columbus State University and I couldn't be more happy!"
Sophomore,5,"So far Columbus State has offered everything and more that I could have dreamed of, with excellent staff, food, locality to all parts of Columbus, Ga. CSU has opportunities for all students with numerous organizations that allow students to live their best lives. Students can even participate in activists held almost weekly around campus to help them stay connected to their peers."
Sophomore,5,"I didn't truly appreciate it until I transferred to Clayton State (which has been awful and stressful). The offices here at Columbus State are extremely diligent, and they make sure to get things done as soon as possible and communicate with you if they can't. The campus is very diverse and has a bunch of clubs and organizations you can join to celebrate the many different qualities that make you, you. I loved Columbus and will most definitely be transferring back as soon as I can."
Alum,5,"I loved the sports faculty. It was awesome, plenty of workout classes and equipment. I wish there was no technology or parking decal fees."
Sophomore,5,My experience while attending Columbus State University has been and excellent one. Since the day I moved in I have enjoyed the campus events and the amount of care that the faculty and staff put into their lessons. The added diversity and the massive amounts of organizations to join have been added bonuses.
Sophomore,5,Columbus State University has provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn amongst excellent professors and peers at a not-so incredulous price be that as it may.
Junior,5,"My admission counselor walked me through each step of the admissions process, explained everything thoroughly until completion.  My academic advisor continued to assist me selecting courses needed to finish my degree."
Junior,5,The campus is really nice !I really enjoy the overall atmosphere and the idea of having a downtown/ main campus location.
Freshman,5,"Columbus State University is a very great school to attend to for all four years. For choosing a major, they have a variety to choose from with a variety of classes to take for that major. Their students and faculty are very helpful when it comes to anything on campus. They also ensure that you feel safe coming to and from class whether it's on downtown campus or the main campus."
Niche User,5,"I met with an admissions counselor to speak about the school. I am interested in becoming an enrolling freshman for the 2020 school year. If admitted, I am interested in becoming a child psychologist and have a successful year at their school. I loved hoe he spoke about how great the campus would be for me. They have great diversity and a great teaching system."
Senior,5,"I am very glad I choose Columbus State University. The Columbus, Georgia are is big, but still have a nice small town feel to it."
Freshman,5,"I like making new friends there, focusing in class, and managing my time for studies, tutoring, and advising. I am involved in one Christian Organization."
Freshman,5,I love how this university is all student success oriented. This establishment is willing to do anything to make sure that their students are successful and happy all the while enjoying their time.
Senior,5,"I like Columbus State University because it’s a mid sized campus. It’s perfect for walking and riding your bicycle around. What I love most is the diversity of students and faculty. It makes you feel like you belong there and that there are progress in people accepting others. I don’t feel excluded in any way and I’m proud to attend a school that was featured as being the top school in offering international education. Also, I praise the Riverpark campus because its located in the heart of Uptown Columbus. Uptown Columbus is filled with culture and music festivals all year round. Riverpark campus is very popular with the music and art students holding performances and exhibits. It made me fall in love with uptown Columbus. Other than that, the only problem I have is the parking issue. I think there should be more parking spaces available so it will decrease students and faculty frustration of finding a parking space."
Freshman,5,Columbus State University is a wonderful school. They have a simple enrolling process along with a fast decision making process. I recommend Columbus to anyone who is willing to take their education to the next level. They have always made sure I got the help I needed. Columbus State University is well worth attending.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the online program, it is very informative and straight forward. The staff and my counselor have been very helpful with me going back to school."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school and I love the arts programs and living downtown. There’s lots of opportunities to go see people speak, opportunities to do things in the community, shows and concerts to go to, and visits to different places. Every professor I have had has been amazing, and UPD makes you feel safe. I think the only downside is the food - some people really like it and even I like it sometimes, but sometimes it makes me feel sick. Besides that, I feel like Columbus has given me many opportunities."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience with Columbus State University has been amazing. I love how kind, helpful, knowledgeable, and approachable the faculty and staff are. Also, I am extremely appreciative of how clean, organized, and safe the campus is; you will never find any discarded garbage on the ground, and the police presence is active 24 hours a day. Also, there are multitudes of fun events held on campus each year including homecoming celebrations and influential guest speakers. One thing that I would like to see change is the maintenance and organization of online content; too often, I have come across typos on official documents or miscommunication over emails or website posts."
Freshman,5,"Very friendly people, all around make you feel welcome. The academics are very well done and not too much to take on."
Sophomore,5,"Columbus State is an amazing college. The professors are helpful and student friendly. They will answer any question you may ask. The college itself is beautiful. With two campuses, Columbus has gorgeous landmarks."
Niche User,5,I recently went to Columbus University with my teaching candidate class. I absolutely  loved everything about being there. The faculty was extremely helpful and sweet and everything was easy to understand about where to go. I wasn’t sure if teaching was the definite path I was going to take but after touring the teaching program and the campus I know for sure that it’s what I want to do.
Alum,5,I graduated with my nursing degree here and it was clutch! Not only did the professors and program prepare me for my life after graduation but I was also able to get a job directly after graduating in the hospital in my hometown!
Junior,5,"Columbus University allow many opportunities to expand my goals and plenty of activities centered around my career, I was nervous at first here, but after a year, the staff was sooo user friendly,  where if I had a problem,  I felt comfortable asking. Columbus is a beautiful city, with plenty of activities."
Sophomore,5,I’m still here. I’m a sophomore and I was enjoying my time there. I enjoy having all the different classes and seeing people but the teachers could do better in not wanting all your time to be on there work
Junior,5,"Columbus State University is a great school to attend. The many aspects that cast the university in a great light is its affordability, diversity, and opportunities. The community is heavily involved with the school and the students do what they can for the local environment too. Diversity is exhibited through the social programs and individuals who attend the school. Many opportunities have been offered for myself and others thriving in academics and organizational aspects."
Freshman,5,"I really like the environment that this university brings to their students. I think that the teachers really like their profession and because of this they treat the students with equality and respect. Every time I have need help they have been there for me, with every question. It is truly a beautiful campus, the peace that it lets you feel is beautiful, but my favorite place is the Schwob School of Music, I just love it."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus it is beautiful, it is a friendly community. There are so many great activities you can engage in the community, so you’re never bored."
Junior,5,"I have the best advisor who is helping me get done with college in the amount of time I wanted to. She warned me of how hard it would be to take six classes one semester so I was prepared for the challenge. I have had some wonderful Professors at this University. It is challenging, but so rewarding in the end! I would change the bathrooms and make them nicer."
Junior,5,I'm currently still attending Columbus State University towards my bachelors degree. That my few years of experience being their has been good. I have achieved several different studies that I'm glad I learned. That the environment at Columbus State University is very comfortable.
Senior,5,"Trust me , when you go there , you will love place , environment and everything. When i went there for the first time , i wasn't  expected that. It just made like whoa. I love those places and everything.  They have pool , basketball court , food court , workout area and many more . They had nice parks , lake and buildings . That college is one of my top choice and i will make it happen . I really want to go so bad ."
Freshman,5,This is the best college so far. They are helping me day to day adjusting and staying focus on the important things.
Senior,5,I love the school! I've had wonderful experiences there and have built lifelong relationships with some amazing people. Proffesors are knowledgeable and willing to help. Parking was stressful and definitely needs to be improved. The food was great and student life was also great. There's always some kind of activity or event going on to keep students as well as the community entertained. Its definitely a nice looking campus. I entered in as a transfer student and the process was easy. Great school overall!
Graduate Student,5,Columbus State is a great University!  I really enjoy the atmosphere and the professionalism that each teacher shows the students.  I would encourage anyone who is looking to further their education to look towards CSU as a start!
Junior,5,"Coming into Columbus State I was nervous about the small school atmosphere, but it honestly makes college more enjoyable. It is refreshing seeing familiar faces walking around campus, especially on a stressful day. The classes are perfect size. Big enough to not have to sit in the front, but small enough to have a good relationship with your professor. The professors are very engaged and want all of their students to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"What I love about CSU is the environment. It is a fun place to be and many exciting events. Winterfest is one of my favorite events because I love the Christmas season and it is fun for all ages. This event has caroling by a children's choir, arts and crafts, and many different food vendors. I absolutely love it!    If I could change anything about CSU, I would suggest lettings students be more aware of the opportunity to help out with the event. Other students that I spoke with, including myself, were unaware of the signups to participate in the event."
Senior,5,I like Columbus State University because they really give me a better chance and more help as I attend that college verses other colleges. I do plan on graduating from Columbus State University.  I can only think of one way of improvement that I can come up with and that is to make a school closer so that I can go to class on campus.
Niche User,5,I am a senior in high school. When I went to tour Columbus State University it felt like home to me. Columbus State is the best school in Georgia. I love the student recreation center. Columbus State has everything that a student athlete could ever ask for.
Graduate Student,5,"Columbus State University offers challenging graduate programs at a much lower cost than larger institutions.  After completing two degrees at a large university, I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality that Columbus State offers.  As a matter of fact, I am considering yet another degree from CSU as I have enjoyed my coursework so much."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience as an online student at Columbus State University has been great thus far. Virtual classes that include live on-camera instruction would be a great addition to the school in the future. Whenever I am on campus, it is easy to get involved as there are many volunteer opportunities and activities. The Registrar and Student Services are also very hands-on with assisting students with any concerns he or she may have."
Freshman,5,I am really enjoying my experience at Columbus State University. I like the fact that the professors here are not rude and they do not treat students like robots. I am also glad that the University is so close to the mall. The fact that there is a subway here on campus is amazing. The amount of work that the professors give students is not too extreme either. They also help motivate you to continue doing the right thing that you are supposed to do. One thing that I would change about the University is the price of some of the things here. Some of the things at the bookstore seem overpriced.
Junior,5,"Columbus State University is an amazing university. I am currently a student there and I am working on obtaining an online degree there. I have to say that their online classes are really amazing. I have learned so much from them. They also offer eCore online classes. Their foreign language courses and professors are great. The campus is nice and most of the professors are great. The people on campus are nice and friendly. The tuition is not as high as some other schools, so that is great. They offer many resources that can help make your college experience great and successful."
Senior,5,Columbus State University has a great business program. I have enjoyed my time here as an accounting student.
Sophomore,5,"At Columbus State University I really enjoyed the scenery around the campus throughout the school week, with different events allowing different people to join together to share the same interest in an event. There’s also a lot of extra curricular programs and groups to help you prosper in school and in socializing. The gymnasium is amazing, plenty of different ways to stay fit at it. I wish they would fix the cafeteria food, it’s like they don’t try there hardest to prepare the food for young men and women who are trying to further there education, at least they could prepare an respectable meal for us, the brain functions better with a good meal. Also the financial aid and advisor should be more persistent in notifying students of there situations in advance instead of the last second mailing the problem even more unbearable"
Junior,5,I love this school. It's easy to make your own course schedules. Most professor will work with you if you have personal problems or need extra help. There are also great tutoring centers. There are many student events and some are even free to the public. There many ways to get involved with the community and it has a very diverse campus. There are also ample opportunities for study abroad.
Niche User,5,I love Columbus State University! The first time I walked in there I felt welcomed. The teachers are great and overall school is fun. They always have events going on and often give away lots of free stuff. I would highly recommend  going here.
Junior,5,I am a Veteran attending college after 18 years of service.  The college has many veteran based programs to help make the transition easy.  The college does an outstanding job supporting the local military and military veterans attending the school.
Sophomore,5,"I'm transferring here from a small state college. It seems like a nice university. Great food, and great dorms. I'm a Sophomore and I have a dorm with my own bedroom and bathroom. There's a little market store, an Einstein Bros Bagel, and a Chick-fil-a on campus."
Freshman,5,"Professors are good. Teaching skills of professors and in class activities are appreciable. Events are well organized by the university. Emails regarding any events and submissions are quickly sent by the university. Also, Fee due dates are also  sent via mail. All the deadlines are displayed in the cougar view."
Niche User,5,Most of the professors are super cool and love to help you with your grades! There are many campus events that involve everyone!
Junior,5,"Columbus State University is a great school. They have an amazing music program that people from all over the world come to study and perform. They offer many study abroad opportunities, and it is relatively affordable compared to other universities."
Senior,4,Columbus State University is a great small university to go to when you might be overwhelmed with the thought of a large university.
Alum,4,"I had enjoyable on-campus experience, and I always felt like I had good professors. I wish there had been more guidance in discovering what one should be going to school to pursue."
Junior,4,"The online experience is hard. The professors seem to not understand that we have multiple classes and we, as students, are not good with technology either."
Freshman,4,It is going well so far. Students are friendly. Teachers are ok. Due to covid the have amped the safety requirements.
Freshman,4,the professors really take the time with you and actually want you to successful in the future. they work extra hard to make sure that the work they give out is very clear and that each student gets the help they need.
Freshman,4,applying to this school was very easy and they have a great set up to help you get on the right track. cant wait for this fall semester to start.
Alum,4,Online classes were well planned and executed. The amount of online courses were low but the ones that were offered are very well executed.
Junior,4,"I took one full course online and it was fine. The professor was a bit over demanding and came off as arrogant, but I gained something from the course. When we switched to online after spring break this past semester due to coronavirus the transition was difficult but my professors adapted as best they could and although I would have much preferred in class instruction, the online was adequate."
Sophomore,4,"I dual enrolled at Columbus State University for two years and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I plan on going there in the fall for college. They have amazing activities for everyone to be social and enjoy college life. The professors are overall great, however, some are a little insensitive. However, most of CSU's professors love their job and their students."
Sophomore,4,"Columbus State showed me that exploring outside of my hometown is really amazing. It gave me the opportunity to begin a new chapter with new people and open myself up to different events and step out of my comfort with the type of people I was used to. I met plenty of cool and fun people throughout my first year. The only thing I had an issue at first with was trying to balance completing assignments and hanging out with friends, but I learned to get better as time passed. Although, I was very upset about ending my first year of college early because of covid-19. I am so ready to start my sophomore to meet even more people, face new challenges and to be given more opportunities!"
Junior,4,I enjoy the orientation that I went to. I was amazing to see how well the school cared and relied on their students. It was nice to see how the students have a voice that matters.
Senior,4,I only took a half online/half in person class. It was easy and educational. The online portion was only videos and quizzes.
Senior,4,"Although I had the occasional bad professor. Overall I enjoyed the campus size, layout, and staff. Most are friendly. I highly recommend using rate my professor to ensure you don’t get a bad egg. Chemistry department isn’t great, I transferred and I was very behind."
Senior,4,"The online portion might seem intimidating, but overall it has been a great experience and easy to access! Professors are always available to chat and help students with any problems or questions regarding online material. Due to COVID-19, the remainder of classes were online, but professors were always willing to help and it was easy to navigate through cougarview."
Senior,4,"Being a student at Columbus State University has provided me with a higher education and access to learning materials, professors who care about their students and various other educational outlets that have benefited my overall learning experience. Columbus State truly cares about their students and the quality of education is worth every penny!"
Senior,4,The application process was very easy. The teachers are very nice and willing to help in any way they can.  They offer tutoring and a writing lab also.
Senior,4,I have taken several online classes at Columbus State University.  The content was very useful and they made sure you had the tools to be successful.
Sophomore,4,"Majority of my professors, excluding one or two, made sure to try and keep the class involved and invested in their class. Two professors particularly did a superb job of doing so.It was just tough for me to retain the information as well as when we were in class."
Junior,4,I love how the campus is concerned about the student. From the academy advisor to the professors. Every professor/class that I have taken makes me feel like it is designed to teach the material effectively so that the student learns and passes.
Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about CSU is the environment on campus. I love the designs of the buildings, the landscaping on grounds, all of the murals and things painted on different spaces, and other things. I also love that the school is all about create you and including everyone. That makes the campus feel diverse and safe to be yourself. If I had to change anything I think it would be some food choices in the cafe and the blue tables outside really need to be cleaned."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman BA Theatre major at Columbus State University and I thoroughly enjoyed my first year there. I stayed at Broadway Crossing (the best freshman housing.) At Broadway Crossing we all had apartments so I had my own kitchen which made up partially for the food. The food on main campus is really good, but the food downtown at the Rankin isn't that good. I have yet to have a bad professor here yet, which I'm really grateful for. There is a very good amount of diversity at Columbus State, we have a lot of black, white, and Asian students. Columbus State is also very inclusive, and the city of Columbus isn't too bad either. If you live downtown it is very aesthetically pleasing. The party scene is amazing but it isn't terrible. The more people you know, the more parties you will be invited to."
Junior,4,"Columbus State University is an open local campus. It’s well diverse in many aspects, if you don’t find your place you can create one!"
Junior,4,"Columbus State University consists of two campuses; Riverpark (downtown) and main.  I absolutely love the downtown scene, there is not a whole lot to do but the downtown feel and river jogs are appreciated! The university is very diverse, and diversity is celebrated in the organizations offered and the events that are held. Personally, academics here are just challenging enough to where I am not bored, but it is not difficult either. My only complaints are that they should tell all first year students to live on main campus their first two years. I say this because even though my major's building is located on the Riverpark campus, all core classes are located on main campus. And then there is no way to sugar coat it- the food here SUCKS. Freshmen are required to get an all-access meal plan which means they can get as much food as they want throughout the day. However, it is the most expensive and I do NOT see where all that money is going."
Freshman,4,Being at Columbus State University only for an entire week does not truly give one enough time to give a trust worthy claim. However the time I have spent here has been quite a smooth transition and hopefully the momentum continues through out the school year.
Junior,4,"I am currently  a transfer student so I am unsure of the school itself. I do know my step siblings have both attended the school so as a mere observer I would say they like the school to say the least. In my opinion its saying something. Not only is it a good town to live in, raise a family and go to school but it is a peaceful environment and not many distractions which is appreciated."
Freshman,4,It’s not a huge campus but it’s a great size. People are friendly  on campus and the professors are always willing to help you as much as they possible can. There are plenty of people you can talk to if you need help with anything.
Senior,4,I am a new student and the process of enrolling was very easy. I was assisted in every way possible to make sure I had everything I needed.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the fact that CSU offers over 100 clubs for students to join and even more ways to get involved, such as Career Development, Greek life, Study Abroad, etc."
Sophomore,4,"I have liked my experience so far. As an international student I feel very welcomed. Campus is not too big, but not too small. Students are very nice."
Junior,4,"It's a very nice campus, but it's kind of boring if you don't have your own transportation. The mall is like across the street. Also, there's a strip mall about 8 mins away. It's a lot food places near the school. The student recreation facility is nice."
Freshman,4,"I'd previously attended another university which do not go well. However, my time at Columbus State University has made the difference between quiting or continuing my education. I have found a home here and I am so glad I gave Columbus State University a chance!"
Freshman,4,"I love playing softball here, the athletics here are great. Softball is ranked top three in our conference, our soccer team just won nationals, and our boys tennis also walked away with a bog win. Last year, our baseball team was national runner up. I love the culture that is built around the sports here at CSU, everyone is so close and always love to hang out!"
Junior,4,"While I have only taken online courses so far at CSU, I have come realize that the staff is just as supportive online as they are in person now that I have officially moved to Columbus, GA to attend the fall semester."
Alum,4,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Columbus State University. I stayed on the gorgeous Downtown campus with the other arts students, and I enjoyed having that trendy downtown feel with the park, coffee shops, and local shops to explore. The dorms had an apartment feel with a full kitchen and living room, but it was a bit ridiculous that all on campus students were required to have a meal plan when their rooms came with kitchens. The separation of the campuses was sometimes a bit of a struggle as I think there was some animosity between the two campuses because a lot of times the main campus had newer and nicer amenities while the downtown campus felt left out. Parking especially on the main campus was a huge issue as well for commuters and downtown students. The Aramark food service was not very good especially on the downtown campus. I had vegetarian friends who especially struggled with the food service."
Sophomore,4,"I have been attending Columbus State for one semester, and I can already tell what a great school it is. The faculty and staff I have come into contact with are all nice, personable, and caring for their students. The facilities are wonderful, and I never have to go off-campus to find any resources I might need for classes. The classes are challenging yet fair, and overall, I think I am getting a very good education there."
Sophomore,4,"The school itself is really nice to me. It is a very clean campus with friendly people, when you choose the right ones. The sources to help you succeed are all there. The teachers are caring and very well taught, they always know what they're talking about. The food provided is just as great. The gym provided is updated and spacious for anyone and everyone to go to. As long as you are nice to people, you will receive the same feedback."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience here at Columbus State University has been great. I feel that the professors really  care about the student receiving a quality education. I feel as though most students and professors here are friendly and willing to assist you with becoming acclimated  with the campus environment. All of the professors and administrators have an open door policy. The financial aid office staff is very friendly and always on point when it comes to updating my scholarships into the system.  The campus lawn is well maintained all year long. I would like to have more variety of selections for food choices, but the food is always good and freshly cooked. I feel safe on campus, and I always see the campus police riding around making sure that the campus is safe and secure. I am satisfied with my experience here at Columbus State University!!!"
Senior,4,"My experience at Columbus State University has been a fairly pleasant one. Of course, there have been ups and downs but that is to be expected of any university. I haven't had one professor that I could say anything negative about, they've all been incredibly kind and want to see their students succeed. 
One thing I would really like to see change is the expansion of staff for my major's department. The Health Science department is very short staffed and it can be a struggle for students to take the classes needed because most are either offered once a year or online only, which can be quite expensive."
Junior,4,"there is always an event going on so you can attend school and have fun at the same time. Also with all the different groups on campus, you can find more forever friends."
Junior,4,"I would change the cafe. The food there is quite average and repetitive everyday. I would make the financial aid office more efficient. When it's time to collect money their systems always go down, or they take their time to get your money in to you."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy being at CSU even though it is not my first pick. Shuttles that run every 20 minutes, so getting from main campus to downtown is not that hard. The problem is that sometimes drivers are late, they leave early, and some shuttles are too small to hold everyone. Security wise, there are emergency telephones around campus, and campus police drives around occasionally. I had a fantastic stay in the hotel-like freshman dorm, Clearview Hall. Too bad sleeping in the same room as your roommate is the only option. When I became a sophomore, I was upset with the rundown housing in Courtyard South/One. I will be moving to Courtyard North next semester and it is way better! I am not a big fan of the foods, but some days are better than others. The cafe is buffet style with a salad bar, pizza, hibachi, ""main event"", and desserts; they server different things for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. CSU is overall a great school if you use RateMyProfessor to choose your classes wisely!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall I personally feel that Columbus State University is a school that functions well and supports its students. I would recommend this University to a lot of high school students that I know as well as any friends who are not in college yet or are looking to attend a new university. Columbus State University has a beautiful campus that has a lot of amenities open for students to use including two libraries and many technology areas that are funded by students tuition. Most of the professors come from accredited Universities , are here for the students, and have their office doors open whenever a student may need to talk or may have questions about the class."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved the overall atmosphere of CSU. Everyone is very friendly to each other and from very different backgrounds with very different opinions. I had so many conversations that never got heated, but respected everyone's opinions. I did not like the occasional moments that made me feel unsafe in my environment. I live on the Riverfront campus, so I cannot really say what it is like on main campus. Nighttime is the only time that you would really feel the need to have a friend with you, but there is a lot of police that are patrolling the area at all times."
Freshman,4,"Most staff is happy to assist in every way possible. Professors are likely to go above and beyond to help you succeed in not only their course, but others."
Junior,4,"This school offers many different ways to achieve your degree. They are also military friendly. They have classes offered in the morning, evening, weekends, and online. This school has guidance counselors on our military base even so we don’t have to drive off post to get help."
Sophomore,4,"Columbus State University has some very good professors that make attending there very productive. The campus is big, but it is not too big. The professors seem to care about you."
Niche User,4,Great experience!! Teachers will really help you and work with you. I've had many professors stay after with me.
Junior,4,"I love CSU, they do a great job for helping me suceed.  Riverpark is a great campus and the comm department is amazing. Res Life is great too, the dorms are beautiful."
Senior,4,"I have attended CSU off and on over the past 8 years. I have found several advisors and professors to be extremely helpful with advice and direction as I struggled on what to study and how to go about it. They have a great recreation center and while the parking is a bit stressful, the overall classrooms and buildings are kept in great shape and offer multipurpose uses."
Sophomore,4,CSU is a great school if you're not into the big college life but still want something out of the four years. They're not so big on parties meaning you can focus more on school. The student to teacher ratio is small so there's better one on one for the students to communicate with the professor. The campus is beautiful with events happening all the time. There's two campus meaning you can change your campus life from main to downtown depending on your major. It's just a great school for those who want that small town big school experience.
Sophomore,4,"I have never had an issue with admissions and they have always been very kind and helpful. My advisor has been very accommodating and always responds when I email her with questions about a class. I have also had good experiences in all my classes. Obviously some are harder than others, but it is about what you put into it."
Junior,4,The campus is very safe. The parking monitors over do it a little. You don't feel out of place no matter your age!
Niche User,4,"Columbus State is very accommodating and they provide many ways to get involved on campus. The campus is relatively small but provides an array of classes and programs to get involved in. The professors are great and do an excellent job of relaying the information to you. The food choices are great, in each building there is a quick and nutritious snack shop, not to mention there is a subway and a chick-fil-a in the main building on campus."
Niche User,4,"Columbus State University is a diverse campus with things to do for every individual. Athletics, clubs, and academics are extremely important at CSU; however, if I were to change one factor about campus, I would offer more parking for students and teachers because space is extremely limited due to the high enrollment of students and small campus space."
Sophomore,4,"Just like anywhere else you go, the experience you have at Columbus State is what you make it. There are a variety of programs and clubs one can participate in that caters to their passions and/or hobbies."
Sophomore,4,Great atmosphere! Awesome professors and a very diverse campus. You can't stay ignorant when going to a college like this.
Sophomore,4,Love the atmosphere. Professors are worth it i can say. I enjoy it here and glad to be in college here at csu.
Freshman,4,"Columbus State University is not a top school but it is still a very good school to focus on academics, meet new people from different areas of Georgia, and to get involved into any extracurricular activities. The things that CSU need to change is having good summer classes to take online for students and to make the campus a whole lot better and a little bigger but just not too big."
Sophomore,4,"Columbus State University was my first choice. This is because the location. I did not expect much out of the university but was surprised to see how much I enjoyed it. To be frank, it's still school so I'm not too pleased but if I have to be at school, Columbus State University is where I want to be. They have lively student life as well as understanding professors."
Sophomore,4,Teachers are great and really passionate about their fields. The campus is ever expanding and making itself more great. The students are determined and ready to embrace jobs in the fields that they study in.
Freshman,2,It is more difficult to communicate through an online class. It is just not the same as if we were in person.
Junior,2,Their website should be up to date and their scholarships should not all be based on financial aid. Overall the school is okay.
College Senior,2,"The school needs a lot of work. Professors can be hit or miss, and many of them do care about students who care about the work, but the entire atmosphere of the University rests in a kind of lazy disregard for, well,  everything. Administrators are notorious for playing ""not my problem"" and directing students to other offices instead of helping. Services like internet are spotty at best, and dorms are expensive for what you get. 

The biggest problem, really, is just that nobody seems to give a damn. I know students in their senior year of the English program who can barely cobble together a paragraph. What are these professors doing? I don't know."
College Sophomore,2,Some professors really need to be fired.
College Sophomore,2,CSU doesn't have their stuff together.
College Freshman,2,"Nobody really puts their information out there while the sororities literally scope out girl who look like their ""type"" when they aren't even accepting people right now."
College Junior,2,We need a true football team.
College Senior,2,The cafe was horrible. The workers were mean and it was mandatory to have a meal plan if you stayed on campus. That was another way for Columbus state to get money from you.
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many parties, although when there is one I have a great time."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus food is really not good. They basically cook the same things everyday, and it is not tasty at all. The cafeteria closes to early. Many other campuses have 24  hours cafeterias or at least some part of the food industry that stay open late for students. Also the fact that you have to have a meal pan. I am feeling forced into spending more money than i have too and to eat the food i do not want to eat. If they just had a cougar cash plan that would be better."
College Sophomore,2,"Many apartments are pricey. University crossing is across the street, but I heard its high and so is cougar village but cougar village is down the street."
College Freshman,2,Wish I had money to spend some where other than the campus dining.
College Freshman,2,The people who are supposed to try and work with you on financial aid dont seem to care whether or not you get your problem solved.
College Sophomore,2,Getting financial aid at CSU can be a long process especially when we they're are being really slow in processing documents. I would advised you to get all your documents in as soon as possible to avoid having to pay more money because you're waiting on them to give you the money.
College Senior,2,"The dining hall at the RiverPark campus is actually pretty bad. Everything is overpriced at the C-store and the hot meals either are not very good or they take forever to make. We complain about it often, but we still eat their and spend our fake money and meal plans. It's interesting. I still like going?"
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, it's quite a struggle to get financial aid. I work really hard and spend a lot of my own money on my education, and I've had to put school on hold to save just to pay for a semester."
College Junior,2,I always find it difficult for professors and staff to help me.
College Junior,2,The only things really close to campus are burger king and an applebees.
College Sophomore,2,"if you can reach anybody on the phone, its a hassle to figure out which set of information is required, and even if you do get the papers required, you are sometimes sent away because office workers say its the wrong info or its out of date. ive even heard from others that the office sometimes actually loses some of the info turned into the office. the service could be better."
College Sophomore,2,"for its price, its not worth the crappy internet, and the shootings that have happened. safety is an issue, and gated fences arent all we need.bugs. the housing process itself is a giant headache. even if you do select your roomates, theres no guarantee that you or your friends will even receive a room. you may even be forced to share a room."
College Sophomore,2,The phone is always busy. You can wait for over an hour to speak with anyone. You will get different answers from different people. It is very frustrating. They are always messing things up.
College Sophomore,2,2-hr parking. You WILL get a ticket if you go over the time. That man is very good at his job.
College Student,2,Busses tend not to run on bad weather days.
College Junior,2,It took forever to match my financial aid award to my account.
College Senior,2,There are not enough spots for the amount of students this school is taking on. Even with the new parking deck they have recently added parking is really bad. Some mornings it can take students an hour to find an open spot. 
College Freshman,2,It is a long process sometimes. Need to make sure all paper work is done and turned in on time.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of different races, religions and beliefs on campus."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of chain restaurants and fast food. But there are a few good places around town, mostly downtown holds a variety of interesting places."
College Freshman,2,"Sports does not play a big role in my campus life, but a lot of people on campus enjoy it."
College Freshman,2,I have absolutely no clue about the greek life at my school.
College Freshman,2,"Decent computers, though I would still prefer to bring my own laptop and work from there."
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have anything that stands out from all the other schools.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't like the main dishes. The pizza, burgers, and hot dogs are the best things there."
College Junior,2,Parking at Columbus could be so much better. There are so many new students because the campus is growing so fast the parking has become a nightmare.
College Sophomore,2,"Because Columbus State is such a small school and it is not a technical institution, opportunities for internships or co-ops are harder to come by. While this is true, I can say that the Earth and Space Sciences department does as much as it can to aid its engineering students in preparation to transfer to other institutions with better opportunities for internships and co-op programs that will better prepare us for our field of work after graduation."
College Sophomore,2,"Although I have not had an internship with Columbus State, opportunities for such internships in engineering in Columbus, Ga are few if any."
College Student,2,"The Greeks aren't very present because there's no point in joining. Most dorms are ""dry"" and it's against regulations to have Greek housing. There is a ""Greek Center"" but I don't know how much use it gets. There are no special Greek privileges, but they do assist in charities a lot, which is nice. Mostly they do more formal events like ""peppermint socials"" instead of parties."
College Sophomore,2,"The school community is definitely second to the military base nearby. Most stores and businesses are geared to attract soldiers and their families, not your typical college student. There are very few activities to do around the campus (there's a cheap movie theatre that plays old movies and a mall and that's about it) and do not expect to find any local businesses offering discounts or anything special for students."
College Sophomore,2,The Greek Life is very pathetic. You rarely see any activity from them unless they are advertising for a party which aren't very good. They are more so for popularity here than a brotherhood or a sisterhood.
College Sophomore,2,The greek life is kind of a joke. All of the Greeks take them seriously but non greeks don't really look at them as real frats or soroities. The college doesn't allow them to have official housing and they don't really do anything for anyone other than other greeks.
College Freshman,2,"The places on campus are somewhat decent. After a couple of days the food gets tiring and you get tired of eating the same things. When you are incredibly hungry, the Den (the dining hall downtown columbus) can be enough to satisfy your hunger. I would suggest that anybody who does not eat that much or does not like fast food that much, should not get a big meal plan."
College Junior,2,I often drive around for a while trying to find a parking space in the student lots.
College Junior,2,I'm not really aware of the Greek life at CSCC.
College Freshman,2,In my school they pretty much allow you to stay on track with your degree on your own. There is a lot of help during your freshmen year that allows you to know what is needed to actually earn your degree
College Sophomore,2,"Barely Represented – I am not a follower of the sports scene a CSU. I was at my old school because of how they supported and presented the school teams. It felt as if the whole school fully supported their team, and that kind of involvement draws you in. This, however, is not present at CSU. The only people I hear taking about sports are the people that play them."
College Sophomore,2,"War of the Campus' – At this school, there are two different campus'. You have the main campus and the river park campus. The main campus students are your average college students going for english, math, science, etc. Whereas the River Park campus students are your art, music and theater majors. Therefore, this mix of different students give an interesting experience and variety of different pupils. However, with this mix there are complications that occur with it. It almost becomes war of the campus' because they are so different and have different interests."
College Sophomore,2,"The Food Is Not My Favorite – This is one area that Columbus State can defiantly improve on. They are very repetitive, Some of the staff are rude, and the food really isn't good besides on Thursdays. The only time the food is good is if there is an event such as ""Steak Night"" but besides that no."
College Junior,2,"Start Early – It's imparative to begin the financial aid process as soon as you can. Have a plan. Have a back up plan. Also, don't be afraid to visit the financial aid office as much as you need to. They are there to help you."
College Freshman,2,They're There and They're Proud – Greek life at CSU is pretty big if you're Greek. Truly only main campus students have time to devote to Greek Life. The parties are elitist and don't expect to get in them if you're a guy. Girls can get into any Frat Party though. Greek people take Greek Life very seriously. Don't mock it around them or be prepared for a fight.
College Student,2,"Diversity on Campus – We have a lot of diversity on campus, but most races stick to themselves. Which is understandable we are in the south, and most of everything we do down here has some portion of segregation."
College Senior,2,"Great Near Main Campus, Downtown Harder – unless you've got money to spend, finding quality housing downtown is difficult. most housing (other than the dorms) is old"
College Freshman,2,"Campus What?? The Transportation on campus is OK. The Old bus Drivers be trying to talk to the students. It is really bad. They pretty much follow the time chart. On the weekends they sometime skip stops and times. The bus Drives can be rude, so you have to watch them. They can get slick at the mouth!"
College Freshman,2,"There are not a lot of option for computer labs. There are computers in the library, and there is a lab in the CCT building and the computers are almost always taken.  The campus does have wifi and plenty of outlets in classrooms fro laptops.  Each student is given 1,000 pages they can print for free every semester and its only like 5 or ten cents per page when you go over the limit."
College Junior,2,"I had very little help with financial aid form the college. There are people here who should be able to help you, but they will not. You are on your own."
Recent Alumnus,2,"College Life – As a first year college student, it is ok. Having the financial means is hard in the first year. The main campus food is not to m liking but the on campus restaurants makes it better. I know for next semster that afternoon classes are not going to work so morning classes are preferred and easies the transition from high school into college life. Taking ap classes in high school prepared me for the gaps in between assignments due and the work load."
College Freshman,2,They Take Parking Seriously – If you do not have a staff parking sticker on your car you will get a ticket if you park in their spot. And you will not get your transcript if you do not pay the ticket. The parking is not so bad for students that it is worth getting a ticket to park in the closer staff spots.
College Junior,2,Students at this school are not uniform and dress how they want to dress.
College Sophomore,2,Campus Police – The campus police are always ready to ticket students whenever necessary however if a student calls campus police they tend to lack a sense of urgency and put students on hold which is unacceptable.
College Sophomore,2,"They Are There but Easily Forgotten. I think Greek life can easily be forgotten on campus. Unless you pass by the Greek house on campus.  The only times, I've noticed them were when they have like a week dedicated to a fraternity or sorority. I guess pledge week? I think this happens once or twice a year. Other than that and every now and then a event one of them held, after that they were gone without a trace"
College Freshman,2,"At Columbus State, the best time to avoid school is the winter quarter. You should plan to take courses in the spring, summer, and fall quarters. If you do have to take winter classes, be careful, wear boots that have traction on the ice (experience talking!), wear layers, and carry a seat warmer!"
Senior,1,"Good luck if you decide to go here, the only good program is in nursing. First year dorms have police at each end of the hallways, not sure why but made me think it was unsafe. The dorms they give the sophomores is a big downgrade and you are made to live with two extra people, I figured it would be the inverse but whatever. So 4 people to a living space unless you choose to live off campus. The cafe closes during lunch hours, not much else to say about that one. The teachers I had were very hit and miss and mostly I felt as if I had to teach myself most of the material, but the advisers are the worst part, it took me awhile to realize that though even a teacher from the school agreed with me that they put kids in classes that aren't the path they have in their education plan. This school is like a university on the cover, once you open the pages and read it looks a bit more like a technical schools approach to learning. It may be that most were only teaching for part time."
Sophomore,1,"After leaving Columbus State due to covid-19, everyone was required to take online classes for the remainder of the semester. I rarely had any internet access in order to complete my assignments. Luckily, I still managed to complete most of my assignments and pass all my classes!"
Graduate Student,1,"Stay away from the FNP program. It is not for working adults. They do not find preceptors for students. Exams are scheduled three times for each class, on a specific date and within a 3-4 hour timeframe during the middle of the day. Not only do you have to beg for preceptors, you have to work around the preceptor's schedule, you have to schedule your work and your clinic days around these exams (if the connection even works without throwing you out of the exam multiple times). The instructors do not interact with the students in the classrooms. There are many time wasting assignments. The director is completely arrogant and states that everything is her ""policy."""
Freshman,1,"Please look at the national rankings and graduation rate for this school. The six year graduation rate is 30%, that is just shameful to know over half of the students that they care for will not graduate. They are certainly not up to par with what they advertise. I think there accreditation needs to be reviewed. Students look dead on campus and advisers do not actually help you graduate on time."
Niche User,1,Columbus state is probably the worst college I could imagine going to. Between the professors who have no clue what they're talking about to the drug addicts that are passing classes for just showing up. I would never go back and attend this college.
College Senior,1,"What I hate about this is paying for the student athletic fees. I was a college athlete myself, and was on a scholarship, therefore I know that athletic fees supply money for these scholarships, however, as a graduate student (and someone not having any part in athletics), I think paying $200/semester for athletics is ridiculous. The school should get sponsors to pay for these.

Furthermore, the fact that I, as a student, pay $180/semester (roughly $43/month) for usage of the Student Recreation Center, while community members AND university staff can get a monthly membership for $20 is ridiculous. I understand the need to pay off this building, but why can't it be met halfway, where everyone pays $30/month? Why do the students need to pay off this building and the staff does not, yet both groups have identical access to it?"
College Sophomore,1,No one really joins the greek life.
College Freshman,1,The school has no idea what its students do.
College Senior,1,The campus police treat every African American at Columbus state like criminals
College Junior,1,"CSU's financial aid department is aweful! EVERY semester I end up in the financial aid building talking with the agents about something they screwed up are need to re-verify before they will give me my money. I have always received my money... eventually, but it is definitely a hassle. 

It would be easier if they would email the students or notify us someway if they need something to finish processing our money, but instead we wait and wait and hear nothing and call and they tell us we have to go there is person, just to find out they need us to update our address or give them a copy of some form.  (that they lost!)"
College Freshman,1,theres nothing to do! everyone usually goes home
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have an early class, you won't have a parking spot."
College Freshman,1,I honestly don't feel 100% safe.
College Freshman,1,I don't see any dining on campus except a hot dog vender.
College Freshman,1,I don't see anything about Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,We always have people stealing cars.
College Junior,1,The parking at Columbus State sucks. There are scarce spots for parking.  The only good thing is the parking deck but for someone like me whose class is in the science building its terrible to get to. The best spots are taken early due to students who commute or just like to drive. They don't really throw out fines and ticket people unless you are breaking the rules.
College Junior,1,Greek life isn't its best like I have heard it was in previous years. The parties are okay that they each throw although the same people attend them. When they have Greek festivities it does brighten up the campus a little bit. All Greeks interact with everyone an they also ask for our opinions on what we would like for them to bring to the table on upcoming events. I wish they would do more things around campus to make it more of a fun experience like it was previous years ago. Greek life makes the school more interesting because it would get the students involved into more school related activities.
College Sophomore,1,"This is the area that I have most struggled with since coming to CSU!! The only reason that I did not give the school an ""F"" is because it's such a cheap school that I was able to pay most costs out of pocket. I have been to the financial aid office 3 times this year and met with 3 different people. Each of them have been callous, rude, and generally unhelpful. The last woman advised me to drop-out when I told her I'd like to avoid taking out student loans for the upcoming semester. They lost my paperwork in the summer, they delayed my pell grant for 2 months and their scholarship deadline was impossible to meet! (<--- Explanation, application for all scholarships are due on January 31st and as part of the requirement you have to turn in the current years fafsa with your application. Because your employer doesn't have to give you your w2 till the 31st, there's a very likely chance you can't get your fafsa done in time.) I would strongly advise trying to work with a website apart from CSU for your questions and advice (GA411 was very helpful) and stay really far ahead on deadlines because CSU is very slow getting paperwork ready for you!"
College Freshman,1,There is only one parking garage on campus and that is quite far form the majority of the halls.
College Junior,1,"Well if you live downtown never take a night course because you will never leave when you want to, the school will buy new buses but nope they will never change anything about schedules."
College Junior,1,"Very dangerous, protect yourself at all times! Columbus has an unbalanced ratio of homeless and prisoner work programs to assimilate with students, a very volitile mix."
College Junior,1,Many are outdated and they need twice as many. The IT dept. seems very unprofessional and underqualified.
College Junior,1,"All low quality chains and fast food but the Columbus customer service and local pride in work ethic is non existent. You will always be disappointed if you are hold a standard in Columbus,Ga."
College Junior,1,"The campus police are more interested in passing out parking tickets than protecting students. I reported a violation in which I witnessed a student hit by a car on campus and the police never followed up with me, they acted as if the student was in error. Last year an unauthorized van was prowling the campus attempting to kidnap women, 2 were assaulted before he was arrested.  There should be more restrictions on unauthorized vehicles durind class hours.  When speaking to campus police, they are often rude and act as if they can't be bothered."
College Sophomore,1,"Early Bird Gets the Spot . . . Usually – If you want a place to park, you MUST be on campus by no later than 7:30am. Otherwise, forget it. You'll end up parking miles away from where you need to go."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Many Options – I am a Biology major and a sophomore here at CSU. If you go on our website to look for scholarships, there are none available specifically for science or mathematics majors. The majority of them are for art, music, or teaching. Its easier to just find some online."
College Sophomore,1,Fail Simply Fail – The Financial aid department at the school is horrible in the worst of ways. If you need help with anything dealing with your financial aid go to another school because the stress they put upon you is not worth the education you are receiving.
College Sophomore,1,"Mighty struggle – Here is my inside scoop on CSU that you will not hear from its officials! 
The financial aid department will help you, after dozens of calls, 5 or 6 voice-mail messages to your financial counselor. They will definitely speak with you if you go to the Campus and speak with them after waiting for upwards of 20-30 minutes. However, while trying to work with them over the summer you will have a battle ahead of you while you struggle towards getting your financials together for the academic semester.
If you have an issue dealing with stress do not attend CSU unless you know you never have to speak with financial aid, they will literally make you cry from the stress they put upon you. "
College Junior,1,"Not That Great – The availability of snacks is great when you get hungry between classes.  However, the dinning area's food is not great and they only offer two alternative places to get a meal."
College Freshman,1,"AVOID CSU – I literally hated CSU. There was nothing to do on campus. If you don't have a car, then you a stuck in your apartment all week/end long. The teachers are OK! They can be helpful. The other staff are rude. They don't really care about you. There is limited work study. The Dorms are a joke. The RA'S are rude. There NO GREEK life. The don't even have a football team.  CSU is not for people looking to party and have super fun. I would not recommend anyone attend this school...NOT EVEN DOGS!"
College Freshman,1,"Stay at Home – There is no Nightlife at CSU. The have a Few house parties, and like a club or two. Most clubs are 21 and older. You CAN'T have parties in the dorm. You can only have 2 people per resident. So since you have 4 roommates yall can only have 8 people in the apartment or you will get written up."
College Freshman,1,"The food in the Cafe is horrible. You really have to catch them on a good day. The servers are really nice. You would probably rather eat downtown. They have more of a restaurant fill to it. Chic-fil-a is high, but good. Burger studio is really good. The store crap is really high. They sale pudding cups for 3 dollars. That is ridiculous. They are all about money."
College Freshman,1,"The Dorms At Columbus State are ridiculous. The Court yard 1 are so old...The room are really small. The walls are paper then. The staff are really rude. The Courtyard 1 North are nice,and you get your own bathroom. I would recommend staying off campus. Listen to me and AVOID columbus state at all cost"
College Freshman,1,"I can honestly say the greek life at Columbus State is sucks!!! I would not recommend coming to and greek events. The only greeks they have are whites, and the black Alphas. "
College Senior,1,Falling Down on the Job – I was molested by a guy who was let into my dorm room while I was sleeping and was told by the university cops it wasn't worth it to press charges. Never trusting them again.
College Freshman,1,"Not Diverse. Although Columbus is known as a caucasion town, I see mostly African- Americans at school sponsored function. Our students do not mix with other ethnic groups, which is very bad. I'd like to have a wide variety of friends, but the students make it very hard."
College Junior,1,The staff that works in the financial aid office are not very good with answering questions.  Calling the office is not a good thing to do because they have you on hold for a very long time.  The staff is not good with telling transfer students how their financial aid is going to work and are very slow at processing important papers and information.
College Junior,1,"The cafeteria hours and the food options are horrible. The food could be good, but they don't put much effort into it. Its good sometimes - like maybe the first two weeks of school - and at random times throughout the semester. I walk into my schools cafeteria expecting to go home without a full stomach, or a stomach full or random nonsense. I'm mad that I pay so much money for a meal plan, and it turns out to be such a waste."
College Freshman,1,If there wasn't a Greek center on campus I would not even be aware that my school has Greek life.

Niche User,5,"Naw, dawg. My bruddah goes there, and it is nothing that these one-star reviews said. They never had the guts to stick out their years here, and my brother says it is truly splendid. The sports kinda suck, but the party scene is lit. 6/5 stars."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Bethany College and so far my career here has been wonderful. I love the dorms, the people, the atmosphere. It's all amazing. The small class sizes are perfect for me because it feels like you really get the one-on-one connection with your professors and you're not just some number in the classroom."
Alum,5,"A gem of a small 4-year liberal arts schools tucked into the rolling foothills of the Allegheny Mountains, Bethany was a fantastic choice for a shy, uncertain high school senior who needed to be removed from his comfort zone. The close friends I made here are still among my best friends. The education has served me well, too. And while my two children chose to attend college elsewhere, they, too, enjoy our occasional visits to the Northern Panhandle."
Alum,5,"Those of us who went to Bethany in the early 1980's found a beautiful campus, dedicated teachers, a wealth of extra curricular activities, and lifelong friends. Most of my friends became teachers, journalists, TV producers, lawyers, paralegals, business owners and marketing professionals. I loved my time at Bethany. I participated in theater, the school newspaper, the tv station, the radio station and field hockey. To be able to try one's hand at so many different activities helped me narrow down how I wanted to spend my life. I have a J.D. and an M.Ed. degree, and I felt well equipped to handle graduate school. I continue to be a lifelong learner, and have worked as a legal journalist, filmmaker, lawyer, and teacher over the years. Bethany will always be dear to my heart."
Senior,5,Bethany is an amazing place to grow and learn as a person. The faculty & staff are the most caring people. The student involvement is great. I hope to see more students attending Bethany soon. I am forever thankful for Bethany and hope to give back one day! Thank you for concidering me!
Alum,5,"Alumni networking is huge.   After I was hired for my first local job, I learned that the HR directors son was an alumni.  She raved over the Bethany education and it's reputation. One should never under estimate the power of networking.  Bethany is a small community situated in the gorgeous mountains of WV.  It offers a beautiful landscape for mountain bike riding and hiking.  There are creeks, trails, farms and fields. Old Mains historic architecture is stunning.   I lived in Phillips Hall for 3 years.  It is a gorgeous gothic residence hall with double and single room occupancy.   Bethany also boasts more modern living in the Campbell Village suites.  Greek housing is also offered beyond freshman year.  The professors are very caring and well versed in their field.  They are accessible and they want you to succeed.   You are not just a number in small Bethany classroom.   I would be honored if any of my children were accepted as Legacies."
Junior,5,"The beauty is second to none. From the green trees that stretch to the rolling hills all summer long to the snow that makes the college look like it's something out of hogwarts. This college is ideal for people who prefer to have a close relationship with both the student body and the professors. Plenty of opportunity is presented for the students to be involved during the school year along with priming the seniors who will graduate jobs and connections for careers. The convenience of a 10 min walk max to whatever you need on campus is great! If you are an introvert who prefers to spend long intimate nights with Netflix, you can do that here. I would highly not recommend it because the thing about this college is that we are family here, you'll be surrounded by quality friends whom you can create the best of memories with if you choose to be involved with them. This is a college that is very accepting of people from all different walks of life."
College Junior,5,Sports comm is my passion. Talking on ESPN will be great
College Sophomore,5,I am in Greek life and it is a large part of Bethany college. Most of the campus is Greek. No one treats anyone differently is someone doesn't go Greek though. We have many Greek events on and off campus trying to promote awareness to our philanthropy. Each fraternity and sorority have their own locked houses that the members are free to live in. It is kept clean in the case we have guests.
College Sophomore,5,I'm not familiar with this.
College Sophomore,5,I love living in Cambell Village
College Sophomore,5,The athletic facilities are great.
College Sophomore,5,This was a great choice. I love it here.
College Senior,5,Great way for a social life
College Junior,5,I wouldn't change where I am for anything. Bethany is a great college and I love it here.
College Freshman,5,"The answer ""painfully remote"" kind of upsets me. I came to this school to get away from towns and civilization so it's the best decision Iv ever made. Being out in the middle of no where is a good thing personally."
College Freshman,5,We are all adults now and know the rules. Bethany College is very good about alot of things as long as your not doing something that could hurt others then your okay.
College Freshman,5,They do their best to keep you on campus in as little debt as possible.
College Freshman,5,It is well worth living their because it is 12 miles from the nearest city.
College Freshman,5,A small college in the middle of know where perfect for being outside without the rush of a city
Junior,4,Bethany is a lovely community. It is built on it's community and willingness to work together.i love bethany and I made a great choice going there!
Junior,4,Bethany College is a small liberal arts school in West Virginia. The small community and small class sizes gives you the opportunity to feel at home while away at school. It gives you the opportunity to easily grow in leadership positions and become closer with your professors as you continue through your major.
Freshman,4,"Great people, great professors, and great dorms. Everyone who works there cares about you, from the President to the Cafe workers."
Junior,4,"If you like Hogwarts, this may be the school for you! It's a beautiful historic campus that offers amazingly small class sizes for a more personal education system. Along with a great educational system, there's a large assortment of activities to keep students entertained, seeing as the campus is sort of isolated. There's Greek Life (Sororities: Alpha Xi Delta, Phi Mu, Zeta Tau Alpha, Fraternaties: Phi Kappa Tau, Delta Tau Delta, Beta Theta Pi, Alpha Sigma Phi) Intramural sports, and amazing events run by the Student Activities Council, which also organizes trips to places like New York, Niagra Falls, and Ireland."
Sophomore,4,Bethany college is a small peaceful rural area. The college has great professors who are very helpful and cares about their students. The college has barley anything around it but overall its a pretty good school.
Freshman,4,"Great school with great people. Being a small school Bethany offers a small classroom size and professors who know students by name. The campus is small, and everything is easily accessible. Many classes are offered."
Freshman,4,I love being here at Bethany College. It is very beautiful. I see deer on the campus just about everyday. So far I love all my professors. The class sizes are small so I get a lot of attention. One class has eight students another has twelve. The food is good at the cafeteria. Boomers Grill is a fantastic late night option too.
College Junior,4,Professors are great they communicate with us.
College Junior,4,"My school is really good, in the middle of now where so I can't get in trouble."
College Sophomore,4,I love the professors here. They all mostly try to help as much as they can. The courses have great quality. There are many courses with wide varieties. The class sizes are mostly smaller. Some classes have rowdy students which could make the class fun. Other classes have more strict teachers which changes the environment.
College Sophomore,4,"There is always someone on campus that can help find you an internship. On campus, there is always a way to find a job."
College Sophomore,4,"It depends on which living space you are in. Cambell Village is the best place to be, but it is so far from where most classes are."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many things to love about Bethany. At the same time, if you want to find negative things, it isn't hard. I personally love this school and believe it is where I am supposed to be. Because it is a private school, it is more expensive, but I love the professors here along with the activities and the students."
College Freshman,4,I personally think that my school is great. I love all of my teachers and I believe that they genuinely care about how well their students preform outside the classroom. Many if not all of my professors will offer office time to any student in need and they are very helpful when someone need assistance. Overall if I had to do it all over again I would choose Bethany every time.
College Junior,4,The school is beautiful but I wish the dining services were better.
College Sophomore,4,"With Bethany being such a unique school, I believe it is up to the student to make the most of the experience. I think Bethany is definitely not the school for everyone, however each student can find their own way to maximize their experience at this school. Teachers are willing to work with student to reach optimum success, the school itself is BEAUTIFUL, the dorms are exceptional compared to other schools (especially CV, but I have also lived in phillips and have spent time in all the other dorms to know they are all good), there are decent sports programs to participate in that don't take away from school too much, and if you find a good group of friends, I can guarentee a good experience at this school. The school undoubtedly has a number of flaws, but you are getting such a unique and different experience coming to this school and if you come at it with a positive attitude, you learn to really appreciate what Bethany has to offer and have a great and worthwhile experience here."
College Sophomore,4,"As a student at Bethany, I've matured more then I could have thought possible. I have made many new friends and many people highschool me would have never said two words to. My roomates/ teammates have become like sisters. I opened up my horizens, I have taken classes I would never taken and enjoyed every minute, I joined a soroity and love the envolment we have on campus. It has been an overall great experience."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is amazing here. I plan to join in the spring. They do not haze and they do alot on campus!
College Junior,4,Most of the campus participate in greek life.
College Junior,4,My school is one of the only schools that have comprehensive exams which make us very unique.
College Sophomore,4,We have comps. Enough said.
College Freshman,4,It is a very lively campus because of the size of the school. So very often can you go places and see other people. 
College Freshman,4,The story behind this school is that it is a good overall school. It's just learning how to deal with being so far from everything. But because of the people here I would definitely choose to come back. 
College Freshman,4,"our campus has a conveniently located wellness center where all students are able to go if they feel ill. Security is always out driving around, especially at night. "
College Freshman,4,It's pretty average. There are parties every week and a bar with walking distance of the dorms. 
College Freshman,4,"Our campus is very small, and I would say around half the students are Greek. The dues are very reasonable compared to most schools. If you don't join, everyone treats you the same, but joining really helps you get more involved on campus and in the community."
College Senior,4,Being that Bethany is a liberal arts college the curriculum can be extremely tasking when enrolled in classes that are unrelated to your field of study
College Senior,4,"The CMA department assists students with internships, post grad opportunities and a number of resume building opportunities on campus as well.  The professors are very passionate and always willing to help any student at any time."
College Senior,4,"Experience is what you make it, although life at Bethany College isn't always ideal.  It has been some of the best years of my life.  It's easy to make close friends because it is a small campus and there isn't much to do other than enjoy the company of others.  "
College Junior,4,"Though I would like to see the number of computers in the library increase (we currently have nine), Bethany has several computer labs equipped with printers in the Richardson building. Students in the computer labs have been known to get rowdy at times making it far more convenient to have a personal computer and printer but students can certainly survive without one."
College Freshman,4,"It is easy in getting into your major, just have to make sure you have all the right courses."
College Junior,4,So far I've had a very positive academic experience  with BC there have been some minor bumps here and there mainly with registration most professors are helpful and very informative of their subject matters although you will encounter some professors who to put it nicely aren't very good at explaining things and will not work with you. Study abroad is an option if your interested in it. Lastly if you have some kind if learning disability the McCann Learning Center will help you get your accommodation set up however they can sometimes be a pain to deal with.
College Junior,4,"Drugs are around on campus however it's very easy to avoid.  It is  pretty common to smell weed though especially in the later night hours as far as the hard drugs those are even easier to avoid, However be warned if you don't like being around alcohol BC might not be for you. BC is a drinking school. There are some students who don't drink. the popular hang out in Bethany is the bar Bubbas"
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is a huge part of student life on campus.  They are always doing something to help better the school and raise money for fundraisers and charities. Each house is nice and welcoming to everyone including non-Greeks.
College Sophomore,4,"Just Picked a Major – Programs are fairly easy to get into, no real struggle for myself. I just became a Managerial Economics major after being Undecided for my freshman year. All I have to do is fill out a little paper work and change advisers and I am in the program of my choosing."
College Sophomore,4,"My Cup of Tea – Bethany College is what I like to call a required taste. Quite a few people transfer out because it simply is not for them. Personally I enjoy my time in Bethany because it is very pretty and very relaxed. Facilities are not the best, my best example is the weight room is lacking but there are two gyms. The professors I have had have all been excellent. Lastly there are a few southern Belles that choose this school making life good."
College Sophomore,4,The parking on campus does not directly effect me because of the fact that I do not have a car on campus. However my girlfriend is from the state and does have a car on campus. I have never heard her complain about parking because there is plenty of spots to park and she follows all the parking rules.
College Sophomore,4,Amazing (Just a Couple Bad Apples) – The majority of the professors here are great. They utilize they small size of the classes to the advantage of the students. They are usually excited to see students during office hours and most give out their personal phone numbers to students in case they have questions about an assignment.
College Freshman,4,"Free Printing and Decent Wifi – One of the best things at Bethany College is the free, unlimited printing. It's very convenient and the labs are open until midnight. Also, the wifi connections in the dorm halls is usually pretty good and there usually aren't many problems"
College Sophomore,4,Our Diverse Campus – Over the years BethanY College has become more diverse. At first it was mostly on white students at this campus. Over the years more and more different races have come to the campus and learned alot about the different things about the campus. I would say now the campus is almost equal.
Alum,2,"A beautiful campus with small class sizes. There isn't much of a social scene here beyond Greek life. Dry campus with no bars and no shopping. Once on the mountain, you're there. Mostly quiet, not great living conditions. Educational programs are OK but not the best. Some great professors, some terrible ones. New leadership at the school since I've been there seems to be bettering the place slowly."
Niche User,2,"I went here for my first year of college.  My best friend became the local bartender.  Classes were easy.  I was almost forced into choosing a major.  If you don't join Greek life, you're pretty much an outcast.  Everyone joins.  The campus itself is beautiful but there is absolutely nothing to do except get trashed.  There are a bar and a very old (but charming) convenience store in town.  Nothing else.  It was certainly an experience but there was very little bang for your buck and I would not recommend it to a serious student."
College Senior,2,Barely enough lighting on campus to be safe walking around school at night also security is a joke
College Senior,2,School computers and library needs updated to 2016 because the Internet is absolutely terrible and computers are old
College Junior,2,"It is a very quiet town, just very small...and boring."
College Junior,2,"it is very unorganized, and it is very disappointing."
College Student,2,"So far in my time, Physics, Latin, and virtually ALL the language majors have been eliminated. Now, the theater is on the verge of dying off, and I know for a fact if you do transfer not only do the classes not include everything you need, but the credits transfer normally for WAY less than what they counted for here."
College Student,2,"The History department here is a joke. You have no required internship, if you want one, guess what ? You have to find it yourself. They also requite one year of a language which will mess you up when transferring to most other schools which require two years. Not to mention they have NO SPECIALIZATION in any type of history. You have two choices, general history, or history education."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless its a break or end of a term or a field trip, you better have a friend with a car or start walking."
College Sophomore,2,MIDDLE OF NO WHERE IN LITTLE WEST VIRGINIA!
College Sophomore,2,Its a 6 mile drive for fast food. 30 minutes for a normal place. It sucks.
College Sophomore,2,95% are drunks and 85% are stoned 65% of the day.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is 6  miles from the closest town, unless you live in Bethany, WV you have really no choice but to live on campus."
College Junior,2,"Most students make everyday a sweatpants and hoddie type of day, though some dress very formally. With Bethany only having around 800 students there isn't a lot of variety when it comes to looking for a significant other. The social life doesn't really help either because, besides class, the only way to really meet someone is at a party or the local bar."
College Junior,2,"The general academic atmosphere is low at Bethany. Many of the students and professors show a rather blatant lack of appreciation and motivation for learning, though there are some great people out there who are just the opposite. There is far too much emphasis on sports, especially since we are division three, and it really takes away from the whole idea of becoming well educated individuals. If I had known this before choosing to attend, I never would have selected Bethany."
College Junior,2,"Bethany is quite literally in the middle of nowhere. The town of Bethany has only 400 people in it and one store and bar. If you want to go shopping or out to eat you will have to drive about 30 minutes away to the Highlands (a shopping center with a Walmart, Cabellas, and a few other stores and restaurants). This lack of civilization and activities means that the night life pretty much consists of alcohol-filled parties and little else."
College Junior,2,"The college claims that they are keeping the facilities in their original conditions to preserve the history of the school, but that means that all of the classrooms and many of the dorms lack any form of climate control such as air conditioning. Expect it to be cold in the winter and blistering in the spring/summer. As a biology major we usually find ourselves short on the necessary technology, though the microscopes that we have are of good quality. The chemistry department is currently receiving several upgrades seeing as the fire marshal came through and discovered that only 30% of our emergency shower heads (used for fire and chemical burns) were up to par. All in all there is major room for improvement."
College Sophomore,2,Food is good but the hours suck. only open for a few hours a day and if its a day they have recruits in then they always cook something good any other day its like high school food.
College Sophomore,2,one bar and small gatherings rather than parties
College Freshman,2,The wifi is probably one of the worst things about this school. Much of the assignments here are turned in electronically and it is a struggles sometimes when it comes to trying to turn something in on time simply because the network is not working. 
College Freshman,2,"The main problem when it comes to eating here one campus is that there is only three places to eat. The beanery which is a quick coffee shop/sandwich shop that closes at 4 everyday. Then comes the Cafeteria that is a buffet style service but it closes at 7:30 which is pretty early. Lastly, we have Boomers, which is a quick burger shop that is open 4-midnight almost everyday. "
College Senior,2,"There are students from very, very well off families and students from the other end of the spectrum.  Not much diversity in the aspects of ethnicities."
College Senior,2,"The security on campus usually doesn't bother anyone, they are always helpful if you need something."
College Senior,2,Average college students drinking habits -- no evident drug usage on campus.
College Senior,2,"Bethany is very remote, I repeat very remote."
College Senior,2,I would compare the general population to the Breakfast Club -- very cliquey but diverse nonetheless 
College Senior,2,Only one bar on campus -- if you have a good group of friends at college here you can have a fun time.
College Junior,2,"Parking has proven to be a bit of a problem on Bethany campus. Though the process of buying a parking sticker is rather easy they are quite expensive. Also convenient student parking spots are limited and security is all to eager to hand out hefty parking tickets (usually $250 for a minor parking violation). If don't have needs to frequently get off of campus, you may want to consider leaving your car at home."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not alot of options close to the school. There is only one place within walking distance, which is a bar. Food is good but mostly fried options. I have to travel into Wellsburg where there are several fast-food options that are average and one Pub that is our favorite."
College Freshman,2,Dining hall food isn't always good.  No places close by except for a convenience store that does have good sandwiches.
College Freshman,2,It snows and is cold.  I live at the farthest dorms but it isn't too bad getting to class.
College Junior,2,"Computers at BC are well to put it nicely are needing upgraded in a bad way. The majority of computers on campus are at least 4-5 years old and very slow. They do however get the job done if you just need to type a paper up. Be warned also if you don't have your own computer do not expect there to be one open in the library. The library has around 8 computers tops. Your best bet is in Richardson which is right beside the library wireless inherent is available in most building around campus but the speed of the internet will not wow anyone. Lastly they recently (this year) made us start paying for printing it was free up till this year they give you $10 to print, each sheet you print is one cent if you use of your $10 which equals out to be 1000 sheets you have to be out of pocket for each additional sheet"
College Sophomore,2,The night life at Bethany is not bad nor excellent. The most popular place to hang out is at the bar a little bit off campus. All students are allowed in and all students are carded. It can be a good time depending on how many people show up. There is also things to do with your friends that do not require smelling like smoke and alcohol. Like movie nights or taking night walks and star watching.
College Sophomore,2,"Well seeing as the town of Bethnay is across the road from the campus, whic has a higher population and is much larger than the town. The only bar is Bubbas whic is across the campus and it alows for any Bethany student, regardless of age to take part in their drinks. The weekends are dull for independent students, everyone leaves and the only people who stay are the greek members who throw their own small weekend parties that are more casuall drink socialaztion than raging parties. All in all their is no self sutaing nightlife at Bethany college, you just have to find ways to entertain yourself, which isn't that bad."
College Sophomore,2,"Registration Finaly Worked on My Third Try – My biggest complaint if any about the school is the class registration. First and formost it's all done online, and this would work great, if the colloges internet worked, it always finds a way of crashing during registration week. Registration really got anyoing wwas that for my first three self registration during my first year and the semester following, was that the website would not let me regestir due to the fact that the registra office messed up my files and because of this i was unable to not get my full class load I wanted. I just wish they also had a physical paper option to regestir so that you had a back up plan for regestration frustation/."
College Freshman,2,"Bethany College, Wv is very secluded.  It is about a half hour from any decent restaurant, therefore, off-campus dining is very inconvenient."
College Sophomore,2,Hard Work in Finacial Aid – This is the one down fall about Bethany College. They are not very organized in the finacial aid. They are alittle messy and not the best. I Like the staff who work there. I just wish they were more on top of things
College Sophomore,2,drug can be accessed easily because it is the middle of now where.
College Sophomore,2,"Process Was ""Ok&quot – I went in for aid at Bethany College and they told me to take out a loan, work, get on a payment plan, or apply for scholarships.  The workers there are fairly friendly and try to help but based on the strict rules here at Bethany College they cant help much."
College Sophomore,2,"Sports Need Improvement – Varsity Sports at Bethany College lack fan support, team performance, school spirit and atheltic facilities.  IM sports are pretty important here at Bethany but could use work."
Sophomore,1,"If you want to pay a lot of money for a name rather than an education, maybe this school is for you,. All the reviews talk about networking and Fraternities/Sororities. Unfortunately, that is what Bethany College focuses on, not education. Almost all of the <1,000 students are apart of Greek Life. It's all about ""who you know"" and the name ""Bethany College"" which still carries some distinction, despite the education being sub-par to other local schools. When I attempted to transfer, the Bethany College Admissions office withheld my transcripts and would not send them to my new college despite multiple calls and emails. I eventually transferred out and I do not regret my decision to leave as I received a wonderful education at my new school. I now work for the federal government based on my MERIT and not because of someone I knew in a sorority."
College Freshman,1,I have to drive 30 minuets to get food off campus so it's not an option.
College Junior,1,CV should've been there only temporary..it is a safety hazard.
College Junior,1,"I live 6 miles into the woods, it is not convenient at all. The food on campus is the WORST."
College Student,1,Greek Hill is exactly like it is in the movies. People are drunken idiots there.
College Student,1,"You have on option, Chambers who despite being nice people, their stuff is WAY OVERPRICED."
College Student,1,"despite our teams sucking year after year, they school continues to pump money into them. However, the arts is dying. Sports here is basically a religion. Don't get any ideas though because not only do we suck, were a D3 school."
College Student,1,"There are two labs on campus with about 30 computers each. Not to mention THEY SCHEDULE CLASSES IN THEM ! So basically until about 5pm each day you can't use them because, if you walk in during a class, you get yelled at. There are about 10 computers in the library but good luck finding one free during any part of the day. On top of this, you have to pay to print papers now."
College Student,1,"I'm getting of here, there is no way in heck I would ever live here if I did end up graduating from here."
College Student,1,Their one of the 55 schools being investigated by the White House and Department of Education for how they handled rape cases. That should tell you everything about how safe it is there.
College Student,1,"Financial aid here has screwed me several times, in fact to the point I of me having to almost drop out of college because I mysteriously owed thousands of dollars. This has also happened every time I looked at transferring."
College Student,1,"Most people the school says are alumni, didn't even graduate from here.  Once you attend for two years, your alumni if you leave. I know people that have transferred that were called two weeks later by the alumni center for donations lol."
College Student,1,"First, you HAVE TO live on campus if your under 25, second, there are NO housing opportunities here. Not to mention with no job opportunities without a car, your stuck in dilapidated and unsafe dorms."
College Student,1,"Drugs here common, I've heard people talk about doing most drugs out there, the school doesn't seem to care. If you get caught you can write a paper, or pay a fine. Ooh boy."
College Student,1,"if you don't have a car you better make friends with someone who is. The school offers NO TRANSPORTATION. Not even on payday. Bethany has no bank, just a bar, a church and a ridiculously overpriced general store. Not to mention that everything is a good 30 minute drive away, I love the location but this is so inconvenient I am leaving."
College Student,1,"Most of the housing here is in absolutely terrible condition. Some dorms have black mold growing int he basement while others, such as Campbell Village have been called by the Fire Department as kindling because of how poorly they are constructed."
College Student,1,Diversity here is horrible. I can't tell you how much stuff I have caught for both being an older student and non christian. It's to the point I'm considering leaving.
College Student,1,"It's the worst. Not because they are so strict, honestly it's quite the opposite, they are so lenient it's almost as if they don't care."
College Junior,1,"With the exception of the town store, which only serves breakfast sandwiches, there is no local off-campus dining. The closest restaurants are a 30 minute drive away."
College Sophomore,1,"unless you want to live in the woods, theres really no off campus housing. "
College Sophomore,1,almost everyone drinks or smokes and the school protects them and  never gets in trouble
College Sophomore,1,the computers here are absolute crap. either they crash or take 30 min to load up. 
College Sophomore,1,finacial aid sucks. they nickle and dime you for every little thing and unless you know someone in a high place they will be complete assholes to you. talk to the president or work study boss to talk to fin aid for you because they never listen to students
College Sophomore,1,"There is none, its best and more affordable to live on campus."
College Freshman,1,Because of the location of the school it is around 20-30 minutes away from the closest town.
College Senior,1,"Only 5th year seniors are permitted to live off campus, there is very little selection to choose from."
College Senior,1,There are no transportation options at school other than buddy up with a friend who has a car.
College Senior,1,"In order to dine off campus it's a 20 minute drive and your options are fast food or pizza, 30 minute drive to Sheetz for a finer dining option. "
College Junior,1,"We are a division three college but you wouldn't know it by looking at the amount of money that we pour into sports. Since we are the lowest division sport tryouts are not very competitive and usually anyone who wants to play has the opportunity. A very prominent issue however, though there are certainly some exceptions, is that sport students tend to preform poorly in class because practices, games, and team workouts take up so much time. At the end of their first semester, many  students find themselves faced with the choice between academia and athletics, and $34,000 a year is  a lot of money to spend just to play on a division three team."
College Junior,1,"I have always considered myself to be a bit of a nerd because I love learning and I was really disappointed with my classes at Bethany. Though I was lucky to find a few great professors, many of them expressed a I-could-care-less-whether-you-learn-this-or-not attitude which was contagious with the students in the class. Comprehension of the material being taught was very low and professors were known to give massive curves on exams to make up for it. Don't get me wrong, it is great to get all A's in your classes, but I want to feel that I have earned those grades by learning the material. Instead feel like a diploma from Bethany proves that you sat through classes more than it proves that you became educated about your selected career path and that is not the reason that I came to college."
College Junior,1,"The financial aid process can be a big hassle. Bethany College got my address incorrect four times even after several emails and phone calls that I made to get the problem resolved. Getting work study was also a hassle but was obtainable. As for scholarships, they give out a great deal but they are generally targeting athletic students as apposed to academic students. After getting a 4.0 my first year and being involved in several clubs and activities my scholarships actually dropped $1,000 while my roommate who had a 2.5 but played a sport saw a major increase in her scholarship allotment."
College Junior,1,"There are very few night activities since Bethany is located in a small town with only one store and one bar it is easy to get bored. There are a few groups of students who have campfires out in the woods but generally, unless you are studying, the only night activities are heavy drinking at the local bar or on Greek hill."
College Junior,1,There is a bar right by campus which serves to anyone with a student ID despite your age. RAs are supposed to tell students to poor out any alcohol that they have in their rooms (because dorms are supposed to be drug and alcohol free) but few actually carry through. Security is very poor when it comes to drug use. I have reported a few people in my dorm who were currently using drugs to our campus security and when security arrived they told the students to merely throw the drugs in the public trashcan. No disciplinary action was taken against the students despite the student handbook rules and the students were later seen retrieving their disposed drug out of the trashcan.
College Freshman,1,Our security is so bored they FIND reasons to give tickets. Not enough spots to park where it is allowed so you do not get a ticket.
College Freshman,1,"it sucks so bad. Overly expensive school for its poor quality I think. You pay 34,000 for crappy food and sometimes lazy teachers. All of that money for a boring college in the middle of no where. Plus this school acts like they are broke half the time is BEYOND annoying, we are paying so much for little quality. It is a pretty campus yea but, the looks can only go so far. The town consists of a bar and two very small over priced store that is in a house at that. Town is twenty five minutes out so, if you do not have a car your screwed. Sports, well our football team sucks and this COLLEGE field is smaller than my high schools. By the way were a division three college but our athletes act like they are in a division one. Creepy Bethany West Virginia that is all I have to say more."
College Student,1,"Bethany College has cut out almost all the language majors, and other majors such as Physics and soon, evironmental science."
College Student,1,Almost everyone on campus is both american and white. The diversity here has really plummeted since 2000
College Student,1,"The wellness center on campus is an absolutel joke. Unless you need something small like aspirin or some over the counter medicine your better off going to the hospital. As far as security goes, this is the worst company I have ever seen. They do nothing for the students, and usually just ride around campus or sit around int he cafeteria. When they finally do show up, normally about an hour has passed. In fact since last semester they have had 5 accidents including t-boning a students car and then driving off."
College Student,1,"Drug safety at Bethany college is nearly non-existant I know personally that at any given time, depending on the dorm, you can smell marijuana smoke yet, nothing is done about it."
College Student,1,"I don't particpate in sports, however, for the most part, our teams minus a few are not very succesful."
College Student,1,"I would give the school an F when it comes to academics. This is due to several reasons. First, as an undergrad, I should not know more about the subject than the teachers who have earned Phd's in their respected fields. Secondly, I should not be taught incorrect facts. As a biology major having correct and accurate information is essential. Last, if the teacher does know what they are teaching, you are expected to be on thier level half the time."
College Student,1,"The food is absolutely disgusting, I have had food poisoning twice, and despite hanging signs that they will be flexible with people's dietery needs, they are definetly not."
College Student,1,"The computers on campus don't even work have the time, and their entirely too few on campus. the student to computer ratio is probably somewhere around 3-1."
College Student,1,"The academics at Bethany College are a joke. As a biology major, I continually have to correct my teachers and am I actually helping teach class on occassions. The problem is I'M NOT a proctor these are classes I am currently enrolled in as a undergrad."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only two places open for dining, both of which serve similar food and are closed for several hours a day making obtaining food in between classes quite difficult. The cafeteria has been reported to Health Services many a time for fruit fly infestations and cold/under-cooked meats which have cause a few cases of food poisoning."
College Sophomore,1,"The facilities are kept in a ""traditional"" style meaning that many of the building lack air conditioning making hot days unbearable. Many classrooms are lacking the appropriate amount of desks and seats and class technology (microscopes, projectors, TVs, etc.). The library has only nine computers for student use meaning that it is a constant struggle to access and print assignments without a personal computer. Dorms tend to have broken or missing lights and furniture making comfortable living a luxury. There is definitely a large amount of room for improvement."
College Sophomore,1,Off-campus housing is limited and usually not worth the price. Most students live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Bethany College feels more like high school than college. The academic challenges are hard to come by and , though helpful, the professors seem to be rather clueless in their fields. Bethany graduates usually find it difficult to obtain a job that is not minimum wage seeing as the classes do not prepare them for their field of choice. The college is also very driven towards sports, which is not typical of a division three school. The part of this college that I find the most troubling is that, as a 4.0 GPA student, I am losing scholarship money while student who have a 2.0 GPA but play sports obtain large sums of ""academic"" scholarships. All in all I would not recommend this college to prospective students."
College Freshman,1,They are strict but people sometimes get away with it
College Junior,1,"I am not going to lie parking at BC SUCKS! There are very few lots on campus and the lots they do have are small and fill up quickly. All freshman most park in the coal bowl or freshman lot though. Depending on where you live parking can be a pain. If you live at CV and are trying to fine a parking spot on CV hill past 7:30 or 8 forget about it your not going to fine a spot and your going to have to walk. Lastly campus isn't exactly real walk-able  sometimes you'll have class in Hurl which is the last building on campus and it's a very very far walk from CV. If you have class in Hurl then have a class in the field house odds are your going to be late for that class unless you drive. In other word you really need a car campus because A the isolation of Bethany will kill you and B, the long walks to and from class will get old especially when it's snowing"
College Junior,1,I am in a bad situation right now I recently transferred to BC. They didn't tell me they were dropping my major (social studies education) so essentially I am major less right now and I have put in too many history classes not to major in the subject so chances are I am going to have to transfer again.
College Junior,1,Financial aid at BC up till this year had been okay however they cut down on the amount of aid they are giving people and it's becoming increasingly harder to get institutional aid. it's not uncommon for people to have there entire work-study go directly to BC as you earn it. If I have any suggestions for people apply for as much outside scholarships/grants you can. BC is not a cheap school at around $35.000 a year
College Junior,1,There is no transportation at BC rarely like once a semester they might have a van take some people to Pittsburgh and at the end of the semester they will take students to the airport they do charge a fee for this but I'm not sure what it is
College Junior,1,Bethany is in a very isolated area of West Virginia options for off campus housing is limited and usually people who do live off campus live at least 10 or more miles away from campus there's nothing in the immediate area around the school.
College Junior,1,What off campus dining? The only restaurants  close to Bethany are 7-8 miles away in Wellsburg. You most have a vehicle to have access to any off campus dining. The only reason why this didn't get an F is Dominos in West Liberty will deliver so technically you do have access to one off campus dining option
College Sophomore,1,The computers at Bethany are old and slow. Continuously freezing and shutting off. Never type a paper on them without backing it up every 5 minutes. They are awful. The only good thing about them is that they are convenient.
College Sophomore,1,I have only pledged one house and know of one house's practices. I dropped out because the of hazing and being told to pick between my classes or the house.
College Senior,1,"You're on Your Own Kid!!! There are shuttles but only for those who need at beginning semester, spring break and end of semester. The do seem to be offering a few city trips, but what is needed is a shuttle for people to go to the nearby town for groceries or banking!"
College Freshman,1,"Don't Bother – The few buildings for rent in the town are inner-city slum rejects plopped down in West Virginia.  They're falling apart inside and out, and not worth the ridiculous price."
College Freshman,1,"Security Dept. is Not Good – Bethany College has poor lighting and poor response times.  Security turns a blind eye to partying and even some petty thefts.  If it itsn't easy for them, they won't do it. Even when you call, they won't always escort you back if it's late, and don't even bother reporting a crime if you don't already know who has done it. Bascially, all security is good for is opening your door when you get locked out."

Freshman,5,The workers in the enrollment office and the financial aide office or amazing and so nice. They answer any questions you have!
Sophomore,5,"The school is amazing and connects you to many opportunities including internships and study abroad. I have had amazing experiences there, and you meet so many people from different backgrounds."
Sophomore,5,"Cottey College is NOT for everyone! I say this in the best way possible. This is not your average party college, partially because the town of Nevada, MO is in practically the middle of nowhere, BUT the campus is a great place for someone who is looking to invest on their academics or wants the opportunity for great things. The professors are AMAZING and the campus is really good at helping you through mistakes, treating you like a person, and allowing you to learn from errors. There are a number of deep traditions and the college overall is a balanced mix of archaic history and modern liberal college. Especially for an all-women's college, they do their best to treat everyone and take care of them as if they were their own."
Freshman,5,"The campus is very small and connected. During the summer, it is not that hot. I like bread.

Niche User,5,"I have only been there once for a summer program, but I have already fallen in love. It feels like a safe campus and like everyone is there for you. Can't wait to start there in the fall of 2019!"
Alum,5,"Fantastic campus community and professors who really care about the students. The small student body means you get more attention from professors. The downside to the school size means there is not much of a party life and athletics are not really a big deal, but the education excellent."
Freshman,5,"Cottey is such an AMAZING school with such a fantastic faculty and a well-educated student body. I have been attending for a semester and a half and the welcoming and nurturing atmosphere has completely reinvigorated my love for my newly intended major, English. The connection the staff has to the students is unlike anything I have ever seen before and I find it to be extremely positive that the connections these students make here turn into lifelong friendships and a lifetime connection to the place where it all began, Cottey College. I couldn't imagine my life anywhere else."
Alum,5,"My time at Cottey changed my life. The professors put a lot into their jobs and care about their students as people. I got to make friends from all over the world and learn about my passions. You donâ€™t have to be in a major to take classes in the department, so I got to continue doing theatre while pursuing a dance degree. The international trip was a big plus, too. I will never stop bragging about my Alma Mater."
Junior,5,"Cottey has an excellent academic program and caring faculty and staff. However, sometimes things can get catty amongst the students, which, given it's a close knit community, shouldn't be much of a surprise."
College Freshman,5,All of the professors are determined that you should succeed in their classroom and the outside world. They are willing to make it work for you if are a good student.
College Freshman,5,"The alumni network is incredible, and so is the P.E.O. Sisterhood. Without them, Cottey would not be as special as it is. The support from these groups is beyond amazing; whenever they come to visit campus, they always let the students know that they are rooting for them."
College Freshman,5,"I love, love, love Cottey College. The small class sizes are amazing because my professors know exactly who I am. I don't just exist as a name to them. Also, the suite living is great too. I've met so many amazing people that I wouldn't have gotten to meet if I had gone to a big university. It's also nice to have a home away from home. Everyone here is extremely nice and helpful, so it isn't hard to find someone to assist you if you really need it."
College Senior,5,"Cottey College is an incredible institution that opens doors for young women everywhere. Cottey has inspired me to become a strong, independent woman who encourages other young women instead of tearing them down. I feel incredibly cared about and looked after here at Cottey."
College Junior,5,I take classes not actually needed for my degree but they are great for my bachelor's degree once I transfer. There is frustration because of the small class sizes they fill up quickly but it isn't too terrible. Transferring credits is really easy.
College Junior,5,"I would definitely choose Cottey again if I had the chance. It's a very fun, small school and you have lots of opportunities for advancement after you finish whether it be after two or four years. My favorite experiences are the traditions and our B.I.L. Hill night. The food is unlike any other and you honestly couldn't ask for better."
College Junior,5,"Financial aid is very generous. I agree with all of the other reviews. I would like to add that the P.E.O.s send a lot of care packages to suites and individual students. These care packages can include anything from gift cards to food to hand-knit scarves, and they can really help to make life easier for students with more financial need."
College Sophomore,5,They have gotten new equipment for the athletic center. The library is always trying to add new books and is happy to try to add the books that students ask for.
College Sophomore,5,I have had a great time getting to know the other students and all of the teachers that I have had are happy to help and get to know the students.
College Sophomore,5,"The fact that it is such a small school helps the student to form friendships with not only other students but also the teachers. It is easy to get to know everyone on campus and to get around. The girls their are extremely friendly and ""suite life"" is a lot of fun and makes it easy to make friends as well as gives new students a chance to ask older students advice about classes and various traditions."
College Senior,5,"Cottey's campus is stunning, to put it simply; pictures cannot capture its beauty. There is a state-of-the-art work out facility full of new and easy-to-use machines, there is a pool for both the aquatic classes as well as recreational swimming, there is a large gym for sports and PE classes, there are two dance studios, and there are even school bicycles for the cycling class students who don't have one. There are computer labs, along with free printing of school-related papers, in every hall, as well as there being two in the main building for classes and one in the library. There is also free student wi-fi in all buildings on campus for students with laptops. Sometimes the internet can be slow because of all the students accessing it, but it's not so bad that you can't accomplish anything."
Junior,4,"Cottey is a great school and it's very unique, but sometimes they really mess up important things. They have a bunch of really weird, odd requirements for their bachelor majors. It's great to be special and all, but Chaucer and Whitman are still authors a graduating Literature major should know. Their associates degrees are great and the community in general is very fun to be in. However, I would not recommend staying for a Bachelor degree until they have time to figure some stuff out."
Junior,4,"Everyone at Cottey is so supportive and invested in the sudents. The college is recently going through a lot of changes (they used to be a two year school, but have recently been adding a lot of four year programs). These changes have not always been for the best, and some of them really need to be looked into more thoroughly."
Junior,4,I really like Cottey because it is such an unique collage. Students and professors knows each other well and are able to communicate anytime because of how small the school is. It is also such a diverse school and it allows me to meet students from all over the world.
Sophomore,4,"Cottey College is great place to focus on academics and plan the pathway for your future. A college for women can have certain stigmas, however Cottey shuts down all negative misconceptions. Being at Cottey I have learned more about myself that I wish I could share with all women."
Alum,4,I have had a great experience at this college and the opportunities that it has given me. The diversity of the school as well as the athletic program has help me to grow as a person.
College Junior,4,"They put a lot of emphasis on preparing students for their careers at Cottey. There are plenty of classes, lectures, and other activities aimed towards students looking for career advice."
College Freshman,4,"While many of the classes are small, there are few general classes, such as freshman writing courses that tend to have a little more than average. However, I have never had more than 18 people in class. The professors here are incredibly. As long as you are a dependable and responsible student, they are more than willing to work with you."
College Senior,4,Alumna and PEO networks are both very helpful and widely accessible. Our career center often focuses on certain types of careers/jobs but there are always opportunities and there is always help for more specified careers/fields when one asks.
College Senior,4,"Although Cottey does not carry my degree, I am still able to get experience by working in their Career Closet, doing costuming for the dance company, and networking with other women in my field of study. Every girl can benefit from an education here!"
College Junior,4,"As a freshman, the first semester was a learning experience and I had to get used to the new teaching style in college. However, the classes are interesting and I had no issues learning from the professors."
College Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere here at Cottey. Everyone is very friendly and the teachers are understanding and willing to help you if you need it. The food is great and the traditions are unique and fun. It's a great school! The only thing I dislike somewhat is that it's a smaller school in a smaller town, but I knew that when I chose to come here. The good far outweighs the bad in my opinion!"
College Junior,4,Job/internship prospects are really good. Many employers hire Cottey students because they know that we have had a quality education. The alumnae network is amazing. They send all students care packages (depending on the state) and we have several events during the year that the alumnae are encouraged to come to as well as coming whenever they choose to. The recruiting isn't' the best but it is pretty good. The career center is great. They help you with every aspect of trying to get a job.
College Junior,4,"Not all of the professors are great, but that's what student reviews are for. The courses however, are great and you do learn quite a bit. There are classes offered in many subject areas, they're small, and mostly structured the same but they can be diverse."
College Junior,4,Sure there are some professors that don't teach very well but you quickly figure out who doesn't and can easily get into another class of the same subject. I'm an art major so I have to do at least 8 art classes. I've done sculpture so far and it was a fun and challenging class. You're expected to put in studio hours outside of class and that can be difficult coupled with hours that you may have to spend on other subjects but it's manageable. The curriculum and facilities are great. There are many job opportunities for art majors and it's a great way to get to know others.
College Sophomore,4,"A small all women's college with great leadership opportunities. I have grown academically, professionally and physically in this school. I have built friendships that will eventually become a sisterhood. The challenges in this school have shaped me into the woman i want to become and i am so proud of myself. I can't wait to explore what is out there for me. This school is the best thing that happened to me and the best place to start my education."
College Junior,4,"My classes are small, so I am learning more."
College Sophomore,4,Cottey prepares you for our increasingly global world by allowing you to have a safe environment with a variety of cultures. Cottey also has traditions that are fun and create a strong sense of community while still stressing the importance of academics.
College Senior,4,"For being such a small school, they provide great resources for the students.  They have a gym, a pool, tennis courts and many campus activities for the students. Almost every week, their is a campus event, be that a speaker, movie, or entertainment group."
College Junior,4,"The fitness center is really nice. It has treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, weight lifting equipment, TVs, medicine balls, resistance bands, and more. Always kept clean."
College Junior,4,"Alumni's have a tendency to stay in close connection with the school and have been great in the recruiting process for current and future students. From the very beginning I had a very helpful, kind, and encouraging admissions representative."
College Junior,4,Right now I am working toward my AA and then I will transfer to most likely major in Fashion Communication. Workload can be heavy but it's manageable as long as you prioritize and organize your time. There are many options available for assistance outside of class including free tutoring. Internships can be arranged easily both on campus and in the community as well as with job opportunities.
College Junior,4,Almost every professor on campus as his or her Ph.D. All of my professors so far have been very helpful and do excellent work in their field so I feel as though I'm learning from a good source. Registration processes are easy and I have a much better chance of getting into classes I need and want compared to many other bigger universities.
College Junior,4,"Cottey College is a two or a four year institution, with that being said, the school is very well versed in helping students transfer to continue their education and reach for other four year degrees not yet offered here."
College Junior,4,"Cottey's student body is incredible. We have many different young women from different backgrounds, states, and even countries. While interacting with the student body I feel comfortable and happy; Cottey College is a very accepting environment and one that values each young woman in her own way."
College Junior,4,"The registrar's office was very helpful and accepting of the college credits I had transferring in from high school. While class flexibility does occur, it does not mean that our professors don't hold us up to a fairly high standard. At Cottey College, they really work with you well and try their very best to benefit you."
College Junior,4,"Cottey College is a very friendly and open place to be. While many professors will challenge you to do your very best, they are still very helpful in your overall outcome as a student. Academic centers, the campus library, and campus activities are often updated and the college does a great job in listening to our needs and interests."
College Junior,4,Cottey College is owned by a women's group known as P.E.O. P.E.O chapters play a huge role in the financial aid and received and have helped tremendously in my scholarship dollars. Cottey College does a lot for it's students and helps find every dollar possible for each individual girl.
College Junior,4,I love most of my professors and they are really helpful. I don't really like my academic advisor. he talked me into taking 17 credit hours and it was just to much so I had to drop a class and now have a W on my transcript.
College Junior,4,Their are lots of resources for students all over campus.
College Sophomore,4,I feel like I am getting a great education. At times the financial aid process can be frustrating and it is difficult at points when first coming to Cottey to find out how much money you are receiving in financial aid. They do try to give the students as much money as possible though.
College Sophomore,4,"We have a wide diversity of students. We have several that have come from different countries. The student body have a variety of belief systems, political view, religions, and economic levels. Most of the students are very open and are happy to learn about other peoples' point of view."
College Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers are quite understanding about the students schedule. If you have a campus job they will schedule the times you work around your classes.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy my specific major. All of the facility know me by name and are happy to help me with any questions that I have or just talk. The biggest issue that I have is the limited number of facility who specialize in my major but the college is working to remedy that.
College Junior,4,there is one computer for every 9 students and during classes each student can have their own computer. The network reliability is great with good speed and easily accessible anywhere on campus. personal computer is convenient but not necessary.
College Junior,4,it has been a great experience. Stuff and faculty are caring and teachers work hard to ensure that needs of each student are attended.
College Junior,4,"the tuition is very expensive but with the help of financial aid, it is more affordable. Ability to prove financial need helpe me get a good scholarship to attend college."
College Junior,4,"small school, with a lot of great faculty. Full educational exerience, and being a women's college, we learn to empower each other through workshops and leadership opportunities. The college is a two-year liberal, therefore i can not pursue engineering here."
College Freshman,4,Cottey has a lot of resources for the students to take advantage of.
College Freshman,4,Cottey College works with me to schedule my work and on-campus employment.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is friendly and I like it as an all girls' school for my first time living away from home.
College Freshman,4,Cottey College has a lot to offer as a small school.  The student to teacher ratio is amazing!
College Senior,4,"The career center is excellent they can help a person find an internship, job shadow, or a job. There are also many opportunities on campus to work. After going to Cottey you become part of a tight-nit community of alumni. There are also many reunions that the college holds."
College Senior,4,Cottey College is very good at connecting people and helping a person find more opportunities. They are very good at getting internships and job shadows as well as transferring credits. There are many classes a person can take that help prepare you for academia.
College Senior,4,The library on campus is fantastic. There are tons of books and computer resources. The library has an online database to help students find more professional articles. Campus activities are really awesome. A person can submit an idea for an activity and it will usually happen. There are very many people to help make it wonderful.
College Senior,4,The class schedules are set up very well. They all have breaks for meals and it is easy to get from class to class. Most colleges recognize the prestige of Cottey College and will accept all transfer credits.
College Sophomore,4,"Cottey College, is a wonderful college. It has a great, amazing and wonderful staff, teachers, friends, people; for women and about women. It is all about growing as individuals, learning what you want to do, learning great, helpful tools inside and outside of the class room.. The class sizes are pretty small, they are helpful, great, amazing and I learn a lot. I was pretty nervous going to college because I am not exactly the best when it comes to learning things for a test or remembering things to help me in classes. Cottey offers very helpful alternatives with Student Disabilites. They have helped me greatly!
Cottey has great food, great people and it is an awesome place."

College Sophomore,4,"The classes are amazing, the teachers are very helpful, the staff are amazing people, the food is great, the suites are great, the college is beautiful and we learn a lot of helpful tools outside and inside the classroom."
College Sophomore,4,"It is the best college for women, about women and women in general. I love it."
College Senior,4,"It's been pretty easy to add and drop classes, and sign up for the classes that I need to fulfill my pre-req and gen. ed. requirements."
College Senior,4,"The financial aid available at Cottey is WONDERFUL! But don't expect the money to just be handed to you. We work for this, we earn our education. Put in the effort, and for the most part, tuition won't be that much of an issue. Especially considering how good tuition is! As an out of state student attending a private college, people think I pay through the nose to go there. But in reality, it's cheaper than any of the other colleges I looked at, and offered a lot more financial aid."
College Senior,4,"Cottey is REALLY diverse. We have women from ALL over the country, and the world! My first semester, I lived in a suite with THREE girls that were from other countries. My second semester, I lived with a girl from the country Georgia. How cool is that? And it's not just that, we vary in age as well. I've known girls that were 17 and in their first year, or 26 and only in their second year! One worry I had about going to a private school was that I'd be surrounded by a bunch of rich kids, and I wouldn't fit in. But Cottey's not like that at all. We're not a bunch of stuck up rich kids. We're young women who have worked hard and earned our education. We're women from all walks of life. The student body is diverse, and welcoming, and it's one of my favorite things about Cottey."
College Senior,4,Being that my school is small in student body everyone tends to  know each other and interact very well. We have our differences but at the end of the day we still get along. My school is also accepts students from all over so the student body is always diverse and there is not any discrimination whether it be towards ethnic or sexual orientation.
College Freshman,4,What they need most is reality counseling. Its easy to be prepared academically but its hard to transistion from Cottey world to the real world again
College Junior,4,"This school is really good at catering to everyone's individual needs. You will have the opportunity to meet people from all over. I have friends from every state in the US as well as foreign countries like Ehtipia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. There are several people that you meet that you easily get a long with who share your same values."
College Junior,4,"Cottey has specific resources to help students transfer if they desire to do so. They have articulation agreements with several different universities and colleges. They offer learning sessions for building resumes and interview skills. Overall, the staff here work very hard to make sure students have the resources they need to be successful in transfering or getting a job."
College Junior,4,"Computer labs are in many different buildings on campus. Most of the technology is up-to-date. Never really had a problem with resources because if the item I am looking for is not available on-campus, they have a resource somewhere to get it."
College Junior,4,"The library is not completely up-to-date, but it offers resources to get more current material from. The technology is mostly current and there is an quite a few computers on campus to use (computer labs in each residence hall, the academic building, and library)."
College Junior,4,the computer network is almost always up. Tons of labs with printers. Wireless access is easy and the wifi loads very fast. There really is no need to pring your own computer or printer since there are so mamny computer labs on campus.
College Junior,4,"The flexibility of this school is nice. I gave Cottey College a A- because of two reasons. One is that they are very good about small class sizes. While I have been here my largest class size has been 20 people and the smallest was 5 ladies including myself. The ability to actually ask questions and talk with teachers is easier in the small setting out Cottey.The minus came into play because the time to take a class that you want or need to take is only available once a year or once every two years. Also when it comes to dual credit classes, the school took most of them but used the rest as electives. So if someone has the opportunity to take dual-credit courses in high school they should really take advantage of the opportunity. Figuring out what classes to take can be really tedious and confusing if you have no idea as to what you are doing. Some of the teachers on campus, who are the advisers to help pick classes, are great for helping students while others as I have been told by friends that they didn't help them fulfill everything they needed until the last minute."
College Freshman,2,Most credits only transfer in and count as electives so I wasted time and effort gaining 33 credits and they only accepted 26 and only one of them counted as a non-elective. It's also hard to find schools that will accept your credits from Cottey.
College Junior,2,I love it but it is hard for me with the way I learn
College Junior,2,Teacher's are not flexible; and it is very hard to get any understanding from anyone. Hopefully going to online classes will solve a lot of my problems so i can get a job and start paying bills.
College Senior,2,"Rough Transition â€“ I took Classical Latin all through out high school as my foreign language. When I came to transfer my credits here, I was told that Latin is not a foreign language and that it would not count. There went four years!!"
College Junior,2,Network Needs Some Work â€“ This computer network has many issues. It is more times than not very slow and hard to get on to. Then it woul go down for hours at a time for no reason what so ever. There have been times that I had to wake up in the early hours of the morning to finish a paper because I can't get to my online sources.
College Junior,2,A Little Unimpressed â€“ A group of friends of mine and myself are some of the hardest working and most participatory students inside and out of class. We frequently get frustrated with other students who rely on us to carry on class discussion. There are other hard workers here but they're very introverted. It's difficult to feel intellectually stimulated by the student body here.
College Senior,2,Horrible Living Great Education â€“ I love the education that I am recievin at this college but the college treats us all like high schoolers! We even have to have our parents sigh paperwork to do things. I love the education at this school it is really good.
Alum,1,"It's the worst school for colored people. I was treated different, and I was discriminated at all the time. If you are outgoing and like city life and not Caucasian DO NOT apply to this school"
College Sophomore,1,i'm going through that right now. the whole affair has been a disaster and i spent all nights in agony
College Senior,1,"The academic education and life lessons learned at Cottey are well worth the money that the school costs. However, the financial aid and financial aid offices are not the most helpful at all. Most monies are promised, but not disbursed, which can leave students in a lurch counting on monies that won't be appearing. I learned the hard way that even though they awarded me enough scholarships for a full ride, they never had any intention of disbursing it all. My senior year, I ended up owing money even though on paper I had a full ride."

Junior,5,"They are incredible people who do all the work to make this college happen, however I am apart of the online section of this college. This means that I don't see how things are on campus but rather how their online platform is and overall it good. There have been some hiccups along the way but they have dealt with it well."
Junior,5,"This has been my primary experience with visible, and they are overall organized and well. I'll refer to my first comments because it won't change much in my situation."
Sophomore,5,"Online school is never easy, but Visible made each course easy to access and relevant to the major the student is in. There are always professors and instructors ready and willing to help with any question a student may have!"
Sophomore,5,They are incredibly detailed in their course studies for each student and will cater to the levels of ability that each student has - whether further along or right at the level in which they are being instructed/taught!
Niche User,5,Such excellence and care for students. Their financial department is accommodating and their faculty is highly qualified and efficient communicators. Really loved my time with Visible.
Recent Alumnus,5,The facilities at the school are amazing.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The school is located in the heart of downtown Memphis, Tennessee, so there are many great options to eat out."
College Student,5,"It's a school unlike any I've tried applying for.  It meets every requirement I had in choosing a school.  The school is small and more personable while still maintaining a high quality education.  With it not only being music affiliated but also ministry centered, it's the only place I want to go."
College Junior,5,Every student is provided with their own Macbook Pro that is included with tuition.
College Junior,5,"It is a private Christian college, but they are pretty lenient on different things as long as you are not breaking the law."
College Junior,5,"I feel very safe at the ""campus"". Some may feel unsure about the homeless in Memphis, but you learn to deal with them."
College Junior,5,"The school is within a three minute walk from the dorms, students help each other getting around to places like Walmart and Target. VMC is in the heart of downtown so there are a lot of things to do without needing transportation. If needed the trolley is readily available as long as the bus which cost no more than 3 dollars for the entire day. Train tickets are very reasonably priced, located downtown and the airport is not to far either."
College Sophomore,5,Audition Only Admission – Getting into this school is based on auditions. No problem choosing your major if you get in.
Alum,4,"Overall my experience at Visible was very good. Most of the staff were excellent teachers and cared a great deal about their students. The experience you gain from learning how to take your passion and apply it in the music industry is awesome. The community that exists on this campus is one that is amazing and helps build one another up. There are only a couple of things I would like to see change. The first is they need some better teachers for some of the classes they offer.  There were a couple of classes that were not taken seriously by the professor and felt like a waste of time and money. Secondly, when I was attending the college, the business office was a mess. I would constantly be owing them more money even though I paid the amount that was billed to me at the beginning of the semester. Other than those small complaints I would recommend this college to anyone who is a christian and looking to grow their passion for music and their faith."
Junior,4,Visible Music College is a unique college experience for anyone seeking to pursue a career in music.  It has an awesome campus and the professors are very knowledgeable.  It's located in the middle of downtown Memphis and has access to many music related opportunities.  The job placement rate for graduates is very high.
Recent Alumnus,4,The strictness is definitely necessary for the safety and well-being of the students.
Recent Alumnus,4,The school is very open to different kinds of people.
Recent Alumnus,4,Very hands on and focused on growing deeper not only in music but with the Lord.
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone is artsy and chill.
Recent Alumnus,4,The party scene at the school is a little different than your average school. It's more about hanging out and building relationships. Sometimes you will feel like you are in a musical because everyone loves to jam out on their instruments for fun.
Recent Alumnus,4,The academics at the school are very hands on and very applicable to life outside of college. The professors provide amazing training and assist in self growth as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My major, in my opinion, was the best option at the school. It gives you the basic music and theology training but also gives you a very hands on outlook. I will be able to use everything that I learned out in the workplace. The workload can be a little intense but I think it's good for musicians to get a little push sometimes. Overall the facilities are great and there is enough space for personal practice time."
Recent Alumnus,4,The school has their own security officer that is on duty 24/7. Overall the campus is very secure and only staff and students can get inside without getting buzzed in. I have always felt safe while being on campus.
College Student,4,The overall experience was phenomenal!  Scholarships and aids could have been worked out a little more smoothly on my end but now knowing what to do it will be easier in the future.
College Student,4,"The curriculum at this college allows you to start integrating hands on classes your freshman year.  That, and with a strong partnership to a big name company, they provide great real life tips and experience the day your start."
College Student,4,The school has the same academic quality as any other school but more one on one time.  Home work is the same as any other average school but also mixes practical projects then just papers or final reviews.
College Student,4,"With how strict our guidelines are, it would e very difficult for an assault like that to occur.  But no place is perfect and anything could obviously happen"
College Student,4,They have strong beliefs that students should adhere to the law regardless where they are from.
College Junior,4,The audio/music production program is one of the best. In my previous school I didn't get much out of it but Visible Music College has gone far any beyond. The professors genuinely car for their students and take the needed time to help them grow and succeed in their field.
College Sophomore,4,"Vocal Major – Being a Vocal Major sometimes seems lie it is not challenging enough simply because its harder to see progress in your own skill because it takes long to develop a habit and you can't practice as long. The workload is a lot sometimes but coming from a different college it is the about the same. I love doing and learning about what I love but it scares me that I may not be able to find a job after school is over. However, this school is great for getting you into networking, and throws you into the business."
College Sophomore,4,"Where to Eat in Memphis – There is no 'cafeteria' and students are responsible for their own food. There are many restaurants surrounding the down town campus. My favorite is Huey's! However, I don't go out much. Just shop at the grocery store and cook in our full kitchens! Kroger, Walmart, Target, and the Wonder Bread store are the best places to buy groceries for cheap. With car situations everyone helps everyone else. Sweet Potato Fries are AWESOME! So is the BBQ!"
College Sophomore,4,"Visible is a unique diverse college of students and faculty from all walks of life. We are a tightly knit community of Christians reaching for the same goal of Making Jesus famous. While there are academic classes such as math and science which hold a great importance the faculty encourage and challenge the students to grow in their particular area as far as their musical talent as well as their walk with Christ. The teachers here are extremely talented and have a lot to teach. Registration process is very swift and easy due to the awesome office faculty, financial aid still has a few kinks to get out but is getting better. The courses, especially music theory, is extremely challenging but they offer free tutoring and because we are closely knit there is so many opportunities to speak to your professors. We hold each other accountable and there is pastoral care. Dorm life is amazing, there is always something to do. Overall, its just a great school to go to challenging but the amazing community helps get each other along with out competition which is rare in an artist centered school. That's what happens when God is present."
College Junior,4,"Available Housing – Visible School partners with an apartment complex right across the street from the new building in downtown Memphis.  The apartments are about the same price as the dorms (which are brand new condominium apartments built two years ago) if split amongst four people.  In my opinion, nothing beats on-campus housing as far as aesthetics goes, but the overflow apartments are cozy enough.  Other than that, downtown living can get pricey.  Midtown is about a 10 minute drive, and has plenty of affordable housing options, but it's important to know where to look.  Neighborhoods in Memphis change completely from one street to the next.  Luckily, as a first year on-campus (or the off-campus overflows I was just talking about) housing is required, so by the second year here a student should no where the hotspots in town are."
Sophomore,1,"I was a student at the Chicago campus, and to be completely honest, this school is a mess. The academic program was fairly poor, the school is very cheap and willing to hurt students for their own benefit, and when issues occur the school rarely fixes the problems. Going to this school is essentially paying 25 thousand dollars to go to an exclusive church. The most frustrating part thus far is that (though Visible will tell you they are fully accredited) none of the 29.5 credits I have are acceptable to other schools. This program is a scam."
Recent Alumnus,1,It is a music school so there isn't an athletic department.
Recent Alumnus,1,There isn't campus dining. The school is little too small.
College Student,1,To my understanding there is no Greek life apparent on campus.
College Student,1,"As a white male in a middle class family it is very difficult to get ""selected"" for scholarships.  I would have to be pretty extravagant or the scholarship would have to be very low bar to be getting anything from anyone."

Junior,5,"Due to COVID-19, our classes were put on online mode, which hasn't happened in Menlo college history. However, the teachers and students adapted fast and it was a great experience."
Junior,5,Menlo college is a great school to go to if you like being in a small classroom setting. Menlo has the best professors who work one on one to make sure you get your money's worth. The student teach ratio is 14:1 and it the best decision made. It is a full-time business school but has psychology as another alternative.
Niche User,5,Menlo College is preparing me and teaching everything I need to know before arriving at Menlo College.
Niche User,5,"My expectations of Menlo are very high I expect my first year to contain the classes I need in order to graduate the fastest as possible. I expect the college education to be exceptional and containing information that I can reflect on in the future. Since Menlo has a 14:1 ratio I expect to excel academically being able to talk to my professors 1 on 1. The final expectation for Menlo would be the type of experience offered the way that they project the business aspect with the application of a real business. Menlo does not only give me a great opportunity but also a chance to stay active on campus. Personally I am an active student and I canâ€™t wait to discover the 40 different clubs and find a club that suits my interests. Menlo also has a high employment rate and will provide long-lasting connections with various companies this will serve as an advantage for my future. Menlo is the key in order to achieve my dreams, a degree in business, Career, and having a brighter future."
Alum,5,"Menlo is such a special place, my experience at Menlo was amazing! I had the the best four years attending Menlo. 

The Menlo community embraced me from the moment I stepped foot on campus. The faculty and staff truly care about you and are there to help you succeed not only in your academic career but also in your professional developments. Menlo offers a number of resources catered to help you succeed. 

Our internship program is great, it was one of the reasons I chose Menlo. Students at Menlo are exposed to all the tools and resources the internship office offers from the moment they step foot on campus. Many of the students are offered full-time positions even before they graduate! Not only did the resources help me land the internship of my dreams, but my classes at Menlo truly prepared me for the real world. I was able to use all the knowledge and apply it to my job. 

My experience at Menlo was like no other, I wish I could do it all over again!"
Alum,5,"I loved Menlo. I went to Menlo as a transfer student so I was over dorm room parties and just wanted to get through school. I loved having a 1:1 relationship with teachers so I could get a solid understanding of upper-division work. We would go downtown Palo Alto to have fun. It was perfect. There is SO much opportunity in this area. From startups to mega-corporations, you can get an internship and land an awesome job out of Menlo. The teachers are exceptional since they've already had a career prior to coming to Menlo to teach their expertise; this is another great way to land a position because the teachers are very connected."
Works Here,5,"Menlo College is a very special place. It is incredibly diverse for a small, private college. A large number of our population are Pell Grant recipients. We have over 50% students of color, 10% of our students come from the Hawaiian islands, and 25% of our student body are international students. Also, the opportunities afforded to Menlo College students are unlike any I've witnessed at other institutions. Partially due to the exact location, being in Atherton. When you're so close to thousands of companies it is easy to get your foot in the door, especially with the added help of Menlo's award-winning internship program and vast network of accomplished alumni. It's also due, though, to the extraordinary faculty, staff, and administration who put students first in all of their decision makings. Ask any Menlo employee, they'll tell you their favorite part of their job is supporting our students."
Alum,5,"My experience at Menlo College was amazing! I had some of the best times of my life there. I made amazing memories and long lasting friendships. 

At Menlo, I felt wanted. I didn't feel like I was just a number. The faculty and staff really do show you that they are there for you and want to see you succeed in whatever you do, even if it is outside of the classroom. I never felt that I didn't have a helping hand when I needed it. There are so many resources available and I think that's what many students love about Menlo.

The internship program is phenomenal. Many students walk out of this school with a full-time job offer in hand. Menlo definitely prepares you for the real world and helps you get that foot through the door due to so many connections they have with companies. It's so amazing to see how many successful stories you hear about Menlo College alums. 

Overall, I don't regret choosing Menlo College one bit. I loved every ounce of it and would love to go back! :)"
Alum,5,"I graduated from Menlo in 2018. The intimate community definitely prepared me with the essential skills needed in the workplace while I built a strong network, or how I call it, a second family."
Freshman,5,"With the recent upgrades and being able to find someplace like this in the middle of Silicon Valley is amazing. I went for a tour and the students were so kind and inviting that I eventually chose to return to Menlo to be a student. With great programs and a mandatory internship to get experience before graduating, I thought this was a great fit for me. Lots of diverse and kind people who are really welcoming, I would say if you're interested come visit or give a call to the school to find out more. I just wish the exterior of some of the buildings matched the feel of the rest of campus, but other than that it is amazing!"
Junior,5,"I was interested in Menlo College because of its school size and the type of majors they offer. My favorite thing about Menlo is the diversity and the community of people. They have numerous students from out of state and overseas. The school makes it easy to network with students, staff, and even professionals that are off campus. The career services are one of the best services on campus because they are really effective in getting the students ready for an internship or a full time job. Classes are great because of the classroom size, Menlo has a student and professor ratio of 14:1 which makes student involvement present as well as individualized attention from the professors."
Niche User,5,"Menlo is a wonderful college. I have never regretted about choosing this college among others. High level education, nice faculty, great athletics, delicious food, fine dorms and etc. This place makes me feel important."
Sophomore,5,"I am an International student and currently a sophomore at Menlo College. I love how diverse Menlo is! You will learn so much about different cultures and people from different countries! The professors are really great and usually do everything to help you pass the class. My accounting professor has a FaceTime account set up, so that his students can call him at any time during the week if they have questions! My finance professor does one-on-one meeting if you have problems with the class or exams! All in all they really care about you at Menlo!"
Freshman,5,Menlo College is an amazing college. It is very diverse the school brings people from all different backgrounds. I have met my lifelong friends here. Their academic programs are amazing. They set you up for success and they want you to graduate from there school and they ensure that.
Niche User,5,Menlo College is a great school . It offers great academics and athletics  programs. Menlo College allows students to build connections with their professors which a unique experience.
Alum,5,"Menlo College was a phenomenal experience.

The support that I received during my time here was unreal. Like most things, you get from Menlo exactly what you put into it. You can't expect opportunities simply to knock on your door everyday.

But at Menlo, the opportunities are endless, all you have to do is ask for them. Internships, jobs, academic support, tutoring, resume building, writing assistance, lunch with faculty, funding for clubs, events in the city, parties down the road- plentiful and amazing!

For a student who wants that perfect balance of support and independence, fun and opportunity, prestigious but welcoming, diverse but unique. Menlo is the place for you!"
Junior,5,"Menlo College is a place that is constantly changing. Like any college, it has its pros and cons. The key to getting the most out of your Menlo experience is getting involved. I've learned to appreciate the countless opportunities that Menlo has to offer, and the activities I've been involved in have paid me back tenfold in friendships, professional experience, and lifelong memories. 
Overall, Menlo is not your typical university college experience where you can disappear in the crowd, attend a huge lecture hall, or attend large and extravagant events, but it suits me perfectly. You get an unexpected intimacy. The small class sizes have allowed me to get individualized attention from my professors, deep connections with my peers, and meaningful friendships with the staff and faculty. It's home for me, and for so many other students on campus. I could not imagine being anywhere else."
Senior,5,It has been a great experience so far!  I am studying Psychology here and I have received a great education so far. Dr. Hager has a strong passion for the program and does a great job preparing his students for their senior year.  I also love that Menlo is a small school and they provide so many useful resources to their students.  It's a strong community and everybody cares for one another.
Senior,5,"Menlo College has a great accounting program! Since Menlo is in the heart of the Silicon Valley, students have a chance of interning at a top tech company or for accounting major at one of the Big 4 public accounting firms."
Senior,5,"Menlo College is a great experience. The college is small but I feel as that's the very thing that makes it worth it. The tightness of the community has made me closer to many friends and people. When I ask friends at larger universities how their social circles are, they answer that their circles get smaller each year. Yet with my time at Menlo I feel as my social circles grow, grow, and grow because I'm still in touch with friends that have graduate and with students that come to the college. That is why I think Menlo was the best fit for me."
Senior,5,"I love how welcoming the Menlo environment in. I was really scared to transfer to a 4-year but Menlo made it very easy going and I am having a great time there. The small school and class sizes are of their best features because you get to meet everyone on campus and get more attention from professors, they actually know everyone's name in class!"
Sophomore,5,Menlo is a great school aside from its flaws. It's the people you meet at Menlo that make it a truly amazing experience.
Freshman,5,"Menlo College provides an experience compiled of new and challenging experiences. Students are allowed to thrive through versatile learning approaches. Both faculty and professors alike, encourage all students to perform to fullest capabilities. Professors enhance critical thinking and strategic methods by incorporating group work and presentations to allow students access of speaking up. All students have opportunities to get involved with the school, local community, actively engage with athletics and arts, alongside pursuit in expanding business connections on a global level. Innovation at Menlo College expands on solving social and economic issues. Menlo College also provides the necessary tools toward achieving personalized success. The possibilities are endless!"
Alum,5,At Menlo you will get a very intimate business education. It is a small and friendly campus. Professors work hard to begin your career. I'm glad I went.
College Junior,5,I feel very safe at school.
College Junior,5,The admissions process was great! I had a reply in two weeks!
College Junior,5,My college is the best because the professors really make the effort to ensure that each student is learning all the concepts in class. The college provides mock interviews with actual people from companies where you can practice and get ready for real interviews.
College Sophomore,5,Great community that has had little problems.
College Senior,5,"Nice, whatever you look for you can find."
College Senior,5,"Amazing, amazing academics with staff and faculty who are always willing and waiting to help you."
College Senior,5,"Very open, the students here don't push beliefs nor do they put down others'."
College Senior,5,Nobody pushes and it's not prevalent at all.
College Senior,5,Amazing help here. It is so hard to fail because the professors give us their personal cell phone numbers. They also are more than willing to stay up with you until 2am to study and even come to your work place (allowing) to tutor you.
College Senior,5,Got an internship right away from freshman year from an alumni. Very helpful and the greatest attitudes about helping Menlo students.
College Senior,5,We are the safest school in the USA with a 0% crime rate.
College Senior,5,"Living on campus surrounds you with the feeling of community. It is cheaper, convenient with great amenities, HUGE rooms and a great atmosphere."
College Senior,5,"Joining athletics here is like joining a family. Everyone understands what you are going through and everyone is supportive of you as an athlete but most importantly, as a student."
College Senior,5,"Menlo College has honestly changed so much about my outlook on college. Coming to Menlo, I felt like I was coming into a community who was always willing to help. There are students who are always friendly and staff, and faculty who are more then willing to answer a personal text and tutor or help you anytime in their free time. It is so hard to fail here but so, so easy to take advantage of the opportunities."
College Freshman,5,The majority of the students who graduate already have a job when they cross the stage which gives the underclass a positive outlook on their future.
College Freshman,5,This school has honestly made my college experience one of the most wonderful I have ever had.
College Freshman,5,I feel so safe when it's late at night due to the 24-hour security at our school.
College Freshman,5,Everyone loves their Menlo Oaks.
College Freshman,5,"Being that I just finished my Freshman year at Menlo College, it was the best experience I have ever obtained. As soon as it was my first day of class, I already felt like I was home. Everyone there is so friendly and accepting towards one another."
College Sophomore,5,Professors are one on one
College Sophomore,5,Almost 100% job after graduation
College Sophomore,5,I love the floor bonding activities and my RA
College Sophomore,5,I love the small community and atmosphere of Menlo the different opportunities and workshops it has to offer
College Freshman,5,"During your freshman year there are meetings and a portion of your STS class talks about sexual assault. There are counselors on campus that people can talk to and they are very friendly. Additionally, there are security personnel on campus 24/7 and always pick up their phones. I fell very safe on campus and have not witnessed any safety problems yet."
College Freshman,5,"The classes are very small. In my first semester English class there was only 9 students. Although it may seem intimidating to answer questions, it motivates you to d your work because it will go noticed. Also the professors know what they are talking about you can see clearly why they were hired. The professors are also very helpful, understanding and overall very friendly and easy to approach. They always keep students posted about their availability and changes in the syllabus. There are a great number of classes to choose from, and are relatively easy to get into."
College Freshman,5,"Ever since I applied to Menlo I always felt welcomed by the staff and the students. One counselor kept calling me, as well as several of my friends, throughout the process of choosing schools and kept us informed about financial aid. This kept me interested in the school and was extremely helpful because all of my questions were answered. What caught my eye the first day I stepped on campus was the beautiful trees and black squirrels. The scenery of black squirrels chasing each other up trees every morning never gets old. I also love that the campus is small because I am never late to a class. Additionally, the small classes are the best! I am able to be known and talk to my professors more easily and am able to get the help and attention I need. #GoOaks"
College Junior,5,It is a very safe campus.
College Junior,5,There is a wide variety of options.
College Freshman,5,A very diverse community that proudly accepts you into the college no matter what.
College Freshman,5,"They have good athletics that are on the rise and are always fun to attend. Especially with the Menlo ""boo"" man."
College Freshman,5,You have a lot of different places to eat so no matter what you can find something to eat and most times find something at a reasonable cost.
College Freshman,5,It never gets to hot or cold but it will get chilly or randomly rain but it's such a beautiful campus that no matter what it is like it's an awesome place to live.
College Freshman,5,There is so much goings on at night in a manageable area.
College Senior,5,There are always computers available on campus whenever we need it
College Senior,5,there are no officers just security guards on campus
College Senior,5,there are no drugs or drinking at this school
Sophomore,4,My online experience was okay but nothing special. You log into the class while it's going on and go from there. The only negative thing is that they still marked you absent if you couldn't make it even with Covid going around.
Sophomore,4,"The school is very diverse which makes it really fun because you can become friends with people from Hawaii, China, Russia, and other places around the world. Plus, it's a business school right in the heart of Silicon Valley."
Sophomore,4,"Outstanding preparation and opportunities to enter the business scene in Silicon Valley. Facilities are poor, but academics, resources, and overall experience make up for it."
Sophomore,4,"Menlo is a very diverse place, its diversity makes anyone feel included. Menlo also offers lots of support for its student from tutoring to events happening on campus for students"
Freshman,4,I like how diverse Menlo is as an overall community. The professors are very hands on and the athletics are super competitive. I want to see Menlo College improve the dorm living style and change what foods they serve in the cafe.
Freshman,4,"I love how closely knit the students and professors are at Menlo. Menlo is a very small school, however it allows you to really get to know those around you, and its location in Silicon Valley makes it quite easy to network and get jobs/internships at well known companies like Facebook and Amazon."
Freshman,4,"Menlo College is a 4-year private college located in sunny Silicon Valley, California. It has a beautiful, small campus that has a homey feel to it. The professors I have had so far have all been great, they know you by name and always respond to emails. The workload is manageable, yet challenging and most students are friendly and welcoming. The dining hall serves a variety of fresh and organic food, however the options on the weekends are less. Nonetheless, this college and the overall area is very expensive, however a great place to be if you can afford it."
Senior,4,"Love  professors at my school, they definitely know what they are talking about. Love how much help a student  receives. Can not give 5 stars because administration part of school is horrible. No one calls back, everyone is late, and it feels as if they hate their jobs."
Senior,4,"The professors and staff are great! However, I think they need a couple more classes on computer programs, like on how to use Excel and Microsoft. Also, thereâ€™s an internship program we have before we graduate. We are required to get an internship before we graduate. I think they e shouldâ€™ve done more explains in the program andcguie is step by step. They had two or three sessions explsing to us about the program, but they didnâ€™t really help us find one. They emailed us on how our search was going and wanted to keep up on our search status, but they didnâ€™t help us secure one which I thought they were supposed to do."
Junior,4,"Menlo is home. No one loves being at home every second of the day and of course you can get tired of it and want to leave sometimes, but it is ultimately your safe space. That is Menlo. Here, you can mold your college experience into whatever you want. There is no other place that you can have coffee with your professor, play in a sports game, go cheer on fellow athletes, go to class, eat in your buffet, print your 10 page paper (for free), and then go to SF for the night all in one day! It just doesn't happen. I know it is cheesy, but you are a name and not a number at Menlo. We all support each other and it you are literally living with 850 family members. You don't like them all and some are distant cousins, but at the end of the day we are all Oaks. If given the chance to do it again, I wouldn't change a thing."
Freshman,4,"This is my first time attending a school in another state and I'd say Menlo College definitely made me feel comfortable being away from home. One thing I like about Menlo is that they have new activities/events to attend or do every week, it is a family type of atmosphere where everyone comes together to enjoy each others company and experience the fun together. The academics is top notch as well, focusing mainly on business majors, I feel Menlo has great professors that focus on the class overall and also individuals who need extra help, they are very helpful and just want us to succeed."
Junior,4,"Menlo is a lovely school with a small student body. Despite some minor issues and some old facilities, the school takes pride in its strong academics and sports programs. Though Menlo cannot offer a ""traditional college experience"" it can offer life changing relationships and a strong community."
Senior,4,"For the most part I have enjoyed attending Menlo College. Besides the few bad experiences with a few particular people, I have met more amazing people than bad.  Menlo college allowed me the opportunity to do things I never had the opportunity to do before such as dancing. They have great clubs,  and good student involvement. Also, and of course only speaking for the professors that I have had, the professors are amazing. Lastly, for the most part, it has a good atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my first semester at Menlo College was exceptional. With the college located in the heart of Silicon Valley it is perfect spot for internships and the small schools allows you to have a good student-teacher relationship."
College Junior,4,I don't live on campus but the dorms I have seen seem to be nice.
College Junior,4,Sports is a big thing at my school. You can tell that the athletes are taken care of.
College Freshman,4,It is great! Everyone is super welcoming. You can be sitting or standing alone and someone from out of no where will come up and talk to you.
College Freshman,4,The career centers send out emails to students if a job opens up either on or off campus and they put you in contact with the right people so that you can find the best part time jobs as well as internships
College Freshman,4,The teachers are really there in your best interest and they care about you to the point to where they require you to meet with them during their office hours so they cam meet you on a more personal level.
College Freshman,4,There are campus security posts all through out the campus as well as a system that you can call if you want someone to walk you across campus
College Freshman,4,"So far, I am loving the school. I am a first generation college student and I am from a completely different state so you would think that I'd have a hard time adjusting, but when everyone here is so friendly and welcoming that it makes this place feel like home. When you see people in passing and you speak their response is not a simple ""Hi."" or ""Hey."" They usually stop and ask about your day and as how you are. If they find out you are a freshman they ask about your classes and give you tips if they've had one of your professors in previous years. They ask how you are settling in and let you know that they are genuine."
College Sophomore,4,Each dorm has a different style of living
College Sophomore,4,The school provides a great small school environment. Large percentage of students live on campus making is an easy opportunity to develop great relationships and make friends.
College Senior,4,It's friendly and open. Nobody pushes and everyone knows how to have a great time.
College Junior,4,I love the community. Class sizes are small and professors know what they are doing. Safe campus.
College Freshman,4,You become so close to the people near your dorm.
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus alone at night. There is 24 hour security that can be called if you want them to walk you somewhere.
College Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes and actually getting to know the professor. You aren't just a number. You are a person and the professors want you to succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"Being located in the Silicon Valley, there are a lot of opportunities for community outreach increasing chances of getting a job or internship after graduation."
College Senior,4,Security around the whole time and sexual assault is almost non existent here.
College Student,4,"Class sizes are small, professors know what they are doing."
College Senior,4,Don't see much of it.
College Freshman,4,Little to no issues with assault.
College Freshman,4,The school is very helpful in finding an internship and job for students.
College Freshman,4,Great class sizes! Friendly people.
College Freshman,4,Small class sizes make for a great and personalized learning experience which also gives you more one-on-one time with the teacher and the ability to better understand what you're learning.
College Sophomore,4,Emergency procedures are clearly posted
College Sophomore,4,I love how over 1/3 of students is involved in athletics
College Freshman,4,"At Menlo internships are mandatory and since we are centered in the most successful business city of the west it can be relatively easy. I have not looked for one myself, but I do know other students who have searched and currently have one. Additionally, since some of our professors own businesses themselves, they have connections to successful people that can help through this process."
College Freshman,4,"Overall it's just great! The dorms are a pretty good proximity away from/close to classroom halls. Since day one you are introduced to your RAs and are introduced to all the rules and regulations. Everyone is very friendly and the RAs are always planning fun activities for people on your floor. If there ever is a problem RAs are there to help, but usually there aren't any issues. Also, our restrooms are kept clean because the janitors come nearly every day! The cost is pretty fair compared to an apartment nearby considering that we are in Atherton."
College Freshman,4,Nearly 70 percent of students on our campus are athletes which is why sports are given so much attention and support. There is always support for all sports from the rest of the campus. Usually we see many parents and teams from other sports supporting the team playing. Every time there is a win we applaud for our athletes in the cafe diner.
College Freshman,4,Menlo College is a great transition from High School to your college career. It is small so you get to meet a lot of people and they have many activities for students who live on campus.
College Sophomore,4,College life is great. Classes are pretty well explained and I have been learning valuable information. Overall a great experience.
College Freshman,4,So far school has been wonderful. Everyone has been extremely welcoming. The campus is lovely and my classes are rigorous but enjoyable. The only downside is the weather difference of home. Also the campus is too small for some people but it works well for me.
College Sophomore,4,"I adore my college for various reasons, the main one being that because it is so small the teacher to student ratio gives us students more one-on-one time with professors. The facilities are all well kept by our janitors that come every morning. Our dinning hall has options for everyone, including a vegan entree at every meal time. The quality of our clubs are wonderful and you are able to form a second family within these clubs."
College Sophomore,4,One of the major reason to apply to menlo college is that its a business college and therefore perfect for my future.The area in which it is located is also safe and climate is also very nice not very harsh.Also it is considered as one of the best regional colleges in United States Of America and is also known as BEST IN WEST.The day i first visited the campus i fell in love with scenic beauty of campus and I feel that studying in Menlo college would not only change my life but would also develop my inner personality.
College Freshman,4,"Eating out in this area is a great experience, but comes at a hefty price. Being in the Atherton Palo Alto are everything is expensive, but you are paying for the quality. Theres tons of healthy places to eat being that everyone in this area is so health conscience."
College Junior,4,Half of the students play a sport.
College Junior,4,"The college is beautiful, there are many activites"
College Junior,4,You get out of it what you put in to it.
College Junior,4,RAs are strict but allow fun as well.
College Junior,4,Menlo parties are small. Big parties at Stanford.
College Junior,4,Living on campus is fun and convenient!
College Freshman,4,"The dorm life is very close and everyone for the most part gets along with one another. We all have school spirit and as well as a good sense of respect for one another. The dorms are kind of on the small side though, and are pricey as well. But living on campus has it's perks, because the dorms are only about a 5 minute walk to the classrooms and the cafeteria."
College Freshman,4,"The area is great in terms that it is a more so safe environment, because a group of students can walk to a grocery store without feeling as if they might be harassed. There are police patrol constantly driving down the small strip of road passed my school and as well there are lots of street lights. The only problem is that since it's more so of a small town there is a need for transportation to neighboring cities, because there isn't very much to do in the town my campus is in."
College Freshman,4,Great and everyone is friendly
College Freshman,4,You never worry about not finding a computer because there is always room and extra computers.
College Freshman,4,It's good compared to other colleges and the tavern where we have grilled snacks at night make it a nice place to eat and hang out with friends.
College Freshman,4,Wish the rooms would be bigger.
College Sophomore,4,Very expensive to live off-campus in this area and only affordable place is not a very safe community. 
College Junior,2,I don't think we have greek life.
College Senior,2,"No one really get involved, which means there is little to no school spirit. Team performance doesn't seem to be that good in many of the sports offered here."
College Senior,2,Not a pleasant experience and I honestly don't think I'm getting my money's worth.
College Student,2,Hard to get a hold of internships.
College Student,2,Dorms look like jail cells. Very small.
College Student,2,Let's just say the school only cares about keeping their name clean. Thy don't have a psychologist or a medical center for some simple band aids. They pretend to be there to help in the beginning but quickly forget you. They do not have services to help people. They hold meetings to make the school a more diverse place but they only do it to look good and in actuality do not do anything. They will turn anything the administration is doing wrong to look like it is your own fault. They treat the students as if they are doing them a favor when they need the students just as much if not more than students need them. They prefer to hide things under a rug than to deal or help.
College Senior,2,I honestly don't see much coming out of it. Many but certainly not all kind of students here are  what I would expect to not get a job in the SV.
College Senior,2,The Football program ran out of money and the other programs are pretty bad.
College Freshman,2,"I guess if you never partied in high school the parties here are ""good."" However I don't enjoy them, they're small, crowded, and hot. Parties at Stanford are totally different though, the definition of crazy frat parties. Menlo is more of an academic based school anyway so I don't think people are going here for the parties."
College Freshman,2,Limited when trying to eat healthy! Best tasting food is at the tavern.
College Sophomore,2,I dont really pay attention to this subject. 
College Senior,2,School on campus is not the best and you have to pay extra for it. In the upside there are great places around the area.
College Freshman,2,Varsity sports in my school is well looked upon. Students that live on campus watch the games and cheer for our school. However off campus students hardly come to cheer our teams. The only time on campus students and some off campus come together is when Varsity Football games play home games.
College Freshman,2,"Some of the doors on campus do not close all the way after you walk through them, making it easy for anyone to get in. One of the doors on the main floor does not lock. People are suppose to use a key to get in the door, but anyone can pull the door open at will. We have emergency polls on campus which makes it pretty safe. We usually have about 2 guards on campus at all times. It is a small school so everyone knows everyone and it is easy to see someone who does not belong on campus."
College Junior,2,Get out your wallet they will find every dollar you try to hide from them
College Junior,2,"Dont Play Beer Pong! Campus is very small and almost half of the faculty live on campus, if you try to have a social gathering you'd be lucky for it to last 20 min."
College Junior,2,"The campus is fairly old, after all the school is celebrating 85 years this year. There is a gym with decent equipment however it's a small school so there isn't a whole lot going on. The campus is mainly dorms with just two classroom buildings and a sufficient library."
Freshman,1,"Menlo College is a simple-minded organization with no structure. The administration is a disaster, critique and comments are not just welcomed-they are punished! I told a female student to watch her eating style, as she was just throwing in pizza and junk food, and the administration accused me of ""verbal harassment"", which included disciplinary hearings and multiple meetings. Students are friendly, but everything is immediately seen as ""discrimination"" and ""harassment"". WAY TO EXPENSIVE for its value, just completely overpriced. Food is a disaster, inexperienced students are preparing the meals (they do as best as they can do), so what could you possibly expect. I am a freshman and will transfer after my first semester, as Menlo College is an embarrassment for the American Education System."
Freshman,1,"Overall experience was disappointing, was there for about a year. The environment tries really hard to be ""college-like"" and ""inviting"" but it is such a small school that it is worse than high school. Administration only cares about keeping the menlo name clean and whatever problem arises with any student, they try to hide it either by scaring you to keep quiet and throw suspension in your face or by just dismissing the problem all together. Basically there's no justice to your voice even if they tell you there is. Actions speak louder than words. Also, no one knows what Menlo is. No real credibility. This school is more like a really small community college where people are truly hoping to transfer as soon as they can."
Niche User,1,"Neighborhood kids come to play volleyball and basketball all the time. The one time a black kid comes along, a never before seen security officer (not in uniform) comes up to us and says, ""If I ever see you people here again, I'll call the cops."" Maybe the school shouldn't hire racists."
College Senior,1,Housing is too expensive and not worth what your paying for. It's very miserable.
College Student,1,"We have to no one to go to in case we need to talk to someone, no psychologist or counselor."
College Senior,1,It looks old and poorly updated.
College Senior,1,"The students are nice but I get this feeling of entitlement. There is no observable work ethic or integrity. In my financial Mgt class,I did a group project on my own that no one contributed to. The output of these students are subpar and it's something I would expect out of a middle schooler. On the final, essentially everyone cheated becasue the instructor accidentally posted it online. I'm paying $32k a year and the campus is old and barely maintained. I came in as a transfer and I thought it was better than this. They are now forcing students to complete an internship for the summer and it is REQUIRED to find an internship in the bay area and you MUST complete a 'class' once a week for a few hours on campus. Also, guess what, you are going to be PAYING $4,000 for this summer 'class'. Four freaking thousand dollars for one class. If it's a paid internship you are paying them MORE from what you earned.  The professors are okay I guess.  My recommendation for incoming students, avoid this school. Get your money's worth from SJC Or SF state. There is a gym room but it's in those portable buildings for students. There are two pools on campus. One belongs to the college (it's a small box) and a full size pool that belongs to the high school next door that only the HS students can use. I live off campus and with no meal plan. That would have been an another $7k.

This school is a scam and a flat out joke."

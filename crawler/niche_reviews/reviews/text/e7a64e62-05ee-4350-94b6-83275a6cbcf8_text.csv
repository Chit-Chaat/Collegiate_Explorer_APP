Sophomore,5,"Even before covid, I would decide to take one online class due to making more time for me to work. That being said I like online classes as lectures are said in virtual class and if you missed class or didn't understand the lesson some professors post the lecture online for you to go back and review. The main reason why I liked online classes before and now is because it gives you a lot more time to focus on your work on your own time and pace especially if some professors post the whole semesters work. Youll be focused on your education and still feel like you're connected with your own life if using time wisley not leaving things last minute."
Senior,5,"Because of COVID-19 we had to switch to online, and it wasn’t that bad. The teachers were amazing. They were able to still get what needed to be done, done. It was quite amazing seeing teachers take classes that are hands on learning and convert them to online. It was almost seamless."
Senior,5,CCC was the best decision I’ve ever made. The staff are so understanding and always willing to help their students the best that they can. The environment the school has created as well is fantastic. You feel that you’re never judged no matter what your background may be. I never felt that I had to hide who I was or what I was thinking. I could be free and speak freely. It’s an amazing world that they have created in the heart of downtown Chicago. I wouldn’t trade Columbia for anything in the world.
Freshman,5,I just started to apply to Columbia and has been a great experience and the paths that I want to take. I will love to get a chance to be an artist
Freshman,5,The online experience is good and the information that I been  giving sounds organized and great and something that I'm interested.
Sophomore,5,I did take classes online when we were in quarantine. The transition was rough and some teaches adapted better than others.
Senior,5,"This school felt like I was coming home. All throughout my high school life, I always felt like an outcast because of my imagination and thinking. I was looked at like I had ten heads. But coming to this school, and to meet people who understand where I'm coming from and how I think, and to have them add on to those ideas and help with my creativity is more than I could ever ask for. It felt like I had been accepted, and even praised for the things I think about."
Senior,5,"The teachers here are working in the field they teach, so they have first-hand experience.These teachers want nothing more than to see their students succeed. I've never had a teacher I didn't like, and they each have such accepting and encouraging personalities, and easily give their students the tools they need to succeed in their goals and dreams in life."
Senior,5,Columbia College Chicago is an extremely diverse community of students and teachers that genuinely believe in what they are doing and who want to better the world. I've had a great experience here thus far and am looking forward to graduation day when I can proudly say that I attended Columbia College Chicago and start my career.
Senior,5,"I have taken online courses here and have enjoyed them greatly. The teachers online are very open, communicate well and always ensure that you understand the material."
Freshman,5,I was able to receive all the information that I needed.  I was also able to understand all of the information that was given to me.
Freshman,5,"Columbia has one of the best music programs.  If you wish to be a musician or performer, you should definitely apply yo Columbia."
Alum,5,"During my time at Columbia I took a few courses online and I found the online learning application was easy to use and very intuitive. Coursework is a bit more heavy than your typical workload for one course in my opinion, but it wasn't overwhelming or impossible to keep up with. The expectation on  student performance is greater, but if you do what is asked and participate in online forum discussions you can pass the course easily. Just show you are engaged in the work."
Graduate Student,5,"I like Columbia college because. It is amazing college that provides us, all the resources necessary to be successful professionals."
Graduate Student,5,"I think that Columbia college is an excellent place to learn and have a degree in short time, also they have affordable tuition. The teachers are people with high academic level and they care that we can learn."
Niche User,5,"a private college specializing in arts and media disciplines and located in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1890, it has 6,195 students pursuing degrees in more than 60 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission."
Freshman,5,I love Columbia college ! When I first started I was considered on fitting in and talking to people but everyone students and staff are very nice and different! Everyone is unique in their own way and nobody I’ve met has been judged mental. The professors can be very helpful and you can tell they want their students to succeed.
Freshman,5,"So far through one semester. Things are better than expected. The resources given can help every student in any major. No matter who you are, there is someone there for you. And always things to do with others."
Niche User,5,"When I did a college visit to Columbia College, it was a very fun experience. When I arrived to campus everyone was super friendly, welcoming, and helpful. They answered every question of mine regarding campus life, adjusting to entering college, and gave info regarding financial support. Which I thought was very thoughtful and considerate because you can tell that they care for their students. I had a amazing experience with Columbia College College."
Niche User,5,"During my college visit, I was impressed with the tools provided to the students.  The availability of internships and work programs that apply directly to my major."
Niche User,5,"Amazing dorms and facilities, all modern and new. They have a great arts program for everyone and a strong connection between the students and faculty."
Niche User,5,I havent started but visiting has been really good. The vibe that is presented is well done. I have seen that the atmosphere has been one that I wanted my career to be surrounded by. I have been drawn in by the diversity and the variety of races that are there. The music and artistic focus is very important to me because I want to major in audio engineering. This makes me think that
Freshman,5,"I love everything about this college. The professors are caring, the people are incredible, and I learn so many new things every day."
Niche User,5,"Since my junior year of high school, I have visited over 10 different colleges and none has impressed me or gotten me as excited for college as Columbia has. I have had two visits, one time with my friend and the other time with my mom and I had a great experience each time. Passionate staff members and students who you can tell love what they do, Very engaging and tentative to all questions and concerns, and even if you're a freshman you get to study your major/minor as soon as your first year instead of having to wait until your third year."
Junior,5,"This school changed my educational experience. I've transferred to CCC to study gain more insight on current musical trends and I've got that and so much more. The professors truly care and are passionate about their craft, they themselves are in the industry and are extremely knowledgeable about their subjects. I would recommend this college to everyone with a dream and plenty of determination."
Junior,5,"I’m still at Columbia right now will graduate in 2021, but I think it’s a great school. I’m an international student from Germany and I have to say I already learned more then the 3 years I studied in Germany."
Freshman,5,"Columbia College Chicago is the best art college in Chicago. 
It has a good faculty, a free atmosphere, and a good curriculum."
Junior,5,Columbia College Chicago has impacted my life in a very short amount of time. All professors at the school are adjunct which makes them experts and professionals in their field. This has all been very inspiring.
Junior,5,I am returning to Columbia College after 20 years of being out.  I am happy to continue pursuing my education in the Musical Theater Field.  I am transferring credits from Triton College.  The overall experience was great.  Great Teachers and great culture was my previous experience.
Freshman,5,"So, far all the Teachers and class that obtain to my area of study are great, and I am learning a lot of new techniques. Also, since the campus is in the city, I get to walk around looking at the scenery while I have breaks in-between classes."
Freshman,5,"I liked the environment the college had. It was very welcoming. There are a lot of students who have artistic characteristics to them. The students are very confident in what they do, how they look, what they wear, and their potential in the career they are studying in. Columbia College is very close to my home and transportation is very accessible. Each form of career has their own building but there is one building where all the students are able to get together and talk with each other. This college also has a lot of art plastered within the college premises. One thing for sure is that it is not a boring school and there is always something that catches your eye."
Senior,5,Overall school experience has been delightful. Loads of creative students here to learn from and many creative classes to take.
Niche User,5,My trip to Columbia was excellent! The tour guide did an amazing job and was awesome at answering questions and making the group feel comfortable. The school was just the right size and seems like they could satisfy everyone's needs. Everyone had a great attitude and was very welcoming!
Freshman,5,"Diverse, exciting and many programs to offer in the heart of a beautiful city!  If you are looking for diversity in  a four year college, located in a very busy city atmosphere, this is for you!  Many beautiful parks close by.  Jobs all around for students, museums to visit and plenty of public transportation!"
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman to Columbia College Chicago, so I have not had the full experience yet.  However, I have found the campus visits, accepted student days, and orientation to all be top-notch.  My adviser has been extremely helpful with questions, and Columbia provided excellent materials to assist with setting my freshman schedule.  I am going to be living in the University Center, and so excited to be done in South Loop so close to Grant Park."
Freshman,5,Classes haven't even started an I'm already in love with the school. The creative atmosphere and the collaboration mind sets are so influential; and all in the heart of a beautiful city.
Freshman,5,"Columbia College Chicago is a school full of opportunities. You get to go to a college that is right in the center of Chicago. The city of Chicago is beautiful, full of art and life. You get to meet new people at Columbia that might share similar interests. If you’re a creative person, Columbia has a wide array of classes like photography, film, television, fashion, etc. If you go to this school, it will be the adventure of a lifetime. I don’t think I would change anything about Columbia College. It’s a great school in a beautiful city and I am excited to soon be a part of that world."
Junior,5,Great experience! Have had a lot of information coming into the school. Very helpful academic advising as well as financial aid advisors.
Sophomore,5,"Columbia College Chicago has opened up so many doors for me as a creative individual. All my life I was outcasted for being different, and wanting to pursue a career that wasn't like anyone else. However, Columbia makes you feel unique, and special. Attending a college where i'm surrounded by staff, and students who have the same aspirations as I do makes me want to work harder, and pursue a dream in the Fashion Industry."
Senior,5,Columbia College Chicago gives their students all of the tools and confidence they need to start their careers in the art world. All of my professors were so incredibly knowledgeable and caring about my success.
Senior,5,Columbia College is a school that lets people explore creatively without any limits. This is a true school for artist that are looking for guidance.
Sophomore,5,I am studying film major in Columbia College Chicago and I love it there. It's a safe campus with mindful helpful professors and it provides all the equipments and tools I need for my education. It helps me build my career while learning.
Junior,5,"I feel Columbia is a great school.  I love the professors and the environment.  I love living in the big city and find new things all the time.  The campus is the city, it is a great experience and I am learning so much."

Freshman,5,"Columbia has a wide range of qualified and passionate instructors who have experience in their fields. This made my educational experience full of instructors who want to help the student succeed and find what their career interests are, which should be the goal of all college instructors."
Freshman,5,"Incoming Freshman but so far the staff couldn't be more responsive to any and all concerns. They are direct, informative and super helpful in addressing any concerns."
Niche User,5,I am starting in the fall as a freshman.  And I cannot wait! This school has everything that I have been looking for! This school will set me up for success!
Niche User,5,This college is the best college I've seen so far based off the campus and the attention given to the students and the involvement with there community and the communication the professors have with the students are at the best a person could have because that's what I've seen as a high school applicant
Junior,5,I really have loved my experience at this school. I have never had such teachers that care so deeply about your performance and well being.
Niche User,5,Columbia College Chicago is very wonderful college in Chicago. The instructors are very nice and they will really happy to helping you the question what you have. And the campus is very good for each student life.
Freshman,5,"Columbia College Chicago is a very warm, welcoming school of close knit students that often come together to create."
Freshman,5,I love the school so much because of its diversity. The school lets you be yourself without any judgements. That was a big difference and change from when I was in high school. This college has taught me that it is okay to be yourself even if it isn't the norm.
Sophomore,5,"Columbia is an amazing school, the freedom to express yourself in any art form and have people take you seriously for your work and career goals is absolutely amazing. Being surrounded by creative thinkers is so much fun. The teachers have so much experience in their field and always want to share. It's great to have teachers that work in the career that you are striving for and show you the ropes. I can't imagine going to a different college, Columbia does such a great job at making everyone feel accepted and open to express themselves."
Freshman,5,"Great school. Three alumni have Grammy nominations. Other alumni have been very successful in Hollywood, Theatre and Arts"
Freshman,5,"Very excellent college settle on downtown Chicago, very convenient and surround by many culture. This college see the importance of being profession and explore your vision."
Sophomore,5,"I am a filmmaking major at Columbia College Chicago. The facilities are top-notch, and most of the professors want to see you succeed. The best part of Columbia is the opportunities it provides for networking. Many students find great jobs before they even graduate, and I am working an internship in just my second semester here."
Alum,5,"I went to Columbia College in the 1980s. It did not have the diverse physical landscape that it has now. However, the principals were the same. Coursework is taught by professionals, not tenure track professors. While this does mean you sometimes get professors who are consummate professionals but not great teachers, this philosophy makes a huge difference in media and tech, where being out of the profession for five years can make you totally out of touch. 

I had the option of attending more prestigious institutions such as Northwestern and DePaul, but was offered a scholarship to Columbia College. I'm so glad that happened. I ended up with extraordinary internships I would have not have had elsewhere, and my connections with alumni are astonishing. I was not a ""rah rah"" student. I didn't want to be in a sorority, I didn't care about football. I was more into arts, theater and journalism. If this is you, then Columbia may be a good fit."
Niche User,5,When I went to the Open House I really enjoyed going around the campus and talking to the professors.  I really enjoyed the tour of the dorms. I also went around the classes and really enjoyed my visit.  All the staff there was really nice.
Junior,5,I feel welcome and accepted in Columbia's environment. There's a huge variety of students that make me feel more comfortable being around and being myself with. My teachers and advisers really put care into what they do and their students. I can easily flourish as I learn loving what I do.
Sophomore,5,"Columbia is a great school those who value diversity and art. There are people from very different backgrounds all over and the campus is right down town so the feeling of being locked in a ""college bubble"" is absent."
Junior,4,I like that Columbia and its faculty really prepare you for your career. You get plenty of opportunities to gain experience and really highlight the importance of networking.
Sophomore,4,"I love Columbia It was my first choice in high school where I wanted to attend. Columbia knows how to run a school. The school area might be sketchy sometimes as there's a lot of nearby alerts but it's downtown Chicago with many types of people I wouldn't blame the school on that part. Inside I feel safe as it's hard to get in without a student ID. The school always had flyers and fun events on campus before covid like game nights, cooking, sewing, dances, and any major or culture-related events that you can think of! Now off-campus with covid, there's some online too to keep us sane. I believe we lack in sports which I hope changes because I love sports like volleyball I played every day in high school and I haven't since but we finally have a gym at the student center to keep me fit !"
Sophomore,4,I took all of my classes online this semester. It's really not bad. I miss in class learning though.
Junior,4,"Well, I don't have an online experience before but since COVID-19 happened, is similar. So, the professors taught just like they were teaching in a normal classroom. It was hard at the beginning because I was nervous but then as time went by it started to get better."
Junior,4,"What I like about Columbia is that the diversity, the student life, the campus and almost everything because everyone there is friendly. I also like the building where almost every event happens because you can meet new people and another building I like is the library because like any other library is quiet but the view is nice. Overall, I like Columbia College Chicago."
Junior,4,This is a great school if you looking to get into creative industries! All the professors are well connected and and incredibly knowledgeable. You also get so many opportunities here!
Junior,4,I’ve taken classes here before COVID-19 and had a great experience. I felt like I learned just as much as I did in person and still use a lot of what I learned til this day.
Sophomore,4,I like the sense of community it all has. And the student center is a great place to lounge at and meet people.
Graduate Student,4,Great school for networking. Wish advisers were more consistent. Fashion department needs some work. Hopefully better than the first time I went there.
Junior,4,"Columbia College Chicago is a good school for anyone that doesn't fit the big state school norms. If you're ok or couldn't care less about football games, greek life, heavy social life than this school is for you. The school is heavy on networking and collaborating, and that is usually how you'll end up making your friends. Professors are extremely knowledgable in their fields, and most still work professionally. I highly recommend creating connections with the professors you enjoy. It's on all around  good school, a little costly, and you should understand that you will be in the center of city life which can be intimidating and often a little lonely with loads of people always around you."
Junior,4,"Classes transitioned to online when COVID-19 broke out. With Columbia being an interactive art school professors were not equipped to handle online classes. At the time I was taking film and dance classes, so to have them transition to online was quite interesting. Nonetheless the professors kept a positive attitude which made the circumstances a little better. Mostly online classes are continuing for the 2020-2021 term, and I am curious to see how they will be conducted. I know professors are receiving a significant amount of training in how to approach online learning. It will be an interesting school year."
Sophomore,4,Columbia is truly an arts school with a great learning environment. Many of the professors actually work in the field in which they teach and are very knowledgeable.
Sophomore,4,The experience Columbia gives is something that you can never forget. It challenges your intelligence and pushes you to succeed not just in school but in life.
Alum,4,"Columbia is a very hands-on school. Every major is full of competitive individuals who are hungry for experience, so put yourself out there, participate in class, care about your coursework and group projects, and you will get the most out of an education at Columbia. The only thing I wish they focused more on was matching students with internship opportunities or career opportunities out of college. During my years you really sort of had to find them on your own."
Alum,4,Online classes were fine and teachers were engaged. They were all through Canvas and it really relied solely on how much work you put into the course. Nothing special at all.
Senior,4,"My experience at Columbia College Chicago was overall positive because the faculty was helpful, and the teacher was experienced enough for the subjects. However not all, so be caution on choosing professors. Downtown life can be expensive and distracting, so it important to stay on focused to be able to success."
Senior,4,"The technology was good enough to hold small classes. However, it could be a bit disconnecting between teacher and students because of the method. It also depended on the style of the class and the topic of the class. Overall, online leaning wasn't as intuitive as in-campus learning in terms of experience."
Sophomore,4,Columbia is a cool place for an artist and right in the scene of the arts business downtown. It’s definitely not your traditional campus because it’s literally downtown but the professors go above and beyond for their students.
Junior,4,"Columbia College Chicago is an amazing school for students who are willing to put in the work. The school has fantastic resources, from industry standard equipment to its outstanding career center to professors who have worked in the fields they teach. However, it can be easy for students to coast; students who do the bare minimum on assignments can walk away with the same grade as those who go above and beyond. The biggest thing to consider when looking into CCC is whether you're willing to be that student who DOES go above and beyond without the incentive of a grade, because those are the students who walk away with industry experience, a pile of references, and a full usable portfolio. If you're a coaster, this isn't worth your tuition money."
Junior,4,"Most professors make effective use of our online assignment system, Canvas (although there are still a few who cling to physical materials, which can be frustrating). In the transition to online classes after COVID closures, students had very mixed experiences. Many of my classes for the semester were lecture and writing based, so it was very easy for them to transition online. However, many majors at Columbia require hands on projects and classroom experience, and students in those classes did not get anything close to the education they signed up for. There was also frustration from students and faculty alike about the ""dumbing down"" of requirements for online classes. The online experience greatly depends on how willing students and professors are to put in the extra work."
Freshman,4,"Columbia has a great location and always things to do around campus. The dorms are nice and there is always someone willing to help, whether that is a professor, classmate, or advisor. A problem is that despite Columia having a variety of classes, there are often very few sections, leaving many students left out of a required class until the next semester. Some professors aren't great as well, but that goes for any school."
Sophomore,4,"I like that my school has a humanistic approach to education. Often times, our school has gone the extra mile to ensure the mental and physical health of students does not affect their abilities to perform in school. I appreciate that the school makes a point of including voices from different races, ethnicities, sexualities, genders and lifestyles."
Junior,4,"So far i'm enjoying my time at Columbia College Chicago, however I wish some of the professor's were better at teaching, and I wish there were more diverse professors (especially in the film department)."
Alum,4,Great school! I like the low number of students in each class. All of the professors are knowledgeable and leaders within their fields. The college is more expensive than it needs to be. Some facilities could use an update. The location and diverse student population is the best part of the school!
Alum,4,Columbia was an interesting experience. They had all the opportunities I could have imagined. Having been located in the middle of Chicago was also helpful.  It allowed students to be in the epicenter of the city's arts and cultural scenes.  This school hosts the most talented students in the county.
Sophomore,4,Columbia College Chicago's diverse setting allowed me to meet people with a wide variety of talents. Which has given me relationships I will be able to use for my career down the road. I also have enjoyed all my professors who are working professi0onals in their fields. So I have been able to learn from their real-world experiences.
Freshman,4,"Columbia has a great atmosphere; the students are lively and fun, the teachers are passionate about what they teach and have a desire to help you improve. However, if you have any questions for the school's administration, there's a good chance you'll get unanswered phone calls and late emails instead of the help you want."
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year at this school and it's still better than anything else I could find. The location makes it so much more interesting and really helps with the feeling of after college and having to live out in the world a much smoother transition. Academic wise, there are so many interesting classes to take, but you really need to be quick to get them or have some backups."
Freshman,4,"So far it's fine, I'm only a semester in so I only have experienced so much. The classes are a really good size and give opportunity to interact with professors on a closer basis, but some professors I've had have, in my opinion, set their expectations too high for freshman foundation classes which takes away some of those first learning experiences and mistakes that should be allowed to happen. It allows for a very specialized approach to your major, but it's also a very expensive school in all aspects. The housing is nice because it's more styled like an apartment, but it's incredibly expensive, and by your sophomore year it makes more sense to move off campus, and sometimes out of the downtown area. So there's plenty of pros which make this school worth it, but also has cons that are important to take into account."
Junior,4,"I like Columbia's environment, most of the professors are kind. And if you are coming from a small high school, the campus is small/medium size so you're bound to run into the same people multiple times. I would like for them to update their site, and choose better advisors."
Freshman,4,"olumbia College Chicago is an institute dedicated to encouraging and celebrating the talents of individuals who do not aspire to fit a specific mold but rather intend on creating his or her own mold in a world that trivializes the arts. It offers a learning environment that is collaborative and without boundaries while being taught by professionals who are still participating in their fields - a fundamental pro that not only provides students with trending knowledge but an advantage that opens doors to internships and other post-grad opportunities ensuring success in all fields. Furthermore, Columbia College Chicago cultivates a bright, welcoming, and inclusive community that inspires its student body to support, uplift, and value one another through partner projects and Manifest Urban Arts Festival - a popular and annual celebration that implements a platform for students to showcase their work."
Sophomore,4,"The School is great for students interested in different art forms such as film, photography, music, etc.  Most of your professors actively work in the field they teach in! So many great opportunities are included free such as free movie screenings of movies that aren't even out yet! If you're looking for a place to learn as well as build for your future within your field this is the place!
All of these great things come at a price, that price being tuition which rises every year. This school is expensive!Most of the money goes toward all the great facilities and equipment the students are provided. So it's almost like a catch 22. The way living arrangements are you are forced to be independent. Shopping for your own groceries, cooking your own meals.Average college things like racism, drugs, partying, crime are average. Expect to meet ignorant people but also expect to meet great people too.  I think spending a semester here is a great way to see if it's a right fit for you."
Freshman,4,I’m currently a freshman at Columbia College Chicago and am starting my 2nd semester soon. Picking a College was really challenging for me; a lot of universities didn’t meet my requirements when it came to their performing arts classes and successful graduate rates. But CCC had nearly everything I wanted and more. I’ve been able to take classes about certain fields I didn’t even know existed and I feel that the professors are genuinely happy to be there and help teach you to prepare for your future.
Sophomore,4,"The school is good at film and invest a lot on that. But as a university, college life is poor here. We don’t have a playground, we don’t have our sports team. College life here is not like a university but an academy. If you are interested in filmmaking, that’s a good choice but if you are interested in other fields. There are a lot of other schools to choose"
Freshman,4,"Columbia is a very open and liberal private college, if you have an open mind and a creative heart, I'd totally recommend Columbia."
Junior,4,So far so good with communication and help with almost everything. I'm a transfer student and wasn't sure I would be cared for as much as I have been. Attention has been given to every problem I've faced.
Junior,4,"I like Columbia they have great campus, and the new student center was amazing., and the facility were also perfect.
Nice classes. I have learned a lot from Columbia, I just wish there’s more nice people."
Freshman,4,"I love how understanding and cooperative with Military students! However, I would like to see the discussion posts to be a bit more complex."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Columbia College Chicago has been very enjoyable. The school has an diverse, creative environment that allows people of all backgrounds and interests to thrive. The education is extremely hands-on so I am fully able to instantly apply what I learn in class to the real world."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy attending Columbia! There are so many different types of course to take here that make the Gen Eds much more fun!
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student. The first semerter was hard. Two of the professors were very good, I can not say the same for the other two. This last semester the overall experience was much better. I was lucky to have professors that were very caring, and that makes the difference. Overall the experience so far has been good. The administrative staff were very supportive, particularly my academic counselor."
Sophomore,4,A great school with many opportunity to network work with other outside of your major. Columbia is the type enviroment that gives the material to form the key to open the door to your future. Columbia is based in the heart of chicago which give you so many opportunity outside the school to showcase your talents or skills. Most of the departments are separated  by at minimum 10 minutes between each dorms.
Sophomore,4,It’s a good school. The classes are interesting. The teachers are fun and nice. I like the learning environment there. It’s a cool place to live and I’m learning a lot.
Freshman,4,"Columbia is a warm, fun, inviting, and including college that offer many fields of unique study in the realm of liberal arts. I am going to be entering the college as a freshmen this year and I couldn't be more excited about it. My only critique is that the overall process of signing up is a bit unorganized and hard to go through. But it is totally worth it!"
Junior,4,"I commute to classes currently due to expenses and commuting from the suburbs can be a little bit of a problem, but that is just me :). Columbia is an amazing open school where you choose what you want to do! You get to make your own schedule and chose when you want classes. There are also many many interesting activities on and off campus to do."
Alum,4,"The best part about Columbia College was the campus... downtown Chicago! The campus was spread throughout the loop, but not too spread out that it takes forever to get to your next class. On your break between classes you could walk amongst the beautiful architecture of Chicago and study or eat lunch in Millennium Park if you wanted. If you love the city, you're going to love this school. I never had any issues with any of the professors, the classes were interesting (at least the classes that had to do with my major), and the administration was decent when compared to other schools. I feel that the tuition was a little high with it being classified as ""college"" instead of a ""university"". All in all, I am glad I chose Columbia for my BA in Graphic Design."
Sophomore,4,The 2nd BA program is really helping me in my young adult life. I have a 1st BA degree from back in 2013 and got stuck somewhere along the way. I didn't know what to do or where to go but knew that I wanted to be an ASL Interpreter but I didn't have the time or money to become a full time student again. That's where the 2nd BA program came in. All I have to do are the major requirements which is about 6 credit hours a week. Best decision I've made in a while.
Sophomore,4,Getting accepted to Columbia was easy. My first semester was great and second semester was a little rocky. The one major issue is the price.
Sophomore,4,"Columbia is an excellent school if you use their resources and get involved. If you're a commuter, be warned, it's more difficult to meet people and to become a part of the community."
Niche User,4,"I like that Columbia College Chicago has a lot of creative majors. Not only that but Columbia College has very good professors who are willing to take time to help you with your work. They have a lot of after school activities and events that students can participate in , and it is overall a very good school."
Freshman,4,This is very good school and i highly recommend it! They have a very nice staff and amazing academics. There are many clubs that you can join so you wont ever have to  be alone!
Junior,4,Columbia College Chicago is an incredible art school in the heart of Chicago. Being in the Loop offers so many opportunities to its students both in experiences and internships.
Junior,4,"I liked this teacher who wouldn't mince words when he was trying to teach me how to improve on my storytelling skills as a writer and comic book artist. He's concrete and can back up his teachings with his talents. 
I like Columbia College's financial aid program called CAP. With this program I am able to do things I would not be able to do such as on occasion get something to eat, counseling or someone to talk to about anything, tutoring, and one occasion was able to see my first bulls game for free! 
However the tuition bill could always use some work."
Graduate Student,4,I am currently in the first year of the graduate program for Poetry. I love it so far. The only thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that there isn't much financial resources outside of the slim chance of being rewarded a scholarship that you can apply for until you're a returning student.
Junior,4,"I have been at this college for about a semester now. It is relatively nice, updated, and safe. Columbia offers an inclusive environment for most everyone regardless of gender, sexuality, or religion. Now while it may be nice it is definitely a obnoxious with how most staff tread carefully so as to not offend anyone. Not to mention it is also pretty pricey. But even so, it has been a pretty decent experience learning here."
Niche User,4,"I have not attended, but I got accepted. From the college visits to their open house, I can tell that I am going to really like my stay. They're introducing new facilities and are very serious about inclusion; that's probably one thing I absolutely adore so far. It doesn't matter what you are or how you look. To them, you're an individual with a dream, and I can tell they're willing to do everything they can for all students to achieve their dreams."
Sophomore,4,Great place to make connections with people. PRofessors are professionals who have first hand experience in the field. Great resources and equipment available for all majors.
Freshman,4,"I like Columbia College, because the teachers themselves are experienced and help their students to succeed in the best way possible, but their materials are also accessible in the tools I need to do the jobs I love."
Freshman,4,Columbia is an amazing school for art students. The teachers are well trained in the courses they teach. You will be very hands-on!!
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Colombia College Chicago, and have only been here a short few weeks. Despite my lack of time, I can say the school definitely knows what its doing. These buildings are full of passion and artistic expression. Also, the cafeteria food is actually amazing and the dorms ar like actually apartments. Chicago can be a dangerous city, but security campus does its best to keep you safe."
Alum,2,The school is in constant disarray and u deflating it’s students while simultaneously increases tuition and lacking transparency in where that money goes. Buildings are old and need renovation as well as providing students with more opportunities.
Junior,2,Columbia College Chicago is like any other college. It has its ups and downs. The top major here is the film department.  So if you are like me and are in another department such as photography your tuition gets bumped up all the way just to pay for buildings such as the film building itself. Therefore your money goes down the drain for a building you will never see.
Freshman,2,"There is a terrible issue with the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. Coming in during Spring 2019, the cafeteria staff was crappy to me because THEY forgot that new students were coming in. The student body is either lazy potheads or they stick to themselves. Thus far my education is disappointing. I've learned barely anything from 2 out of four classes. The dorms need serious renovation. If you stay in The Arc, be prepared for heat and cold to work poorly. Also, everything looks like it's falling apart and the elevators constantly go down. Good luck finding teachers that are worth a darn. Although we are ALL art students, there is no unity. No support between different areas of art."
Freshman,2,"Columbia has a nice campus because of the location and there are always events happening, but the education is absolutely not worth all that money. Living in the dorms (the UC) is not an enjoyable experience and it is pretty hard to take the classes you need to take since they fill up fast. The food is not good either. If you're okay with taking gen eds and introduction classes the first two years then go ahead, but I thought Columbia would advance my knowledge and further my career. If anything, it's slowed me down."
Alum,2,"Columbia is complicated...it's really expensive and many of the professors don't care about their students. I also experienced emotional abuse from a few professors. There is zero sense of school community or spirit, and the academics are far from challenging."
Freshman,2,"The cityscape is beautiful but can't make me ignore Columbia's many faults: 

- Teachers. Some are really great. Most are here as side jobs or because they didn't succeed in their career and became a teacher instead.
- The curriculum is very lax and I feel like I have to teach myself a lot, and yet somehow the workload manages to be overwhelming. 
- The tuition is ridiculous even though it seems comparable to other schools in the area, Columbia gives out very little financial aid. 
- Programs are questionable especially since admissions are low so they keep cutting programs and classes. 
- Tuition is rising, programs are weening out, housing is ridiculously expensive, the area is becoming a hot spot for muggings lately and security is minimal and not the most proactive. 

I've enjoyed my time here so far but not without my fair share of complaining."
Sophomore,2,"Full of close minded liberal arts kids that get easily offended. If you aren't depressed or aren't insecure it's hard to make friends here. Also, totally over priced for what you are getting out of it (especially the film program, not impressed). But hey, cool city."
Alum,2,"Chicago is great. Very political - at times, suffocatingly political. And Columbia is extremely liberal. You really get one-sided experiences here. If you're looking to escape a conservative small town, this place is great. Job placement.. Not one person in the TV department told anyone how important it is to do internships. I'm screwed. I graduated in December and all major internship opportunities in New York and LA are only open to currently enrolled students.This degree and my experience here are not able to compete with the people applying for the same positions I am now and I happened to have two internships - which I found and got on my own. I visited student job placement, the resume center, etc... many times so I thought I was on a good track. Not the case.  Don't choose this school because you like that it's ""downtown"" or that it seems ""fun"" - go to the most competitive school you can, even if it's just DePaul."
Senior,2,"There are some amazing teachers but also a lot of terrible teachers. This school is extremely overpriced, offers an very limited amount of scholarships to help students, terrible financial aid, and courses tend to be too easy. Budget cuts has really hurt this school."
College Junior,2,"There's NO Greek life within the school. Because it's a campus downtown, the Greek life is connected within the ""downtown area"" and multiple city colleges like Loyola, UIC, Roosevelt, and DePaul share Greek life with Columbia College Chicago."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Columbia lauds itself in ""putting students in the field"" and for some majors, that could be true. However, what Columbia doesn't do is help students make real, important, connections which is what most students desperately need but don't know how to do."
College Sophomore,2,The Greek life is not that great
College Freshman,2,"I currently reside in the East-West University section of the Flats. My personal experiences has kind of been sort of a hellish one. I do enjoy the cleanliness and modernization of the building, but the East-West students are almost unbearable. Whenever I work out on the the 2nd floor of the building there are always East-West students there watching me either on the treadmill or elliptical. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. On top of that I have had a sexual harassment issue I had to deal with while working out here."
College Junior,2,"Let's be honest. There are a million other artist for every single one of us. Be prepared to work in a field that you didn't major in. Be prepared to not get the internships you want. You will take classes on ""career strategies"" but you probably most of the things they are trying to teach you."
College Junior,2,Visited the dorms and promptly left. Get an apartment.
College Freshman,2,"There are not really athletics at this school. They have some clubs, like soccer, baseball, volleyball and quidditch, but no one attends."
College Sophomore,2,They don't have college sports teams or anything at my school. They don't offer intermural sports either.
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't really any athletics at our school besides dance, but the dance team and department are excellent."
College Junior,2,Very visible if you're roommate drinks it in front of you. There are also young adults (or kids) standing in front of the school buildings and in front of dorm buildings smoking drugs or taking drugs.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is easy, I fell in love with the city more than the school"
College Senior,2,sucking the money from you
College Freshman,2,"The party scene at Columbia is almost non-existent, and the parties that are available and really bad. If you want to party it has to be away from Columbia."
College Sophomore,2,I don't think our school is very well known for big parties.
College Freshman,2,"The UC is fine but if you do not live there, the way to get in is sketchy. I do not feel comfortable going to dinner by myself."
College Senior,2,Rent for off campus housing may be cheaper than living on campus but it is expensive and the commute is longer.
College Junior,2,"The athletics scene in Columbia is overlooked.  We have a lot of career-based and social activities, but we barely hear anything about sports."
College Junior,2,Not a big part of an Art school.
College Freshman,2,"Since I go to an art school, it's not to surprising that sports are not important and not really talked about."
College Freshman,2,I am still trying to figure out my finacial aid and the school doesn't do a lot to help.
College Freshman,2,Sense the school is in the middle of a city its not their fault theres just too many people you never know what can happen.
College Freshman,2,"There are always parties, but they sound awful and as someone who doesn't drink or smoke, it's easy to feel left out if you don't participate. People won't peer pressure you, but they also won't even know you exist if you're not there every weekend stoned and wasted."
College Freshman,2,"Nobody plays sports, but it's an arts school. There are nice gyms."
College Sophomore,2,Horrible hours if you don't live in the UC. Not worth it.
College Sophomore,2,"Make friends with kids at other schools and ask them to take you to parties. There's not too much going on at Columbia, mostly dorm drinking/smoking with friends, not too many actual parties."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many restaraunts around besides Dunkin' Donuts and Subway. Those two get old extremely fast, and when you want food, you also have to walk a good distance to get it."
College Junior,2,"Disappointingly enough there isn't really a sports community at Columbia College. And as far as the facilities included in tuition, it could be better."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have competitive teams, I wish we did. I used to be a volleyball player, until college. We have teams, but they just play for fun. No one really pays any attention to them."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't recommend housing to anyone ever, in any situation."
College Junior,2,"I've never really ate there because I don't have a meal plan. But I've had a few things there before from friends, the food looked nasty, and worst off, the prices were so ridiculously high!"
College Sophomore,2,It's really hard to get scholarships and aid from my school and for my school.
College Sophomore,2,"The worse! You can't drink, smoke, party, sign in more then 2 people, can't leave your guests, can't be too loud the list goes on."
College Freshman,2,This school is only worth it if you know EXACTLY what you want to do with your career. They don't make you take your gen eds right away like most schools would. Don't expect to learn much (or anything) your freshman year. Definitely a school one would want to transfer too. It's not worth the price and teachers don't care much about students.
College Junior,2,"I'm choosing bad because honestly, I know nothing about sports at Columbia. This is probably partially due to the fact that I'm not interested in sports. But I can also say that I've never seen an advertising to get people involved or let them know that sports exist at Columbia. As an art school, I feel the sport here are very minimal and unheard of."
College Sophomore,2,"It's really hard to get scholarships.  I'm applying to all sorts and the ones the school offers, I don't qualify."
College Sophomore,2,"In Chicago in order to have a real legal nightlife you have to be 21+. Nightlife is nonexistent if you live in the loop because everything closes. transportation is good, thank God for the UPASS!"
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a parking lot for students and staff. We have to you foreign garages and lots like everyone else. There is street parking with a paybox and it's over priced per hour. Everything about Chicago is over priced. I think people still come here for the culture, vibe, and opportunities."
College Sophomore,2,It's not taken seriously. The dorms are running crazy with drugs and I don't see much happening to correct it. The move-in online alcohol test we have to take is a joke. I don't even partake in drug and alcohol and I don't see how it's affective for those that do.
College Freshman,2,"It's more of an art school, so many people are not into the whole sports thing like I would hope. I love sports and wish more people were invovled"
College Freshman,2,"I'm not used to the cold, so the weather is not my favorite thing about this city"
College Freshman,2,"Students smoke pot everyday, they go to class high, walk past security reeking of the stuff, and nothing is done because no one really cares. Alcohol usually isn't present on campus, just outside of it mostly, but students still come to class and back to their dorms wasted."
College Student,2,SD                  SDA
College Freshman,2,It hasn't stop snowing this hurts my feelings I am not here for this STOP.
College Junior,2,I have to take the bus because my neighborhood does not have a train stop.
College Junior,2,"This school is not challenging at all. The professors are not tenure track and they are just people in the community that do free lance work and need additional income.  They are nice people and talented artists, but not teachers."
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of drug use. Mainly pot.
College Freshman,2,Its hard to find them for your major
College Freshman,2,"The school doesn't tell students about certain loan/scholarship opportunities unless they ask specifically. From friends I have heard that the office is hard to get a hold of, but I always call right when they open and have no problems."
College Freshman,2,Columbia dorms don't allow for many gatherings and a lot of the events are either not well known or become too crowded.
College Freshman,2,The school gives us U-PASSES but they sometimes don't work and for the cost ($100) they should always be working. Also on breaks you can't even use them which does not make any sense because some people still take classes during breaks.
College Student,2,"Off-campus housing is only a good idea if you have money to spare and if you're a junior, senior or grad student. Finding an apartment close is really difficult."
Junior,1,"It's a very expensive joke. The school is extremely political and close minded. The best part is whenever you've been there for three years and realized you haven't had one real lecture or exam. If you enjoy getting extremely high and having someone explain to you how you aren't liberal for being liberal then waste your money at this black hole of ignorance. By the way, the tuition increases annually but you lose qualified professors and actual resources whenever that happens."
Junior,1,Online is almost as bad as the real thing. The plus side of online is that you can realize what a horrible choice in an education you've made from the comfort of your own home.
Junior,1,"I have run around and sit around to get answers from my advisor (who is still not well versed in their job), Columbia Central and my transfer advocate. If I go to one person, they tell me to go somewhere else for help and so on. This has become the worst experience. It does not matter if it is summer. Summer classes are on. The pandemic moved things online, so we should be given THOROUGH information. We aren’t given jack shit."
Junior,1,"If you’re a new transfer student, do not just assume your advisors will help you through everything. They are very hot and cold. Get ready to run around to get answers about things new students should be guided through. They assume that because you’re a transfer student, you know everything so you WILL be discriminated against. Hell I start in the fall and I don’t even know how the finances work! If you think that’s good enough incoming student help, please do transfer here."
Junior,1,"God awful school, instructors are all about themselves and what they have accomplished or mediocre at best. None of them know how to use Canvas and have you do a scavenger hunt just to find an assignment. You need to talk to your academic advisor? Good luck. Just from my own experience  at the beginning of the semester my advisor was booked everyday until the last day of school. The only time you will hear back from the school is when they want your money for tuition. Trying to register for classes is an impossible task already there, but trying to register classes for your major is difficult from the lack of teachers and classes during the week.  Most classes for your major will overlap and not allows you to take. Do not waste your time or money into this nightmare of an institution."
Sophomore,1,"TL;DR: Do not go to this school unless you are or aspire to be a one dimensional art kid. 

If you're like me, Columbia College is so appealing because of it's location. Chicago is an amazing city, and if you want to live there check out Depaul, Loyola, etc.
Columbia is not focused on academics. Many of the professors are just Columbia alumni who are teaching there because they can't make a living in their field. I have been smacked by so many lazy assignments, its impossible for me to feel like my money wasn't  wasted. 
If you attend Columbia, prepare to be surrounded by people who are so desperate to stand out to the point of being extremely self absorbed, who smoke weed every day because it makes them more ""creative"", who talk about art so much they forget to make any art. All the professors and students are so painfully, superficially liberal, that even as a liberal myself, I couldn't stand it. It is an environment with such a mob mentality, so you better be ready to conform."
Niche User,1,"Columbia was the WORST 5 months of my life. They do not have a student center, the clubs are not welcoming, it's VERY hard to meet people and make friends

DO NOT GO HERE FOR FASHION WHATSOEVER. The head of the Fashion Deparment studied poetry and has no knowledge of fashion. the fashion program underwent changes and most of the design classes will be going away. 

 The classes were not challenging AT ALL, I didn't learn anything here. 

 I actually ended up in the hospital during finals week and none of my roommates helped. I told my RA about it and did NOTHING about it. I had a panic attack because I got diagnosed with a chronic disease and the counseling center told me that they couldn't help me. Even though we are ""guarenteed"" 12 free sessions.

Living here I got harassaed and attacked by a homeless man who was trying to punch me in the face. It was in broad daylight.

DO not go here. It will be the biggest waste of your time, money, and mental stablity, I promise you."
Niche User,1,"I went to Columbia for about 2 yrs.Each semester I brought a 5 yr academic plan, and told repeatedly by my advisor, ‘Columbia is not for you’.Some professors were nice, but overall the classes were unstimulating.I sought help when feeling like an outcast. I went to see someone for therapy.I had a session with a grad student who was judgmental. I made another appointment and was rescheduled 3x because of lack of staff.After my experience, it took some time deciding whether to return to school. I chose to go to the city colleges, and I’m almost ready to transfer to another 4 year. Columbia has made this difficult.The campus itself is beautiful. The neighborhood is downtown, morning and afternoon classes are best. It's been an emotional time retrieving my transcripts, but everyone at the Registrar's Office has been kind.For those seeking to go to Columbia, go to the city college first. It'll save you money.Also look at public schools for an art program.They aren't all underwhelming."
Freshman,1,"Columbia lacks the atmosphere that inspires curiosity and broadening a student's horizon. Simply encourages narrow minded vision within departments (at least for film). I was always worried about finding ways to pay for the college. Unsure what the high tuition and housing was used for as there are no sports, few clubs, no student center, no lawns/grounds... I left for a State University and am now learning more about the practical integration of design and science, being more creative, making more friends, feeling more confident in my future, having less stress, and paying WAY less!

Chicago is a world class city, sorry Columbia doesn't meet that standard. If you do insist on attending... Center for Community Arts Partnerships is a wonderfully under-publicized service organization in the college that has an enormous impact in the local Chicago non-profit arts sector. One fantastic part of an underwhelming school."
Sophomore,1,"Columbia College Chicago is a scam. The teachers are not qualified for teaching and only have experience in their field, not in a classroom. Teachers will often cancel class or not be prepared for class, and this is because they put their ""real"" jobs before their teaching jobs. The dorms/housing are average, but they do not make fire safety a big priority, and put faulty appliances in students' rooms. Also, the Residence Life staff and Student Health Services staff are very unhelpful and can even be rude. I had roommate troubles, and was told by my RA's supervisor that I just have to get over it instead of searching for a solution. The one cafeteria on campus serves terrible food, and is overpriced for what you get. I decided to leave Columbia because I don't feel valued as a student, the classes are a joke, and I even feel unsafe in my own room. Don't waste your money here, this school is a joke."
College Junior,1,"Housing is ridiculous. I mean, an extra $14,000+ just to live for two semesters?! CRAZY. It's cheaper if you find off-campus housing, or commute and live at home."
College Senior,1,"No Greek life whatsoever, even further alienating students from the school and each other."
College Senior,1,"No ""real"" athletics. Columbia College Chicago has a small handful of sports clubs you can join, but it's basically a bunch of dedicated students who want to find another rare student-athlete at CCC."
College Student,1,No sports at this school.
College Sophomore,1,Personally I do not like greek life. Lucky for me there is no greek life at my school so I do not have to deal with it.
College Sophomore,1,There is not Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Security is awful. Almost anyone can enter a building posing as a student.

There have been numerous assaults this year."
College Freshman,1,"The school itself is cool. Great courses.

Not digging the student body. Very hard to fit in. Don't like that part at all. But I'm just there to get my education and get out of there."
College Freshman,1,Columbia is a non-traditional college and doesn't believe in Greek life.
College Freshman,1,It's an art school. No one cares about sports unfortunately. We do have teams but no one cares about them and most of them suck because they let anyone in regardless to having any background experience.
College Junior,1,"Your favorite professors that actually care will be ""leaving"" or blatantly quit after you have them. You won't get the courses you want. Registration days are a joke and don't benefit anyone. Even seniors (who get first pick) have trouble getting the CLASSES THEY NEED TO GRADUATE IN 15 WEEKS. Don't hold your breath on interesting classes. Be prepared for cramped spaces."
College Junior,1,We share a gym. But no one knows that.
College Junior,1,Tuition raising every year with fewer students.
College Junior,1,This is a very liberal arts school we have no Greek life.
College Junior,1,We are a very liberal arts school.. there is no sports groups here unless you count the Quiddich team that is hosted by the Harry Potter club.
College Sophomore,1,"I've never had more issues with on campus housing than I have had this year. The RA's are rude and don't care that you are a person and have little respect for what you believe or think is fair. If it's against the rules they become the sheriff, and the judge, they have no mercy."
College Sophomore,1,This is another thing my school doesn't offer. Greek life does not exist a Columbia College Chicago.
College Freshman,1,"This was hard to rank because we do not have any school teams. As an arts school, we have some extra sports I believe, but they are not tied to Columbia's name. We focus more on art here!"
College Junior,1,This school has no athletic program and I feel like most of the students look down on people who love sports.
College Junior,1,All athletics are student run clubs. Wish there was cheerleading.
College Junior,1,No Greek life or athletics at Columbia
College Sophomore,1,People don't come to Columbia for our athletics department as it often exists as an afterthought.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you're in the visual and performing arts, this is a bad choice. The school functions poorly, and advising and residence staff are condescending, passive aggressive, and accusatory."
College Junior,1,Absolutely horrible. Still fighting with them for more money.
College Freshman,1,"I wish there were more opportunities for scholarships within the school. Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places, but I hope in future semesters there is more advertising of scholarships or else I don't know how long I can stay."
College Freshman,1,they let anyone get away with anything
College Freshman,1,They don't give any money
College Sophomore,1,I've been helping some friends figure out financial aid and it was horrible. The office was grossly misinformed about the FASFA and gave my friend and I poor advice. I ended up calling the FASFA offices for them to tell me that my school basically was not telling the truth. Huge headache. One of the reasons I'm not using a FASFA for school.
College Sophomore,1,"There just aren't any, really. There's a baseball club, I think, but it's an art school. Not a lot of interest."
College Freshman,1,My School doesnt have Greek LIfe
College Freshman,1,There are absolutely no sports here. Absolutely none. Do not go here if you have any interest in sports. Barely anyone even follows national sports like the cubs or the bears.
College Sophomore,1,No greek life. Too traditional and bro-ey for art students.
College Freshman,1,"It's not a dry-campus, I don't care what they say. Most students drink or get high, but the amount is sickening."
College Freshman,1,"We're an art college with no sports. If you like sports, don't come here, everyone dreads the person in class who wants to talk about football or hockey."
College Junior,1,The financial aid department is not the best department. It is a hassle and takes a while to get into your appointment as well as speak to a representative on the phone during the school semester.
College Senior,1,Don't live on campus.  Looked at housing and it was very expensive and very old.  Ugh.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have off-campus housing, through the school. It's in the middle of the south loop, downtown Chicago. You can try to find an apartment if you want. But it'll probably be very expensive."
College Freshman,1,Columbia College Chicago is a Liberal Arts school. Sports are no ones main focus. All sports are student lead.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have regulated sports teams at my college, only club."
College Sophomore,1,Horrible! Winters are brutal and I will be leaving as soon as I receive my degree. Never again!
College Sophomore,1,We do not have athletics at my school.
College Freshman,1,It's the city and you won't have your car there unless you're commuting.
College Junior,1,Anyone living in chicago will tell you it's rained/snowed/been dreadfully hot/dreadfully cold/sunny/stormy all in the same week.
College Junior,1,"I'd love to driver versus taking the train but the cost of parking is too high. My weekly parking costs would far surpass my weekly train costs. Depending what time you get downtown, it can be difficult to find open parking let alone parking lots that offer student discounts."
College Junior,1,WE DON'T HAVE GREEK LIFE.
College Junior,1,There is very little sports spirit.
College Sophomore,1,WINTERS ARE HORRIBLE!!! being in the loop and right by the lake it is unbearably cold. I hate winters here they are too cold and too long. All of the other seasons are nice. :)
College Freshman,1,"I did not even know Columbia College had sports, until the end of last semester. Being it an art centered college, the fact that it didn't have sports did not surprise me, I was more surprised to learn that it did."
College Sophomore,1,Columbia does not have sport teams that are worth being a part of. They hardly exist. The sports here are more like clubs that meet in Grant Park and play together.
College Junior,1,I really hate this city and this school.  I very much wish that I had not gone here.  It is a waste of time and money.

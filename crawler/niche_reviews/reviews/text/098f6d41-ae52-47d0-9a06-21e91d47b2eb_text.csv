Niche User,5,great campus! can't wait to go there next fall! love the staff to student ratio. I also like how the campus is smaller so your classes are closer to get too.
Niche User,5,"Wilson College was an amazing experience. The people on campus were very nice, the buildings and facilities were clean and great!"
Niche User,5,"I don't go here yet, but visited on an open house day. The staff knew who I was immediately upon hearing my name. They knew what major I was interested in and they did all they could to provide the information that I needed. The school is beautiful as well!"
Alum,5,"I loved the history of this place, the professors, the traditions we were privileged to be a part of, and the community we were living in for 4 years.  We were given a great opportunity and tools to be better educated women striving for success in a safe environment.   The professors and administrators cared about their students.  Lots of cherished traditions and memories.   I am proud to be an alum and encourage others to try WC out for themselves.  You won't regret it."
Sophomore,5,"Wilson is a smaller college that has many opportunities to offer. It is only as fun as you make it! Many people are quick to judge the school, but it is only because they do not participate, and contribute to the well being and livelihood of the school. The college has a beautiful library that has many spaces for studying and support groups. Almost of the professors are extremely supportive and care about the education. They only want the best for their students as long as the students are putting in the effort. Help is always around, and Wilson even has stress support groups!"
Niche User,5,I have enjoyed my classes and professors so far.  Other staff around campus are easily accessible and very helpful.
Niche User,5,"College to me isn’t just a place where I have to work hard and study all the time to get my degree to help me get a job and in turn pay off my college bills. Now having spent  years as a college student I understand that when going to college comes a whole lot of responsibility and independence. Not only do I get the freedom to take classes of my choice and ones that also peak my interest and push me closer to my desired career.  To me, college stands for getting a higher education to help me succeed later on in my life and throughout these four years of my life and college is going to help me find out the type of person I am going to become. Therefore my Wilson College education means the world to me and it is going to be something I can’t put a price on, because it will be so valuable and priceless to me."
Works Here,5,Great college to attend--lots of individual attention--caring faculty and staff.  Safe environment.  Academic preparation for advanced degrees is top notch.
Junior,5,Wilson college is a wonderful school! The professors are truly there to help you and make sure that you get the best education possible.
Sophomore,5,"Very friendly campus, and dog approved! Professors are willing to go above and beyond to help students and staff make the college transition easy. Highly suggest!"
Junior,5,I love the adult education program!! The culture behind Wilson College and the architecture!! The professors are well educated and bring a great variety to learning!
Niche User,5,I like Wilson College because it gives me the opportunity to transfer my pharmacy bachelors degree to be RN
College Senior,5,overall experience of wilson college is fantastic
College Senior,5,I am not involved on an athletic team however i believe that sports are a  huge impact on students for the better
College Senior,5,I WOULD CHOOSE THIS SCHOOL ALL OVER AGAIN !
College Freshman,5,My overall experience at Wilson College so far is absolutley amazing. Everyone at Wilson College is gregarious. People are always willing to interact with you and help you with anything you need. My favorite experience at the school was the summer oreintation where we got the chance to see the school as well as dorms and we got to get envolved with the upcoming freshmen so getting to know my future class mates was a great experience.
College Senior,5,"I had a pretty, spacious single dorm with a private bath and walk-in closet. Amazing view of the campus. Filthy when I went but surprisingly a great little dorm. I wasn't involved with social life on campus. Kept to myself, but the dorm was great."
College Freshman,5,Very happy with my school.
College Junior,5,The courses are challenging and the professors are very helpful and accessible. I love the small class sizes.
College Junior,5,I love the small campus and the close community. I loved the classes for my major where we got to work with animals.  The professors are passionate about what they teach and most of them are very helpful.  The traditions Wilson has make the school unique and helps the students get to know each other. I would choose this school again in a heartbeat because the friends I made and the experiences I've had are unforgettable.
College Freshman,5,"we have a very quiet campus, and because of this I always feel safe, and know of no felonies"
College Student,5,"The police are strict when it comes to our safety at Wilson. They will stop at nothing to keep their students from harm, and will protect them honorably. It is comforting to know this when I fall asleep at night."
College Student,5,"The process was very assuring and relieving because I got what I needed. I wasted time worrying about what I was or was not going to receive, when I realized that I am a Wilson girl; and Wilson will provide for my needs. My tips for getting into financial aid at school is do not wait until the last minute to get things done and look and take any opportunity that will benefit you short and long term."
College Student,5,"I am enrolled in Wilson College, but I have not attended full time yet. But I can imagine that the party scene at Wilson would be classy and sophisticated. I dream that they party with style, grace, and elegance; accepting anyone who comes in their circle because they are so welcoming and kind. Their party scene in my mind has a definite positive impact on any student who wants to fit in or just have a good time at Wilson."
College Student,5,"Wilson has a variety of meals and menus to give and assist to their students needs. What I like is that Wilson cares about their students so much so that all their delicious food is grown on their farm and is healthy. Attending and living in most colleges soon will bring on the freshman fifteen; not at Wilson! Wilson wants to assure that their students are full, focus, and ready to learn. Their nice and elegant dinning halls make it easy to consume the awesome brain food that they supply. One of the best places on their campus is hard to say because everything is a true sight and cool to check out, but my favorite place I have to say is the exercise room. I love it because there they have all kind of equipment to keep you in shape and they also have a pool for water polo and all kinds of other sports that you can participate in."
College Junior,5,"I would absolutely choose Wilson if I had to do everything over again. The traditions are wonderful, I've made a lot of friends, and campus is small and personal enough that everyone genuinely cares about each other."
College Sophomore,5,"The facilities are kept in good repair. The athletic center was recently moved to a larger space and has a wide variety of exercise equipment; the hours are varied sufficiently to provide a lot of access. The student center was also recently renovated and includes a lot of TVs, a game room, and dedicated lounging areas. There is also a kid's section so that women with children can bring their kids in and allow them to play in a secure, child-friendly area. The library is currently under renovation, so getting books involves requesting one from the librarian and waiting for them to retrieve it. The greens are very large and have a lot of seating areas and shade from a lot of old trees. There are a lot of campus events and traditions, something every student looks forward to."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a lot of international students on campus and they are always made to feel welcome. There is a lot of racial diversity and all races are treated fairly. Politics and economic background do not play a major role in the student interactions because generally everyone wants to stay away from potentially 'sticky' topics. Religions (and lack thereof) are well-represented on campus; though the chapel provides Presbyterian services, they are done in such a way as to be completely inclusive of those of any religion. There is a strong LGBT presence on campus and there is a lot of support for those students."
College Sophomore,5,"The VMT program is excellent. The workload is fairly intense because the vet tech program and pre-vet program share major classes. The difference is that pre-vet students must take more math classes than vet tech students. The curriculum focuses equally on large and small animals, but does not go into as much specific detail with lab animals, pocket pets, birds, and reptiles. Because Wilson is a liberal arts college, liberal studies are a requirement for every major. There is a wide variety of classes one can take to fulfill the requirements, though. The facilities for the VMT program are very good; there is a kennel and surgery area on site, as well as a large equine program and corresponding horse barns and a cow barn. There are also chickens and pigs on campus. An internship is required to graduate and it is the tricky part, but it is usually completed the summer before senior year. Job opportunities are immense because the turnover rate for vet techs is 50% in the first year. Academic advisors will help students study after graduation to take the certification test."
College Sophomore,5,"The drug policy bans all illegal drugs. During dorm inspections, extra time is spent searching for prescription drugs that are not under the students' names and for suspicious drug containers, any of which would be confiscated. Penalties for drug charges are severe and often include expulsion. Alcohol is permitted on campus, but it is heavily regulated. There is a size limit for all alcohol containers and the alcohol may only be consumed in a student dorm room with people 21 and over present. It is not allowed to be open in any room other than an overage student's dorm room, and underage drinking is absolutely prohibited. The policies are very strongly enforced; several students have been brought before Honor Council for unauthorized alcohol use. There is very little peer pressure because the students who do drink alcohol often share it with their close friends of the same age and no one else even notices."
College Sophomore,5,"My program was relatively easy to get into. The classes are very timely, placed when one already knows the information they need to have as background in order to succeed. Professors in the VMT program are keen to help everyone and make it clear that they will offer help if needed. I have a relatively high chance of finding a job soon after graduation because my field fills a necessary position for every veterinary clinic."
College Freshman,5,"All the students at Wilson are very responsible, if they are under the influence it is alcohol and the only students that participate in it are 21 or older and don't act immature or reckless."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone at Wilson is so friendly nice and welcoming, as an incoming freshman I have no regrets choosing Wilson College. Each time I visit I fall more in love with the school and the area. The school has many ""hands-on"" opportunities for those interested in the sciences. The area is quitter than I am used to but there is still lots of fun in the area if you know where to go."
College Freshman,5,"We have a lot of school spirit and support. We don't have that many ssoorts, but the support of the sports are big. The teams that are at Wilson play good and work hard to win. People from the Chambersburg area come to see the games and support the athletes as well."
College Freshman,5,"Drugs are completely outlawed on campus. Residence life runs two weeks of drug and alcohol awareness programs. Drinking is allowed, but responsibility is key: alcohol is only allowed in small quantities in residence rooms with people of age."
College Freshman,5,"Wilson's campus police are extremely kind and will do anything to help in an emergency. When I sprained my ankle last semester, they drove me to the urgent care center, brought me back to school, offered me any help I might need getting places, and frequently wanted updates on my condition. The most major crime at the school is drunken people wandering onto campus and needing escorted off. Wilson makes everyone feel safe; the campus is small and everyone knows everyone else, so it's easy to spot and report anything that's amiss. Many people leave their doors unlocked to go on short trips because of the trust, and it's a frequent sight to walk by an open door when the residents are in a social mood."
College Student,5,"I always feel safe on campus, and have helped to do RA rounds at one in the morning, and feel as safe as I do in the afternoon. I have also walked from the field house building at night, which is a walk from campus, and feel completely okay with it. If someone doesn't feel safe with it however, there is always an options of call security to escort you where ever you need to go."
College Freshman,5,"Stables Are Amazing – There are three horse barns, one large in-door arena, and two outside arena's. The facilities also include, many paddocks and grassing areas for the horse to be turned out. Also, there are many trails and fields that the riders may use to take their horse's out and exercise for the day."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Veterinary Medical Technology – The VMT program at Wilson College is a wonderful and challenging program that prepares the student for a real world career. The curriculum is challenging with a good workload, but so rewarding for those who really have a passion for a career in veterinary medicine. The faculty is amazing and the facilities are really wonderful. The Veterinary Medical Center is set up so students can get the feeling of working in a hospital. There school also requires that students complete an internship, which in many cases leads to a first job. There is also a great network of VMT Wilson graduates that can help to find an internship and job. The education I earned at Wilson College is second to none, and really prepared me to face the challenges of a career in veterinary medicine."
College Senior,5,"We Are Adults Now – At WIlson, the staff trusts us to make the right decisions for ourselves, because we are adults now. They let us have members of the opposite sex in our rooms and on our all girls campus, woth supervision.  They are very flexible with curfews and since there is virtually no drug scene, the college is laid back"
Sophomore,4,If you like a small school and getting one on one help then this is the perfect school for you!! The people at this school are very nice and teachers are nice and very helpfully as well
Sophomore,4,The teachers had to adjust but once we got back online they made sure we as the students got the most out of it.
Junior,4,Excellent professors and friendly students but very expensive.  I enjoy my coursework and my professors have been extremely helpful with any questions I have had or extra help that I have needed.
Junior,4,My online learning experience has been very good overall.  I would like to see more communications between teachers and students in the online forum.  My professors are excellent but the switch to online was difficult for everyone.  Clearer expectations would have made the transition more seamless.
Sophomore,4,"This was my first year in any type of college setting after graduating high school, and I was a bit nervous starting out because in many ways it's very different, but similar to high school. But with a school like Wilson College, which is small but yet very welcoming, have made the transition easier than expected. I am very pleased with my school and the classes they provide, giving me the necessary tools to prepare me for my major of choice. I could do without some of the struggles with the registrar, but it hasn't dampened the college experience yet, and here's to going all the way into graduation."
Sophomore,4,Wilson College is an excellent school and values the education of their students. They strive to provide the best college experience for students.
Niche User,4,They have a nice equestrian barn and paddocks on campus! it is a smaller campus located next to a senior center.
Sophomore,4,"I am having a great experience. I enjoy the area, the professors are very intuitive, and the education is superior. If I had the power to change something about Wilson, I would change the food. It is good, but it has the potential to be great. Sage dinning company has good and bad meals."
Graduate Student,4,"Wilson College is a very small college. I like the small amount of students per class. The instructors provide a quick feedback to the students and they provide advice to students who are struggling. Wilson also has online classes for busy parents like me. However, not all courses are available every semester and the instructors have too many loads."
Junior,4,"I am a current VMT major which is one of the most popular majors on campus. I love the hands-on experience given, the professors, and the animals that we have on campus. The campus is very beautiful especially during spring."
Niche User,4,I like their classes. I think they are very good and have given me credits. It is worth doing their classes as i found them to be very helpful for me. The teachers come to our campus and do good work with us. They have good resources which we have been able to use. I can't comment on too much else as I dont live there
Niche User,4,"Wilson offers a lot of great programs of studies, and are fairly cheap for a private college. Wilson could offer more scholarships though."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is small and quiet. It is easy to get to and locally located to go to places that are close by for people who are not from the town. There is always something to do, a lot of events are held at Wilson. The campus is ideal for people who don't want the pressures of a high volume campus."
Sophomore,4,"There are some aspects that make you roll your eyes, but for the most part Wilson is a good school that truly wants you to excel!"
Freshman,4,"Many different programs offered to cater to adults and single mothers.  This in not a typical college, it is small class sizes for a more intimate educational experience. Beautiful campus, many recreational activities offered..."
Sophomore,4,"I like that the College is a smaller campus, which gives it more of a community-like feel. The professors and students are all really nice, and are more than happy to give a helping hand. Being an International Student, I found that everyone was really welcoming and supportive, which was really nice!"
Freshman,4,"Wilson College is a very good academic college.  The professors all take a great interest in your success as a student, and their are many programs to help you through any and all classes.  The college does not provide many campus activities over the weekends however the city of Chambersburg has many activites to do over the weekends."
Freshman,4,Small friendly college with an active international student community. Students are supported academically to achieve their best results.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy Wilson College because it is a small school and I like the student to teacher ratio. I also like how helpful the teachers are with the students.
Freshman,4,"I love the VMT program. While it has its own issues and drama, the professors are amazing and the animals are great. It's very difficult, but hands-on. You better learn fast or switch majors! Cheaters beware: get caught, and you'll automatically fail that test until Joint Honor Council hears your plea."
Senior,4,"Wilson College is a good college when it comes to the education you will receive, but as with everywhere there are pros and cons.  Wilson's party life or activities is terrible.  If you even think about having a party you run the risk of getting kicked out.  You can have alcohol if you are of age of course, but if you get too loud because it is so small and stuck up, someone is going to complain.  The campus is beautiful.  The layout of the green and the buildings.  Reminds me of Hogwarts in Harry Potter.  Parking sucks because there is not enough parking spots in reference to how many people need to park.  There is a creek which runs through campus that is very nice to sit by and work on homework or assignments."
Freshman,4,"Wilson College is a small college located in Chambersburg, Pa. All of the professors i've encountered really care about helping you succeed and will do what ever they can to help you. The staff here is also very accommodating and pleasant. 
The dorm rooms here are very typical of a college dorm room. Small, but has everything you need. My only real complaint about this school is the food in the dinning hall. They're not open all day like some colleges and universities and the food is very mediocre. 
Over all i really enjoy the school and would recommend it to students, especially students who are seeking to become a science based major."
Sophomore,4,Currently a sophomore so it's hard to really review my whole experience when I'm really just beginning but so far things are great. Many improvements have been made and are being planned.
Sophomore,4,Professors are pretty easy to get along with and the people are friendly and helpful. Campus is easy to navigate
Freshman,4,So far I am enjoying my time at Wilson. The professor are very helpful and the small class sizes are amazing. Wilson also offers a variety of course and services to help you determine what the best major is for you. The writing lab is free to use and is a lifesaver for an written assignment in any class.
College Sophomore,4,"Wilson is a Liberal Arts school which means when the students graduate they will have varied backgrounds in all sorts of areas such as social studies, womens studies, languages, natural sciences, history, and environmental studies (plus more). These graduates will look better on resumes and career interviews because of the varied education they received. There are a couple career fairs and networking available to find jobs."
College Sophomore,4,The classes at Wilson have been pretty good so far. The class sizes are manageable and the biggest class so far was General Biology I & II with about 40 students per lecture time. The professors are pretty easy to talk to and are willing to interact and help students.
College Sophomore,4,"We have campus security there 24/7 and blue call boxes placed throughout campus. It would be nice to have more lights between the athletic building and the main spot of campus. The school has a forest right behind it and it is creepy at night walking by with limited light, but its not bad because the science building is nearby."
College Senior,4,i am not on campus much to be able to make a good answer about public safety
College Senior,4,"I actually had a great dorm. It was a single with a private bath with a great view of the campus. I'm not into college social life, so I didn't get involved in activities on campus or in my building, but I loved my dorm. Old building, no air conditioning, but nice wooden floors and pretty spacious for a single. It was filthy when I first got it, but with an extensive clean up and decorations, it was a cute little dorm."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a great school but, it needs some changes."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lack of diversity in students and staff
College Freshman,4,I am not very interest in sports.
College Junior,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus.  The security guards are very friendly and helpful and most everyone knows them by name.
College Junior,4,"Getting a Vet Tech degree from this school is very valuable. I don't have personal experience, but I've heard the career office does a good job of helping students get internships."
College Freshman,4,"Some of the buildings are sort of old, but they are in the process of renovating them"
College Freshman,4,The faculty is great and strive to help the students
College Freshman,4,there is no elevator and air conditioner in my hall but it is a cool place to be
College Freshman,4,everything is great in the school. there are nice people.
College Freshman,4,It is great and very safe. The safety and best professors provided with helpful teachers makes the school unique. I would choose the school again because it is a small and quiet place with condusive environment to promote learning
Recent Alumnus,4,I am a part of the VMT program and I know Wilson is highly accredited for this proram and the VMT professors all seem really awesome and want their students to do well.
Recent Alumnus,4,The school is very safe. There is security always on duty and the crime rate is extremely low to none on campus.
College Freshman,4,Campus feels very safe. I haven't heard of any crime on campus and we have campus police that are always around.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of options for students to earn money while in school
College Freshman,4,I really like Wilson so far and I am very happy that I chose this school to take my Bachelors program in.
College Freshman,4,I have had a wonderful experience at Wilson so far. There is always help when you need it.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy Wilson College. The liberal arts education I am receiving will benefit me more than someone who goes to a normal institution.
College Freshman,4,Students are offered a lot of help. You just have to reach out and apply
College Student,4,"The pros to the off campus housing is location, freedom, convenience. You feel like a true adult and you have the freedom of a true adult, the location is amazing because you are right across from Wilson College, and it's convenient because there are a lot of shopping and grocery centers to check out and utilize. There is reasonable and good parking, as well as safety which is beyond fantastic. In my opinion there is only one con when it comes to the off-housing campus and that is the building itself. But that is a small con, and quite frankly I like this flaw because it shows students that you have to start somewhere and it teaches them responsibility, not arrogance. I really respect that a lot. It makes me want to move into the off-housing campus!"
College Student,4,"There are not many that I know of, but the ones that are there are really good and appetizing. The locations are great, students discounts is awesome, Wilson always has variety, and the best places to check out are the ones that are closet to Wilson."
College Student,4,"The dorms to the campuses I visited was very neat, clean and livable. All the things and necessities were included in the dorms and more. The only thing that I believe that did not match was the size and price for the dorms themselves.  In my opinion, the smaller the dorms the cheaper they should be, the bigger the dorms the more expensive they should be. The social atmosphere was beyond great, the tuition costs were very agreeable, location and convenience was beyond fabulous, and the amenities was excellent! What I love about Wilson is that they accommodate to each of their students needs in any way possible and giving their students and better and stronger education. That is why it is the College for me; and that is why I give this campuses a four out of five."
College Sophomore,4,"The dining hall is really large and beautiful. The menus are basically the same each week. Dinner might be a little different from week to week. The dining hall has a lot of variety. They have vegetarian food, a salad bar, a fruit bar, a lunch meat bar, dessert bar, food off the grill bar, main dish bar, soup bar, and a ice cream bar. Doing the hotter days students have the opportunity to eat out side."
College Sophomore,4,The town is beautiful and lovely. It is semi easy to navigate because it has a lot of one ways. The cultural events are great. In the winter time there is a ice sculpture festival in the middle of town. Safety is great too because there are security guards on campus that check everything all the time. Shopping is great because all the shops are in one area. the attitude of locals toward students are that the are friendly and seem to be pleased that they met college students.
College Junior,4,"The crime rate on campus is very low because of the Honor Principle. The campus security officers are very good about patrolling and are always available to act as escorts. There are emergency phones all over campus and all are kept in good repair. The only criticism is that some pathways are poorly lit, but most people aren't out late enough to be concerned, or if they are they bring friends along."
College Junior,4,"The equestrian center and Veterinary Medical Center are the most talked-about facilities on campus.

The equestrian center includes three barns, paddocks for small groups of horses to minimize fighting, three riding arenas, and two cross-country areas. The horses suit a wide variety of skill levels, and everything at the barns is extremely neat and organized.

The Veterinary Medical Center (VMC) has kennels for dogs and cats, a lab animal area, multiple examination and surgery prep areas, and a fully functional surgery area, as well as an isolation/recovery room. There is a run for the dogs during bad weather. The VMC is home to the VMT club and its biannual dog washes."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus is small enough that walking and biking are usually sufficient to get from place to place, but because very little happens on campus most weekends, many people like to have cars to go places on weekends. The town is relatively small and so walking and biking usually work to get places, but people who shop in town need cars. There is a bus shuttle that runs about once every month, but a pass is a hassle to get because the availability hours to get a pass are small and it is either get one for a very expensive single trip or pay to have the entire year's shuttle service."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are relatively old, but one of the main dorms that freshmen are located in was recently renovated and is much nicer. Upperclassmen can choose to live with freshmen or to live in special, junior- and senior-only housing. Because campus is small, no dorm is very far from other events on campus, but people with horses often choose to live in dorms closer to the barn, while students into dancing or the arts live closer to the relevant buildings to avoid long late-night walks. The RAs spend a great deal of time creating hall programs which create a strong sense of closeness between students on their floor. There is laundry on every floor and a very spacious common area with a TV and many comfortable seats. Visiting other students does not require a lot of work, but students with male visitors must announce their presence on the floor. The housing process is very simple, a lottery based on graduation year (by credits earned). Generally everyone is satisfied with their dorm choices."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at Wilson are very welcoming. Because the college is small, the professors seek to know everyone they teach, and if a student is sick the professor often makes first contact to make sure the student is okay! The registration process is not that difficult because it is online. The worst part is getting the dates right and staying up until midnight on the correct day! Students can create their own major from available classes if they consult an advisor and the registrar's office. The most popular majors are the VMT major and the equine major, but there are also quite a lot of art students on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Wilson's application is very straightforward and the main problem I had was choosing my first-year electives! VMT program only requires that everyone pass their major courses with a C or higher; a D is considered failing. The application process is the same for every major, though scholarship applications vary by requirements. Some require evidence of membership in groups, others require volunteer work, and others require a certain GPA from high school."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is really cool about eachothers beliefs
Freshman,2,"Has a beautiful campus and most of the science and veterinary facilities are close to brand new. Professors are hit or miss, some are excellent and care about the learning of the students, while others appear to just be there to collect their paycheck and could care less about the class or students in general. Sports coaches for almost every team are very attached to certain players and will isolate the rest."
College Senior,2,"I've heard of several entire dorm alcohol problems, but I haven't seen any myself."
College Senior,2,"Quality of courses: low

Professors: some good, some bad

Variety: not good

Class styles: lecture, workshop, studio

Class sizes: don't make enemies - very small"
College Senior,2,"Awful. I went to this school for the specific program, not being told that if I would attend, I'd be the first student to go through the program. I registered for classes before my first semester here --- they signed me up for classes I already completed through high school and my transfer school. They told me I failed to give them my transcripts --- after I sent copies of my receipt and contacting the transcript companies myself, the school mysteriously found them in someone's email inbox. This caused me to spend money and time completing requirements that I already completed.

This school has so many flaws, but most importantly, after completing the requirements for my major, I feel completely unprepared to enter the workforce in the area I paid more than $50,000 in which I was formally educated. I believe that this school has become so immersed in the idea of being diverse that it is lacking academically. They almost didn't run a class I needed for my major because they had no one to teach it. At the last second, they hired an adjunct that already had two jobs and it was clear throughout the semester that our class was an afterthought to her. The class was a complete waste of my time and money because out of the entire semester, I feel that I know as much about the subject matter as I did before taking the class. Overall, I would suggest to anyone that they seriously reconsider any second picks before accepting Wilson."
College Sophomore,2,"The only off-campus housing are apartments in town. Thankfully, Chambersburg is a small town and the housing is never far from campus. The only way students find out about available apartments is by the advertisements that are posted."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do on campus
College Freshman,2,The food is nasty here
College Freshman,2,The weather is horrible this year
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do here at night on or off campus. My friends and I usually just end up playing cards or watching movies.
College Freshman,2,"Campus computers are fine- just typical school PC's. The printing allowance is plenty ($20 free each semester at 3 cents a page), though there often isn't paper. The network and wireless are unreliable and mostly slow, but the availability of free Ethernet cords (and an Ethernet hookup in each room) helps."
College Sophomore,2,"I hate the college food, but that may be because I am a picky eater and vegetarian. If you like interesting choices and lots of meat, you'll love it here."
College Sophomore,2,I&#180;m a vegetarian and so it is for me really difficult to find something to eat Off-Campus.
College Sophomore,2,Our nurse does not know much but our athletic trainer is amazing! She helps with everything you need but this is only if you are invovled in sports.
Alum,1,"The two senior doctors of the education department—at the time I was there (2010-2011)—were horrible. They were clearly more concerned with preserving themselves than the success of the students.

The math department was equally in disarray. Two of the professors never seemed to have their act together for class, often tripping over themselves with regard to topic and solving equations. Myself and a couple other students missed a few questions on an exam based on what the professor dispelled in class. When confronted, they couldn’t clarify the solution approach and didn’t come up with the correct answer either. We went to the Dean and—in short—was told: “We [sic] should have sought clarification.” If this were the case, we’d have to second-guess the professors with every comment they make. You’re paying them to educate you, not misinform or mislead you."
College Senior,1,Very very hard to land an internship in the area
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek Life at Wilson College.
College Sophomore,1,"I think it is horrible that the school does not allow off campus housing for upper class students. The community could easily support off campus housing with all the multi-family, older homes in the area."
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing within walking distance, and only a few to choose from."
College Freshman,1,As and underage individual there is not much to do during nights.
College Senior,1,You will not move on to the next level and will have to re apply to the college next year.
College Junior,1,"The College lives on an Honor Principle and there are many people on campus who feel the need to tell on others for stuff that isn't relevant to them, or things that they should be worrying about. Everyone is nosey."
College Sophomore,1,we do not have much/any variety and i often find myself eating cereal for breakfast/lunch/dinner. not good food.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. There are not nearly enough parking spaces near some of the residential buildings for everyone to have a parking spot. The only other option when there isn't a parking spot is to park in a ""illegal"" spot and get a fine. Or you can park in another residential lot which is across campus but then you can have to walk across by yourself at night which isn't right."

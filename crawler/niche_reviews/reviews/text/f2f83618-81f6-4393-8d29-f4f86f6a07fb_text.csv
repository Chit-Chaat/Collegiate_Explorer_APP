Alum,5,"I applied ED in 2016. I knew from the moment I set foot on campus as a high school student that this was going to be the school for me. I'm a woman of color and my time there wasn't perfect, but in terms of academics and setting me up for success in the career of my choice, this was top notch. My friends from undergrad are still some of my closest friends now. My professors were my biggest advocates when I applied for doctoral programs and I'm casually friends with them on FB now. It's a small school, so I did take advantage of the tri-co and took courses at Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, and Masters level courses at UPenn."
Alum,5,N/A.                                                                                                   .
Alum,5,"I had a very positive experience at Haverford overall. I chose it over Middlebury and Bowdoin because Haverford students seemed friendlier and more down-to-earth. Any of those schools would have been great, but Haverford fostered in me a level of intellectual curiosity and a social justice ethic that I'm not sure I would have gotten from other top LACs. There are tons of student funding opportunities to take advantage of, which sets students up well to be competitive for elite fellowships and graduate schools. There are better places to go if you want to go corporate and make as much money as possible, but Haverford is hard to beat for idealistic, intellectually curious students."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Haverford in 2019. I chose it over 6 other elite schools (including Williams and Bowdoin), and have never regretted my choice. 
The academics are rigorous, and if you put in the work, you can absolutely get a very high quality education. I really loved going to a school with an honor code that is ingrained in the culture of the school, from the social to the academics. It's not a perfect system, but it makes a big difference. Writing a thesis was also incredibly rewarding.
The culture can be a little difficult at times, with an athlete-non-athlete divide and clashing of opinions (the student body ranges from extremely liberal to moderately conservative, which can result in some disagreements).
I absolutely had my problems with some things at Haverford, but the student body is committed to improving its school, and having seen other colleges post-grad, I can see that Haverford is better than just about anywhere else."
Freshman,5,Haverford is a diverse and welcoming school with really good academics. It's very walkable to Ardmore which is a great town. Customs was a great experience as well.
Sophomore,5,Just finished my first year at Haverford and thoroughly enjoyed every one of my classes. The professors make every class enjoyable and I can always see myself improving from the advice they give me.
Graduate Student,5,"Haverford College is a healthy learning environment with a tight-knit student community that will help you succeed.  A good balance of hardworking yet caring qualities that you will feel the moment you step on campus.The college landscape is unreal. The Haverford College Arboretum is the oldest collegiate arboretum in the United States In 1834 by the world class English landscape gardener William Carvill.  While the option stands for students to live outside of campus, almost 100 percent of students live on campus at Haverford. 
As for teaching, you will not find better, even at ivy league schools. Unlike the big time universities where you encounter for the most part TA's during you undergrad years, at Haverford you will be taught by full professors that will know you by name after one class session.
Haverford students may also take classes at Swarthmore or Univ. Of Pennsylvania."
Niche User,5,This is a very diverse and welcoming college.  It is a smaller school and the campus is easy to navigate.
Senior,5,An overall positive experience. Some departments are fantastic but some are just so so. The athletes-non-athletes divide is apparent.
Senior,5,"Pros: Haverford has a very active social scene. And I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that the College is one of the best college party places within Haverford and Lower Merion Townships. A large number of students here are rich, refined, and resourceful or--more precisely in the words of the great inimitable--""gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely."" It may also be true that sometimes students are too ""gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely"" to talk to. 

A fragile line between Pros and Cons: Always look on the bright side of life--everything will be just fine.

Cons: The counseling & psychological services leave a bit to be desired. In any case, I am happy that most of the wellness centers around the greater Philadelphia area are affordable."
Freshman,5,"The social scene is way underrated. It’s got to be better than every other high caliber liberal arts college.

The location is awesome, the teachers have been supportive and giving strong instruction. The opportunities afforded to students are huge, with tech companies and financial institutions actively recruiting on campus. 

For such a small place, that’s very close knit, it’s incredible the resources and the top notch quality of the students. Student engagement and self governance on campus is also very active."
Senior,5,"Haverford is an incredibly liberal arts-oriented college. With that in mind, the academics is highly focused on students, professors are caring and among the most approachable you'll ever meet, and students respect and care for each other. Campus is scenic, quiet, and has an excellent location in the suburb. There are many restaurants and shops within walkable distance to campus. However, in terms of the social aspect, Haverford parties are somewhat lame in nature, but it is also an extremely safe and accepting environment. Despite that athletics is not commendable, either, the majority of students are more or less involved in varsity sports and seem to enjoy what they do. Overall, Haverford is a nurturing environment for both intellectual growth and maturing personality-wise, and is ideal for those who seek a non-distressing transition into college."
Sophomore,5,"I love Haverford for the people and community it fosters. The academics are tough, but that's to be expected. There is a great balance between social and academic life. The Honor Code sets this school apart from all others in that the community (faculty and staff included) attempts to be as respectful as possible, while still encouraging tough conversations, situations, etc. I've grown so much at Haverford in the one year I have attended, and cannot wait to see how it will continue to shape me."
Sophomore,5,"I am so glad I chose Haverford College. The students and teachers here are kind and willing to help you with anything. Haverford has so many resources like peer tutoring and question centers that have helped me succeed in my first year. However, it is not perfect. This year there were many problems with the honor code and student vs student-athlete ""divide"". Although we pride ourselves on being able to have civil dialog, many times that is not the case."
Sophomore,5,"Haverford is an top-notch school academically with a very welcoming social environment for the most part. The customs program is something that really stands out to me, though YMMV.

My major gripe would be the spending on unnecessary building projects that would be better devoted to financial aid; the endowment is being mismanaged (though granted it is still in the national top 50 for student to endowment ratio). Applicants should also be aware that there is a significant divide and tension between athletes and non-athletes."
Freshman,5,"Great inclusive community. You get to know people in your customs group really well. The college really does care about you as a person, not just academics. The Honor Code here is also a big thing, you get to have take home exams, no RA's raiding your room for alcohol, and people accept you no matter what you choose to do or not do."
Freshman,5,"The most amazing school you will ever go to. The kids are so smart and the culture is both collaborative and fun. People study hard but also know how to have a good time. When applying to colleges I got so caught up in going to an Ivy League or ""big name"" school but every employer from J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley look so highly on Haverford students. If you want to go to a ""presidious"" school save it for grad school. Most Haverford students get into Harvard, U of Penn, and Columbia for a Ph.D or MBA. Don't look down upon Haverford because it is truly an amazing place."
Freshman,5,Great fit!  Close knit group with diverse backgrounds. Faculty members are devoted to helping students.
Sophomore,5,"I loved the campus and its proximity to Philadelphia. Haverford has a lot to offer, so long as you make an effort to use your resources. The fact that the school is so small makes it a bit limiting not just socially but also  professionally, seeing as big recruiters generally don't come her. However, it has the reputation for being academically excellent, and the curriculum is rigorous enough to exercise your critical thinking, creativity, and work ethic."
Junior,5,"Nice surroundings, great teaching.  There is a very good atmosphere that allows you to learn and discover your talents"
College Freshman,5,"Haverford embodies the idea of collaboration over competition; no-one talks about grades, for instance. The area is beautiful, the facilities are superb, and the people emphasise the role of community through the lens of the all-encompassing Honor Code."
College Junior,5,"Registration process is painless--it's very unlikely that you won't get into a class you want unless it is extremely popular. Professors are always a matter of personal preference--there are teaching styles that work well for some and not for others. I have really enjoyed almost all of my professors, and respected them both as experts in their field and excellent instructors. Classes are engaging, unique, and offer knowledge in areas that are especially interesting to Haverford students. We have a Peace, Justice, and Human Rights department. A lot of our classes examine very relevant issues around economics, race, politics, scientific innovation, etc. The workload is moderate, but you definitely have the power to control your own stress. Professors are known for giving more/less work and they're very clear about assignments in their syllabi. We also have self-scheduled exams! Whether you stay in your comfort zone or challenge yourself with your classes, your workload almost always depends on time management."
College Junior,5,"Even if I haven't loved all of my professors, my classes have always been interesting. There is a wide variety of fascinating and relevant courses offered at Haverford, and there are some incredible professors. The two classes where I wished there had been something different about the style of instruction were classes that I took my freshman year, before I was well acquainted with the departments and before I had a decent number of upperclassmen contacts that could provide me with prof suggestions and reviews. Class sizes are generally very small and most center on a seminar/heavy-discussion style (at least in the humanities and social sciences). Although students can take classes at  U Penn and Swarthmore, the most common exchange is between Haverford and Bryn Mawr, which have complimentary departments and scheduling. I have really enjoyed the accessibility of Bryn Mawr classes--they double the catalog of courses and are the exact same in terms of credits."
College Junior,5,"I haven't noticed a lot of recruiters on campus, however our career center does a great job of connecting students with organizations that they are interested in."
College Junior,5,"Housing is great because most people can get a single. I have yet to have a roommate at Haverford, and with just one year left, I don't plan to have one. Tritton (a freshman dorm) and Kim (an upperclassmen dorm) are the nicest college dorms I've ever seen--they look like 5 star hotels. I think our housing cost is higher than other schools, but you can clearly see why when you get on campus. Gummere is largely considered the worst dorm because it is old, has a confusing layout, and has small showers, but it's honestly on par with most other colleges' dorms."
College Junior,5,"The great thing about Haverford is that so many activities are student led, so you have a lot more power than students at most schools do. If there is ever anything that you want to do, it's so easy to just join a club, and if there's something that you want to do that is not already happening on campus, it's easy to just start something on your own and even get funding from the school."
College Freshman,5,"I love going to college at Haverford.  It's almost everything I want in a college.  The social life isn't overwhelming but it's always fun and exciting.  I'm learning a ton in my classes and I've gotten to know a lot of my professors.  I've joined various activities that I wouldn't have been able to join at a larger school.  I feel a sense of intimacy with the campus due to its small size.  The honor code also makes Haverford a great place to be.  I do wish Haverford students were more politically involved and talked about topics such as class, race, etc. more, but I think that aspect of the college can improve."
College Freshman,5,The honor code shapes much of campus life and is a great thing about Haverford.  Not only does it affect academic life but it affects social life as well and makes sure everyone is looking out for one another.
College Freshman,5,"The academics are amazing at Haverford.  The class sizes are very small, so you get to know your peers and your professor very well.  Office hours are another great resource so you can get to know your teacher and also get one on one help from them.  The class lottery sometimes doesn't work out the way you want it to, but you can usually get into a class eventually if you really want to."
College Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful.  Most the facilities are of quality also.  There's always something to do whether it's during the week or on a weekend.
College Freshman,5,"Safety & Security is always there to help.  No one is afraid to go to them if they need something.  Also, health services is extremely accessible."
College Freshman,5,"While some introductory courses like chem or psych are classes of 50 people, most are smaller than so. As a first year, I even had a class of 7! There are so many opportunities to establish a great friendship with your professors in this close-knit community. There's a good mix of seminar- and lecture-style classes.

The variety of courses offered is a great plus, especially with the Quaker and TriCo college consortium. Haverford kids can take classes at BM, Swat, and Penn, all of which equally count towards the GPA"
College Junior,5,Campus is not strict at all
College Junior,5,Haverford does an excellent job helping their students study in the field they are interested in.
College Junior,5,"I love the classes I have been taking, both those that count for my major and those outside of my major."
College Junior,5,The Customs program at Haverford is a great thing to be apart of and I would choose to go to Haverford if I could do it all over.
College Sophomore,5,"Students at Haverford like to experiment and have a good time. That being said, it is also a welcoming community full of dedicated students, so drugs and alcohol are lower priorities for most. The school is very good about protecting students from law enforcement, and will break up a party before the law gets involved."
College Sophomore,5,"Haverford has put me in a great position for pursuing graduate education and, ultimately, a career."
College Sophomore,5,"Haverford is very committed to student-athletes. There are no classes between 4pm and 7pm to allow for practices and games. The Ford may have a nerdy reputation, but the bottom line is close to 40 percent of students are varsity athletes. Games are well attended with baseball and men's basketball being the most popular. The weight room is fantastic, and student athletes enjoy free, daily laundry service. The school has done a phenomenal job in building competitive athletic teams."
College Sophomore,5,"Couldn't be happier with my academic experience at the Ford. My classes are interesting and engaging. Make no mistake about it, Haverford is very intense and challenging at times, but the professors are invested and generally very accommodating."
College Sophomore,5,They just let you do your own thing to some extent. A lot of trust is put in the students.
College Sophomore,5,No worries at the Ford. Campus safety does a good job.
College Freshman,5,They treat us as adults and everything is dandy
College Freshman,5,"Student run alcohol policy so it is not against the rules for underage students to partake, making safety the number one concern because people do not drink in private."
College Freshman,5,"They are intense. Do not be deceived by the fact that most courses earn only 1 credit, you will work yourself into the ground to earn it - but in a good way. Classes here are hard (no matter what kind of high school background you come from), and give a lot of work, but hey - at least you know you're getting your money's worth!"
College Freshman,5,Love it. Perfect place to just walk around and discover a new store when you just need to get off campus!
College Freshman,5,"The college understands that students will have access to alcohol at any college they attend. What makes Haverford special is the complete absence of shots while alone in your room. Because drinking is relatively open and accepted, everyone feels comfortable calling for help if someone is in danger. It is less likely for students to get alcohol poisoning because they aren't taking lots of shots all at once. The administration has a lot of programs that help students understand the dangers of drinking and in general choose to take a preventative rather than punitive approach."
College Freshman,5,It is very clear that the academics at Haverford are the reason that every student is here. The professors are all obviously knowledgeable and capable. The other highlight is your fellow students; everyone is excited to learn and participate.
College Senior,5,"Based on my friends experiences at places like Yale, Harvard, and Penn, I can confidently say Haverford is harder than Ivy League schools; we are assigned far more work and it's much harder to get As. That said, you have a lot of support and the professors really want to help you succeed. These professors are at Haverford because they want to get to know you as an individual and as a student and I have had some really thought provoking and life affirming conversations in my professors' office horus. Intellectuals thrive in the close classroom environment here and you hone your skills articulating your thoughts, thinking critically and creatively, and developing your ability to write."
College Sophomore,5,"The People Here Are Amazing – I have my mind blown on a daily basis when I'm at Haverford, by the incredible minds of the professors I have the honor to learn from as well as the amazing students I'm lucky to be peers with. For the most part, everyone's pretty open and friendly, and happy to have a deep conversation with you, or just be goofy. I'm betting you'll meet some of the best people of your life here--I know I have."
College Sophomore,5,"Really Can't Complain – I have everything here that I could ask for. I'm consistently entertained, and quite happy."
College Freshman,5,"So Many Options – Along Lancaster Ave, where many other colleges are situated as well, there are many great and price-friendly restaurants off campus.  The whole street is lined with 3 miles of restaurants and convenience stores.  The most popular places that Haverpeople go to are the Chinese/Japanese resturant, Chipotle, Peace a Pizza, Ardmore Pizza, Indian food, etc.  Anything you could imagine, exists.  There are more upscale restaurants as well, which are normally filled with residents of the Main Line, not just college kids.  Anything you could want, probably exists within walking distance of HC."
College Freshman,5,"Safety First – Be safe - you will be fine.  The campus is safe, and we have probably the most cohesive community around."
College Freshman,5,"So Much to Learn - So Little Time – I came from a pretty rigorous private school, which prepared me well for Haverford.  That being said, I am challenged more than I thought possible.  But in a really good way.  No one here talks about grades - it just isn't done - because everyone is scary smart.  But we challenge each other in areas other than grades."
College Freshman,5,"NO LOANS! Haverford met all of my need, and met it entirely with grants.  It doesn't get any better than that!"
College Freshman,5,"Like a 'Ford – The facilities at Haverford are exceptional. The athletic center is brand new and all of the equipment is easily accessible at any time of day to accommodate different exercise schedules. The student center is open and running with mail and a small bookstore. The libraries are open most of the day, and 24 hours during finals week, to allow students to have a quiet study environment. There are campus activities through our group called FAB ""Fords Against Boredom"" that allows alcohol-free/drug-free events to happen weekly and monthly to encourage students to de-stress during the weekends. The general campus aesthetics are wonderful, everyone who walks on campus loves it and notices how pleasant it truly is to be a 'Ford"
College Freshman,5,"Overall, the academics at are wonderful. The professors are approachable and always willing to help if there are any questions or concerns. The registration process is swift and the move in is more than exceptional. The workload is a lot at times, but everyone finds a way to manage their time and stress loads. Studying abroad is very common. Haverford very accommodating to every thing a student needs. The popular study area is Biology because our program is very intensive and prestigious, but psychology is another popular subject as well as the education program."
College Freshman,5,"The best education you could ever get – Our professors are phenomenal.  Even the ones that annoy you are brilliant.  People here study for the sake of learning, not for stupid tests.  We still study hard for tests which are very hard but most Fords will agree that they came here to learn not to pass. "
College Freshman,5,"So cute – One of the cutest things Haverford does is advertise by writing on the floors of the paths in front of the library and dining places in chalk.  It is not uncommon to find out about a big event like a movement or a big dance or concert in this way.  Just another one of the things that makes Haverford such a wonderful, quirky place. "
College Freshman,5,"Haverford is perfect for Freshman who have a vast variety of interests.  The school is Liberal Arts which means they value breadth not depth, at least until you declare your major right before Junior Year.  It's actually best that you don't come in with a set mind on what you want to study.  I mean, if you want to be Pre-Med, you can begin fulfilling those requirements but keep an open mind."
Junior,4,"great people, great professors, great school. really opened my eyes to cultural and racial issues in the world. people here are generally very nice and intelligent and care about other people. there are not that many class options or majors if youre interested in something niche but you can take classes at other schools in the tri-co (Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore) as well as UPenn but it is kind of a hassle to get there."
Junior,4,"haverford did pretty well with the facilities they have to make my online experience enjoyable but it obviously was not the same as an in person experience. I would have preferred if all my professors had lectures that all students had to be at the same time so that I was forced to be engaged and participate. obviously this only is ideal for people who live in the same time zone as the professors so this option likely isn't feasible, or fair."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is incredibly nice and sweet. I was surprised at how welcoming and accommodating the faculty is. Dorms are good, I like that they are mostly singlesThe food does get repetitive and is generally bland."
Senior,4,"Loved my time at Haverford but for different reason than most. I was an athlete and thoroughly enjoyed my time with my teammates and the academics are bar-none at Haverford. My downsides were the lack of social scene options on campus which can be frustrating, but that is part of being at a small school."
Niche User,4,"I absolutely loved the atmosphere of the campus. The students all looked hard-working but stress-free. I appreciated the close-knit community of the school compared to prestigious schools in the city, yet there was still movement and multiple different things to do to have ""fun"" off and around campus. Haverford is my dream school!"
Freshman,4,"While Haverford is very different from what I grew up with, I've met many friends that have made me feel at home. One thing that I really enjoy about Haverford is that the students here prioritize collaborating with other students over competing in class. The teachers here are very easy to approach and make themselves available whenever you need them, and the campus is gorgeous."
Freshman,4,"The best thing about Haverford is the amount of freedom that the students have. You can schedule your own final exams, and in general the students are trusted with a lot of privileges both inside the classroom and outside of it. It is a small school, so you do see the same people every day which can at times get a little annoying, but overall the people are very friendly, and you will make very close friends."
Freshman,4,"It offers a robust and diverse academic experience, with courses ranging from the studies of sacred texts to the history of the early United States."
College Freshman,4,"Professors really care about students, and the classes are generally very interesting.  There is a pretty big workload, but it is definitely possible to do well if time is managed well, and there are many resources on campus to turn to for help with academic work and planning."
College Freshman,4,"The Safety and Security office at Haverford is great.  They are very approachable and helpful, and they do a good job of addressing problems when they arise.  I think more people feel very safe on this campus and the loss of property is not a common problem here at all."
College Freshman,4,"While Haverford has fewer alumns than other, bigger school, from what I understand people in the network try hard to help other people in the network/students still going to the college."
College Freshman,4,"Professors here really care about the success of students.  They have plenty of office hours and are happy to meet with students outside of those hours if they are asked to.  I've definitely had some professors who were better than others at explaining the material in the class or who were much more engaging and interesting than others, but I think all over them had good intentions and attempted to be fair to the best of their ability."
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus.  I currently live in what is generally considered the worst dorm on campus, and I still really like it; I would be happy to keep living here for the next three years of college.  Since Haverford does not have a huge campus, most dorms are really close to classes - it takes me less than five minutes to walk to my farthest class."
College Freshman,4,People don't generally attend games which is a bit of a bummer. Most of the teams are pretty competitive in the Centennial conference and I have heard good things about the coaches. The teams are pretty close knit groups socially. Facilities are up to date and I have no complaints with them.
College Junior,4,"Haverford is very liberal and I would say the vast majority of people make a concerted effort to make the community an excepting place for everyone. Of course we have problems, who doesn't? Despite our stated values and the general inclusiveness of our campus, we are a largely white, middle-upper class community. I can't speak for minorities on campus because I'm a white/hetero/cis-gendered woman and I have it pretty easy. There are spaces for expression and discussion of the issues that our community experiences and I think in the current climate people are starting to speak up more than ever. There are a number of groups trying to bring awareness to various types of privilege on campus (economic, racial, etc.) and just get people to acknowledge it and talk about it. Students have expressed problems with microaggressions and indifference toward injustice. I think we have a lot of systems in place to handle instances of offensive behavior among students and generally people in the community look out for one another. However, our values and image sometimes lead us to forget that things happen here too, even if we seem like a community where they wouldn't."
College Junior,4,"Campus security is awesome. Haverford is generally very safe. It is an ""open"" campus, meaning that the surrounding community can enter freely during certain hours (just not in the middle of the night), which has occasionally caused problems, but not anything serious. I have not personally had any experiences with sexual assault, but it does occur. I would say that it occurs at a rate much lower than most schools, but like at any other American college, it's an issue."
College Junior,4,"The career center works really hard to help students find internships during the year/summer and jobs after graduation. I would say that the network of Haverford alumni, because it is such a small and tight-knit community, is really strong. If an employer who went to Haverford years before you finds out that you were in the same improv comedy group as they were, it's a helpful boost. Haverford is especially well-connected for students who are seeking opportunities in social-justice related work. The curriculum and program at Haverford is also geared in some ways toward giving students a strong starting base for a career in academia."
College Junior,4,"There is enough housing for all students. There are a variety of housing options and it is generally not too difficult to get your first or second choice (a little harder if you are a rising sophomore). The housing coordinators are extremely accessible and kind. We have community houses, dorms, and on-campus apartments, all of which are generally good quality."
College Junior,4,"There is very little crime on campus, mostly thanks to the honor code. However, because of the honor code, many people think that Haverford is completely absolved from the prospect of something bad happening, which is certainly not the case. Our rates of crime and reported sexual assault are lower than a lot of places, but they are not nonexistent."
College Junior,4,"I have had some really great professors and intriguing courses at Haverford. And, although I am a Haverford student, I am majoring at Bryn Mawr--so I haven't taken any classes that weren't art at Haverford in a while. Even though I haven't taken many Haverford classes recently, I think it's awesome that I am able to major and minor at Bryn Mawr (the International Studies and Italian departments are at Bryn Mawr and don't exist at Haverford). I have also taken a class at Swarthmore and hope to take a class at UPenn next year. The classes in the Tricollege Consortium (Haverford, Bryn Mawr, and Swarthmore) are all pretty small; the largest class I have taken was 40 people and the smallest class I have taken had 6 students. Professors are required to have office hours, which makes them available if you have any questions or just want to start a conversation about something, but if you can't make a professor's office hours, then it is usually pretty easy to schedule a better time to meet."
College Freshman,4,"Although I feel like Haverford is a very safe environment, there are incidents of sexual assault here too like in any other school. However there are many facilities and counseling if a person does feel like talking about a sexual assault incident."
College Freshman,4,There are many research opportunities at Haverford for teachers and there are many facilities that help with finding a job or internship.
College Freshman,4,I am only a freshman but I am loving Havrford thus far. There are may opportunities around campus and the teachers are very helpful. I feel that Haverford is a true community. The party scene is okay and the housing is great. The Customs team understands you and you can go to them for anything without judgement.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of housing options where some are designed for freshmen and the others for upperclassmen. The custom people live with you during freshmen year. The apartments are a little further from campus so that's a minus.
College Freshman,4,I love Haverford. Everyone is nice and understands each other. The Deans and Customs people are there for you whenever you need help. The teachers trust us and do anything to help us understand the subject.
College Sophomore,4,"I am very glad that I was accepted at Haverford because it is a wonderful place to study and learn.  I feel I am grown tremendously in my first year there,

The intellectual atmosphere helps the resoning and discussion and the fellow students are stimulating and come from a number of different backgrounds."
College Sophomore,4,"Filled with great, nice, well-rounded students. Very challenging/rigorous academics, but worth it! Close and personal relationships with the more-than-willing-to-help professors. Small class sizes."
College Freshman,4,"Dining options in the nearby towns are often a trek, but worth it. Places like Chipotle are popular destinations among students. There are a number of good restaurants in Bryn Mawr and Ardmore, within walking distance, although a car makes it much easier to go off-campus for food."
College Freshman,4,"The administration mostly leaves the students to their own devices, trusting to the responsibility and integrity outlined in the honor code. Sometimes, certain administrators overstep their bounds, but generally they work with the students to ensure the best experience possible."
College Sophomore,4,Off-campus dining is a little bit expensive but there are plenty of diverse options in walking distance including both chain restaurants and unique restaurants.
College Sophomore,4,The honor code allows students to have a lot of freedom and responsibility and there is not a lot of interference from administration because the students are trusted and make their own rules.
College Freshman,4,The mainline is a nice place to live in.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of options, most are walking distance.  Many off campus restaurants also deliver."
College Freshman,4,A ton of people are either varsity athletes or club sport athletes.  There's a P.E. requirement so that's part of the reason why some people do club sports.  Both types of teams host a lot of social gatherings for the entire campus to attend.
College Freshman,4,"Basically, you can take a great liberty in choosing to drink or smoke but it's better not to flash your beer bottle to a campus safety car that drives by if you're underage--just an unspoken rule. By the Honor Code, we recently established an alcohol and drug policy, such as the prohibition to drink in academic buildings. But since it was passed by the students, I believe many follow that without much enforcement by the administration."
College Freshman,4,"Probably because Bryn Mawr and Villanova are nearby, the delivery restaurants like Golden China, Insomnia Cookies, Tiffin, and Domino's are always available. They know the campus by heart.

While Haverford students also have access to Bryn Mawr dining options (as part of the BiCo dining plan), there are a handful of local restaurants to go to on a friday night to keep things interesting, like Snap Pizza. Favorite chain restaurants like Chipotle and McDonald's are also available."
College Freshman,4,"Games vs Swat seem to be the most attended. Love the playful rivalry with that school.

We may not have the most exciting sports game scene (as a  D3 school), but club sports are as popular. Because Haverford requires 6 quarters of Physical Activity within the first two years of your attendance, many people see frisbee, crew, rugby, etc. as a way to expand their social life.

I always find the lax boys and fockey girls together. Rugby pre-games are insane, and frisbee parties are a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,"Campus Safety is very reliable and approachable. They provide escort service at night every day, and does not exercise intolerance for drinking and smoking."
College Freshman,4,"Since the school is an arboretum, people in the area run, walk their dogs on campus. So glad bc I. Love. Dogs.

There's Suburban Square nearby and tons of strip malls. A 20-minute drive to the mall in King of Prussia. Take SEPTA and in a half an hour, you're in Philly. Not many attractions/events are walking distance, but if you can manage with public transportation / are friends with people with a car, local activities are at your fingertips."
College Freshman,4,"Haverford provides very spacious housing relative to my peers from other universities. Gummere subjectively is the worst housing provided: the building is one of the oldest, its hallways are narrow, and the showers are small.

Tritton and Kim are the nicest ones (very clean and have amazing bathrooms), but the walls are very thin...better not to try to sleep early on a Saturday night, if you know what I mean. People say that once you have HCA housing, you'd stick with HCA housing; lots of people love living with a full kitchen and private bathrooms; the buildings are modeled like apartments in the ""adult world."" However, the disadvantage is that everything is relatively far from those who live in South Campus.

Barclay is the housing that tends to be on Haverford Official postcards; its bathrooms are neither the worst or best, but the hallways are wide and the suitemate/common room set up is very spacious! (unless you're the few unlucky ones who are put in the forced doubles). A major perk of the North Dorms is the proximity to Lunt Cafe (honestly) but if you're not into the partying scene, maybe these dorms are not for you; a lot of partying happens there. Lloyd, furthermore, is unofficially the senior housing dorm; just FYI, Lloyd does not have laundry rooms, so you'd need to walk to the North dorms or Barclay whenever you have a cycle. Drinker House is the closest thing we have to what we call a ""frat"""
College Junior,4,It depends on what dorm you live in
College Junior,4,Academics are taken seriously and are the best part of the school. Very rewarding!
College Junior,4,"Great selection of majors, classes and awesome professors!"
College Junior,4,There is a lot of interracial dating and couples which is shocking! I appreciate the athlethic groups and clubs are diverse in ethnicity as well
College Junior,4,The Honor Code plays a large role in students' academic and social lives and creates an amazing atmosphere on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Haverford is an arboretum so the campus is beautiful. The COOP is an okay space, but it definitely grows on you."
College Sophomore,4,Transportation into Philly is easy and pretty cheap!
College Sophomore,4,"Campus wi-fi is shotty sometimes, but overall computers are accessible."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of good food near Haverford, but you will need a car to fully explore the Main Line. Public transportation into Philly is good, but expensive."
College Freshman,4,"60% of students are varsity athletes, but not many people attend games."
College Freshman,4,"The typical pay is 9 dollars/hour for the first year on the job, then 9.25 and so on but they are very flexible"
College Freshman,4,"Ardmore, Bryn Mawr and Haverford have great restaurants"
College Freshman,4,"We are not limited to our 1200 students, we've got Bryn Mawr girls and the ocassional Swatties as well!"
College Freshman,4,"You don't declare a major until sophomore year, but as a prospective music major I think it's fabulous. The music building and music library is one of my favorite places on campus and the major requires you to be a well rounded musician in terms of musicology, composition and performance. There are several ensemble and solo performance opportunities both serious and casual ranging from acapella, to open mic nights to the Chamber Singers or Flute Ensemble. Not to mention the faculty are spectacular, approachable and friendly!"
College Freshman,4,"Most people are genuinely nice, but your experience will be largely colored by your opinion of your customs group. The importance of accountability, independence and community is particularly stressed here and that can be difficult if the place you live fosters the wrong environment for you."
College Freshman,4,"4 seasons, Really beautiful trees and it's a pretty small campus so even if the weather sucks it's pretty easy to get indoors quickly."
College Junior,4,You should pay attention to the honor code and study what it means. You will be required to write an essay on it and how it connects to your values. 
College Junior,4,People seem to like it. I dont have a car. 
College Junior,4,I think the facilities are really pretty. There are spaces to hang out both casual and academic. So there is always a place to be depending on your mood. 
College Junior,4,there are several computer labs but they center around the same area. so if youre in a different place on campus youre gonna have to walk over to the computer lab center. the network if youre on wireless sucks. its kinda laggy. but if you use an ethernet or computer lab one it is really good. you dont need a printer at all. its free to make copies. i highly recommend to bring a laptop. 
Freshman,2,"Don’t be fooled by all the fluffed up 4, 5 star reviews. Haverford is...meh. The social scene is heavily dependent on whether or not you are an athlete, surprisingly 40+ percent of the student body is made up of athletes. So, social groups stem from team members, etc who already spend a lot of bonding time together, which is fine but considering how small a school Haverford is (probably smaller than your high school) and this large percentage it sucks for others. I’m kind of an introvert and I thought the small size would make meeting people easy, but it’s been the opposite and your options are limited. Aside from academics this is one of the reasons I’m transferring."
Junior,2,"As a junior, I’m regretting the choice of attending Haverford. Despite the diversity and equity values they preach, the students are pretty miserable. The guys are way too many arrogant jocks and the social s eve revolves around their parties. The professors are good, but the workload is excessive without a real reason. The administration is the underlying problem. They relentlessly put the institution above the students. Humanities are weak, STEM rules yet elite grad school admissions and fellowships are rare. I was so excited to attend this school, applied ED, have made both friend and good grades, but... it is not worth either the $$$$ nor the high misery quotient for these 4 years. Friends at other schools mostly way happier."
College Freshman,2,"Don't know much about off-campus housing. Almost everyone lives on campus. Occasionally students are kicked off campus or don't get the housing they want in the selection process, and move off campus. The housing around the school is expensive and limited."
College Freshman,2,"While the coop and lunt cafe offer nice alternatives to the DC, with good sandwiches, sushi, snacks, desserts, and other delicious but unhealthy options, their prices quickly add up. The DC's food is one of the biggest complaints among students, although it is slowly improving. After a few months, you learn what is good and how to make the most out of the food the DC offers."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot of selection in the Dining Center and the coop and lunt cafe cost money so that is not ideal either.
College Junior,2,All about the athletes and their group. They throw most of the parties and no one wants to go to a non-athlete party. Jerks!
College Freshman,2,"Christians, Republicans and lower-middle class people are completely outnumbered."
College Freshman,2,"It depends on your socioeconomic status, lower-middle/middle-middle class applicants beware."
Niche User,1,"Buyer Beware...
School is currently on-strike and has been closed for several weeks.  If you’re ok with a school that has disruptions to a student’s academic career, this may be a viable option. Teachers are great WHEN they’re teaching. If you hope to choose a school with  a more consistent program of instruction then this is likely not the school for you."
College Freshman,1,"No Greek life, but the closest thing to a frat would be the Drinker House, full of baseball guys."
College Sophomore,1,"Could not have been more disappointed by the food at Haverford College. It's borderline insulting.  I love almost everything about this school, but the Dining Center is a joke. The food is low-quality and prepared poorly. You can bet that almost everything you consume will be overcooked, including the coffee. The dishes are often unclean, yet put out for the students to use, and the staff can be rude at times. The Coop is decent, but isn't open on weekends, is very expensive, and is super-slow. The Dining Center is the single worst part of my experience at Haverford."
College Freshman,1,"The Dining Center food is the worst but the Coop and Lunt Cafe food is great, although they have terrible hours."
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,"The RA equivalent practically provides alcohol to the freshmen. As a freshman alcohol is pretty much inescapable, people are not ordinarily pressured but it depends on your hall. The policy is super lenient and ill enforced."
College Freshman,1,Not strict. All accountability falls on the student.

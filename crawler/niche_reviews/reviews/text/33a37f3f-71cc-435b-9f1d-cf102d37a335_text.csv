Sophomore,5,Ramapo offers amazing opportunities and selects amazing professors that genuinely round out students and expand their learning. I do not think I would be able to pursue my career at a different College because Ramapo provides me with all of the tools (and then some) to achieve my goals and ambitions. All of the students I have met at Ramapo have been nothing but helpful and encouraging in taking chances and overcoming challenges when facing them head on. I would recommend Ramapo College to any student!
Sophomore,5,Currently I am taking courses online and it has been a struggle to properly connect to come classes but all my professors are very understanding of the current situation. They are very accommodating and I love Ramapo College!
Sophomore,5,The campus to me is amazing. For the college to be small there’s so much to see that I haven’t even experienced yet. So many connections at this school that have helped students now and in the future. I knew the moment I first visited that this was the school for me.
Junior,5,"Ramapo College of N.J. has an extremely beautiful and welcoming campus. It's Gen Ed curriculum provides a huge variety of interesting courses and has helped me become a more well-rounded person. Due to its small size, professors are easily accessible, and you're able to build more personal relationships with them. The study spaces and on-campus housing is always stellar. One thing I would improve on campus would be Academic Advisement. From what I've experienced, some advisors are more personable than others, and many do not take into consideration individual student goals. It would be helpful to have an advisement session like they offer their freshman, where the head of advisement and a few student assistant help students plan out the best path for them."
Senior,5,Online classes are very easy to follow at Ramapo.  Professors communicate a lot through emails and canvas.  Hard not to do well in an online class.
Senior,5,Loved Ramapo!  Currently am a senior commuter but still feel so involved in the school! Tons of clubs/activities to join! Highly recommend joining greek life at Ramapo!  Makes your experience there completely different and fun!
Freshman,5,I attended school there before and love every bit of it. I dropped out then and decided to return after 25 years. I love my experience then and hope to fullfil my dream this year. The faculty were and I feel are the best for an old girl like me. I would recommend this school to anyone.

Freshman,5,I loved the college. Everyone was very friendly and helping. The campus was beautiful and had great programs.
Alum,5,"I liked my experience a lot! I'm a recent alumni (class of 18) and now making good money out of college. I got involved and was never too bored on campus. I do think there could be a lot done to improve the school, but I also think the state of NJ could support the school more too, Ramapo gets less money than any other 4 year public school in the state! It's a great school with small classes and I know it's a better school than all of the other public schools in the area. I don't regret my choice one bit."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Ramapo! Everyone is very accepting and the location of the campus is stunning! Transitioning into college is a lot easier when you feel at home, and at Ramapo, that's the feeling I get. I live a good distance away from the college but when I'm at my dorm I don't feel like I'm homesick or wanting to leave. There is a very homey vibe. The only thing is if you aren't involved with clubs or sports, it does get quiet on campus but being close to the city is very convenient."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy how Ramapo College puts emphasis on its nursing program. Even though it is tough, I know it is to prepare us and set a foundation for everything we are going to learn in the future. Overall, I've really enjoyed my first year at this school. The college is diverse and accepting of all its students. There are so many interesting courses to take, especially for gen-ed requirements and electives. As long as you are dedicated to your studies but also willing to take different opportunities that the school provides, then you will really find that this school is a hidden gem and has much to offer its students despite being a small community."
Niche User,5,Very nice campus and great nursing program. Everyone is very friendly and the dorms are very nice and clean. The food is not bad either.
Niche User,5,"I loved the people that were giving tours, and I loved the environment and feel of the campus. I would love to spend my next four years of my educational career there."
Freshman,5,I like the professors there and the resources the college offers. I also like how many groups and activities there are for students who live on campus and also for student who don’t live on campus.
Sophomore,5,"Ramapo college is an innovative, forward-thinking institution; truly a hidden treasure. I am currently in my sophomore year and commute to campus. The campus is nestled within the vastness of Mahwah while being easily accessible to Route 17 and NJ train network. The campus' efficient, simple layout enables both safety and convenience for all; the second floor of each academic building is connected to one another.  I have yet to meet a professor who was not passionate about not only their field of expertise, but more importantly, their students. I look forward to completely my bachelors degree at Ramapo."
Freshman,5,"Ramapo college of New Jersey gave me the opportunity to be more than a number. I feel valued and important, while receiving the best education possible.  The helpful staff, and diverse student life create a great campus feel. The dorms are absolutely amazing, and the dunkin on campus is a great bonus. The atmosphere of the campus is secluded while being open, it is surrounded by trees and close to the mountains, but at the same time you are 20 minutes away from shops and restaurants and 30 min away from the city."
Senior,5,"Ramapo College is filled with opportunities for hands-on experiences in the classroom, tons of 1:1 guidance with professors and professionals in the field, and provides a safe and stimulating learning environment."
Alum,5,"The campus is located in New Jersey but very close to New York city. The campus is not too crowded, great location. I found the teaching staff to be excellent. The class size small. The gym and cafeteria are very nice."
Sophomore,5,Ramapo College is a small comforting and welcoming atmosphere that provides an abundance of support and resources for their students. Ramapo college has many opportunities for students to become an active person on campus which can benefit students in so many ways. Our events and organizations bring our communities together and it is a chance to learn about of similarities and differences and how we can contribute to our society as a group. Ramapo has many amazing professors that will help guide your way through graduation. Staff and faculty do an awesome job in maintaining a efficient support student for each and every individual attending Ramapo college.

Sophomore,5,Ramapo has the best dorms in the state. I loved in Mackin my first year and loved it. The dorms really can me more idependence and showed me what it is going to be like living on my own. Living in the dorms gave friendships hat will last me a life time!
Junior,5,"I love this school. Everyone is so helpful. I forgot to fill out forms for the registrar for my current student loan, but they helped me with everything. My advisor has also guided me in what classes to take, and what is best for my career map. Ramapo offers job counseling as well as resume building."
Freshman,5,I will be attending Ramapo this year and am very excited. I come with intensions to learn a lot and grow as a person.
Junior,5,Ramapo College of New Jersey is an amazing school. It is beautiful. It is for students who like small schools because it doesn’t have a lot of student.
Freshman,5,I love being a Student at Ramapo College of New Jersey. All of the Professors are super nice and care about the students doing well in their classes. The dorms have been ranked #1 in New Jersey for two years in a row.
Junior,5,"My experience at Ramapo College was super fun and new. I love the view and the dorms so beautiful, full of nature. The academics is so great, you learn something new all the time and professors are very helpful. Ramapo is just a friendly environment. I would change the food they serve at the cafe because students are paying $1,000s of dollars and it should be better quality. Other than that ramapo is an amazing school and I had a great experience . The student life is exciting and different every time. Almost finish have one more year left."
Senior,5,A beautiful campus with dedicated and friendly staff. Great college culture and contentedness among students. Small enough to know people but big enough to meet new people.
Senior,5,"I am in the Social Work program at Ramapo College of New Jersey.  The faculty are extremely knowledgeable and work hard to ensure that each student has a clear understanding of the material.  The school was extremely helpful during the spring semester when I became homeless and quickly needed to find a place to live.  Working with the Residence Life department they were able to get into student housing, where I was able to move into an apartment on campus.  The college faculty and staff are always will to spend the time to assist the students with any and all of their needs."
Senior,5,"Ramapo is a very interesting place it has a lot of potential, but it’s all about what you make of it. A lot of students go home during the weekends."
Freshman,5,"I loved how the people at Ramapo deal with diversity, everyone there is really friendly and open to interracting with others. It’s not such a big school so you don’t have to travel so far for classes. RCNJ loves its students"
Senior,5,"Ramapo has been the best school I could ask for. The office of special services, which help with students with disabilities, has helped me more times than i could count. Free laundry and free printing also come in handy. The knowledgeable professors and small classes shape an excellent educational system. The only thing that could be improved in my eyes is the food offered."
Junior,5,"People do not see the perks of living on campus such as free laundry, AC, heating, your own bathroom, microwave and fridge... IT IS ALL PART OF THE TUITION. The other colleges I visited it was all extra. Plus, free printing !!!!"
Senior,5,"I am a biology major and I am commuter. At first, I wanted to become a doctor but Ramapo inspired me to follow my passion for forensic science. I’ve been at Ramapo for four years and my experience here has been nothing but amazing. I made friends for the rest of my life. Being a biology major has flourish my passion for plants."
Sophomore,5,I am going to be a Sophomore at Ramapo and I could not be any happier. My first here was amazing and I loved living on campus. I loved living on campus - I lived in Mackin Hall. The room is spacious and there is a dining hall right next to the dorm. It was very convenient since the business school is also so close to. Can't wait for the next 3 years.
Sophomore,5,"Ever since the first time I visited Ramapo, I knew it was my home. There are incredible staff members and professors always available to help, plenty of ways for students to get involved, and a beautiful campus. It is truly an amazing place."
Sophomore,5,Professors care a lot for their students. They take the time to listen and work with their students one-on-one when needed and are quick to respond to emails.
Senior,5,I still can’t believe I will be graduating soon. My experience at Ramapo has been nothing but amazing. Ramapo makes sure to be a home away from home. I love how I never had an issue here. I always got the classes that I wanted and never had a problem to go out at night. There are SO MANY events going on. My four years has been nothing but the best!
Junior,5,"I love Ramapo for so many reasons. First, every professor knows my name. This is very important to me because you are able to develop a relationship with them. Second, the campus is SO NICE. I feel safe walking around here at any time. Third, they want you to succeed. There are always internships opportunities and they really help you find the right internship for you."
Junior,5,I do not really understand why some people would write negative reviews about Ramapo. I love Ramapo. It is so close to NYC and they offer so many internships opportunities in the city. I never had a problem at Ramapo. I made so many good friends and I am so happy that I decided to attend here.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at Ramapo. I had an amazing experience and it was so much fun. I loved all my classes and living on campus was better than I expected. I was not sure about living on campus my sophomore year but after my experience, I am 100% sure that I will be living on campus all four years."
Senior,5,I have been a Ramapo student since my freshman year and I never thought about transferring. I love my professors and I have had three internships so far. Great school!
Senior,5,"My experience at Ramapo College of New Jersey has been amazing. I am currently going into my senior year here at Ramapo, I am involved in a social sorority which has been the best decision I ever made. I lived on campus until my sophomore year and I had the time of my life. Ramapo has gone above and beyond to help further my career, and I am excited and prepared to go off on my own next year."
Senior,5,"Ramapo College is a school that can be good for anyone. It is small enough to get around, but big enough for that college experience. A lot of amenities are included when and if you decide to live on campus! Free laundry, good food, air conditioning in every building. Students also are provided many resources like a center for reading and writing, free tutors and more. Free printing is an added bonus because as a college student i constantly need to print.I would recommend Ramapo to anyone who wants Professors who actually care about your learning, and for people who would utilize all the resources provided."
Niche User,5,A beautiful small campus. I love the nature and home-like feeling. I am going to be a first-year student fall of 2018 and I am so excited to begin my college journey and discover my career path.
Sophomore,5,I'm a sophomore here at Ramapo and am really enjoying my experience. From the excellent housing to the many sports and activities available on campus. The curriculum is challenging and the professors are inspiring. I can't imagine myself any where else.
Sophomore,5,The campus is very nice and beautiful!  The professor really care for their students. Dorms at campus are very nice then other colleges.
Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, and everyone is beyond nice. I can really tell they want me to succeed there and I feel like a part of a huge family. Professors are always available for questions, and peers are constantly available for extra help. It is very close to NYC, and buses transport kids to and from malls, cities and stores. There are many internships that can be found from New York, and there seems to always be activities planned right on campus."
Niche User,5,"Ramapo was my number one. Getting accepted truly changed my life. The school will always be my home away from home. Yes, I do commute, so I still live at home."
Sophomore,5,"I've had an excellent experience at Ramapo thus far. It's really easy to become very involved in the campus life, both as a commuter and as a resident. I've had good experiences with all of the staff in a variety of offices on campus. The College has also given me lots of opportunity, in terms of research, working on campus, and interacting with peers. In addition, I love the campus itself. We're located in the valley of the Ramapo mountains, with the Reservation right down the road. In the spring and fall particularly, the campus looks absolutely beautiful. I could not have picked a better place to attend college!"
Alum,5,"Ramapo is a beautiful college in the middle of the mountainous northern New Jersey. Parties are usually on Wednesday nights. The groups are divided into cultural cliques. Professors are great if you can get your first choice. Definitely take Ecology, Economics and Ethics! It's one of my favorite courses!"
Sophomore,5,"The professors at Ramapo really care about their field of study as well as their students succeeding. I have gotten personal attention at Ramapo from professors and faculty that has helped me feel more prepared for my profession in the future. Although there are not a lot of people on campus during the weekends, there is always something to do if you want to get involved and look for it. I am extremely satisfied with both the academics at Ramapo and the opportunities that it presents me with."
Junior,5,"I personally love Ramapo College. It is a small school that is deeply grounded in nature. If you are a party type then this school wont fit you, but if you are interested in a good education and nature then it is a perfect fit. The professors are also super qualified and the class sizes are remarkably small. I have loved it ever since I have arrived here."
Alum,5,"Ramapo College is a fine state school located in the rural, mountainous area of northern New Jersey. Aside from the scenery, Ramapo is always enhancing its buildings, so there may be some construction, but all to make your learning and experience worth it. Professors are always there to help and there are plenty of clubs and opportunities to make new friends. There is something valuable at Ramapo that any type of student will find. From those who enjoy partying and going out with friends to those who prefer quiet time in nature and a place to study. Ramapo will be your home."
Junior,5,"I love it at Ramapo. It is a great education for the value. A lot of people complain that it is boring, but the fact is they are boring people. Put yourself in any situation and the key is to be sociable. Something is always going on, you just have to poke around."
Freshman,5,I love Ramapo College. The class sizes are great and the professors are very helpful.The professors are always willing to help you if you need the help. Ramapo is the hidden gem in bergen county New Jersey.
Alum,5,"Attending Ramapo College of NJ was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The campus and beautiful with some of the best student housing and apartments in the state. You're education is top of line. There's only about 20 students enrolled in class, so you get the attention you need from your professors. Would have wanted to go anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,Ramapo College of New Jersey is a very good school. It is in a very calm and quiet area. It is a small school with not a lot of people which is something that I looked for in a school. The people in the school are very nice and overall it is a very great environment to be around.
College Freshman,5,I attended a summer program which allowed me to take 8 credits worth of classes and it was truly great. I learned more in the six weeks about life than I did in eighteen years.
Sophomore,4,"The campus of Ramapo College is small, and it is easy to locate any building in the area. The teachers are nice and friendly and are always willing to help in order to see you succeed. The food is nice, but a little pricey."
Sophomore,4,Ramapo is a pretty good school I personally like the environment and my peers. I think the professors there at least most are very knowledgeable and passionate on the subject that they teach. Due to the pandemic people had to switch to online learning which ultimately alternated and impacted everyone's lives differently. And even though there were new challenges due to the switch the school and professors tried their best to work with students and make the transition smoother which I thought was really helpful.
Sophomore,4,The experience at Ramapo College is great. I personally have enjoyed my first year of college the environment and my peers made it a memorable time. It is a pretty campus and the college in itself has a lot to offer students all you have to do is see the opportunity and take it.
Junior,4,Ramapo is great college for both commuter and resident students. The class size is perfect if you are the type to learn better in a smaller classroom size. You have a better connection with your professors.
Junior,4,"Due to COVID-19, many colleges had to transfer over to teaching classes remotely. I think most of my professors were pretty good with it. They were very understanding and was able to respond to email quickly."
Junior,4,"In general, my online classes at Ramapo have been pretty straightforward. While challenging due to their shortened nature, the online courses I've taken have had clear instructions and reasonably difficult assignments. From my experience, certain professors are less engaged with their students throughout the semester. I greatly appreciate the professors who actively respond and reach out to their students."
Alum,4,"I had a very positive experience at Ramapo. The campus is beautiful and located in an area with a lot of activities, restaurants and stores. The dorms are very clean and the best I have ever seen on college campuses. Dining hall was also very impressive with a lot of options. Staff very friendly. A small town campus feel and positive environment. I felt at home and very comfortable and miss my experience at Ramapo!"
Freshman,4,"very good dorms, could be more affordable, campus is far from everything else, teachers are mostly good"
Freshman,4,"I like the location and small classes. Dorms are very comfortable, food very delicious and a lot of to chose from."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of Ramapo is very active throughout the week, but is very quiet during the weekends. I have met many great professors and advisors who have thus far been helping in my education."
Alum,4,"The campus at Ramapo is beautiful and there is a hiking reservation. However, beyond that there is no nightlife and no places for students to hang out that are very close. Professors were overall respectful and very ready to help and write letters of recommendation. The dorm rooms and apartments appear very well-maintained and are very comfortable."
Freshman,4,"I am currently in my second semester of freshman year at Ramapo College of New Jersey. I am very pleased with the academics offered at the college, but the social life is very dependent on your efforts to go out. There is nothing to do on campus, which is why meeting people and going out together would be the only fun to have on campus. Other than that, the campus is beautiful and the vibe is very friendly."
Junior,4,"I love that I am able to go to the city within minutes, I also enjoy that it is in the mountains, and the school is also a train ride away from my home. The STEM department is good and I love how the class sizes are small and how the school focuses on having students take classes that are in the liberal arts section."
Junior,4,"The faculty seem to really care about their students but at the same time, with how busy they are, it is hard to set up an appointment at times for office hours."
Freshman,4,"The college has a very upstate New York vibes. It’s very down to earth and surrounding nature. It’s a beautiful campus with lots of trees and ponds. The college is on the border of upstate and 5 minutes from a town called Ramapo in New York.    
Students that come here are very polite and sweet."
Junior,4,I loved the whole experience of Ramapo College. From the outdoors with the beautiful nature scene to the great academic buildings and friendships to be made. Everyone is so caring and helpful no matter where you go.
Senior,4,"The classes and professors at Ramapo college are really great and informative. They provide great opportunities to share and express opinions on the different subjects. I am a music major with a double concentration in production and industry and taking a creative writing minor, so there are many opportunities for thoughts and opinions to be shared. The campus is very supportive of everyone attending the college. The campus itself is beautiful with many trees and some statues made by students. Overall, I am happy I chose Ramapo."
Sophomore,4,"At Ramapo, you truly get out of your college experience what you put in. If you want to have a good time and make friends you have to get involved in various clubs and organizations. There are several different ways to get involved including academic clubs and societies, varsity and intermural athletics, social sororities and fraternities, etc.."
Sophomore,4,"Ramapo is a good school, however it is inconsistent, as the quality of courses and professors varies significantly from discipline to discipline. However the school has a lot of opportunities and resources, and I think it is overall a good choice, especially for those pursuing sciences and arts. I appreciate the small class size, which is not as small as advertised but is still small enough to allow better learning."
Freshman,4,Starting school in Fall 2019 after completing Marine Basic Training and School of Infintry Training.  Visited college again for accepted students day and has only confirmed my decision to enroll for my bachelor's degree.
Freshman,4,"If you are an international student, do consider Ramapo. The people are friendly, the food is good enough, and the professors are caring."
Sophomore,4,"I like the fact that it has such a close environment. Your interactions with teachers, students and other faculty feels more intimate than most college due to the small size. And because of that, it is a much more personal college experience. It is a very beautiful campus filled with beautiful nature and nice trails to go hiking as well. And if that's too slow, New York, Paramus and other malls/ shopping centers, restaurants are nearby. The college also provides very nice internship opportunities, especially to work in the city. I am in the Music Production program and I can safely say it is an amazing environment to create and share. This type of networking stems to other majors as well due to the small campus size, it is easy to gain those connections for success. The teachers also care just as much. They are challenging but also want you to challenge yourself in the way that you think about your major. Overall, a great school for achieving a great career."
Freshman,4,"I am almost halfway through my second semester at Ramapo College and I am loving it. All of the buildings are very modern and I admire how clean they keep the entire campus. The people I am surrounded by everyday are all so warm and very welcoming, and because the school is not so huge, I feel I know a lot of people. Starting my second semester, walking into all of my classes on the first day, there was at least 1 person that I already knew, making the transition to the next semester seemless.
 I have experienced two professors whose teaching does not necessarily correlate with the course material. This makes it a bit more difficult when it comes time for exams, but if you make study groups with friends, or visit any one of the numersous tutoring centers on campus, it pays off in the end."
Niche User,4,"Ramapo is a beautiful campus that makes each person feel at home. It is not as small as some may think and the dorms are much nicer than those compared to other schools. I am a nursing major and it is by far one of the best schools to go to for nursing! Visit it for yourself though!! You have to see how it fits for you and only you. You'll get a vibe right away, trust it!"
Sophomore,4,"Ramapo College is a very good college and provides a great opportunity to get involved on campus and in the community. The standards for living are set high at Ramapo, therefore, the dorms are well organized and clean. Professors build relationships with students and make a nice learning environment. The food could be better."
Freshman,4,"I am a commuting  freshman. There really isn't much going on around campus. If you are just looking to get your education and not the expensive ""college experience "" this is the school."
Sophomore,4,Everyone is really nice and due to the smaller classes students get to know the professors more and are able to better establish connections. The campus is nice especially in the fall.
Sophomore,4,Ramapo is a nice college that works with the students in order to give the best experience that they can.
Junior,4,"I've been at Ramapo since Fall of 2018. I transferred to this school from Bergen County Community College. So far, everything has been good. This school definitely gives you opportunity to expand in the theater world and have great teachers here to help you succeed. If theres one change I would make would to be to add a Theater Business class instead of having us to take a Visual Imagination class as a requirement. Visual Imagination is a art class which has nothing to do with being an actor or teach an actor how to do certain things. It's a waste of time and money. If we learned how the theater district works and how business is made and how we should present and act during certain situations. I feel as though that would benefit us more rather than give us a art class"
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my experience at RCNJ. The class sizes were small, the students were diverse and there were always plenty of events and clubs to be involved in. I had a great academic experience there as well, my professors were caring and really helped me gain skills that helped me post-graduation."
Senior,4,"Small, but beautiful campus with very helpful, caring professors. Dorms on campus are high-quality . Up-to-date computer labs; dining is buffet-style at two cafes, along with a Dunkin Donuts on campus and other options."
Niche User,4,It is a great school. I know many students and professors and they all love it there. Ramapo has a beautiful campus and many equestrian facilities close by.
Freshman,4,"I really like the atmosphere of the college, as looks very modern, while it also surrounded by nature. It is a small college, so it is very accessible to go to your classes. There are many ways to get involved, with over 100 clubs and organizations you can join. The staff is very friendly as well. Just wish there were more food options at the college."
Alum,4,"The professors at Ramapo were all very good. I appreciated the small class size, and feel I was able to form good relationships with most of my professors. The administration was frustrating at times, particularly when I had to withdraw for medical reasons and they made it very difficult for me to do so and keep my academic standing. The on-campus security also left something to be desired."
Freshman,4,"Dorm life is fun if you become friends with people around you. The college is what you make of it, if you get out and make friends you'll have fun. Public safety if annoying and they are very strict on policies, get caught once and you'll get suspended and kicked from housing for a semester."
Freshman,4,Very friendly environment. Awesome staff and a lot of opportunities. Numerous resources to excel at academics and ECAs.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I am currently enjoying my experience here at Ramapo. I'm heavily involved around campus. I'm a resident assistant at the Overlook, I work for admissions and give out tours as well as working in the president's office. I enjoy the work environment that I am in as well as my classes. As an art major the class sizes are on the smaller side compared to the average here. I loved all my professors I have had so far and they are really supportive towards their students. I feel at home when I'm at Ramapo; I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking for a small campus where professors, advisors and counselors would be able to get to know you, then Ramapo might be the best choice! You don't need shuttle bus to get to class. Class average size is 23. Also, dorms are really nice that comes with fridge and microwave!! Also, each dorm has their own bathroom."
Freshman,4,"I love this college! The class sizes are small so every professor can really get to know each of their students. It is the kind of environment I enjoy being in and is academically rigorous. I have to say, though, I wish there was more for me to do outside of my academics. There is a large amount of time where nothing happens even if I am involved with four or five clubs."
Senior,4,"Ramapo’s campus is Unbeatable. The area is beautiful. The surrounding area has mountains, hiking, horses, and beautiful scenery. For the cost of tuition, the school has a very good value."
Senior,4,"Ramapo College is an amazing school. It is on a beautiful nature centered campus, with small class sizes and staff who really care about students' success. I   just wish there was a bit more diversity."
Senior,4,"I love Ramapo- I am learning so much. The campus is beautiful, and the professors are brilliant. However, I do wish there was a bit more diversity, as well as more dietary options in the cafeteria."
Senior,4,"Ramapo College offers many opportunities for students to succeed throughout their college careers. Opportunities such as resume building, cover letter creating, reading and writing center, tutoring and much more. Clubs, sports and activities vary as well, and their is always something going on when on campus. The Ramapo Reservation is across the street from the college and that is a very nice spot for walks and relaxation on nicer days. When it is hot out the students create their own fun by all getting together outdoors playing games, chilling, and just enjoying the sun. Ramapo has a gym for everyone to use with no extra cost, free printing, and free laundry.  With all of these positive aspects, the number one reason i love Ramapo is the small personalized classrooms. My professors were very helpful, and they take pride into making me more knowledgeable on my major. 
I Highly recommend Ramapo College."
Senior,4,"Ramapo is a college that provides an abundance of opportunities for their students to submerse themselves in. An ongoing issue that I've witnessed in my years here is a lack of motivation from students to obtain these opportunities. Given that we are in a very close radius to New York City Ramapo is affiliated with countless potential jobs. Academically, you will find professors that you will love, hate, and everything in between. Once you find your more favorable professors, you have the option (most likely) to retake them. The professors here are my mentors since our classroom sizes are smaller and are more personalized. Outside the classroom, there are a variety of clubs and extracurriculars to identify yourself with. There are also plenty of places to explore within Mahwah. As a commuter, I am always on campus with clubs. The high school I attended was mostly white, so coming here was a culture shock in not feeling like a minority anymore. Make the most of your opportunities."
Senior,4,Ramapo is a small college with major opportunities. They offer a variety of programs and volunteering experiences. One thing I would change about Ramapo is the meal plans. They are not much choices when it comes to choosing a meal plan. Also they do not allow a student to deny a meal plan.
Freshman,4,"I like that Ramapo College of New Jersey offers so many different programs to help support your future career. They have programs such as EOF for the financial support, LLC program for undeclared students and many more. However, if you're looking for a widely diverse institution this is not the school for you, this is an PWI. The food is pretty good and the campus is fairly small so the classes range from 1-35 students. The social experience with the professors is great, the devoted professors care and will make an effort to get to know you."
Freshman,4,This is my 2nd semester as a freshman at RCNJ and I have loved it so far. My professors have been great and the people are so friendly. I love small schools and I love the fact that you see familiar faces walking around campus. The food is also pretty good.
Sophomore,4,"From the first time I went to visit RCNJ I immediately fell in love with the campus and the peace of it. Little did I know that I was going to be spending the next four years of my life here. I love this school so much, the professors are awesome, will definitely make your money worth it ."
Sophomore,4,"As an incoming college freshman, you have so many expectations about your ultimate college experience. Going in, I had so many thoughts about college. I thought that it was going to be the greatest time of my life, I was going to meet so many new people, and try so many new things. Not that my experience was so awful, it was just not what I expected it to be. Because of this, I began to hate Ramapo College of New Jersey. However, once I started to get myself out there more, I began to love it so much more. Now being a sophomore, I couldn't even imagine hating my school. Because of this, I would just tell any incoming freshman to give their school a chance for longer than a week if it's not exactly what they expect it to be. In the end, you get out what you put into it and because I have this mentality, there isn't much about my school that I would change."
Freshman,4,Ramapo is great! I am having a great experience here. The professors are great as well as the overall atmosphere here.
Junior,4,Ramapo is my home away from home. It has given me the chance to branch out and grow amongst peers of similar minds.  The professors here help us students strive to reach our goals and actually get to know us as individuals.  Ramapo is a school in which gives students memories to last a lifetime and an experience no one will ever forget.
Sophomore,4,"I love Ramapo, they are very welcoming and helpful to transfer students. Just started my second semester here and honestly I never want to leave. The positive learning experiences have provided me with many lasting college memories."
Junior,4,Very good program and living space.  Professors are passionate about the subject matter and care about the students.
Senior,4,"The school is small so you get to really know your peers and your professors, the social work department is great and all the professors are extremely helpful. The food is average but there are a lot of options to choose from. You will always find parking but you will have to walk a good distance. The campus in beautiful and it is nice to sit outside and study or have lunch on a warm, sunny day. My only complaint is the lack of livelyhood and events going on on campus, its quiet."
Junior,4,"I love the scenery, and friendly environment of the staff. I would love for Ramapo College to become more of a diverse campus amongst faculty, staff and students."
Sophomore,4,The people are nice and the dorms are not bad but there is not much happening on the weekends and the food is not so good.
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled in Ramapo College of New Jersey. As  a commuter, my main focus is to just be on campus for class. I was afraid that because I commute, I would not be able to participate in clubs or attend career fairs. The college offers both activities at different dates and times- which makes it convienent to participate in the college's affairs! As for academics, the college is perfect. It is smaller; therefore, professors are tailored to the students and their needs. They are easy to reach and there is a very personal experience. I would recommend Ramapo for its academics. The school provides great resources and knowlegable professors."
Junior,4,Ramapo is extremely gorgeous. The staff is amazing and more than qualified for their positions. The people are nice and open minded. I always feel at home!
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, great student activity, huge commuter school, friendly people, great basketball team, I'm very proud to go here."
Freshman,4,"RCNJ is what you make of it. When I attended the school, I knew people who loved it, people who absolutely despised it, and everything in-between. The academics are fine, some majors are definitely better than others. I liked the small class sizes - no 400-person lecture halls here. Professors are a mixed bag, though I did have some great classes.  Some students are nice, but others are arrogant and snotty  and the school is very clique-ish. That said, I did make a few lifelong friends in the end. Lots of kids go home on the weekends, and there isn't much to do in Mahwah, NJ. At least NYC is only 25 miles away.
On the upside, the campus is beautiful and the dorms are great, just as nice as you've heard.I think Ramapo is good and bad - even down to the offices, some  are outstanding and some are a joke. I don't regret going here, but I do sometimes wonder ""What if?"" Prospective students, weigh all of your options carefully and decide for yourself."
Sophomore,2,"The online learning experience is a little jarring. For me, it is difficult to even pay attention to some classes, as sometimes I get bored and start dozing off."
Sophomore,2,"Seeing as though this was a new experience for all of us, it didn’t work out very well. Yea there were so teacher who already had skill with online classes but some were confused about the different apps to use for video calling and also trying to make sure al students got the criteria for the week. I felt that there was more work given to me online than when I was on campus walking to class."
Freshman,2,Weekends are absolutely dead. Everyone goes home. Not a lot of opportunities. The staff at the school doesn’t help you. They just want your money for the school since it’s in so much debt. The professors are not good. Some are very hard. Some are very easy. There’s no in the middle. I’m gonna transfer soon. Only good thing is the location and dorms. The location is near NY and the dorms have more room and are nicer than any other college!
Freshman,2,"My experience was horrible.  At the beginning of school, they do not let you keep your door open and let people come into the room.  The bathroom is in the room, so if you do not join anything, you are pretty much stuck in a room all day.  There are a handful of on campus activities, but they are very specific and are not the typical clubs on other campuses.  For example, nobody wants to join the beekeeping or bass fishing club.  All on-campus parties are broken up and the greek housing is 15 minutes away from  campus, so you need to Uber to the frat parties. The school is also a middle of the woods and unless you have your car on campus, you are pretty much stuck. The campus security is also terrible, they let anyone through the front gate and do not question them. Other than Dunkin Donuts and  Starbucks, there is no other chains on campus.  Plus, it is a suitcase school and a good amount of people go home on the weekends.  Overall, thought my experience would be better."
Freshman,2,"If you enjoyed having fun and going to parties in high school, this is not the place for you. However, if you were a misfit or hung out with the theater/band crowd, this is meant for you. Jokes aside (kind of serious though), Ramapo is a place which will make you feel extremely bored and lonely. It is very common knowledge that Ramapo has a much higher density of weird kids than the average college. Many kids resort to smoking weed as the only activity during the week. The campus is dead, there isn't much to do around the campus either.  Nothing in walking distance. And to top it off, the food is horrible. Don't go to Ramapo."
Sophomore,2,"I don't want to be negative because I'm generally a positive person but I have to be honest, this school is a little bit of a disappointment to me. Nearly all of my friends commute and there's almost no social life on the weekends. Yeah, a lot of the people here are ""chill"" but they're pretty apathetic. I get a very depressed, I don't care vibe from everyone on this campus. No one is enthusiastic and ambitious and wants to go out and do things. Can anyone just go to dinner and a movie, or just an infrequent frat? It would be nice since the food at Birch is just so bad. Sodexo is so bad for you, all carbs and grease. Nothing vegan.  Also,  from my experience a lot of sexist guys. Also, ANYONE can come through the Ramapo gates practically!! No security here! Please fix this! I've been followed twice now by random guys on campus late at night who ARE NOT from this school no joke!"
Freshman,2,"Few class options to choose from. Registering for classes is a HASSLE! Before I decided to transfer, my attempt at registering for the Fall semester was nearly impossible. They offered TWO Accounting classes that I needed- both filled to capacity. When emailing to see if I could be overridden into them, I was told no due to already having a 50+ person waitlist. The thing with Ramapo is, they won't add more classes- you just have to deal. Meanwhile the college I'm transferring to continues to keep adding classes upon classes because of high student request volume.

Every class I had was a repetition of powerpoints they had already sent us. We did no in class work for any of my classes. I had ONE professor throughout the entire year that actually tried to teach anything at all. Financial Aid won't send you your refund until semester is nearly ending even though it's meant for college related expenses. Cliqueish. Dead weekends. Security is AWFUL!"
College Junior,2,It is a predatory culture which encourages getting girls wasted so guys could sleep with them. I feel that greek like is very superficial.
College Senior,2,"If I was asked to rate this my freshman year, it would've been okay. Going into Senior year Ramapo College has changed many rules in order to appeal to outsider eyes, completely ignoring the pleas and suggestions of the students and staff. It has set a lot of people back. While initially students appealed to this college because it is liberal arts and the set up was unique, now the recent changes induced has taken away from the personality of the college and made it more difficult to schedule time, take certain classes. They recently unknowingly changed the housing system without notice to upperclassmen that instead of a credit based system, it now depends on who has the larger group (who has more friends), eliminating the senior housing that freshmen such as my self were not allowed to get until now, yet it has been snatched away from sophomores who had larger groups. Along with this has come taking away certain days due to them wanting to put in more class time, such as eliminating Reading Day, taking away an additional component of classes that was to be used for life experience with the work and instead making class times longer... As a student, and knowing many other students, College Life does not seem to exist anymore with the experience of Ramapo and the strict rules set up over the years, in addition to the change in organization/class time."
College Freshman,2,Athletics are definitely not that important however the facilities are very nice and easy to get to. Many different opportunities are available at the gym and the fields are open to who ever would like to use them. Most intramural sports are non-existent and not taken seriously.
College Freshman,2,"The quality of professors is so low, it is almost non-existent. I have not found any of them to be professional in their fields whatsoever."
College Freshman,2,The housing is nice with good size rooms and personal bathrooms. The social atmosphere is awful as everyone goes home due to the overwhelming strict public safety rules.
College Freshman,2,"As of this point in my schooling I am quite disappointed. I have found most of my professors to not be qualified for their work. I have taken the time to seek help from tutors, who were also not helpful. The school does not host many activities on the weekends pushing even more students to go home, making the campus completely boring."
College Freshman,2,"Lived in pine, moved out. Not enough space"
College Freshman,2,I am looking to transfer. It is not for me.
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, Ramapo has been on a steady decline since my entrance into the school. I hated so much about it my freshman year, and now as a sophomore, I gave it another try but the bureaucracy and all the nonsense with the school cracking down on everything, it's time to transfer. The only thing that I love about the school is the quality of education. I love that we take four classes a semester and I have had some amazing professors, and I have to say from an educational standpoint, it's a respectable college. It is just too small, cold, and in the middle of nowhere. The area is beautiful in the fall, but the school is in the middle of the woods. You NEED a car on campus if you want to get off campus - the shuttle is horrible and you can't even go to a party anymore on campus without getting busted. Most parties are 20 minutes into New York state and from a social standpoint, everyone here is awkward, entitled, white, disgustingly wealthy, and on top of all of that, nothing to do on campus. There is no social life, and there is certainly no school unity, especially that half the school commutes and half the residents go home on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,"No one is really on campus on the weekends and due to heightened rules, people are afraid to get together"
College Sophomore,2,"The administration sets rules that are too strict on most occasions. The parking rules are out of control and I feel like as a commuter who attends the school, I am treated as an outsider when visiting at late hours as if I am not part of the student body. I feel commuters should be allowed in the campus buildings and not have an issue getting in."
College Freshman,2,Iff you go to Ramapo almost everyone lives on Campus. Bergen county in extremely expensive to live in therefore everyone stays on campus. There are a couple frat houses off campus in New York but other than that everyone dorms.
College Freshman,2,I DONT LIVE OFF CAMPUS SO IDK
College Freshman,2,YOU NEVER GET A COLLEGE DISCOUNT!!!
College Freshman,2,needs to be a better variety of food and better taste!!!!!!
College Freshman,2,"After the incident that happened this year, Ramapo is becoming more strict about everything and anything they can be strict about."
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do around here and there is nowhere really to live as everything around here is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,There is just honestly nothing to do here. Everyone who does live here pretty much goes home on the weekends and those who stay have really nothing to do because of the new rules. Everyone here also acts like the are still in high school.
College Freshman,2,"Some of the professors here, even those in my major seem under-qualified and inept. Many of them have been here since the school has opened and thus are too old to be teaching here effectively."
College Freshman,2,No one really watches our sports teams so going to games is not really a big event.
College Freshman,2,This campus is in the middle of nowhere so good luck finding places to explore off campus.
College Freshman,2,The food is regularly terrible and not many options. There's days where there is just nothing good to eat. So much fried food not enough healthy options.
College Freshman,2,Everyone goes home on the weekends. Freshman dorms are a dump and feel like you are in prison.
College Sophomore,2,Ew I eat ice cream and thats it
College Sophomore,2,"The local area definitely has its perks, but overall Mahwah is pretty boring. Yeah there is the Reservation which is beautiful for fellow nature fans, but not much else to do besides take a trip to the city. The transportation around the area is good, multiple train stations and bus stations for commuting to the city and other areas in jersey."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many houses , unless you want to practically live in Suffern NY which is kind of low quality. Mahwah is an expensive area, so finding cheap housing to my knowledge is not easy. Staying on campus is nice, I don't see the need to stay off campus."
College Junior,2,Not much school spirit when it comes to athletics. No football team.
College Junior,2,The campus is strict overall. They want your money and know how to get it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"NYC nearby, but on campus, nothing."
College Senior,2,"Honestly, im not too sure about this one, ive never tried to live off campus. However, ramapo is in a very wealthy area that is surrounded by big expensive houses so i doubt that there are too many off campus options for fairly poor college students."
College Senior,2,You can get a violation for having a shot glass (a decorative one) in your dorm room even if you are 21. You can get a violation for being at a party where someone else is under 21 even in an alcohol allowed area. Overall its too strict on alcohol rules.
College Junior,2,the people that work there are mean
College Junior,2,only some boys in frats live off campus
College Sophomore,2,the school is not very diverse but the people there are accepting of those who are different
College Sophomore,2,"I understand acceptance, but all of college political stuff is about gays, I support it, but I'm tired of hearing about women's rights and gay rights."
College Sophomore,2,"The events and student life here is terrible, no-one participates, and everyone goes home on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,"It is very hard to find someone that is not judgmental, and doesn't have unrealistic expectations. Girls here aren't even really pretty (inside and out)."
College Sophomore,2,"Internships are the only way to be anything, and everything is so competitive, and not everyone has a chance to have opportunities."
College Sophomore,2,The majors that Ramapo offers are generic and non-diverse.
College Sophomore,2,"For a progressive college, progressive food options are just not there."
College Freshman,2,There's barely any parties on campus that are any good. The majority of them get busted by Public Safety within a couple of hours. The only other option for partying is paying for a cab to go to a frat party that probably won't be that great anyway.
College Freshman,2,"There's barely anything to do outside of campus (or inside of campus for that matter). In order to go places like the mall or a restaurant, you need to take a shuttle or know someone with a car on campus."
College Freshman,2,"In terms of school spirit, Ramapo has nearly none. During the campus tours and orientation, students would say that the basketball games are big for the school and a lot of students would go and it became a big deal--only to actually come to the school and realize that barely anyone went to the basketball games because they were on the weekend when most people go home."
College Freshman,2,There is transportation to malls and such. Being under age I do not go to bars or clubs or take part in underage nightlife.
College Freshman,2,The only places to go would need transportation to and that is on a highway. I have not experienced many activities or shopping nearby because I'm not sure where it is.
College Freshman,2,"The only frat houses are off campus and you have to take a 50 dollar taxi to them in the mountains. The shuttle brings you to the mall, cvs, train station and one other plaza at ridiculous times. "
College Senior,2,It goes right through you and you can tell they do not care much about constant quality food. 
College Freshman,2,The food here is not that good. It is all greasy and there are not that many options. Also the availability is horrible. On the weekends the dinning halls are barley open so we usually have to eat something in our room. 
College Senior,2,"Took forever to fill out the form, had issues with it and took a while to receive my financial aid "
College Student,2,It personally doesn't fit my tastes. I was forced to go here. I didn't choose this.
College Student,2,"I do not really know much about off-campus places to eat. I don't really know much about discounts, either. It seems to be inconvenient to get places."
College Freshman,2,my classes have been relatively easy so far and the class sizes are great
College Freshman,2,i am only a freshman so i dont do anything pertaining to my major yet
Senior,1,steer clear of this college if you have any sort of learning disability or if you want to major in computer science. professors are not helpful and the school as a whole does not care about its students at all. many staff that i’ve interacted with before have joked about the majority of students not graduating within 4 years because they can’t get into the classes they need. this college will find any excuse to charge you fees. it’s just a huge scam. avoid at all costs
Freshman,1,"The school had a terrible program for my major. The school was filled with kids who never experienced anything in high school. Id never recommend this school to anyone. I wasted my money and made no connects to people. Also, school gets confusing because everyone looks the same seeing as the population is mostly white kids craving to hear sweet caroline."
Alum,1,"Graduate early if you can- nobody here is going to give you the extra job experience or education or amazing friendship that will make attending any amount of time here worth it. Admin tries to actively block discussions on lectures in business, economics, sociology, student participation, etc., so you're not going to find a super-interesting lecture or job opportunity here anytime soon. The campus rules and lack of involvement make it damn near impossible to meet people and make lasting friendships with others. 

Ramapo won't develop you. It does not have the tools or community or classes required to do so, nor does it care. It'll hold your hand your first semester and then smack you in the face for the rest  and leave it all up to you to decide what to do next with your friendships, intellect, career, goals, and ambitions. It's a college that serves nobody buts its administrators, and is ultimately a college that nobody should attend."
Alum,1,"Money hungry public college that doesn't follow the procedures published in handbooks. I would NEVER recommend going to this school... go to Montclair or Rutgers. Hell, go to Willy P instead of Ramapo as well"
Alum,1,One of the worst college experiences I have ever had. This place does not know how to manage more then a few people. My bill was wrong many times. The program I was a part of was a joke. I could have taught the course better my self. This school was not challenging and not cutting edge. While some of the concepts and skills were good for a novice that is not what a 4 year college should be teaching toward. I did my MA here and felt as if I left with more BA knowledge.
College Sophomore,1,"There is literally no off campus housing. The area is just too expensive. If you want to live off campus, you're only real option is going a few minutes across the border into New York state. The campus residence halls are nice and worth the cost. Almost every one lives on campus so there really isn't a point to living off campus. It's only really a few of the fraternity houses that are off campus."
College Freshman,1,could have more parties or a better night lif offered to the students on and off campus
College Freshman,1,The greek life here is honestly just like cliques in high schools. They have a holier than though attitude and most of their parties are honestly pretty lame. Most of the frats here are whack.
College Freshman,1,"Again this campus is in the middle of nowhere, so finding off campus housing is impossible, and your options are not great. Also proximity is not very close and very expensive."
College Freshman,1,"The administration runs this place like a literal prison. You have to sign in and out of buildings if you are a guest. They also raised all the fines on violations so you are literally paying and arm and a leg if you get caught drinking. But worry not, you won't get caught drinking here because it is becoming a dry campus."
College Freshman,1,"The administration has basically turned this place into a high school. There is nowhere you can go if you want to have fun, so everyone just goes home on weekends or is in the process of transferring. There is nothing to do off campus here either."
College Sophomore,1,"Administration has turned Ramapo into a jail. This campus used to be fun and everyone used to be able to have fun and be safe but one poor incidence and this whole school is on lockdown. I am more afraid of getting in trouble at Ramapo than I have anywhere else in my life.

Ramapo is hell on earth and it is a dead campus. Everyone is depressed and hates it here."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly the worst. I hate coming here I regret it so much. There are no parties because of new insane rules. Host a party and lose housing, get caught drinking be suspended until your hearing, Psafety sees you throw up automatically get sent to hospital parents have to get you and you are suspended. 

I cannot meet new people or see people that I only see around because there is no common social or party scene now. It used to be fun but now you are stuck in a dorm all night every night.

Do not come here unless you like to be alone"
College Freshman,1,Our Greek life sucks. It has no effect on our social atmosphere and not a lot of people are involved.
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't care about students. I was almost hit by a car in the crosswalk and they did nothing to prevent it from happening again of investigate it.
College Sophomore,1,They are such pains and always cause problems for everyone. Parking is ridiculous! They will give you 3 $50 tickets at a time!
College Sophomore,1,No-one really even recognizes the fact that we have sports teams. There is not a large student population active in athletics.
College Freshman,1,"There are not really any options for off-campus housing, unless you're a guy and you join a fraternity--in which case, the frat houses are about fifteen minutes away from campus in New York state. Otherwise, there's nowhere else for students to live that's particularly close."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any financial aid. Applying for the scholarships are tips for getting financial aid but there are very limited scholarships given out from the school.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall closes before dinner time even begins in the average household. There are only 2 small dining halls on campus and the food is disgusting, unhealthy, and has laxatives in it- it gives everyone stomach problems and is not worth the money at all. "
College Senior,1,Public safety is constantly looking to get a quick buck out of handing out violations like candy. 
College Senior,1,Snow days are the worst because teachers will never cancel classes. This past snow storm was miserable and sloppily handled. 
College Junior,1,Public Safety do not know how to do their jobs. Intimidate students and are not lenient.
College Senior,1,My school does not offer off campus housing
College Freshman,1,"the only bad thing aout the school is the social life. When you read the reviews about being dead on the weekends, believe them! There has not been one weekend since ive been here that ive enjoyed myself. Im in the process of finding a better school as in entertainment wise but everything else is good so im not sure if i do want to even leave."
College Freshman,1,Nightlife REALLY depends on who you know. You will get mixed views from many people so dont be shy and try to make friends with the upperclassman and preferably someone with a car for the off campus greek parties.
College Freshman,1,There's not much diversity on campus. There's a lot of white people and they are somewhat rascist
College Freshman,1,I do not know much about internships because they are not available until you are finished your sophomore year. 
College Senior,1,Greek life is practically non-existent.  There parties are few and far between. They are always getting in trouble for various offenses and overall don't have a very good reputation or strong alumni involvement.
College Senior,1,Ramapo College has very strict campus security and checks ID's in wet areas.  Fines for a minor in possession of alcohol range from 200-800 dollars and almost always result in the mandatory enrollment of the offending student in a alcohol abuse counselling class.
College Freshman,1,Mahwah is one of the most expensive towns in New Jersey so off campus housing is kind of pointless.
College Freshman,1,"Bad. You have three options on campus: Birch, PayCafe, and The Pavilion. None of them provide you with a good quality meal. I'm sorry for being picky and conscious about my health, but I totally regret getting a meal plan and part of the reason I'm commuting next semester is because of this. Birch and Pav are buffet style and the selection gets very repetitive. The only reason I don't grade this an F is because of late night dining which is available until 1 AM."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Nightlife at Ramapo? What nightlife? For students of all ages- legal and otherwise- nightlife does not exist. Public safety is so strict, that before a social gather even assembles, it is broken up. There are few bars nearby and they are very strict about carding students. There is one local pub down the road, but you are more likely to run into one of your professors than many of your classmates. There are no clubs, so most students either cross the border into New York State, or they go to Hoboken where there are plenty of clubs. For transportation you are on your own so be sure to have a DD on hand. The campus used to have a shuttle to one of the local bars, but it was stopped, for they felt as though it was promoting drunken behavior. Your best bet for any sort of nightlife is to leave campus and drive at least 30-40 minutes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Despite the needs of my family, we did not receive any financial aid. Both my brother and I attend the school. I am an A student and my brother is a student athlete. We expected some sort of scholarship given my academic excellence and my brother's athletic skills, but we received none. It was a hassle to fill out the proper forms and in the end it resulted in nothing. I know very few students who actually received financial aid from Ramapo; one girl that I know who did receive aid was dropped unexpectedly."
College Senior,1,Everything for flex dollars is extremely overpriced and the meals I can get are only 6 times a week.  The food quality is terrible. There are 2 dining halls and both have terrible food
College Freshman,1,Lots of White Students – If you are looking for a diverse campus. Ramapo is not the school for you.&nbsp;
College Freshman,1,Don't Stay on Campus – If you don't stay on campus the parties are moderate at best. A couple frats have off campus housing but underclassmen generally only attend. Most people go to the clubs Tues/Thurs. Be prepared to try to party with like 10 people if you stay on campus and for a public safety violation if your underage and get caught (which is easily - zero tolerance)
College Sophomore,1,"Parking here is ridiculous. You can't find parking anywhere and then when you do, you need to have a certain sticker even if you go to the college. I would get to school about 45 minutes earlier before your class starts."
College Freshman,1,"Ramapo Is Boring – There is not much to do, ever! In the beginning of the Fall semester there was a lot of talk about sororities, but now it seems like there are only 2 on the entire campus. People go out to frat houses on Tuesdays because nobody has classes on Wednesdays but besides that, nothing really happens at Ramapo."
College Sophomore,1,"Remotely Safe – Campus security seems to be more interested in catching under age drinking then actual threats to student safety. Out Alert Me Now system is the worst, you can find out more about what is happening through Facebook."

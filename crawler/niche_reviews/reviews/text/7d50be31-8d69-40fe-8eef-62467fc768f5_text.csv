Alum,5,"It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, and I would do it all over again. I learned so much inside and outside of the classroom, and I made lifelong friends and mentors along the way."
Freshman,5,"I transferred in to Hanover College after a terrible experience with a previous school. Hanover College met my every expectation and more. The professors are quick to help, learning services are easily accessible, and student activities are so fun. Hanover feels like family to me."
Freshman,5,Switching to remote learning was so smooth and my professors were there to help every step of the way. They truly made the most out of the situation.  Grading accommodations made me feel like my university cared about my academic success.
Niche User,5,I sat in a class and already knew what they where talking about. I can learn lots at this college. Beautiful campus. They want me in there tennis roster. Loved the students there. Made me feel welcome. Like I belonged there.
Senior,5,"The faculty and staff at this institution care about your emotional,physical, and mental well-being as well as your success as a student and an individual."
Sophomore,5,I love the campus and the people. It’s really a great place to be. The food isn’t the best though. The education is worth it however.
Niche User,5,Hanover has a beautiful campus and a welcoming environment. Everyone you meet there is so kind and helpful. The campus feels like its own community that is open for anyone to join.
Junior,5,"The people are what make Hanover College a good place to go. If it weren't for the friends I have made, I would be looking to go somewhere else"
Niche User,5,When I visited it was absolutely amazing. The campus is beautiful and everyone is so nice. It’s small and private so you get a personal feel. The classroom sizes are small so you get closer with the professor. No complaints so far.
Sophomore,5,"Hanover College is absolutely wonderful! The environment is academically rigorous and, due to the small class sizes, professors are always available to help you. It is definitely a challenge, however, and the cost of tuition is outrageous. Fortunately, there are a lot more scholarships and grants available to students here than there might be at state schools, due to there being more private donors backing the institution."
Sophomore,5,I chose Hanover College for the size and diversity.  I play women's basketball and have joined a Sorority making new friends every year.  The professors are friendly and offer many suggestions on how they studied and accomplished all their goals as a student.
Alum,5,Tight-knit community with professors who truly care about students. Beautiful campus with outstanding architecture and serene hiking trails.
Niche User,5,The campus of Hanover is beautiful and makes me feel safe and at home. My admissions counselor has helped me immensely with receiving financial aid and answering any questions I have.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful. It is a small campus, hardly any privacy. Lacks racial diversity. You are presented with many great opportunities that are not offered at other colleges. The food is terrible, but the stir fry and subs are good."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I've only spent 1 year there, yet I can say that I really enjoyed my time there.  The professors and students are really nice and helpful and the campus is mostly peaceful.  I am personally a quiet person who likes to be alone and doesn't interact with others much, but since I've been to Hanover, I've been more open and talkative with the faculty and students.  I've really enjoyed interacting with the multitude of people there and look forward to my years with them."
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere here. It is very homey and very close. It is very easy to contact professors or other students if you need help. There is free tutoring and a plethora of different activities to do on campus and even off campus.
Freshman,5,"Hanover is a challenging school academically. It is easy to get out and socialize, but due to its size, you see pretty much the same people everywhere you go."
College Sophomore,5,Hanover college is the greatest choice you could make when picking a college. Not only are the students driven but they are extremely well-rounded and accepting of diversity. The professors and faculty are always an email away. Any of the faculty would do anything they could to help you have a brighter future. I love my college.
College Sophomore,5,"At first I was committed to IUPUI, but after going to an event with a buddy (who no longer attends Hanover), I discovered that I felt at home at Hanover. Upon arriving on campus, I knew this was the place i wanted to be for my collegiate career. The school is small enough that professors take interest in your activities and truly care about your success, but large enough to blend into the school if that is what you want. There are always events going on that are generally open to the students and the food at the Shoebox and Underground is simply fantastic. While it does cost a pretty penny, I believe the experiences I've had at Hanover and the connections I've made have really paid off, and that is only in my first year!"
College Sophomore,5,"Despite having some questionable occurrences, like literally every campus to ever have greek life has had, the greek houses are very strict on enforcing their rules and protecting people who enter their house. When parties do occur, that house's security roams and verifies that people are who they say they are and to be sure the people in-house are safe.When parties aren't going on, the brothers in houses are the nicest people you'll meet and they're always welcoming to ""outsiders"" even if they're from different houses."
College Sophomore,5,I love the small class size at Hanover. Our classes are based on discussion rather than lecture which makes learning a lot more fun and interesting. The professors are enthusiastic about what they are teaching and really care about the success of the students.
College Senior,5,Love the softball field the most
College Senior,5,"Amazing faculty, beautiful campus, and great students."
College Freshman,5,Academics are wonderful since all the professors are easy to approach and always friendly. The courses are abundant and interesting.
College Freshman,5,"There is so much to do on campus outside of class. It is such a beautiful campus and everyone is so friendly and open. Everyone is ready to help you and instead of waiting for days without replies on emails and such they answer the same day. The professors and staff are so helpful when choosing classes for your major and everything and they are always willing to help you in class, even if it's not in their own class they are willing to help you out."
College Freshman,5,"My professors have been willing to help me succeed in college. They are able to answer my questions and show me what I need to do to make the most of college. The courses are challenging but are not overbearing and the homework outside of class is not overwhelming. In all, the professors are great and the courses are interesting."
College Freshman,5,The college is absolutely beautiful no matter the season. The professors are willing to help and take pride in their subject. They connect the material with real world situations and help the students understand how it is applicable in their lives. I would definitely choose this school again because of the academics. The courses are challenging but interesting. The school also offers a variety of courses to choose from.
College Junior,5,It gave me leadership roles and challenges me.
College Sophomore,5,The cost is worth the education you receive.
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus has allowed me to meet new people.
College Sophomore,5,"Not stereotypical Greek life. NO hazing (okay, I guess that's iffy. The worst 'hazing' that happens is some guys not showering or talking for a week). Very involved people with high GPAs."
College Sophomore,5,"Being a private school, financial aid was great."
College Sophomore,5,I have never experienced discrimination on campus.
College Sophomore,5,It's easy to find where you fit in. The professors are all very helpful and are willing to work with you. The president  goes to all events and that is really cool. I would not have chosen any where else.
College Sophomore,5,It has a heavy workload but it is one if the best undergrad pre med tracks with the hands on activities and opportunities. The faculty are super involved and everyone wants you to succeed and shows it.
College Sophomore,5,It is really simple to choose and be a part of a major. There isn't anything extra you have to do for science majors.
College Sophomore,5,Campus security is always around- there is never any issue on campus that isn't solved in less than ten minutes. I've never seen a fight on campus and it is a very small place to be. All in all- Hanover is extremely peaceful with friendly security and great people.
College Sophomore,5,"The prices for these range, but are overall very affordable. There is great variety, from a burger place to a sushi bar. It's not incredibly easy to get downtown, but when you can it's a great place to be."
College Sophomore,5,"A lot of these policies depend on the individual RA or teacher, but it is relaxed on the condition that students are respectful and don't cause harm to others."
College Sophomore,5,"In my opinion, our school is very updated when it comes to athletics. The facilities are fantastic, the locker rooms are being redone, and the environment of campus athletics is very inviting."
College Junior,5,The school is small enough that you can get to any building within a ten minute walk.
College Sophomore,5,We have lots of international students at Hanover College so our diversity is very high. There are tons of clubs that wok to celebrate that diversity in our campus. Our college is a liberal arts college and requires 2 semesters of foreign language and I feel that also makes our student body diverse.
College Sophomore,5,"Hanover has so many different races and religions. Hanover College has lots of international students which allows for a lot of diversity. For having such a small campus there are many different races, economic backgrounds, religion, and sexual orientation that you can find at Hanover."
College Sophomore,5,In order to declare your major at Hanover College you must have qualifying grades in the classes that are prerequisites for that major. You will declare your major at the end of sophomore year. By then you have tested many different major choices and you are ready to declare your major. Keep your mind open when coming to Hanover College. Don't have your heart set on one major or idea because it will most likely change through out your first year at Hanover. But that is the whole point of going to a liberal arts college!
College Sophomore,5,There are always parking spaces on campus because it isn't a commuter college.
College Freshman,5,"To be a student at Hanover College is unbelievably amazing. I have highly enjoyed my experience here so far and would recommend any student to join this college and web of friendships. I love it here because first off the professors are outstanding. They care about every student and do their best to see them achieve well. The factually is also wonderful with how much they care about the students. From the workers who serve our food to the president showing up at basketball games with a smile, they all care. Secondly, the opportunities you can achieve at this college. Plenty of internship and study abroad are available and numerous amount of clubs and leadership programs. What makes Hanover College so unique is how outstanding very student performs. Every person here wants to help each other and form friendships that will last forever."
College Freshman,5,Student life is diverse and many hangouts are available on campus. Food choices are diverse...student life is diverse (there are probably more minority groupls on this campus than others) and acceptance of all personal choices is endemic.
College Freshman,5,"We are miles from anywhere. Cell phone service is sketchy and shopping opportunities are limited. If you cannot live with bad cell service and lack of shopping opportunities, Hanover is not the school for you"
College Freshman,5,I'm a first year and am already helping out with a paper on childhood personality traits. My psychology professor asked my help after realizing how much psychology interested me.  I get 1/4 credit for school and my name will be published as a contributor on the paper.  I have a good relationship with both department heads and look forward to more involvement with the psych program
College Freshman,5,"Everything is geared for a student getting the best they can out of all courses and activities. Peer Advisors help with a variety of subjects.  Professors have office hours at varying times of day, to make sure that students who need extra help have an opportunity to visit.. Registration is quick and easy and counselors really help to find the right classes for each student.  Workload is hard but not impossible, and you have plenty of time to study and have time off for lettting off steam."
College Freshman,5,"I have only seen the Women's and Men's Basketball facilities so far but they are excellent. Plenty of peer support for sports teams and facilities are clean and ready to go at game time.  Fans get there early to get good seats and the 'campus' sport is Basketball, so lots of turnout for the games.  Team performance is excellent and they have a good rapport with each other, you  can tell how much they enjoy the game during their warm ups and the games"
College Freshman,5,"I have had several day trips to the college for applications for scholarships and a couple of overnights for the feel of the college.  Everyone is quite friendly and the people I've talked to love living on campus and enjoy their classes.  Classes are small so if you need individual help, it is possible.  A sorority has already asked me to join and I feel very welcomed by them.  My favorite part of our trip, was when a Hanover student took me to the lookout.  That is a viewpoint of the river where you can see three bends.  It was breathtaking."
College Freshman,5,"There are security phones in each building and at key points on campus.  There is visible patrolling after dark and it feels very safe.  If you are nervous about walking on campus after dark, you can call a security guard on the house phone in the dorm and one will come walk with you to your destination"
College Freshman,5,"Off campus housing is not as good as campus housing.  It's more expensive, the apartments are smaller than a dorm room and you don't have a roommate.  Parking is a problem and the security is non-existent.  I would never take off campus housing."
College Student,5,Prepare You Well – All of the professors at Hanover College prepare you well for the world outside.
College Student,5,"Little Bit of Everything – There are people of every race, color, political affiliation, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, and financial background you can imagine. Everyone on the campus is so accepting of differences."
College Sophomore,5,"Very Safe Campus – Hanover's campus is very safe. Common sense tells us to keep our doors locked to avoid petty theft or pranks, but overall you don't have to worry much about safety here. Campus Security is always on patrol just in case though."
College Junior,5,"I'm Throwin 100S – Financial aid is awesome! And flexible. If you are having rough times, they got your back, no problem."
College Junior,5,Kinesiology and Integrative Physiology – One of the hardest majors on campus. Professors push and push but it sets you up very well for post-undergrad work
College Senior,5,Spanish and Psychology – I love both my Spanish and Psychology majors.  The professors in each are very good teachers and make the material interesting.  I truly enjoy my courses in both of these subjects.
Alum,4,"A great community and tight knit school on a beautiful campus. Professors who care about students and actively engage in thought provoking discussion. That said, the impact of Hanover beyond graduation is lackluster. Most alumni (with the notable exception of Mike Pence - yikes!) go on to middle management positions at small Indiana companies, meaning the alumni network is underwhelming at best and opportunities based on name recognition or the strength of the college brand are nonexistent. It's not impossible to achieve success after HC by any stretch, but it's a graduating class of about 90% future insurance claim adjusters."
Junior,4,"The communication was average when it came to online classes. I learned more on my own, but my professors were always there to answer questions. I liked the set up for classes and how involved they were. Finals were definitely less stressful"
Junior,4,I enjoy the atmosphere of Hanover college. I am able to seek help when needed and they always there when you need a question asked. I feel very prepared for the next few years at Hanover. I would like to see more involvement in community projects and more hiring to keep the campus clean. I would like to see more security when it comes to guests so that the school knows who is on and out of the buildings.
Junior,4,"Hanover is an excellent academic school, and it has many resources to help prepare students for their futures."
Senior,4,While at Hanover I have had many experiences I would not have been able to pursue if I had attended a bigger school. I have had so many travel opportunities and time to figure out what I enjoy and what I am passionate about.
Niche User,4,It has a beautiful campus and everyone makes you feel welcome and loved. The only tiny issue is there is not really a town or community around it.
Junior,4,"I love Hanover! For the size, it is incredibly diverse and welcoming. The academics are fantastic and competitive with big schools. However, there is a lot of work to be done in the administration in terms of dealing with Title IX situations."
Sophomore,4,"Hanover College is a Hidden Gem, I went into the campus with no prior expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the small but charming campus. It is in the middle of the woods located by a small town off the Ohio River. The Air is very clean and there are many beautiful sights all over the campus looking out to the Ohio River. I would recommend for students who like a small campus with lots of hiking trails and freedom."
Freshman,4,"Enjoying it very much so far, difficult but definatly will prepare you for the real world and graduate school."
Sophomore,4,"If you like the small town, small college kind of  feel, then Hanover is this place for you.  Hanover is a quiet, academically driven campus placed in the middle of the woods while directly overlooking the Ohio River.  It is a great place for a prestigious degree after a lot of work."
Sophomore,4,Hanover College is beautiful and I don’t have many complaints. The environment and professors could not be better. The dining hall lacks quality a little bit and the campus is not very wheelchair-friendly.
Freshman,4,"I loved it from the moment I stepped on campus because everyone is extremely welcoming of everyone and the campus itself is beautiful. Of course there are parties, but if you don't want to go, no one is forcing you and you can create yourself as a person."
Niche User,4,The professors (most with PhD's) really care about their students and want to see them grow. It's a great school to be a part of.
Freshman,4,I love college as a whole.  It have been a great experience so far.  The only thing I would improve is some of the meal choices.
Niche User,4,I really like Hanover college because it is a small community that has a real family vibe when you walk on campus. The only thing I don't like about Hanover is that they don't have an actual theater that can be used for their theater department.
Sophomore,4,I've only attended Hanover College for 1 year (so far) and I loved it! The things I love the most are that the faculty and students are all very nice and helping people. The small classroom size makes it very easy to get the help you need.
Sophomore,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time spent at Hanover so far. It is a small, but close-knit community of students and faculty who are committed to a higher learning. The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do with a surplus of campus clubs and activities. I have met some of my best friends here and become a better student because of Hanover College."
College Sophomore,4,"Hanover College is a well-known college nation wide. We have students that have graduated and became Actuaries (a hard field to get into), students that have moved on to grad school at various campuses, and we even have a Business Scholars Program that allows students to interact directly with businesses by solving business-related issues. In fact, as part of BSP a student is required to have a summer project-based internship (some have been with Eli Lilty, Lays, and many many more). This school, despite its small size, has very large connections through alumni, businesses, and other programs nation wide."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus security is always patrolling and watching out for students. This year, they have installed several new emergency beacons around campus to improve the access to campus safety. There have been times that I have walked alone at 3 in the morning for about 20 minutes and I felt completely safe because of the environment Hanover College has. In terms of issues on campus, there havent been too many negative cases (when there is, the administration is sure to alert all students as necessary). Most of the time, campus safety is just called when someone drinks too much on the weekend."
College Sophomore,4,"My floor in particular formed a sort of brotherhood and we'd always involve each other in various activities, and be sure we're okay when party nights happened and we'd return for Taco Bell (there was always a DD on the floor). As far as I could tell, the other floors were relatively the same where everyone knew everyone and there was always something fun to do. Yet, at the same time you could trust people to not steal from you when you door was unlocked and could get some peace and quiet when in your room. The other buildings were essentially the same (various layouts however). THe layouts were very effective and the school made sure to keep the lobbies up to date to allow for more comfort. Worst thing is that we were constantly being threatened with fines for literal normal wear and tear."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is quite small, but dedicated to students and athletes. We have a facility known as ""Horner"" where students and athlets alike are more than welcome to use (from the gymnasium to the indoor track & weightroom to the ""yoga"" room). There is plenty of space to run (the streets are very safe to run on) and, being basically on the Ohio River, we have access to beautiful hiking trails and the gorgeous city of Madison!"
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers were all pretty easy to talk to with such a small school (~1100 students grades 9-12), plus they didnt want you to just pass the tests, they wanted you to learn the material, most of the time. Something I truly enjoyed about our school is that we ""buy"" parking spots from the National Honor Society chapter and we are allowed to paint them however we want (so long as it is appropriate) and it stays on there all year. We also just got an updated school and each student rents a macbook from the school (fairly expensive to be honest) to complete their homework and the like."
College Sophomore,4,Students who graduate from Hanover tend to be extremely successful in their careers. Hanover keeps connections and networks with the alumni to help current students find jobs and internships. The connections it makes is one of the many great qualities that Hanover possesses.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus and I am not afraid to walk alone at night. Hanover College does not have a sexual assault problem but encourages women to talk about it and not be afraid to get help if sexual assault does happen. Campus security does a lot to help make students feel safe, including giving them a ride to destinations on campus if a person does not feel safe walking."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been very good. I have made a lot of friends, and the amount of groups we have on campus make it easy to meet new people. The campus itself is beautiful with many trails to hike and places to explore. If I could do it all over, I would choose Hanover College every time."
College Junior,4,"Hanover College has the best team of professors in the state of Indiana. The absolutly love what they do. They give 110% with lecture, every assignment, and every time they have office hours. I have not only gained amazing advice from them but they have become apart of my very own family. A student could not ask for a better grop of professionals as educators."
College Junior,4,"The value of a degree form Hanover College is more that one would think. Liberal arts means that first and formost we will be getting a well rounded education that will enable us to mold into any professonal carreer we choose. As students, we come into Hanover thinking that we weill just learn all of the things we think we want to know for are job after College, but it gives us that and more. I can bank that when I leave College I will be ready for any goal or post college education."
College Junior,4,"I myself am not in Greek life, but Hanover's Greek life is a very important part of our community and campus climate."
College Junior,4,"Hanover College is a well rouded university that takes into consideration the background of each student which enables them to find their passion. As a student I feel that my professors give just as much as I do when it come to learning and obtaining the best understanding possible. I feel that Hanover College is an accademicly challenging school, yet an outstanding networking school as well.  My experience thus far has been challenging and equally rewarding. I am proud to call myself a Hanoverairan."
College Freshman,4,Do not have an opinion as I start in the fall
College Freshman,4,Do not have an opinion yet as I start in the fall
College Freshman,4,I will know more and be able to give more opinions in the fall
College Freshman,4,"Again, I will start in the fall and have nothing bad to say or opinion"
College Freshman,4,"Again, I start in the fall so I have nothing to base my opinion on as of yet"
College Freshman,4,From what I  have experienced this far.   May have a better rating once I truly get started.
College Freshman,4,Starting college this fall and so far my experience with this school has been fantastic
College Senior,4,I choose not to be a part
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy being at Hanover and hope that I can financially support myself to remain here for the next three years.
College Freshman,4,"I greatly enjoy the campus and staff here in Hanover, but there are some cultural and social issues that the administration must work through."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are really what pull many of the students together. Even if our teams lose, the student body always stands behind the players and still go on cheering at the next game."
College Freshman,4,Security drives by on campus about every 10 to 15 minutes to keep the campus safe. There is little that happens on campus that gets people in trouble or that puts someone in danger. The campus is safe overall and people are not afraid to talk about anything that happened on campus.
College Freshman,4,The college offers internship opportunities for everyone no matter the major they pursue. The career center is able to help with internships and with finding a job for those about to graduate. Most graduates walk out of college with more than a diploma in their hand and come back to tell their stories and also to help those who are in the same position they were in at the time.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a major part of campus. Everyone believes that the students in Greek life help contribute to the community and to each other. Those in Greek life are asked to maintain a certain GPA and, therefore, become tutors to others in and outside of the Greek community. Greek students are housed according to their chapter in a big building with two students to a room for studying and bunk beds for them to sleep on."
College Freshman,4,There are quite a few varsity athletic at the school and they are fun to attend. The students support the athletics. The school spirit is outstanding and the cheerleaders and dance team is always there to support the teams.
College Sophomore,4,I like being able to park behind the place I live.
College Sophomore,4,It's much better since the new WiFi is in the dorms
College Sophomore,4,"So many options, this is fantastic!"
College Freshman,4,New football stadium...sports highly supported by admin and students
College Freshman,4,"Madison, IN is nearby and lots of sports bars and it's right on Ohio River"
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is great. I'm close to class and fields for practice. Always surrounded by teammates and lots of activities by RA's.
College Sophomore,4,Most everyone receives financial aid is some way.
College Sophomore,4,I think the school is pretty lenient on most things. Except drugs. That's the only thing that the school cracks down on.
College Sophomore,4,"Love it. Most parties at frats, but parties elsewhere if it's not your thing. Wednesdays and Saturdays always."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in the sorority house is much better than the dorm, but most of,the other living options are better than the freshman dorms!"
College Sophomore,4,I have made many life long friendships
College Sophomore,4,Small Camus doesn't have many problems and the health services is very easy to get into and used
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is open with each other and all the facilities are relatively new or being renovated.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't done an internship yet, but I heard they were great and really helpful to those who did them. I would like to have an internship before I graduate."
College Freshman,4,"Sports are great here. Well, as great as any Division 3 teams can be."
College Freshman,4,Almost everyone gets involved with the sports here on campus.
Freshman,2,The dorms don't have air conditioning which makes everyone miserable. the students are very cliquey. There is little to do on campus and the surrounding area
College Freshman,2,No car? Oh well. Friends who have cars? Great! Neither you or them have one? Too bad.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is located near a small, lovely town with cute local shops and a farmers market on weekends. There isn't much nightlife or an abundance of shopping, almost no local sports although there are some art galleries. Everyone is very friendly and feels very safe."
College Sophomore,2,"At my school, the only available transportation is shuttles to Walmart on the weekends and shuttles to a few of the closer airports for international students over break. As a freshman, cars are not allowed unless you live more than 150 miles away. This is to help students get used to the community and being on campus. It is inconvenient, however, for anyone who buys groceries."
College Sophomore,2,It's a miserable experience to be a freshman with a car.  Once you pass freshman year it's not awful.
College Sophomore,2,"Not very good food... They're supposedly fixing that problem, and they HAVE made some improvements. Much more is going to need to change before their food could be anywhere close to good."
College Freshman,2,"Transportation provided by the school sucks. They do run shuttles to the nearby town of Madison and the ever popular Walmart, but not very often. Also, the times aren't very publicized, so more often than not you don't actually know when they shuttle is leaving. Transportation to the airports is unreliable, sometimes taking three times as long as it should to get from the airport to the school. Other than that, transportation isn't really needed. The campus is very walkable, so much so that driving to classes would be silly. Some students use bikes to get between their classes, and they are almost always where you left them by the time you get out of class."
College Freshman,2,Living in the Ohio River Valley does have its ups and downs.  Hanover gets weather to the extreme.  It rains a lot and classes rarely get cancelled.  Snow and ice can cause a problems while walking to class but luckily classes are close so not a lot of walking is necessary.
College Sophomore,2,"Hard to get, hard to keep, have to fight to get financial based scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly white, very little diversity.  There are clubs here to help promote the diversity that is present here."
College Junior,2,"Small but Varied – Hanover is a small college with mainly white students, but there is still a wide variety of races and religion present.  No matter your religion or race there is likely someone with the same background there."
College Freshman,2,There was a drought this year so the temperatures were high and some of the residence halls don't have a/c.  Also it's in an area that gets a lot of snowfall in the winter.  Not looking forward to melting in the summer and freezing in the winter.
College Junior,2,Student's Looks – There are slim pickins for good looking girls and guys.
College Freshman,2,"Attendence Policies Make You Feel Like You Are in High School – Going to class should be a student's responsibility but at Hanover, most professors have an ""attendence policy."" These attendence policies tell you how many acceptable days you can miss their class (usually 1 to 3) before they impose a punishment. The punishments are not restricted by the college so it is okay for a professor to take 5% off your final grade for every class you miss. It feels like high school where teachers would punish you for missing class. While all students should go to class, I've seen these attendence policies affect hardworking students. Attendence Policies at Hanover appear a little over the top."
College Freshman,2,"Lacking Athletic Center – At Hanover College, there is one athletic center called the Horner Center. While the facility is kept clean, it is small. The weight room and the cardio machines are in the same room because there are so few. The work out equiptment is outdated. Besides the Science Center, most buildings give off an outdated feeling. One of my classes is in a room once used as a lab, complete with holes in the floor and a white board that doesn't work. The Campus Center feels more formal than student friendly."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a whole lot of diversity on Hanover Campus. However, there are many international students"
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do for local life in Hanover. Activities take place in Madison. There is an upper area that is commercial and lower Madison which is by the river and more historical. Many students will travel to Louisville or Indianapolis if they want to get away and spend the day in the city.
College Sophomore,2,Campus is mostly white.  The only African American's on campus play sports.  The campus is mostly christian.
College Junior,2,"Hanover, is basically in the middle of nowhere, so there's nothing in walking distance, you must drive.  There are no discounts for students.  There is no place that delivers, except for Papa Johns.  There's no variety in food, it's basically the same thing, and its inexpensive.  The best places to eat are the small restaurants in Madison, which is the closest town, but they're not open very late, I believe they close at 9 pm on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"Off Campus – There are some options off campus, but most student tend to live on campus."
Niche User,1,"I was amazed how campus officials facilitated a harassing environment for a visiting team by the student body, coaches, and officials.  It was obvious after our recent experience that this small town campus needed  to help capture a win at all costs.  It was the most disturbing experience that we have ever witnessed.   How proud everyone must be at Hanover to be represented in such a manner.  Classless!"
College Sophomore,1,No one lives off campus.
College Sophomore,1,You are really not supposed to live off campus.
College Junior,1,You don't live off campus here...it just isn't common. The only place off campus is a miserable little apartment complex. The college owns all the other housing. Best best? Go Greek and live in those houses.
College Freshman,1,I believe there is only a small set of apartments right outside campus that a student can live in. Most students live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The sororities can be very clicky and can be heard talking ill of a fellow sister often.  Fraternities on campus give out alcohol to underage students and host parties all the time.  One house even has a bar hidden in a students room, and during parties free alcohol is given out all night to anyone who wants it.  Greeks can also be bad for covering things up in order to help a fellow member not get into trouble."
College Sophomore,1,"Few choices, greasy, little for vegans and vegetarians, limited dining hours.  The meal plan is also outrageously priced."
College Sophomore,1,"No air-conditioning in freshmen dorms and one upperclassmen dorm.  The rooms are small, and there are very little perks in building. The bathrooms can be dirty often and some dorms even have a bad smell."
College Sophomore,1,It is hard to live off campus because there are not many apartments near campus.  You will have to drive a bit to be able to live in a nice apartment also.
College Freshman,1,"Small Campus, Big Racist Problem – There are students from all over the world that attend Hanover College. However, race has been a problem at the college and in the surrounding communities. There is a very small African-American population here. In the five months that I have attended college here, there have been two incidents involving African-American students that were not handled well by the college. Instead of talking about the problems with the entire student body, they made matters worse by segregating the African-American students and having a meeting with only them. A good friend of mine (who is African-American) also said that she does not feel welcome in town. Many of the people in the southern small towns we are surrounded by are racist."
College Junior,1,Not Too Great – Some students from abroad programs. Not too diverse with respect to Americans
College Senior,1,"Way Too Strict – ridiculously strict. we have a ""dry"" campus and our campus security searches for students breaking the rules. our security isn't concerned with keeping the campus safe they're concerned with giving us fines to bring in more money. i was robbed on campus and my house was next door to security. had they been patrolling and doing their duty instead of trying to get us in trouble maybe i wouldn't have been robbed."
College Sophomore,1,What Housing? It is greatly recommended that no one commutes. So much so that I have no idea if we even have off-campus housing.
College Freshman,1,You Need a Car Here – There aren't buses here except for the weekly shuttle to Wal-Mart.  So you either have to have a car on campus or know someone who is willing to give you rides.
College Sophomore,1,"There is pretty much no transportation at HC. There's a free shuttle that runs twice a week to Walmart, and that's it. Otherwise you'll have to find a ride."
College Junior,1,"Very Limited. It is impossible to live off campus unless you meet certain requirements like: Older than 25 years old, have a dependent child, fifth year student, and commuting from home. Having the possibility to live off campus is something that I really wish Hanover let us do."
College Senior,1,"It seems as if the college frowns upon living off campus. (i.e having to ask special permission to live off campus)  It should be the up to the student if they want to live on or off campus. After all, we are the ones paying to go here. 

Housing off campus is not publicized by the school, causing accessibility, safety, and convenience  to be jeopardized.  The college should provide options or suggestions for people interested in living off campus."
College Junior,1,"Punishments and Security – Security is very slow to respond to complaints and they let FIJI do whatever they want. If they are going to crack down on one group of people, they need to crack down on EVERYONE."
College Junior,1,Hanover discourages living off campus. Enough said.
College Junior,1,"Things to Do – Hanover is a small town, and so is Madison. The college claims to bring thing to the campus, but this is not so. The attractions that are brought are not interesting to students. I know students want better shopping areas and things to do after 9pm besides taco bell."

Alum,5,"As the nation began locking down due to the Coronavirus pandemic, Kansas City Art Institute stepped up to meet the challenge. As you might imagine, being in a studio art-based program presents some problems as you transition to a remote classroom setting. With that said, the faculty, staff, and students made this transition quite well. It was difficult being isolated as we all quarantined and yet the school was very supportive holistically. As artists, the community found ways to stay connected, learned new and exciting ways to learn, present our portfolios, and create online. It has been a massive learning curve and the professors and administration did a fantastic job."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience at KCAI. The school was very supportive and encouraged exploration and individual expression. As a mature age student returning to academia to pursue my BFA, I found that the culture there was inclusive and provided a variety of opportunities for students. The faculty were fabulous. I found everyone to be open, approachable, and eager to assist students with their academic goals. Not only does the school foster an environment that encourages growth, creativity, and innovation the Kansas City area is an extension of that and is very supportive of the students at KCAI."
Freshman,5,"The buildings are amazing, so are the students I've seen working there. Definitely recommended for their willingness to help people pay for tuition and other expenses."
Niche User,5,"I like the school because they are always willing to help out incoming students with whatever they need, and are always willing to keep in contact with you if you have any questions. I don't see anything that needs changing."
Works Here,5,"KCAI is challenging but you get a lot out of an education here. It is not for the faint at heart. There is a huge focus on foundational skills and you spend your first year trying everything. It is kind of like a boot camp for art. If you love to work hard and you really want to get better, this is a great school to do that. 

It is also located in a really great part of a pretty neat city. A lot of people end up sticking around after college because Kansas City tends to be pretty supportive of artists and creatives. There is also a lot of opportunity after graduation, much more than just a studio artist."
Sophomore,5,"It is a small school that provides a great environment for the arts. It is located between two great museums, Nelson Atkins and Kemper. 
The professor and faculty are really caring and helpful. The school also provides independent studio spaces and great installations/materials.
I love it here, not gonna lie, you need to work a lot, but that's why you are in school, righ?"
Freshman,5,"I really like how the campus is small and close together. I really enjoy living on campus. You get to be in the middle of the community and get notified about the events happening on campus. With residency in the living center, you get a meal plan which provides you with three meals a day in the cafeteria. The food is pretty good, much better than high school food and the dining staff is really friendly. The school sits right between two art museums which is really handy and is in walking distance of Westport and the Plaza. All of the professors are really nice and want to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,"This is a school to go to if you want the best education in the arts. Their programs are rigorous and fast paced, but the improvement that can be seen from my peers was astounding. The faculty care about each student and the small classes makes this education more personable. At this school, you are able to diverge from any path you choose and try things you never thought you would consider. Many people go to this school for one major and end up taking something the complete opposite because this school is good at showing you the options they cam provide."
Graduate Student,5,"The college challenges you, supports you, and lets you grow as an artist. Once you graduate, you will understand how much you value the college. The instructors I had were very supportive and allowed me to do what I had to do at that time. They let allowed me to see how far I could take things to the next level. If you work hard, you will see what you can do. One thing I learned when going to this school is that it is not like most colleges where you can party ever night. You will be in studio every night and the instructors will see who puts time into their work and who doesn't. Also, school comes first, not your job. That's why I decided to go to this college.  I think it would be cool if they had a masters programs for a few of their majors."
College Freshman,5,The professors are knowlegable in their courses and enjoy teaching.
College Freshman,5,If there are people who do drugs on campus you can't really tell.
College Freshman,5,Despite the whole setting up things being a bit confusing it's worth it as far as I can tell. Jobs will defiantly take you seriously graduating from here.
College Freshman,5,Art school is not typically the parting type because you can't art drunk as for other means of drugs I don't really know but I don't think it ever lead to anything sexual.
College Freshman,5,They really want to know what your living needs are for the best artistic out put. They spend lots of time figuring it out for you.
College Freshman,5,"Its great, the nusers are nice and very helpful and."
College Freshman,5,the student career prospects are great and the value of the degree is great.
College Freshman,5,The courses are great and i learn new stuff everyday day.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms, are always clean and everyone is very nice."
College Freshman,5,"My experience has been amazing, its a school with great academics."
College Sophomore,5,It was awesome. My mom drive me up for portfolio review and I was told I would be accepted that day. I loved the small campus and how all the students seemed to be like me.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved my education at KCAI! I had great instructors, took amazing classes, and had three awesome internships. My favorite experiences were interning for The Studios Inc and learning about the ins and outs of running a large residency and exhibition space. I also studied abroad in Florence, Italy - where I took art conservation. It was an incredible six weeks that I wish I could re-live every year. I have some amazing life-long friends who are all doing really interesting things. It's fantastic to see how each individual student pursues their goals after graduation. I am excited to see where we will all be 10, 20, 30 years from now."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I went to a university for my freshman year, and then to community college before attending KCAI. This was by far the best experience I had. Everyone is friendly, helpful, and willing to go the extra mile for you. 

The courses here are challenging, and you will learn an amazing amount. The faculty are personally invested in each students success, and give a lot of their time outside of class to working with us. The class sizes are smaller so you get individualized attention in your studio and liberal arts classes, and they are large enough to create healthy creative dialogue, and competition. You are surrounded by people who are equally passionate about art + design, and it create an amazing atmosphere to learn in. All of our faculty are practicing in their field, and are knowledgeable about the history of their medium, current practice, and technical craft."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I paid $600 a month for a 300 square ft apartment in TX. In Kansas City, I currently rent a 1,000 square food apartment, 2 bdrms, with one other person and my share of the rent is $300! Renting a one bedroom will run you around $500 per month, but if you live with another person you can live for as little as $250 a month. Most students live within 2 miles of campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I grew up in Houston, and now I travel for my job. One of the things I miss the most when I travel is the food in Kansas City because there are very few places that I have visited that have as many fantastic options. There is a little bit of everything, and it is all amazing. I am gluten, dairy, soy free. I have my favorite spots that include BBQ, Mexican, Mediterranean, Thai, Vegetarian, there is great Indian food, brunch spots, local fare, vegan bakery and coffee shop, burger joints, etc. Seriously good food, and very affordable."
College Freshman,5,"A rainbow of people here. Most of the students are LGBTQ+ friendly. Pronouns need more work, and non-binary labels and thought (Niche, I'm looking at you). There's a half-half thing here- half the people like to dress up everyday, half don't. Half the people are dating, half aren't."
College Freshman,5,"Made some awesome friends, great projects, had some cool and inspirational teachers, plenty of opportunity, etc. Went to the Opera recently for a class, and before made bags with leaders faces on them. The classes are hard but are remembered well. time outside of class is even more memorable. It's just awesome."
College Sophomore,5,the teacher want to help the students which creates a great setting for learning
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy being around other who share the same interest
College Freshman,5,"I love Kansas City. Museums, parks, fountains, sports, and cultural attractions along with shopping and family neighborhoods."
College Freshman,5,"Very secure, evening patrols and friendly interactive staff."
College Freshman,5,"So far I've only been in my first year which is foundations.  You're required to get an internship your junior year.  It's a heavy workload but worth it with the amount you learn.  They give you acces to what you need and the teachers are all top notch, foundations specialization or liberal arts."
College Freshman,5,"I love this school.  It's hard, but it's collage, it's supposed to be hard.  I had wonderful peers, a great atmosphere, and I learned so much from this school."
College Freshman,5,"As a soon to be sophomore, I have yet to experience my major.  I go to an art school and the first year is dedicated to experiencing a wide variety of art and shaping your mind to prepare you for the coming years.  This is a unique program and though it was exceedingly difficult I absolutely loved it.  It's structured to help everyone from each of the different possible majors someone could go into.  I know it helped me."
College Sophomore,5,"The rooms are very small. There is one building you can live in on campus, freshman get first dibs. There is a meal plan, but the food isn't great. It's relatively clean, but still wear shower shoes.."
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of different places. You name it and there is probably somewhere nearby that serves what you want.
College Freshman,5,"You're given a lot of work, but it's to discipline you. You can't come here and party all the time. You'll fail of course. Time management is key here, especially in the foundations year. Professors are great, curriculum is well-planned and extensive. Registration, for me at least, was pretty easy to get through."
College Senior,5,"Freshman are the only ones who live in the dorms, everyone else lives off campus.  The neighborhood around the school is not very safe, but the school does a good job at informing students about the unsafe things happening in the neighborhood and how to prevent it.  The housing is incredibly affordable, I'd say about $400-600 average and possibly less if you have roommates.  If you need help finding a roommate student affairs is very helpful and keeps a list of all the students looking for roommates.  They also give advice about what areas are more safe and which landlords are more helpful."
College Senior,5,"Being a painting major is clearly the best. We are the only department to have full studios with a gallery to show work bimonthly. We also have a large faculty with expertise in everything from the renaissance to modern, so just about any question you have can be answered by email or a short trip to the offices. The program is very intense, but constantly being around your peers and critique, really helps develop a successful studio practice."
College Senior,5,"KCAI is really close to two popular areas called Westport and the Plaza. It's also a short distance from the bar area downtown called Power and Light accessible by bus. There are tons of varieties of places to go, such as dive bars or classy martini bars. There is also tons of entertainment throughout the year. Kansas City has a wonderful local scene that they take pride in."
College Freshman,5,KC has some of the best restaurants in the country!
Sophomore,4,They recently built new dorms which are amazing and definitely worth moving into if it is affordable for you and your family. They are very expensive but they want all freshmen under the age of 25 to live on campus. The food is wonderful. It is buffet style and such an improvement from the last dining center. Freshmen year is absolutely a boot camp and don’t be surprised when you feel like pulling out your hair. It is okay. We all got through it. You’ll get through it and it’s worth it in the long run. If you are actually serious about expanding yourself as a person and an artist then come here. Do not come here thinking it will be rainbows and sunshine and you’ll get to finger paint and draw in adult coloring books. That is not what this is. This is a professional setting to grow and if you want it to work then you must be open and willing to learn and expand.
Freshman,4,"Kansas City Art Institute is a 4-year college of art. The first year concentrates on exposing the student to different types of material and processes, collaboration, and ways of thinking. The workload sets up students for success. It is challenging, thought-provoking, and self-driven. The students are expected to learn the discipline necessary for a career in the arts. Therefore, they are assigned multiple, fast paced projects with high expectations. The projects involve creative problem solving. The faculty all work closely with every student and give individualized feedback and assignments based on their needs and abilities. The student transforms over the year as they expand their knowledge and hone their craft. However, the faculty all have different expectations. Some will assign more work or be a better fit for some students. The structure of the year allows for this by setting up three four-week workshops taught by different faculty in the second semester."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy how much I have learned in such a short period of time. My professors and mentors have helped me look at art and creation in a way that I never have before. I enjoy the social aspect of Kansas City Art Institute, as I get to work alongside people I have become close with over only a handful of months. My peers are there for me just as I am for them.
Something I would change about the Art Institute would be the focus around requiring students to resign from a part-time job to be able to succeed in school. I am not able to pay tuition and succeed in general without working a part-time job. I have to work significantly more than I would have to if I do not work a job. However, working is something that I required for me to be able to attend KCAI."
Sophomore,4,Amazing professors! They actually care about you and will make an effort on checking in with you if they notice something is up or if you haven’t been in class. It’s pretty amazing if I must say.
Alum,4,Overall I very much enjoyed my time in the illustration department. Foundation year is a hellish bootcamp but once you get into the major you actually want it is much more fulfilling. The illustration department is great and all the professors are wonderful and very invested and care about the students. The workload can be overwhelming at times. I have seen many classmates drop out or stay back a year from not being able to handle it. It gets more manageable as you go though. The school is super inclusive for LGBT+ students and puts a big emphasis on pronouns and most buildings have gender neutral bathrooms. I’ve heard not great things about the living center but they are building a new one! The school has 2 art museums on either side which is a huge resource for art history. The big downside is the safety of the area. There is a lot of crime in the immediate area and i have heard of many students being the victims of muggings. it can be very scary walking home from night classes.
Freshman,4,"Poor rooming conditions. Heating is non existent to the point where it's freezing even in the summer. There is a hole in the wall and occasionally you can hear rustling sounds coming from within it in the night. I was promised a fitness center, but alas my tuition only covers free Zumba lessons from a faculty member. If I had to describe the food as a color, it would be medi'ochre'. Ha! However, I agree... Ric's cous cous is divine! The people are great and some professors will work with you."
Junior,4,"My Experience in the Illustration department has been one that felt much like a family. The staff bend over backward for students for them to succeed and continue in the illustration world. 

The main issue I've had was having to deal with administrative issues as they are not always organized or communicating issues on campus."
Freshman,4,"its ok i find it sorta difficult sometimes with everything that goes on down there due to my disability, I also feel very limited about what i can do there such as offensive humor or comedic materials that will effect others. there also seems to be more narrative media topics that people have been more attracted to which reflects the type of art that i wish to achieve in my career goals. but overall it nice, i feel very welcomed to my institute and happy that I'm improving myself as a more semi professional artist, people at the art institute like my work and i wish to get better and learn more as time goes by, and i sorta have and wish to succeed and doing so due to the help of professors and peers help."
Freshman,4,"So far, the school has been a wonderful experience for me, aside from one rather unhelpful teacher. otherwise, i have enjoyed it all. so far i have learned many skills that i had partial knowledge of and have since expanded upon, and have learned a great deal of Art History and enjoy it dearly. I may personally struggle with some aspects of the curriculum but that isn't the fault of the school. the school is a wonderfully diverse and accommodating place and i look forward to my future there."
Junior,4,"Great school for those who love small campuses, open-minded people, art (in all its forms), and PB&J Nights in the dorms. Very friendly people, great security, and a peaceful campus. What's not to love about KCAI?"
College Freshman,4,The people are nice for the most part and teachers are always there to help but the cost is outrageous and you'd probs have some debt but I get where it goes.
College Freshman,4,It's defnaintly a great school with lots to do just way over priced with not a lot of options for people who don't have a lot. The applications are confusing for the most part and you will probably have to call the office a lot to ask questions. Most of the steps that would benefit you are obscure and difficult to find but the office people are patient and will walk you through it as many times as it takes.
College Sophomore,4,"KCAI offers fun events during the later hours, such as PB&J Night (my personal fave), where you can go to the living center and (usually around 9pm) you can make your own PB&J for free! It's a great event to be apart of (especially if you've run out of nighttime snacks in your dorm room). Parties at KCAI usually are fun, hilarious, and a bit weird but overall, they bring people together. The KCAI nighttime events I've been to usually end with a ton of smiling faces and people laughing their heads off, all in good humor and good vibes."
College Sophomore,4,"Being an art institute, you can expect that KCAI students are either very busy or have lots of free time. It's only one or the other, however. The workload can be intense depending on the professor and the class itself. Most instructors are understanding of their students, so if anything seems to be troublesome, you can talk with them. If the instructors are busy, your classmates can also be helpful to talk to (trust me, sometimes they are just as confused as you are). If you need someplace to study, the library, the computer lab, the living center lobby, and the meeting room next to the workout room are perfect places to do so."
College Sophomore,4,"People at KCAI are very diverse, more diverse than some universities sometimes. KCAI students and staff are all unique; there are many people with varying backgrounds, sexual orientations, and religions. Ethnicity is also diverse but not as great as people's beliefs, backgrounds, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"The Kansas City Art Institute is a great private institution for those like me: open-minded, understanding, artsy, fun-loving, caring, and free-spirited individuals. The amount of art courses offered are immense and diverse, including even liberal arts courses like Art History and Creative Writing. The professors are well-experienced, intelligible, and strive to make amazing artists out of their students. The class sizes are typically small, ranging from 15-25 students per class. Depending on your chosen course, classes can be mostly hands-on; usually, liberal arts classes are the only classes that are textbook, notes and lecture-only. Classes span from 2-D arts, such as Illustration and Painting, to 3-D arts, like Ceramics, and media-based arts, such as Animation and Film."
College Sophomore,4,"KCAI Security is available almost anywhere. They can drive you back to campus if you happen to feel unsafe, they are constantly around the KCAI Living Center, they roam around campus, they have a phone number if you need to call them for any reason, and if any crime happens to go on around or near campus, they will send an email to all students and staff. They will also post a message up on the living center bulletin board and other places around campus, if needed."
College Sophomore,4,"The Kansas City Art Institute of KC, MO is a small private art school dedicated to fulfilling students' artistic achievements. Both students and professors are open-minded individuals and respect each others' personal lifestyle choices. People, on and off campus, can feel free to talk to administration about any issues with financial aid, classes, or personal problems without the feeling of being judged. The ""Green"", a large, tree encircled field in the center of KCAI, is a popular hangout spot for playing games, studying, picnics, or sunbathing on the cool grass, taking in the nature that surrounds you. All students that typically go to KCAI come with one similar goal in mind: to become successful in the visual and fine arts world. Although KCAI can have expensive tuition, is underfunded, and contains older dorms and older facilities, it continues to be a well-loved institute for art students and art lovers across the United States. This institute is perfect for free spirits, artsy individuals, and open minds of any kind."
College Sophomore,4,"I loved my first year, I had a problem with one teacher but overall I loved my teachers they challenged me and helped me when I needed help"
College Sophomore,4,They try their best to help with career oppertunities they set you up with internships and still keep in contact after school
College Sophomore,4,"My school isn't ""hard"" it's very work intensive, I'm never not busy working on a project, they professors keep us constantly busy and you have to work hard to succeed, I work the hardest I've ever worked and I have come far since last year. On thing that is frustrating is that you can work for hours and hours on a work and someone else could just spend one hour on another thing but if they're better they're gonna get a better grade, it's discouraging but I know with all my hard work I will soon be the better artist."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus, mind you, CAMPUS is great with health and safety. However if you are in Illustration or Fibers, the safety factor goes down because those buildings aren't on campus this making them a big unsafe during the night."
College Freshman,4,Dorms are great and cozy.
College Freshman,4,The school is everything I expected an art school to be
College Freshman,4,There are 24 hour securities available and a number you can always call incase of campus emergencies.
College Sophomore,4,"My admissions counselor really took the time to understand my situation. When I told him I did not have enough coverage to attend the school, he offered me a grant to cover the remainder of tuition. He also was accommodating to my parent's poor credit-which meant I couldn't take out outside loans. Overall, far better financial aid help than the first college I attended."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Lots to do, super affordable, beautiful place to live."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Expect what you would almost anywhere else, in terms of getting along with people. You will make fast friends, grow into other friendships, and have people you don't get along with. That's just part of life. 

Style of dress seems like a silly thing to consider when looking for a college. As an art + design school, students have their own aesthetics but often dress for their major - meaning we dress appropriate to the materials we work with. I'm not going to wear my nicest clothes when I am oil painting. 

Everyone has different interests within their areas of study. We all do a lot of research for our studio practice and it keeps conversations really interesting, intellectual, and creatively challenging. 

We spend the majority of our time in our studios. Outside of that, you will meet students through electives, liberal arts, campus organizations, etc. There are a lot of arts events happening around the city where you can meet and network with people outside of the KCAI student body. The art scene is really supportive."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Kansas City was not a place I imagined myself living or going to college, but once I visited campus I knew this was where I wanted to be. The facilities are fantastic, the faculty are full time, the attention is on undergraduate students, and we have so much flexibility to explore our interests. There are great internship opportunities with artists, galleries, design firms, animation firms, museums, etc.

Students receive outstanding opportunities for graduate level studies, including scholarship and acceptance to top programs. 

We have numerous visiting artists every year; great networking opportunities, and opportunities to show our work in local galleries. 

Students pursue varying careers. Many take time to continue their studio practice after graduation, before committing to a 9-5. Applied arts graduates have great career options. My friends from Graphic Design for instance have high paying jobs in places like San Francisco, New York, Austin, etc."
Recent Alumnus,4,"We don't have a student health center on campus, but we do have a lot of information available to student about low cost and emergency clinics close to campus. If you have insurance through your parents, there are two major hospital systems, one that is only a few minutes from campus.

Our Student Services provide great training for the staff, faculty, and students in regards to sexual misconduct. 

Crime on campus is actually minimal for a mid-town area. Usually it's because someone left their laptop in their car, or they were walking home past 1 AM alone. That would happen anywhere. I never experienced any reason to be uncomfortable or feel unsafe while I was a student."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There were always a lot of fun parties to go to. People hang out in their apartments, or houses they rent. Someone turned their apartment into a gallery, and passed it on to another student. A girl in my class had the best annual Halloween party, and again, as art students the costumes were always amazing!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"A strong portfolio benefits you the most, as it is an art + design college.

Don't wait until the last minute to apply for outside scholarships, start doing that early and it will help you a lot. 

Be prepared to take out loans. Federal financial aid has a lot of re-payment options that can really benefit you after graduation, so do the research to better understand the financial investment you are making."
College Freshman,4,"The courses are really customable, and the academic advisors are really helpful. The courses are all ace and are led by excellent teachers. The Liberal Arts here have the most memorable and awesome teachers."
College Freshman,4,There are a pretty good number of restaurants because it's a city but they are not in the immediate area.
College Freshman,4,We actually go to class because there are attendence policies.
College Junior,4,"Depending on where you look and what company you decide to go with, housing off campus can be awesome. The school owns a property called Checkers that is a few minutes away from the main campus that is injunction with a local housing management company that is a great option. There are a variety of Housing Management companies that are amazing and very accommodating ."
College Junior,4,"Off-campus dining is amazing. In Kansas City, there are a number of local, ethnic, and fusion cuisines as well as fast food places. A lot of amazing places are small little corner restaurants on Broadway and Main st. We have the Country Club Plaza, which is a 10 min. walk from campus, that has a variety of retail stores and more well known restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, P.F Chang's, Bo Lings Chinese Please!, Ingredient, Season's 52, etc. We have a variety of bars and bar food restaurants in Westport, which is a 15 minute walk from campus. We have the crossroads in the downtown area (You should take a bus or drive down there) that has a variety of restaurants. There are many places in Kansas City to enjoy amazing food. My favorite places are iPho Tower, Chai Shay, Lulu's Thai Noodle Shop, The Filling Station, The Beer Kitchen, Blanc Burgers, The Local Pig, Cafe Gratitude (a vegan/vegetarian restaurant), and for an amazing coffee shop - Broadway Cafe."
College Freshman,4,"It's great. There's the Plaza, which is big money but they have nice restaurants for special occasions or dates or job opportunity. There's Westport, which has smaller restaurants and bars and cafes and is a bit cheaper. There's the Crossroads but that's downtown, so one'll need a car. All have great options and prices ranges. One'll need to walk around and check them out."
College Freshman,4,"They really are strict about attendance, but that depends on the teacher. Missing class, whether 15% or 30% will either droop it significantly or fail one. Sometimes they don't accept any excuse even if it really wasn't the students fault for missing or not notifying the school about their absence. Some teachers aren't all that tolerant or understanding of any mental health issues or conditions so people should watch out for that. Otherwise, the teachers are awesome and the admin are really helpful. Most just really want to help and forward a student's career and learning."
College Freshman,4,"I applied early and had a great portfolio and grades. Art schools appreciate good grades and test scores; there are even merit scholarships for a good ACT score. Anyways, I got a good scholarship and even more money when my admissions advisor gave me a form that asked for more money. She was awesome helpful. KCAI gives great scholarships but, of course, one must keep their grades up, which isn't hard if your a good student with time management skills and don't always do parties or drugs. There is also workstudy, which one should apply for early if one wants a job and a job that they like with maybe good pay."
College Junior,4,"Overall, its a great area.  The college is right next to a couple art museums, parks, and the Kansas City Plaza District."
College Sophomore,4,there are many internships student can apply for. many people receive job offers because of the school name
College Sophomore,4,there's always something going on and clubs. it's a very close campus so you get to talk to different people and make friends.
College Sophomore,4,It's fun too learn from the teachers who have much to give
College Freshman,4,The specialize academic study is exactly what I've been looking for.
College Freshman,4,A large number of students participate in competitive and intermural sports on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I didn't personally go a lot, but the few times I did the food was always excellent and was never to inconvenient or expensive to go to."
College Freshman,4,I gave a general portfolio.  They want artist and then will train those artists in the specific way the artist chooses.
College Freshman,4,"The school is inbetween two great museums, within walking distance of the plaza, a large shopping area, and surrounded by parks."
College Freshman,4,Upperclassmen aren't allowed in the dorms.  There are a lot of housing options nearby.
College Freshman,4,Most people here are very understanding with an open mind.  You can tell it's an art school though because everyone dresses and acts like it.
College Freshman,4,"There may not be any transportation, but there isn't any need for it.  The campus is very small and the buildings are all well within walking distance.  The walkways are well kept and in such a way they're beautiful all year long."
College Freshman,4,The weather really doesn't affect campus.
College Freshman,4,"The only ones I have experience with are freshman classes, which are mandatory and pre-chosen for you.  Foundations, the art class everyone has to take, is hard.  The teachers expect you to work as hard as possible all year long.  Roughly a quarter of the freshman class is able to make it through the program each year.  The liberal arts classes also pertain to art, such as art history instead of normal history."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most of the security guards you know by name. Friendly people, if you call and ask to walk you to your car they will gladly do so, although most the area around there is pretty safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Has everything you could possibly want. Pretty diverse. Westport and Crossroads are pretty close so transportation is not too difficult. West Bottoms is not too far away from the Crossroads area either. Lots of different settings and people. You can easily find something to do, whether it's entertainment, dining out, getting involved, or relaxing."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's really not bad at all. You can easily find a spot if you give yourself time. You will need to get a parking pass and from what I remember it was reasonably cheap. I enjoy walking the majority of the time, so walking from my car to a building was not hard on me unless I was late."
College Senior,4,"Best in Missouri for sure, though they take them away very easily."
College Senior,4,I love the animation department here and would go through the program again in a heartbeat. The rest of the school has something to learn from that department.
College Senior,4,"Very good, but not the best in the world"
Alum,2,"I felt like 2 of my core teachers at this school were much more interested in their outside professional projects than my education.  The head of the department was great and supportive and inspirational, but the other two ""working artists"" were frustrating to have as professors and didn't seem like they were accountable to anyone.  Also, the general focus of my program (Photography and New Media) was on concept and not on improving technique, which I did not personally agree with as a good teaching method."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have athletics at all, it's an all art school, not focused on anything else"
College Sophomore,2,"The Dorms are ancient and pricy, I lived there freshman year and It was awful. My room was always cold and my roommate and I didn't have alot of space. For some reason our room was on the end and was kinda small."
College Sophomore,2,"Well I attend a school for the arts, not dancing or singing arts but traditional arts, Painting, sculpture, illustration, ect. While there is a gym in the living center, its really small and sometimes the RA's aren't nice about letting off campus students use it even though we all pay a fair amount of money to the college."
College Freshman,2,"I don't have any athletics at my school, because its and art school."
College Freshman,2,It gets progressively worse as time goes on.  It's also very expensive.
College Junior,2,"Financial Aid is great the first year you attend, but as tuition rises, there seems to be less and less help from the school to cover those costs in your merit and other scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,there is no greeks at the school
College Freshman,2,"The meal plan is used on the cafeteria.  The food is processes and usually not the best, but it's much better than previous years."
College Senior,2,Kansas City public transportation is a joke.
College Freshman,2,"Diversity regarding to ethnicity is scarce. There are way more American individuals than African Americans, Asian, Latino, etc. I wish there were a variety of us instead."
College Sophomore,2,Pretty much everyone here is white but everyone is very accepting of eachother in the ways that they are different. There are a lot of gay/lesbian/transgender people here. They are accepted nicely.
College Junior,2,"Compared to other prestigious art schools, KCAI offers pretty good scholarships. Out of the three art schools I applied to, KCAI gave me the most money but for the amount I still have to pay, I feel like we should have more/better facilities and, as students, we should be more involved in the decisions made at the school rather than the administration (which has nearly no background in the arts) make all decisions without our input."
College Senior,2,"There aren't many! A tiny gym where two people can work out at a time, very few clubs, no interdepartmental anything-- It's hard to grade this topic. The Library isn't amazing, but it isn't bad, and the cafeteria is pretty awesome, but that's it."
College Senior,2,"Drugs and Drinking Are Everywhere – Both scene's are available at KCAI, in dorms and off campus. Alcohol is brought into studios-- You can walk across campus and into your dorm with a six pack on the right day. While ""study"" drugs and weed are the easy drugs on campus, students can hit any party house on the block for something more lethal or experimental. If you aren't interested, though, most kids will leave you alone about it."
College Freshman,2,"Security Is a Placebo – KCAI is mostly focused on the students. They care for their students a lot, and want them to be successful, but they do this at the cost of less funds, and since this is an inner city campus, it's no surprise that, even with our security force, and the need for an ID card to get in anywhere, bad stuff is going to happen at some point. 

Theft is what we have to worry about the most, whether it be from our rooms, our studios, or even our cars, there's not much our security can do, except tell us to be careful."
College Freshman,2,"While the city itself is beautiful and offers events, students are not social and there are not many student activities offered. Weekends are dead, the town closes early and unless you're not interested in going to studio for fun, i don't recommend coming to the school"
College Sophomore,2,I find that there are a lot of white people compared to any other race. I even had a professor ask if I felt different or weird while I was there. If I had made lots of friends or not. I'm asian and I happened to have another asian friend and he questioned our relationship. He asked if we became friends better since we were the same race. It was kind of frustrating since I am very accepting of every race and culture. I can make friends with anyone since I don't see different ethnicities a problem.
College Student,2,It's a Shame – I do not feel the food is very good. I am sorry I am required to pay for it freshman year.
Junior,1,I hated the online learning experience because I'm hands on and work In the studio most of the time.  There was not a good transition for me and I had a lot of stress and anxiety and my parents were concerned about my mental health.
Sophomore,1,The online experience at the art institute was not great. They sent all the tests out as Google forms and half the teachers did not know how to use Google Classroom. The Disability Support never reached out to assist students with the difficult time and a lot of students were really struggling due to lack of support and space at home. They obviously weren’t prepared for it and that isn’t their fault but they did not make an adequate plan for a successful finish of the semester.
Freshman,1,Horrible school bad environment for anyone with health issues . Kids are cruel and uncivilized teachers are incredible unproffesional... don't waste your money on this poor education. Also this school has a consistent amount of bullying and kids attempting suicide as a reaction. KCAi is a horrible school and I would never let anyone I know go there. Also they make you pay out of pocket for All your materials which your teacher picks for you. Don't waste your time here with horrible people and a horrible education......
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at my school because its an art school.
College Senior,1,"No sports really, it's a art school"
College Sophomore,1,"There are two tiny parking lots that have 20 spaces total, and there isn't enough street parking for the rest of the school. You better get to class 20 minutes early because you won't find a parking spot of you don't."
College Freshman,1,"There are no athletics at the school. The Black Lungs are a group of guys that hang out and play soccer together, but that is pretty much it."
College Freshman,1,"The school doesn't support a nightlife, but there are plenty of options around if you look."
College Sophomore,1,The dorms are for freshman only unless you get special permission. They are extremely old and extremely small. They don't have very much to offer either.
College Sophomore,1,"There Are No Sports. Kansas City Art Institute has no organized sports teams, and very few to no organized clubs based around sports."
College Sophomore,1,"Little to None. As an art school, I wouldn't say a lot of the students are athletic. There is one unofficial indoor soccer team, called The Black Lungs, some people get pretty stooked on it. But thats the only team we've got."
College Freshman,1,"drugs and alcohol are all around. people don't bother to hide it and unless you do drugs, there is nothing to do. all the people doing social things involve drugs and alcohol therefore if you are straight edge it is very difficult to get involved in anything other than work"
College Sophomore,1,There is so little racial diversity at KCAI. Everyone is pretty much white.
College Sophomore,1,It is a very small campus but too many students with cars! The dorm parking is so tiny. Maybe like 30 spots! And there are around 200 freshmen. We can use the art museum parking but that's not that much space either and it's inconvenient.

Graduate Student,5,"I very much appreciate St. Mary's University. As a graduate student, I have had a wonderful experience with the department leads and professors. Not only do they want to support you in any way they can to succeed academically, but they also care about a students mental and emotional health. I feel very supported by this school and I am confident I am getting a quality education."
Graduate Student,5,"As a student who wanted in person classes, the switch to online courses has been very difficult. My department leads and professors worked very hard to create a supportive and interactive online experience. While I still prefer in person classes, I feel confident that I am getting a quality education from my online learning."
Graduate Student,5,"Saint Mary's University of Minnesota is steeped in Lasallian Catholic tradition and driven by today's technology. The array of degree programs offered online and on campus exemplify a long history of innovation in education, which translates to enhanced career opportunities."
Niche User,5,"The campus truly makes you feel at home and it is full with a lot of activities such as sporting events, different movies, hiking in the bluffs, and many more.  Also, students can create a bond or good relationship with their teachers due to the low teacher to student ratio. I believe this university is such a great fit for not only me but for many others."
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere surrounding Saint Mary's is surreal. I was a little nervous to go so far from home, but this now my second home. Everyone talks about ""Minnesota Nice"" and this expression is fully shown through the people contributing to Saint Mary's welcoming atmosphere."
Graduate Student,5,"I did my Master in Science project management program in 2017, the Professors were very impressive in learning. The system of online learning was easy to navigate and submit assignment. I recommend the school for good learning and acceptable tuition price.

Sophomore,5,"I feel safe on campus anytime, day or night. The classes are small and  personalized to each student, there are no big lectures. The dorms are spacious and clean. Love the bluffs and trails too!"
Junior,5,Saint Mary's has been a great choice this far in advancing my education. The online pathway to completing the degree is allowing me to focus on all aspects of life. The professors are wonderful and there is a true connection to the course material being learned.
Sophomore,5,"As a small college, Saint Mary's University of Minnesota is excellent because this type of environment really allows students to get to know each other and faculty very well. The campus is located in the bluffs, making it incredibly scenic, as well as providing many unique opportunities such as cross country skiing and frolfing (frisbee golfing)."
Sophomore,5,Saint Mary's has a beautiful campus and great teachers who are willing to take the time to help you succeed. They have a of great classes and a wide array of extracurricular activities.
Junior,5,Beautiful campus and great people. Don't want college here to end! I like it here so much that I stay and work in the summers. Small town with so much to do!
Sophomore,5,"Attending Saint Mary's for one year now, I have come across many great things with this school. I would say that the academics really push a person to strive for greatness. Every person is able to succeed and be challenged all at the same time. While these classes might be rigorous, the professors will always be willing to help and since it is such a small campus, they will get to know and care about you. This campus is a small community with so many friendly faces and a plethora of different activities to take part in. I genuinely enjoy being a part of this school."
Graduate Student,5,"Quite frankly my experience with SMUMN has been nothing shy of great. Not only the professors, but all faculty are always kind and available for assistance. This university truly wants to see their students succeed."
Niche User,5,"My daugher attends SMU, so I am familiar with the campus and everything about it. The campus is small which is perfect for what we were looking for. The class sizes are also small which makes learning easier for her. Students get to know the professors well. There is so much to do for her beyond academics and sports. The community is also excellent giving them plenty of things to do on their down time."
Senior,5,I love how friendly and caring the professors are about the students and how the atmosphere is one that is focused on helping the students as individuals and not just how the school looks on paper.
Niche User,5,Beautiful Campus and amazing education. Small class sizes and freindly community really makes you feel at home.
Sophomore,5,When I was in a car accident the school took great care of me and my family. Staff members were there in the hospital for me just a couple hours after the accident happened.
Alum,5,The staffs real life work experiences and knowledge makes for great conversation on topics that can be very helpful for understanding complicated topics.
Freshman,5,"Saint Mary's is an amazing community to learn in. Everyone will take the time to learn about you and why you are here. All the Professors teach because they are passionate about their students, not because they are looking to benefit themselves. The classes are small and personal, and soon everyone will become a familiar face on campus! Great facilities and housing as well. Winona is a great city with lots of things to do indoors and out."
Freshman,5,This school is good for the students that want a small campus atmosphere. You recognize everyone on campus. The faculty and the staff are great. They are willing to help all students when they need the help. If a student is struggling in class the professor might remind them of their office hours to get the extra help. Their is not much of a party life on campus.
Freshman,5,"I like Saint MaryÂ´s alot.  there is a lot of stuff you can do here, and it never gets boring.  the teachers are nice, and with the small class sizes, you really can create great relationships with your professors."
Freshman,5,"I like how at Saint Mary's everyone is connected in some way, and how the professors get to know you as a student, not as just a student I.D. number."
Sophomore,5,"I have never had a community that has cared about me as an individual as much as Saint Mary's has. While the food is poor, the atmosphere is amazing and everyone is incredibly supportive."
Niche User,5,During my experience I stayed with a group of juniors that showed me around the campus and they were representing the school very nicely. The head track and field coach took time out of his day to give me a tour around and included lunch and dinner for the overnight visit that I was on.
Graduate Student,5,Class sizes are small and very interactive for a wide variety of learning experiences. There are many resources that are very accessible to students. The campus is beautiful!
Graduate Student,5,"So far, I'm really enjoying my experience at Saint Mary's University! I am an online student and the school provided me with an iPad, which is so great. The class structure is easy to understand and the professors are typically very quick to respond to any questions or concerns.  I do wish we were able to take more than one class at a time, but I can understand why the university does not allow it. "
College Sophomore,5,"it's perfectly safe, there aren't a lot of interactions."
College Sophomore,5,there has been some great people that have come from campus and they give us numerous options
College Sophomore,5,I had a rough start but I wouldn't want to have it any other way at any other place
College Sophomore,5,They give us what we need plus more
College Sophomore,5,I have had good places to stay with friends or my room
College Sophomore,5,from what Ive seen they are good at stuff they put on
College Sophomore,5,love what they got to offer. works for everyone
College Sophomore,5,"friendly people, willing to help, there for you"
College Junior,5,The professors on campus are very kind and passionate about the courses they teach. Most of the teachers care about the students in all aspects and are willing to accommodate with students when needed. The class sizes are amazing. It helps me feel more comfortable to participate in class with out worrying about being judged if wrong.
College Junior,5,Saint Mary's University of Minnesota is a wonderful place to gain an education. I feel very welcome and know that I can find help with anything on campus whenever.
College Junior,5,"SMU is giving me great training in order to perform professionally after graduating. I have already received professional roles due to my relationships with professors, and they have plenty of contacts all over the country."
College Junior,5,"I really love it here, but mostly because of my program. The number of gen eds we have to take is a little high, but the classes are at least interesting. The professors have personal relationships with students and take time to learn everyone's name. The class sizes are generally small, hardly any classes are over 30 students."
College Junior,5,"I decided to attend this school because of its unique theatre program. With many schools, it is difficult to study abroad due to limited class availability. Saint Mary's incorporates study abroad into its curriculum, with a requirement that all juniors go to London for a semester. It's why I made my decision to attend."
College Senior,5,"I've personally had a great experience finding internships at SMUMN. I've had one on campus which lead to one off campus. The alumni network is small, but vibrant. If you need alumni resources, you just have to ask. The quality of career fairs is outstanding and our career services is getting better with each passing year. We have resume proofing, mock interview, phone interview rooms, and all sorts of advising services."

We have resume proofing, mock interview, phone interview rooms, and all sorts of advising services."
College Senior,5,"I personally wanted to go to a school that offered 4-yr housing. SMUMN has 90% of all students living on campus which I LOVE because it makes me feel like I'm in my own little town of SMUmen&women.

All of SMUMN's residential halls have sinks and most have private bathroom options which is pretty rare compared to other universities. I've never had to use a communal shower system at SMUMN (awesome!). 

Villiages are a popular choice for upperclassman and create an apartment style way of living which most students like and try to get once they are juniors and seniors. The nicest building is Brother Leopald and is the place of reference for students sophomore status and up."
College Junior,5,"Saint Mary's University of Minnesota is a very unique school. Small class sizes, and easy to reach professors are some of my reasons why I think it was the best fit for me."
College Sophomore,5,It is always a safe yet fun environment.
College Sophomore,5,"Just like all other campus's, if you're looking for a good time, you'll find it."
College Sophomore,5,"More diversity is needed, but is also accepted."
College Sophomore,5,It is a safe school.
College Sophomore,5,Our Wellness Center and Campus Safety department is a great support and resource for these issues and does their best to prevent them.
College Sophomore,5,I am a resident assistance so I have a view from the inside and out.
College Sophomore,5,I love it here! I have came all the way from Arizona and plan to stay despite the harsh weathers.
College Freshman,5,"I love the wellness center. St.Mary's is one of the most understanding schools about mental illness and you can see a counselor for free unlimited times. I see someone once a week since I started school and it's greatly helped. This school is also very helpful if you have academic disabilities! Everyone is so understanding, I was scared of having a bias against me but I didn't feel that at all from any one of my professors.  The only sucky thing is that the wellness center doctor isn't open on the weekend so you would have to take the bus to the urgent care down by Winona state, 10-15 min away. I had the flu one weekend and had to do this.  Also, if you're sick you have to get a note from the DR or the wellness center excusing you from class, but it's so hard to get out of bed and walk yourself to the wellness center to do this, I wish you could just email or call."
College Junior,5,Loved my housing options.  Always got what I wanted.
College Junior,5,Saint Maryâs is one of the greatest colleges. Something happens every day that solidifies my decision to attend this institution. The class sizes are great because it allows student to get more one on one attention from professors. I really feel like my professors want me to succeed and I am not just another face in a lecture hall. There is a lot of activity on campus and it is easy to be involved in all spectrums.
College Junior,5,"I love living on campus, it's quiet and easy to get work done anywhere without distractions."
College Junior,5,Living on campus is very convenient and welcoming.
College Freshman,5,Very spacious and I love the community.
College Freshman,5,A huge chunk of my tuition was covered by the school. Even if a person has trouble with the the financial aid process the the financial aid office is opened and friendly.
College Sophomore,5,Campus safety is constantly patrolling campus.  All residence buildings are locked at all times.  Crime and theft are mostly irrelevant around campus.
College Junior,5,"The workload is manageable. It is hard, but teachers do not make it so hard that it is impossible. Many students manage the workload as well as being involved in numerous other things. The most important thing is time management. If you figure that out, then the workload is easy!"
College Junior,5,"The biology - pre-physical therapy program at Saint Mary's is challenging, interesting, and fun. The staff is top notch, they know what they are doing and know how to get you prepared and on your way in four years. The facilities are a little outdated, but I believe renovation is in the near future!"
Graduate Student,4,"For having everything have to transition to an online platform, SMUMN did an amazing job at creating a supportive online environment for the students. Initially, it was overwhelming to think that everything would be online, but once you found your groove, it worked very well!"
Graduate Student,4,"Saint Mary's is a smaller school with a personal feel. The faculty and administration care about the students and their wellbeing, and they want students to be successful!"
Sophomore,4,My first year at St. Mary's was refreshing. I went from hating school and seeing it as something that I just needed to get done to loving learning again. There were a few thing that I would change in regards to basically only administration and some of their beliefs but that is as to be expected as it is a private Catholic university. My teachers genuinely cared about me and wanted to see me thrive. My classes were interesting and engaging. I made some of the greatest friends that I have ever known and feel lucky to have had such a wonderful experience.
Sophomore,4,It's an average but beautiful town with some activity. The university wants students to enjoy their experience and the professors often ask for student impute. The honors program is held in high regard among professors and administrators.
Sophomore,4,We learning online during Coronavirus. It was very difficult for the older professors to adjust and learn how to use technology. The university did give money back to the students as a refund for being unable to be on campus for the last few months. Overall it went as well as could be expected.
Freshman,4,I love the small campus and beautiful atmosphere. Everyone is friendly and including. The professors are very passionate about their jobs and are always willing to give extra help to their students.
Niche User,4,"A mighty fountain for medicine and clinical psychology to flow forth upon the world. While it may be expense, it is truly worth the cost if one has a clear sight on what they want out of their future. Tall and proud, humble and true, Saint Mary's Uni might be the one for you!"
Sophomore,4,"I love SMU! It has such an incredible community of people and I love the smaller amount of people. It makes it much easier to get to know many people and find friends as well as mentors. I love everything SMU has to offer. My only complaints would be the limited spots for classes, which makes it very hard to get into the classes you need for your major sometimes (although most professors are pretty understanding and willing to lift the class cap size), and the food on campus."
Freshman,4,"I love Saint Mary's Theatre program and I highly recommend it. The heads of the department are amazing, and the directors all wonderful to work for, and the production/technical designers are also amazing."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very small school so everyone knows everything about everyone, but professors are amazing and class sizes are small."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the theatre program immensely. I would like to see resident life to improve their organization. I would also like to see the Gen Ed program improved and planned better by the administration.
Freshman,4,"I like the small class sizes because it is easy to connect with professors and to be heard in class discussions. The downside is that because it is such a small school, there are not a lot of different options for majors."
Sophomore,4,"When I began my college search, one thing that was my top priority was finding a school that cared about their student's success, and needs. After my search, I found that Saint Mary's University of Minnesota was the school for me. The small tight-knit community allows the students and faculty to stay connected which is something that I need. One thing that was a bonus for me was that my school has a Student Success Center, which means that if you do encounter some academic troubles, you can seek help from academic advisors that can give solutions for your academic problems. 
Being around my peers, they allow me to be myself and they allow me to have fun!"
Senior,4,"I am in an online program that is overall a positive experience. My one complaint is the number of times the professor has had a dead link or other technology related issue. My expectation is the online applications are tested prior to courses starting. Especially for an online-only program, it should be seamless and run as if the students were in a classroom. It is reminiscent of an instructor who can't get av equipment going for a class and sit watching them fumble with the powerpoint slide..."
Freshman,4,"This college is very welcoming to anyone who wants to join the community. Faculty and staff are wonderful to interact with and one can be met with kindness and understanding. The student community is very kind as well and it isn't difficult to make new friends. The school also holds events where the entire school can get together and become closer. 
This school also provides ample amounts of opportunities to get financial aid and makes an effort to make sure that no one falls through the cracks. They want to make sure that every student gets an equal opportunity to get the education that they deserve and want."
Junior,4,"Saint Mary's University really cares about its students. There is always a teacher or other member of staff ready to help you. Perhaps its a small town midwestern thing, but everyone here is really nice. It's not unheard of for someone to strike up a conversation with you at lunchtime or to chat with friends you run into in the plaza. The small class sizes are both a pro and a con. Teachers know your name and are able to give you the help you need but it's also very apparent if you've missed class."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors are focused on real world learning, not just funneling students through the pipeline, unlike most programs. I received very personal interactions through my online graduate course and was able to take what I learned into real world environments."
Sophomore,4,Saint Mary's is a great school that is only lacking at the moment good apartment style forms. But the school is working on this at the moment so the problem will be gone soon. And the town of Winona is very safe and has lots to do if you love the outdoors
Graduate Student,4,The online MA in HRM program has gone very smooth for the past year. I have had no problems with any of the instructors. They are all super nice and try to help you as much as possible. The workload seems to be about right for a full-time program.
Freshman,4,"The college itself is very good, they offer a lot of options to support struggling students. The surroundings are also very beautiful and the people are nice. The only real problem is that if you are a man who isn't in a sport going to that school it will be difficult to connect with most people due to the small population that attends and the gender ratio being 1-3 men to women."
Freshman,4,"St. Mary's University of Minnesota is located in a beautiful part of Winona, Minnesota. The nature scenery is amazing, but unfortunately there aren't many places surrounding the university to walk or bike to. It is 10 minutes from downtown Winona, which is a cute little town. There are buses that transport students to and from downtown. The atmosphere is very conservative and optimistic. All of professors care about each of their students as individuals. For the most part, the students of Saint Mary's are kind and pretty social. There isn't much diversity, but it isn't too bad. The dorms are all nice and close to classes so it makes it convenient to wake up and go to class 5-10 minutes before it starts. As far as parties, there are house parties and small gatherings in the dorms. Although campus safety makes it difficult for people to throw parties, it makes for a very safe environment on campus."
Graduate Student,4,I have been going to saint Mary's for a year. It is a great school for someone on a budget but who still wants an advanced degree. Staff and faculty are all helpful to academic matters and any question students may have. The application process is fast and straightforward and one can enroll at any times as they do terms not semesters.
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus in the bluffs, small campus feel but not too small. The community is great and all of the professors are there to help at all times."
Junior,4,"Overall, a good school.  Small classes were the best part of Saint Mary's.  The staff everywhere are nice.  There are many parts of the campus that could use improvement."
College Sophomore,4,I love the professors. I like how the professors are intellectually challenging and keep you on your toes. They seem to care and always offer to help students in order for us to succeed. I am appreciative of them.
College Sophomore,4,there is a lot of support and these sort of things don't happen too often.
College Sophomore,4,"I can't complain about the living environment at SMU. The rooms are good enough to sleep in, the rooms I have gotten from last year were nice and spacious."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are excellent, and the professors are as well. The professors know your name and help you the best they can."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had little interaction with career services but from what I have heard, they are great at helping students."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is very safe, the students in attendance, to me, seem to be very harmless."
College Sophomore,4,I've had a great time at Saint Mary's so far and I'm excited to go back!
College Sophomore,4,It's easy to get connections made through the school that will help you with that career path you choose.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never not felt safe on campus, even walking alone at night."
College Sophomore,4,I really  did enjoy my first semester in the dorms.
College Sophomore,4,Sports are fun to participate in or just to watch.
College Sophomore,4,"I really like going to Saint Mary's. The staff and professors are fantastic, they really want you to learn and they love teaching and helping you out. Everyone at Saint Mary's is very welcoming and friendly which creates an environment that immediately feels like home. I wouldn't want to go anywhere other than Saint Mary's."
College Junior,4,The school has a few career fairs throughout the year and is always willing to help students search for career options that go with their degrees.
College Junior,4,The school takes great concern in the safety of the students on campus.
College Junior,4,Crime is relatively low. I feel safe walking around campus by myself at night. People often leave their rooms unlocked in the day as the buildings have good security. It's often joked about that you could leave your laptop on a table in the library for an entire day and it will still be there when you come back.
College Junior,4,"Everyone with school scholarships are required to stay on campus all four years, but no one minds because the dorms are so nice. Freshmen ones are the simplest with the fewest perks, but for the upperclassmen there are options like private or shared bathrooms, apartment style, and rooms inside of buildings with classrooms. All dorms have private sinks in each room also, which is really convenient."
College Senior,4,"I've never been nervous walking across campus, even late at night by myself. The campus is small and it is not nestled in a city, so the campus is it's own place with campus security making rounds quite frequently (not quite sure how often, probably like twice an hour or more). I'm never worried that someone will break into my room, in fact, I keep my door unlocked 90% of the time. I also am not afraid to leave my book bag in the library or in study areas because I know students will not take my stuff. It is a very trusting, safe community."
College Senior,4,"SMUMN only has music sororities and fraternities. These groups do not have 'houses' and only have groups because they put on music shows for all students which are well attended and always a blast. A typical student at SMUMN is not affected by greek life at all, so if it's something you're interested in, you really have to seek it out at SMUMN."
College Senior,4,"SMUMN can be described as a small, liberal arts, christian, private university. It's a niche school for sure. If you are looking for a school with a friendly atmosphere and a well-rounded education, this is the place for you. I think of it as kind of a 'knock-off' school to more well-known mn private institutions (e.g. St. Bens, St. Thomas), but that's because SMUMN is cheaper so in my eyes it's worth it."
College Junior,4,Campus Safety does a great job securing the campus and keep things in order.
College Junior,4,"Me being apart of the men's track and field team, I have had get success both on and off the track. I made lifelong friendships and connections with people I would not have normal connect with if it was in a different sitting."
College Senior,4,The instructors that I've had so far have been great. You just have to communicate with them.
College Junior,4,Professors are knowledgeable in their fields and greatly help a student who is seeking to find a better education.
College Junior,4,I am personally involved with the international Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Music Fraternity that offers great ways to explore the field of music and develop personality skills and traits that will help a person in whatever they choose to do in life after college.
College Sophomore,4,The student success center is very helpful in terms of career planning.
College Sophomore,4,I love the school! It's the right fit for me.
College Sophomore,4,"From what I see on the outside, I would say that it is a pleasing life."
College Sophomore,4,"As part of the Track and Field team, I would say that I am very pleased with the experience thus far."
College Senior,4,Most of the professors have been outgoing and able to accommodate the adult learners who have full time jobs.
College Senior,4,I haven't heard of any attacks on campus.
College Senior,4,The degree plan is easy to follow and allows me to plan ahead for the classes I need to take.
College Senior,4,The SGPP program is convenient for adults who have full time jobs.
College Freshman,4,"I did like my classes a lot. I got close with a lot of my teachers. They're some of the most dedicated and passionate people I've ever met. My professors were always there for me and it was impossible for me to fly ""under the radar"" even though I really really wanted to. Class sizes were fantastic. The student to faculty ratio was low, I think the largest class I took had a little over 20 kids; the smallest I took had 11.  What sucks is that you have to take so many classes that don't count towards your major and won't ever transfer, every year, it's not just ""freshmen"" classes. LCT (Lasallian core traditions) that you have to take freshman through senior year. Course loads are TOUGH. My advisor told me to take 17 credits my first semester and every professor does act like you're only taking their class and I had to withdraw out of one of my classes. My advice? Stick to 15 credits or less first semester no matter what your advisor tells you to do."
College Freshman,4,The Instructors are awesome here as they care more about your success overall. They try to help you if your falling behind. They are extremely accommodating if you would happen to have a learning disorder of any kind. The Professors are also very interactive with their teaching methods.
College Freshman,4,St. Mary's campus feels completely safe to me as it is a small school and the buildings are so close together and there are people everywhere so I do feel safe at my school.
College Freshman,4,St. Mary's University has been very surprising to me as it was in my top three schools that I wanted to go too. But It was my third choice school but after my time I have spent here I wish I had originally put it in my first choice slot. The reason for this new insight would be that Professors and Instructors of the courses you take actually try to engage and not just as a class but you as an individual. I will use my History professor as an example as he was also my seminar instructor as well. The first day of class he walked in and told us to take our desks and form a circle we did and he took a desk from one of the rows and sat down in the circle with us and unlike a lot of the other instructors I have encountered he allowed every person to make a point in and he only chimes in when he is needed to clarify a point. He explained the reason for the way he teaches was because he hated the assembly line education that school systems have been using for years. He is probably one of the best professors I have encountered so far and has made me want to learn more about history. The only Problem with St. Mary's is the location as it is only near a shopko and a Kwik Trip everything else like Walmart and Target are pretty long out of the way if you are a walking commuter like me but if you have a car you should have no problem navigating through Winona. Lastly the scenery around St. Mary's campus is absolutely breathtaking and Beautiful as a bluff lies on its boundaries and waking up every morning to see that majestic site is pretty worth it. All in all St. Mary's was definitely not my first choice but I am absolutely happy that I ended up here. I give it a 4 out of 5.
College Sophomore,2,"Since it's a small town there aren't a lot of parties and if there are, some are lame or not everyone knows about them."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do unless one is over the age of 21.
College Sophomore,2,There are only musically involved fraternities at Saint Mary's.
College Junior,2,"Most people I know, including myself were not able to get into the dorms we wanted."
College Senior,2,"My courses and teachers are great; BUT the business side of everything, such as getting help with financial aid, getting contact with and help from certain offices are terrible. They don't seem like they care about you as a student/person at all."
College Freshman,2,"I'm a city kid and I thought I would be able to handle living in such a small, small town. I was wrong. Granted, the city is BEAUTIFUL. The bluffs are gorgeous. You can go up on the scenic outlook and see the entire downtown Winona.  However, this campus is predominately white and even me being white, I felt out of place. I'm very alternative and dress from the 90's and get the ""St.Mary's stare"" all the time. Athletes, Catholics and theatre kids really thrive here and if you're a first year (freshmen/transfer) everybody seemed to make their friends in the first 2 weeks and if you didn't you're SOL because this school is very cliquey.  I loved (most) of the teachers here though. A lot of them really care to see you succeed, I just had to transfer (a large portion of freshmen transfer out actually) because I felt judged and didn't belong."
College Junior,2,"There is basically no diversity on Saint Mary's campus. There is a little bit, but not a whole lot. The people at there are extremely accepting of anyone and everyone. Even though we are Lasallian school, we are accepting of all religions and will even offer you help in finding a church which fits your domination, and find you transportation if you are in need. Now that's what I call accepting!"
College Junior,2,There is barely anything available. I haven't invested much effort to dine off-campus because the quality is not worth the time or travel.
College Junior,2,I drive myself because public transportation safety would be a concern of mine.
College Junior,2,"Within my first year attended, we have had 5 classes cancelled between Septemeber-March due to snow hazards."
College Junior,2,"To be honest, I have never even been to our cafeteria before because my classes are in the evening and I am make sure to eat beforehand."
College Junior,2,"It is located in a unsafe area of Minneapolis, MN. I absolutely love the education but do not feel comfortable in the local atmosphere."
College Junior,2,We are Minnesota Gopher fans of the U of M.
College Junior,2,The people in financial aid are horrible at helping. They are rude when you ask a question and they need to be able to understand that not every student has the ease to get financial help.
College Senior,2,The majority of the sports are at another location so there isn't much about it at the MPLS campus. 
College Senior,2,There are not a lot of options at the Mpls campus. 
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many options within walking distance besides Ground Round.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a lot of variety for food around campus, only two real dining halls and a small restaurant. The breakfasts are usually good. The lunches and dinners, however, are usually non-nutritious and bland-tasting, and don't offer many choices. It's a good idea to change your meal plan after the first semester freshman year to get access to the campus restaurant: the Cardinal Club."
College Freshman,2,"There are few restaurants close to St. Mary's.  Ground Round and Mango's Mexican Restaurants are both good options, but they are the only close ones.  For more food, you have to go downtown by Winona State."
College Freshman,2,"Because St. Mary's is in Winona, MN, Minnesota weather is notorious for being very variable.  There is a lot of snow in the winter and there is heat and humidity in the fall and spring.  The bluffs make all weather conditions beautiful, though."
Graduate Student,1,Itâs very nice place and there are professional teachers. Saint maryâs need to improve students resources and provide more tutors and offer students more scholarships
Niche User,1,There is hardly any diversity at this university. Campus Saftey is a joke and cannot help with anything but removing a parking ticket. Housing is run down with no improvements throughout the years. Very small campus. If you drive through town and blink youâll miss it.
College Senior,1,"Although the instructors are great in the classroom...the admissions, financial aid, etc etc...offices need a lot of work in reform. I've had different answers from different people on the same topic, dates have switched last minute making financial aid/scholarships almost impossible, and you basically just have to do everything yourself. I feel that the help from these offices have been minimal and incredibly disappointing."
College Freshman,1,We have two fraternity's but there's no housing for them. They're basically just clubs (coed btw) for the theatre/music majors. You have to be accepted and maintain an awesome GPA to stay in it.
College Sophomore,1,Never heard or seen anything regarding Greek Life here on campus.
College Junior,1,There was only one scholarship that I qualified for. They did not have an abundant amount of opportunities and I am afraid my debt to income ratio will be immense once I do receive my master's degree in Education.
College Junior,1,"It is a very small town so there is not a lot of options. Also, it is predominantly white so there is around 6 or 7 ethnic restaurant options."
College Senior,1,I can't afford it. I have to work to live. 
College Junior,1,There's a few resturants/fast foods within driving distance. I wouldn't recommend any of them. The neighborhood isn't the greatest.
Recent Alumnus,1,"it's absolutely awful. if you're vegetarian, talk to someone about getting off the meal plan or prepare to eat pizza and salad every day for 4 years."
Recent Alumnus,1,you lose almost all of your financial aid if you even think about moving off campus.
College Junior,1,"I had to gather all my schools grades, one of which was 1994 and that was hard to get.  Then I had to get two people to write recommendations and they forgot to get them in.  Found out my mom was dying so I had to fly home and take care of her during the admission process.  I was still accepted and started school before she passed, but it has been hard work trying to keep up with the classes and my children and fiance at the same time."
College Student,1,There are only two small scholarships available at this school for the psychology program. They give out one per year per program. I suggest looking elsewhere for scholarships.
College Student,1,"Limited in Choice â The off-campus choices around my campus are scarce. There is a park across the street and not much else but traffic, construction, and a giant hospital.I am at the graduate school which is located about 80 miles north of the main campus."
College Senior,1,"Students at Saint Mary's are discouraged from living off campus.  Financial aid is actually taken away if you do not live on campus.  There are some apartments down the street by Winona Bowl, but most of the apartments are downtown and not within walking distance."
College Sophomore,1,"SMU provides an on-campus shuttle that is lovingly referred to as the ""drunk bus"" to bring students around town during the day and some hours of the night. Otherwise, you're best bet is to bring your own car or have access to a friend's car. Taxi's are alright sometimes but tend to be pricey. Long distance travel back home is a mixed bag. The Amtrak train in town is consistently late and unreliable. Although I don't know much about Greyhound, Jefferson, or Megabus, it's safe to assume that a lot of students rarely use any of them. Most prefer to either hitch a ride from a friend back home, bring a car, or ask a friend to drive them to the airport to fly home. Bottom line, cars are your best option."
College Sophomore,1,"As the title insinuates, there basically isn't much of a nightlife in good ole' Winona unless you're 21 and can get into the bars ""downtown"". A lot of freshmen tend to either bring fake IDs from home or try other desperate means of getting into the bars because there isn't much else to do on the weekends besides drink. I can't even begin to explain how many of my friends or acquaintances have fallen prey to alcohol poisoning from partying a little to hard. Bottom line is that there is one sketchy 18+ club in town that opens roughly once a month. Otherwise, you can look forward to your freshman year consisting of going to the ""rugby house"", ""hockey house"", ""basketball house"", etc. or settling for dorm parties. Luckily, you can pay an upperclassman to buy alcohol for you and hope for a semi-decent time. On the bright side, there are a handful of campus activities, musical showcases, and theatrical productions to take in if you want to avoid alcohol altogether. If you're really bored, ride the drunk bus around town or else look forward to bringing your own car or being the ""designated driver"" for the night."
College Freshman,1,"Its a small school.  You can't expect much.  Those that do sports seem to enjoy it, but it isn't a place where you will go far in sports."
College Freshman,1,"I Have Not Had a Great Experience. So far my experience at Saint Mary's has not been a good one.  I haven't met many sociable people.  The gen ed requirements are not very transferable.  Winona, to put it bluntly, is a crappy town.  It's just like high school all over again because it's so small with so few people.  I would not choose Saint Mary's again if I had the choice."
College Freshman,1,There is a taxi service but at specific times like 2 in the morning on a Friday night it is nearly impossible to get ahold of.  The taxi costs $8 one way to get to Winona.

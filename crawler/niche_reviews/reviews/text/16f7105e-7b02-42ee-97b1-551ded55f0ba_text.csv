Graduate Student,5,Amberton University is the most ideal college any working adult can trust and depends on. The classes are scheduled to match a crash-course format.
Graduate Student,5,"Finally! A university for the working adult (with children like me). I have a wife and three kids, one with special needs. The semesters are little shorter which keeps me motivated to finish. I don't feel like I'll be attending school forever. Apparently, the university has also ensured that the syllabuses of all courses have a consistency. The low-cost tuition makes me feel like I won't be paying on student loans forever. Last, but not least, I researched the backgrounds of the professors I would be registering courses with and could not be more impressed. These are highly educated academics who are flexible, but they will not coddle you. You will be challenged. But I would rather be challenged in the classroom than in the process of paying for and attending school."
Senior,5,"I've attended Amberton for many years, just picking away at my degree and I thoroughly enjoy the professors and courses. The administration and online experience is organized and professional."
Alum,5,"The professors I have had possess doctorate degrees. Thus, it says a lot about their in-depth knowledge, and I have learned so much from each one of them. 
Of course, I studied extensively, and although I had some difficulties in some areas, I was never intimidated to ask ""dumb"" questions.  I am glad I persevered and did not quit when I was close to doing so. Lastly, the tuition is manageable (debt-free) when I earned my Master in Human Relations and Business in 2017.
Thank you...."
Graduate Student,5,"I chose Amberton University first because they had the degree I was looking for not to mention the ability to complete my Masters online at a very affordable cost. I also found the registration and transfer process very simple.  One key factor I was pleased with the capability to research professor ratings at Amberton on the classes I am needing to take. This was very beneficial in my choosing my instructor.  I was pleased that I could also access the instructor's syllabus to know what to expect in the class; which also assisted my choosing the instructor.   I had a question about the course and wished to know what the professor's response was and not only did he willingly answer my questions and eased my concern, he responded very quickly.  This is very important to students.  Since my registering, I have recommended Amberton University to several individuals."
Graduate Student,5,The return on investment is incredible - you won't be in debt for thousands for a higher education. You can accomplish a lot with Amberton University. They have online as well on campus. And all their professors earn their doctorate or phd's which have notoriety.
Senior,5,"Taking online classes at Amberton has been a good experience for me. I understand the work and the professors respond in a timely manner. The faculty in the office are helpful, as well."
Alum,5,It is relatively inexpensive compared to other Universities and maintains accredidation. Typical classrooms. I attended Lamar University for my Bachelor degree and Amberton University for my Master degree and I hope that you are doing good.

Recent Alumnus,4,"The school is located in the suburb of Garland. Garland is strategically located within minutes of downtown Dallas. Dallas is home to the Sixth Floor Museum, Dallas Zoo, Dallas World Aquarium, and Dallas Stars (pro hockey), Mavericks (profl basketball). Dallas is home to Baylor Dental and Medical Schools, and several state of the art research hospitals in the country. Dallas is part of the huge metroplex that includes cities to its west - 15 miles, Arlington - home of the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers pro sport franchises, Six Flags over Texas, Hurrican Harbor. 30 miles is the city of Fort Worth.  This huge span of metropolitan cities offers a multitude of professional sports, arts and culture, museums, theaters, and entertainment. Most of all, we have plenty of jobs available. Texas employment rate is one of the highest in the nation."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The weather in Texas is unpredictable. If the weather is bad - for instance, snow and icy (the two weather events that we typically are not accustomed to) then the school will post closings on their website, radio, and television. The school has an emergency plan for bad weather days as well as for pandemic events. When this happens, students can resume their classes online."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school is conveniently located near my primary resident; I am able to drive there. I know that the school is near two major airports - Dallas/Fort Worth International and Dallas Love Field, and that they have city bus and the DART rail system.  DART - Dallas Area Rapid Transportation."

Recent Alumnus,1,There is no Campus Dining at all because it is a small school.

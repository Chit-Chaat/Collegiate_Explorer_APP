Junior,5,The staff and students are all very friendly. The teachers really care about their students and want to help them learn.
Senior,5,"Since going to San Diego Christian College, I have been able to grow spiritually, and mentally in ways I could never image. My education has elevated along with the potential and determination I have for myself. As I continue my education at San Diego Christian College, I hope to build a more diverse community of acceptance."
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my experience with San Diego Christian College.  They have supported my efforts to apply and complete my bachelors degree.  I had a wonderful admissions advisor.  He was a very wonderful communicator.  I never had to wait very long for answers to any question.  My professor is nice.  She appreciates intuitive questions and is happy to supply answers to keep you on the right track.  I would not change anything about my experience so far.
Senior,5,They are very involved with the community and try to make big changes to help everyone out. San Diego Christian cares a lot about your education and helps you succeed in the end.
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at SDC. Everyone is very welcoming and has the same mindset as I, to grow closer to God. I used to be very shy, quiet and antisocial; but being a student here, they have helped me come out of my shell. I've discovered who I really am and have learned to be my own person. This year I've learnd that I am made in the image of God. I don't have to change myself or pretend to be someone I'm not to please others. SDC has been a huge impact in my life. I know that if I'm ever going through something, I don't have to go through it alone because there's always someone to listen and help out as best as they can. SDC is always opening doors for me. They have given me the opportunity to travel and minister in other countries. I absolutely do not regret coming here. I know that this is where God wants me to be and where I'm meant to be."
College Sophomore,5,Super safe campus. Nurses and counselors are on-call and completely accessible to students.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Class sizes are small, you can get to know professors well. Flexible class options and you never have to crash!"
Recent Alumnus,5,It is a small school and in my 4 years here we have never had a safety issue!
Recent Alumnus,5,I have a job right out of college working in Marketing. Staff and Faculty were supportive and helpful in my post-grad experience
Recent Alumnus,5,"The community is the biggest part of SDC. Also, everyone as freshman get apartments rather than small dorm rooms. It is pretty nice to have a complex of only students. The RD's and RA's are helpful and friendly"
Recent Alumnus,5,Great community. The staff and faculty care about each individual student. I am confident that I am prepared to enter the workforce and represent the ideals of SDC
College Freshman,5,"I am on my fourth online course. My first class instructor is my most memorable because of just starting school. It was an orientation and adult planning course. For most students this is probably important, but I am 55 years old and closer to the exit gate than the entry gate of life. I still found it amusing and instructor very helpful. Class size is irrelevant being online and classroom is virtually a laptop computer."
College Freshman,5,"As I am finishing up on my first semester, I have enjoyed immensely the discussions with class peers, the instructors, and graduation coaches. The professors are very helpful instructing and assignment details. I have no regrets for attending San Diego Christian. I picked the school primarily because I graduated from MCRD in 1978 and felt it would be neat to graduate again fro an institution based in San Diego, CA. I definitely have no regrets from choosing this college."
College Junior,5,I have gad the best teachers and classmates ever!
College Senior,5,"They are a small college, so they are able to be a lot more accommodating and understanding of student's individual needs."
College Senior,5,I will be getting a teaching credential. I will be able to get many teaching positions because I want to be a single subject math teacher. This is a high demand field.
College Sophomore,5,"The campus that I attend in Minnesota has no Greek life, which is fine with me. I am at college to prepare for my future and the Rivendell campus does that in an amazing way."
College Freshman,5,"My college is truly like a big family. Events and interaction are casual and social events spontaneous. Cost is high, dorms and food and Spartan, but it's the college of the future, and I love it!"
College Freshman,5,"Our school allows no drugs or alcohol, and the rules are honored."
College Freshman,5,I was apathetic about college until I discovered my college. It's unlike anything I have ever seen and it's tremendous.
College Freshman,5,My school includes and welcomes everyone so the guy-girl pressure is relieved. Everyone feels comfortable interacting.
College Freshman,5,"Professors and students discuss, debate, and analyze together. Students gather at lunch and after classes to continue study and discussions. Students are immersed in a subject since one subject is studied at a time."
College Freshman,5,"Since everyone follows the same liberal arts track, the pressure and struggles and premature decisions are eliminated."
College Freshman,5,"It's strict in ways it needs to be strict, but faculty treat students like adults. Many faculty live on campus and are part of the activities."
College Freshman,5,The common bond of the school is our Christian faith.
College Freshman,5,"This is not the focus of my school, which is great. Good clean fun, lots of study, and great friendships are the emphases."
College Freshman,5,One of the best things about my school is that everyone works on a liberal arts degree and no one is pressured to declare a major until they've experienced all disciplines.
College Freshman,5,"My college doesn't rely heavily on standardized testing. Every potential student is interviewed by one of the cofounders and decisions are based on learning record in high school, attitude, determination, commitment, and passion."
College Freshman,5,"Semesters are back to back and you can receive a bachelor's degree in 24 months. My college spends the first 7 weeks teaching critical thinking, and that method is used for the remainder of the college. Students stay with the same peers and instructors for the first 16 months., The college provides extensive career testing and helps you find an internship after graduation. Learning is hands on and includes 5 weeks in Italy as we study the arts."
College Sophomore,5,This is a very safe school!
College Sophomore,5,There is no presence of drugs and alcohol on our campus. So if you just want to commute and get your degree done this is the place to be.
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, we have one the best campuses in San Diego. It is completely new and modern! Also, the shuttle buses students from the student apartment complexes numerous times during the day and night."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, I had the best experience! They worked it out so that I received the maximum amount of money possible!"
College Junior,5,we are on contract so there is zero tolerance for that stuff
College Junior,5,"you dont have to pay for it, the only thing is if you dont get there a little early spots will get taken up."
College Freshman,5,I am onlien and I am thrilled at what I have learned in a short time.
College Freshman,5,The best support is supplied.
College Freshman,5,Beautiful with plenty to do.
College Freshman,5,There are very high morals and conduct code at this school
College Freshman,5,I have never gone to college. I have been online at SDCC for a week and I love it. It has been the best decision of my life.I am so grateful for this college.
College Freshman,5,"I had a very positive process of being accepted,as I wrote an essay and with my grades it was a win win for me."
College Freshman,5,I am in San Diego!  Perfect California weather!!
College Freshman,5,We have a gated parking lot with 24 hour guards. It is free and there are always spots.
College Freshman,5,What drug scene?? Vary rarely do students partake in drugs.
College Freshman,5,We are gated and the guard shack is right in the front parking lot.
College Freshman,5,"It is a Christian school, so religion is big. Very rarely do we have homosexuals."
College Freshman,5,"I have met a lot of wonderful people.  Classmates and teachers alike.  I have learned a lot about my major, music.  I would do it all over again."
College Freshman,5,I have learned a lot this first semester.  I am very pleased.
College Freshman,5,Security guards are on campus.  They are very friendly and they help make it a very safe environment.
College Junior,5,its like one big family and everyone is so nice. the weather is also amazing
College Junior,5,the software is all up to date and the wifi is free
College Junior,5,everything you need is on campus and transportation is rarely used because the dorms are so close to the campus
College Senior,5,"SDCC is virtually drug and alcohol free. The environment is very positive and clean. People there are so fun and great that drugs and alcohol is not necessary for a good time. Standards at this school are high, which keeps the students from making stupid decisions."
College Freshman,5,"I'm awarding an A+ for this category, but I refuse to comment on the physical aspects of the students. God made everyone equal, beautiful, and in His image.

As for their interests/social life, SDCC is like any other college in the sense that you're going to attach yourself to those who are compatible with you. I listen to a lot of indie rock and alternative music, so naturally I'm drawn to any hipster wearing skinny jeans and a flannel. However, I'm an open-minded person and I'm very sociable, which allows me to connect with the athletes and bookworms alike (and I mean that in absolute respect). The student life at SDCC is, however, unlike any other college due to the immense love and care you'll receive from anyone there."
College Freshman,5,"This is San Diego, California. We've got temperatures between 60 and 100 degrees fahrenheit year-round, and it couldn't be more beautiful. The way the palm trees and blue skies contrast each other makes getting out of bed in the morning less of a chore and more of an intriguing privilege."
College Freshman,5,"I sat in my SDSU classes and felt separated. I felt as if everyone around me not only didn't know who I was, but didn't want to know. This is not a letter to attack San Diego State University, which is a well-equipped institution in both the academic and technological realm, but this is an example of what life at San Diego Christian College is like.

On my very first day, I was nearly in tears, because I felt at home. The close-knit student body, the God-led teachers, and the beautiful campus (with the vision of the new campus just over the horizon) brought me in with open arms and made me realize that I was in the right place. I'm a man led by faith and I know God led me to SDCC for a very important reason. San Diego Christian College is a fine establishment with great opportunities for Christians young and old, as well as non-Christians with an aspiration to educate themselves in a loving community and potentially embark on a spiritual journey that will affect their life directly and greatly."
College Sophomore,5,"Sports are very popular here at SDCC. As the years go by people get more and more enthusiastic about games and supporting the teams. Some guys get really into the games, it is kind of funny to watch them. :) Overall I enjoy the sports here, since the school is moving campuses next spring they will be getting a few more sports, like softball."
College Sophomore,5,"Local weather will not affect campus experience. Weather is weather, it happens everywhere! San Diego is known to be sunny and warm all the time, this is untrue.  There are days that it rains, there are days when it feels like it is a million degrees, some nights are cold and some are warm.  Weather is weather, it will never be perfect for everyone all the time."
College Sophomore,5,"Never seen or heard of any drug on or off campus. Hence no peer pressure when it comes to drugs.  We have to sign a contract saying we will not drink as long as we are attending the school, but people who are 21 or older sometimes with family, they drink very responsibly. Never on campus though."
College Sophomore,5,"We get breakfast lunch and dinner served to us every day with the exception of Saturdays and Sundays, they do a great job at getting all types of foods. I enjoy the food they prepare for us, it could be a little healthier, but they do have healthy options. Very good."
Junior,4,I think the classes were conducted well. I have taken online classes before so it wasn't an issue for me.
Graduate Student,4,I took many classes online at this institution. The great thing about online courses is that you can work at your own pace and get ahead if needed. The professors really take the time to read each word of your essay and provide you with timely feedback. The professors are very prompt when answering their e-mails. This is a small school so take advantage of office hours and asking as many questions as necessary in order to seek help.
Sophomore,4,While this college may be small it has huge potential. The small size means its easy to a hold of professors and fixes any school-related issue. The students and faculty are friendly and are always willing to lend a helping hand.
Freshman,4,I am pleased with my college. I am impressed with the Christian and loving way I was handled from the start. They did all that they could to make my first experience the best.
Freshman,4,"Right now I give SDCC a 10/10. It is an amazing environment, great people, and great classes. The cafeteria is amazing fresh good healthy food at your fingertips. The environment is so great because you get to learn about Jesus while getting a degree."
College Junior,4,I don't know much about this but Im going to find out.
College Junior,4,"I've met some wonderful professors who have challenged and encouraged me to do great, while I've met some that don't care much. That's life."
College Junior,4,"My campus is pretty secure, there could be more security guards at night though."
College Junior,4,I loved living on campus with all my classmates.
College Junior,4,It has been one of the best experiences of my life.
College Junior,4,There are no real drug issues on campus.
College Junior,4,We haven't had any assaults on campus that I'm aware of.
College Sophomore,4,"San Diego Christian College is a unique school with a great community. Additionally, the school is 20-30 minutes from the nearest beach as well as downtown San Diego. On days with little or no classes, the beach is a great place to study or distress. If I to chose a school again I would definitely chose San Diego Christian College"
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are helpful, curriculum is good, courses are typically relevant."
College Sophomore,4,"Not for everyone, but it's a great community. They definitely emphasize connecting with people."
College Junior,4,There are a lot of homeless and unsafe people that live in the general area
College Junior,4,"Not only am I getting a great education, but this school also allows me to grow in my faith."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The support of the teams are a school-wide event. Everyone loves to go to Basketball, Volleyball, and Baseball games!"
College Sophomore,4,"The only thing really wrong with this school is how expensive it is. I love the community here, the professors and the extracurricular activities that are available."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of different kinds of places to eat around campus, everything from fast food to sit downs. There are different kinds of places such as Thai food, and Mexican Food, and Chinese food, and pizza places."
College Junior,4,"The social atmosphere is amazing. There area always people doing things and going places like the beach. People are friendly and helpful. Dorms area always being visited. Rooms are small, bathrooms are smaller. The apartments/dorms are do not have a lot of furniture. Ease of housing is easy and check in is a breeze. Cost is rather high though and the internet can be a bit spotty at times."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of different apartments that you can find around San Diego that you can share with people that makes it affordable to live. You are always close to convenient stores, and gas stations. Its not hard to get around no matter where you live"
College Freshman,4,"Wide variety, and healthy choices."
College Senior,4,Santee is pretty awful but I'd never want to live anywhere but San Diego if I had the choice.
College Senior,4,The campus neighbors a huge shopping center with plenty of places to eat.
College Senior,4,I really love it... aside from the price.
College Sophomore,4,I would say it's a pretty good location. There are a lot of stories close by that are in walking distance.
College Senior,4,"They have a lot of options, but it is more geared towards liberal majors."
College Senior,4,"I have not started there yet, but I have had great experiences so far with the administration."
College Senior,4,There are many dining options in the surrounding Santee area. They are close in driving distance. There are also lots of food options in the adjacent shopping center.
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere is great, but the weather is COLD!"
College Freshman,4,"Everyone is required to bring a laptop. The school is small, and everyone works on their own system."
College Sophomore,4,"There are so many places to eat, the variety is awesome!"
College Sophomore,4,This school gave my the atmosphere to focus on school during the week and enjoy life during the weekend. It prepares you for the real world. I have made great friends and our school spirit is very prominent but it does not take away from our focus on education but everyone here just truly wants to get their degree.
College Sophomore,4,"We have great campus facilities, outlets at every table and smart boards in every classroom. Everything is new! There is free unlimited printing at our campus, color and black and white. Also, they often times give away free catered food to students such as Chick-Fil-A, Baked Bear and local taco trucks."
College Sophomore,4,"the locals are really friendly and downtown San Diego is just 20 minutes away, there is plenty to do down there!"
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of computer access with free printing!
College Junior,4,they use a van pool and drive kids to and from the dorms and school
College Junior,4,Your teachers want to see you succeed
College Junior,4,its so small that everyone can see everything
College Junior,4,we need faster internet and more computers. printing is great!
College Student,4,"great apartments while new dorms are under construction.  have to be shuttled to campus, inconvenient"
College Student,4,"just starting , so not a good judge"
College Student,4,gated with security on campus
College Freshman,4,It is a beautiful area with friendly and helpful people.
College Freshman,4,Students go to this college from all over the world.
College Freshman,4,I attend school online and really know nothing about the sports at the school.
College Freshman,4,"We are near the beach, Sea World, the zoo and animal park.  We also have a pro football team and baseball team.  Lots of shopping.  Plenty of things to do in the area."
College Freshman,4,"I am a liberal studies major - I get all the classes I need, workload is fine, we have a brand new campus so facilities are state of the art"
College Freshman,4,it wasn't difficult at all.  Students are able to get into any program.
College Freshman,4,"Sports are a big part but right now we just moved to a new campus and the athletic facilities are not finished, so athletes must travel for practice and games.  Just an inconvenience right now."
College Freshman,4,Great student to teacher ratio/ lots of support.
College Freshman,4,"There are strict guidelines that we all have to follow, but the support of everyone on campus is great.  Our professors want us to succeed.  Anyone attending a private, Christian college should expect rules and guidelines.  So no one here is surprised or bothered.  We are here because this is the college experience we wanted or needed."
College Freshman,4,We do events with student life and buses or car pooling is always available.
College Freshman,4,I love not have open halls 24/7. I enjoy the rules and regulations. You have to be the best of the best to come here.
College Freshman,4,We have excellent teams with students from around the world on our teams!
College Freshman,4,We have 2 chapels every week and they are a great place for fellowship.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are very intelligent and have a lot to teach on
College Freshman,4,"We have labs, but everyone has their own computers and the labs are always empty"
College Freshman,4,"The girls can be mean sometimes, but overall, it is a nice environment and very friendly"
College Junior,2,Teachers do not seem to care and academics are hard to tell if they mean anything on campus.
College Junior,2,School is very same and friendly but not much is left to privacy at all. The teachers don't seem to cage much some do but for the most part they are as disheartened as the students are.
College Junior,2,You couldn't get a hold of anyone the week before school started and most of the communication happened over emails. Lots of the time things got lost in and you spent several meetings trying to sort through grants and finical help.
College Freshman,2,Largely the athletes can get away with anything they wish. The school desires to be an athletic highlight and so are unwilling to do anything that can harm it's teams.
College Freshman,2,Those who run the financial aid department or often lazy and slow to respond. You must hound them to get any results.
College Freshman,2,"We are not actually on Campus. Instead we are living in an apartment complex around half a mile away from the college. The apartment complex itself is not bad. However, the internet is hardly adequate and there are no additional commodities. Worst of all we often have to wait half an hour to take a shuttle to the campus for classes."
College Senior,2,This school accepts the students that no other schools will. The class registration process is painful.
College Senior,2,"People are pretty judgmental towards other students, and disrespectful to faculty."
College Freshman,2,My college is about more than physical comforts. It's Spartan but it's the best school ever!
College Student,2,this is a new facility and parking is still under construction. should e ok when finished
College Senior,2,there just is not any near campus and it is supper expensive
College Senior,2,"The school itself is old. A lot of the campus is shared by the high school that is there. The dorms are not very nice, they have a lot of work to be done. The dorm bathrooms are pretty disgusting."
College Senior,2,The college is located in a lower income area. The only perk is that it is located in beautiful San Diego California and you are only a few minutes from the beaches and downtown.
College Freshman,2,"This is the only problem I have run into at SDCC. While it is affordable in comparison to most private colleges in the nation, it is still more than I can handle. At five-figures per semester, it is very difficult to keep up as a student without any college assistance from his parents or extended family. I hope I am able to return for the coming years."
College Freshman,2,"Living in the dorms is a good and bad things, because the school is so small the dorms are close to classes, unless you live in north or south. However the freshman girl's dorms are filled with obnoxious girls who have low hygeine standards. These buildings are older so they are not the greatest."
College Freshman,2,"there really isnt much of a night life due to it being a christian college, many of the things most college students go to are against the college's contract. however the beach is not far and bon fires are pretty popular"
College Junior,2,"Being on the Minnesota campus the days can be either really nice and enjoyable or really cold. In the summer, fall, and spring thins seem to be really nice and warm it's easy just to go outside and do homework. The winters get really nippy at times though and definitely icy on occasion."
College Junior,2,They food is not that good for the price I'm paying
College Junior,2,"711- quick midnight snacks
mcdonals-no comment
valerio's mexican food-cheat prises for a filling meal"
College Freshman,2,Too Many Guys (Great If Your A Girl) – After Miss California attended SDCC. Heaps of guys began to take interest in SDCC. Throwing off the 3-1 ratio and making it a husbands r'us for women at SDCC.
College Senior,1,"Racial diversity is encouraged, but political/religious/sexual diversity is not allowed and the prices make economic diversity impossible."
College Senior,1,The registration process is insufferable and the classes have a painfully low standard.
College Senior,1,"The faculty and staff are negligent, incompetent, and not concerned with academic development. I have filed multiple formal complaints with the registrar and financial aid offices."
College Senior,1,"The professors, with one or two exceptions, couldn't care less about their academic standard. They openly allow students to cheat, don't make any effort to challenge students, and grade very unfairly. The class variety is minimal and many classes are only offered once per year, not several times per semester like any other school."
College Senior,1,"If a potential employer valued a degree from this school, I would have no interest in working for them."
College Senior,1,"There is occasionally a nurse in the health center but she is unreliable and unable to provide any real medical assistance. I required stitches once and she was away from her office so I drove myself to the hospital and my school health insurance refused to cover it because I did not get a referral from the nurse.

As sex is forbidden on campus, there are no measures in place to prevent or address sexual assault, nor is there any birth control or std testing/treatment available. I'm certain just having a condom in your backpack could be enough to get you expelled."
College Senior,1,"The administration tells students what they are allowed to do both on and off campus, far beyond the standards set by law. Violating any of these rules can result in immediate expulsion. I have heard that fake student facebook pages are used to monitor students, but I do not have a facebook so I can't verify that."
College Senior,1,"The student handbook requires that all students (regardless of age) don't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, go out dancing, or even allow the opposite gender into their dorm rooms unless it is a pre-arranged ""open halls"" event."
College Senior,1,I do not know of any Greek life at SDCC.
College Junior,1,it's like a high school
College Junior,1,we dont have greek life here
College Junior,1,"Workers in the financial aid offices, are rude and will not go the extra step to help students in need."
College Sophomore,1,we have no option for public transportation and there isn't a bus stop close to the school.
College Sophomore,1,"this school is very strict about hold each and every student to properly live a ""christian life."" They judge you on everything you do and if you are caught drinking or using drugs they will punish you with writting an essay about why drinking is not right. your second offense you are fined $$$ for not representing the school in an appropriate behavior. they don't even life if you go anywhere that sells alcohol or displays inappropriate behavior.Then your third offense it starts monthly drug test, and breathlizer test. and there is a curfew for students who live on campus (1 oclock) and if you are not back on campus and your name is written down with security and then you are set up with a meeting with a student life superviser to explaining why you came in after curfew. and to live off campus you have to be 21. i feel that a lot of the students here are afraid to be themself because of the fear of being judge"
College Junior,1,"On the Minnesota campus we don't have any sort of sports teams, any and all athletics are directed by the students. There are a variety of sports we play: soccer, football, basketball, ultimate frisbee, etc. but nothing is official through the college."
College Freshman,1,"Obviously, being a Christian school, I should not expect it to be accepting toward gays, lesbians or transgenders. I am a lesbian, and nobody at my school knows for fear of expulsion. But I signed a contract stating that I wouldn't ""perform any homosexual acts."" Besides that, the students are only somewhat welcoming. The teachers are too opinionated about Christianity, and I think that they feel that because this is a Christian college, all the students agree with them."
College Sophomore,1,"Since the school is located in a rural/suburban area there is no local nightlife. In order to go out, one would have to go to San Diego. The college does not promote parties, bars, or clubs because of its Christian views. However, the school has several fun student functions like going to the Padres baseball games."
College Sophomore,1,"El Cajon is about 15 minutes from Downtown San Diego, so transportation is needed to go into the city. All students rely on their cars to go places which can be costly with the expense of gas. College transportation would be a good thing to incorporate at the the school because El Cajon is not the best place to walk around. It is a rural, suburban area."
College Freshman,1,"All Show – Campus strictness is all show and no action. As long as everything is kept on the ""down-low"" in the main hallways, cafeteria, and chapel... feel free to swear up a storm, hop the fence afer curfew, drink in your room, or bang some chick. "
College Freshman,1,"Health insurance is not all they claim it to be. And the school's response to an injured student is sub-par.

After a fatal accident, $90k medical debt, and overseas family... SDCC really dropped the ball. "

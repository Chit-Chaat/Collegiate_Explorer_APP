Senior,5,"I love how LVC is a small, close knit campus. All the professors get to know their students and are there to help whenever we need."
Senior,5,"When we went online during COVID-19, my professors were very accommodating and understanding. They made the online experience just like it would be in the classroom."
Niche User,5,I really loved LVC. It felt like a home to me. Even though I left after my first semester for personal reasons. Everyone is so friendly and accepting. I was an Audio Music Production major and I joined the LGBT club and Disney club. Campus is small easy walk to get to places. A lot of restaurants and places to go in Annville. Dorms were very lovely and food was excellent. They have a big foreign student program. My roommate was from Ireland.
Freshman,5,A beautiful campus with wonderful people. Everything is so close and personal. The small size is also plus.
Niche User,5,LVC has an amazing campus. Every bullring is close to one another so you feel very safe. The town of Annville  has a lot of things to go around the area such as movie theater and restaurants.
Freshman,5,I love Lebanon Valley College! Everyone here on campus is fantastic and their main goal is to help you succeed.
Junior,5,"It's a small college so everyone knows everyone. You also can't get lost. The staff wants to see you succeed. The college has a variety of resource centers to help you weather it be in writing, resumes, preparing for an interview, etc."
Sophomore,5,Lebanon Valley College has a very close community and there are a lot of resources to help students succeed.
Alum,5,Going to a small school is awesome.  You know everyone on campus.  Lots of opportunities to get involved.  I wish I had studied abroad!
Niche User,5,"Lebanon Valley for me was a beautiful place to be. Located in Pennsylvania, it was near Philadelphia making it easy to commute to a major city. The professors and campus were very good and helpful. The food could be a little better, however, it was not so bad that you would need to buy your own food. If you like history, than Lebanon Valley is for you."
Niche User,5,"Lebanon Valley College is a gem nestled in a small Pennsylvania town with a of of history and character.  Upon my visits to the College, I found that the whole staff is very welcoming and smiling.  Although they are eager to talk about the success of the graduated students, they spent a tremendous amount of time discussing the success of the current students.  The faculty knows every students name and genuinely cares about their academic achievements.  Everyone is engaged academically and culturally.  I do not have one opinion of anything I would like to see changed."
Freshman,5,With an 11:1 student to teacher ratio it is super easy to reach out to professors to get help! There are courses that help you with your first year transition into college and also peer mentors to help you along the way. This is a great school I would recommend to anyone looking for a smaller college with great academics!
Alum,5,"Lebanon Valley College is a great school and great graduates.        Many of the graduates have what I call the LVC Edge in life and employment.       I believe the school embraces creative thinking and level of personal confidence in the graduates.          As a graduate in the mid 1970's I have returned to Annville to live in order to enjoy the amenities of the college.          There are hundreds of different cultural, music, art and sports events within walking distance."
Niche User,5,"Students and advisers alike are all very friendly, and since it's a private, small campus, classes are small and you get to know the professor personally"
Alum,5,While still of good quality .....the college was outstanding through the 80's.   Campus is spectacular.  Class size is small.  Professors have a deep understanding of students.
Sophomore,5,"I think that Lebanon Valley College while it is a small college is very connected to the communities that surrounds it's campus. What is also nice is that the teachers are very nice and really want the students to succeed, and they will make time to meet with the students one on one."
Alum,5,"Lebanon Valley College is in a beautiful setting. The buildings are gorgeous, and the facilities are phenomenal. The educators are intelligent and tough, but kind and approachable. The atmosphere of the college is small, which allows for many long-lasting friendships."
Freshman,5,"Deciding to go to Lebanon Valley College is one of the best decisions that I have ever made. The faculty and staff of the college are phenomenal and desire the success for students just as much as the students desire success. Dorms are typical of most colleges, and Residential Life does an amazing job of finding RA's and other personnel to make the transition and life at college easier. The dining hall has decent food, but more often than not, the food is mediocre. I would recommend having food in your dorm in case there is a day that the dining hall isn't serving something good."
Freshman,5,"I love how small the campus is, and that you get to feel more like a community with your classmates. With the bigger schools you get lost, but here at LVC you fit right in and the professors know you name and actually care about you."
Niche User,5,I am transferring to this College so I do not have experience yet but so far everyone is friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at college, class of 2021 and I can say that I am really enjoying my time here. I made friends veg quickly and I feel very connected to the College on a personal level. The professors are all nice so far and it seems to be going very well. I love it here and I hope others decide to come as well"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love it here as I have already spent a whole month on campus before my freshman year. great sense of community and everyone cares for each other. The programs are awesome too.
Junior,5,"This school has opened my eyes to so many opportunities that i would have never gotten to take at other institutions. Not only am i able to be a contributing memeber to my team, i am also able to be involved on my small campus with various leadership roles and clubs."
Freshman,5,"So far, in my first yeah at LVC, everyone has been very welcoming. It's nice to have such a small campus and have familiar faces everywhere you go. Although it's small, the amount of clubs and organizations are huge, it's a very family like community and a wonderful place to be."
Niche User,5,"When I visited Lebanon Valley I fell in love with the campus, the Peace Garden is my favorite place ever! The way they lay out courses is really nice too, and since they are a private college they are on the smaller end, which is perfect for me. "
College Sophomore,5,"As a physical therapy student, my job prospects are great because of the schools reputation and the field growing in general."
College Sophomore,5,I have no qualms saying I feel safe on and around campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my college, it's the perfect fit for me and I couldn't be happier there."
College Student,5,The campus is extremely safe. There are blue light emergency lights on campus and public safety is always going around making sure everything is safe.
College Student,5,LVC offers numerous classes and the professors are great. The class sizes are small and you really get to know the professors
College Student,5,"There are numerous career services at LVC. In fact, every week we get an email from them with different oppotunities."
College Student,5,"Living on campus is great. The buildings are all close to together so nothing is a far walk away. Also, the bathrooms are kept very clean and the cost is not crazy expensive. There are also many options to choose from."
College Student,5,The facilities are phenomenal. They are always kept in pristine condition and everyone comes out to support the teams.
College Student,5,"I absolutely love my college! I am in the six year PT program at LVC and I am so glad I am studying here and know my six years will be fabulous. The classes and professors are great, the staff are amazing, and the students are friendly. I do not have one bad thing to say."
College Freshman,5,"LVC is very safe and I have not heard of one bad thing happening on campus such I have been there,  I never have any worries about my safety."
College Freshman,5,"Just about everyone here is accepting of everything about a person, whether it be race, sexuality or even political beliefs. LVC is definitely welcoming to anyone and makes you feel like a part of the Dutchmen family."
College Freshman,5,"Public safety is very strict on the use of drugs, so if a student is caught using drugs there will definitely be consequences. There is little drug activity on campus so a person who does not want to go to a school where there are a lot of drugs does not have to worry about that here."
College Sophomore,5,I and everyone I know feel very safe on campus.  There are campus security and we feel safe all the time.
College Sophomore,5,"I am very satisfied with the quality and class size. It is small and the professors know and care about each and every student,"
College Sophomore,5,I am just learning about all the opportunities available to students.  There are a lot of job/.internships available from alumni and are a big part of the school in many aspects from jobs to scholarships and job recuitment.
College Sophomore,5,The community and alumni are a BIG PART OF THE sports at this school.  Fan support and family participation is very active.  When I was in a small catholic school family was a big and only  supporter and I was very impressed to see how family and past alumni be such an active part of college sports.
College Sophomore,5,The school I attend is very academically challenging but I am very comfortable here.  The students and Faculty are very friendly and it feels like I am a great fit here.
College Freshman,5,"I feel like I can walk alone at 2 a.m. by myself without having to worry about my safety because I know the public safety office is doing their best to make the campus safe, and they are doing an amazing job at that."
College Freshman,5,"I'm not part of a sorority, but I want to join Gamma Sigma Sigma, they are very welcoming and are unbiased against anything about you. Before I even came to this school, the girls here were very welcoming and warmhearted, like I was already a part of the Gamma Sigma Sigma family."
College Freshman,5,I've never felt safer and more welcomed than I have been here. I have more of a social life here than I did in high school and I strongly appreciate that.
College Freshman,5,Its known for being one of the safest campuses across the nation. It is very safe and I never feel uncomfortable walking around at night.
College Junior,5,Our school loves athletics so much you'd thing we were division 1
College Junior,5,"Overall, I love everything the moment I was there. Everyone was nice and helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at school has been absolutely fantastic. The friends I have made, the classes I have taken, and the professors I have had have all been wonderful. If I could redo the college search process, I would choose my school every single time. Throughout my short time here, I have grown mentally, physically, and emotionally into the person that I want to be. I cannot wait to see what experiences lie ahead of me."
College Junior,5,"LVC overall is a fantastic school. Almost everyone is friendly and there is a strong sense of community on Campus. The education is high quality and the class are challenging, engaging, and help learn technics usable for the real world."
College Junior,5,Almost everyone at LVC is receiving some form of academic or merit-based scholarship(s). It also helps if you are offered the opportunity to interview for your scholarship because you could end up receiving more aid.
College Junior,5,"Sometimes the safety report includes things like ""Resident in Funkouser burnt toaster pastry."" No, seriously. I don't think there is a college campus as safe as LVC."
College Junior,5,"Generally, it is easy to be accepted into a particular major (with the exception of Physical Therapy & related majors that have a different selection process...). I think the biggest challenge for me was figuring out what I wanted to do. Once I decided, it became very easy and many people are happy to help you if you are having an issue with your major. The best advice I could give if you're having trouble in your major or you think you might want to change majors would be to talk to your advisors and professors. They are the best resource you can have on campus, and most of them are happy to help if you ask!"
College Junior,5,"The local area is beautiful! You will find lots of trees, flowers, and beautiful gardens in the area."
College Freshman,5,"Fan support is the greatest. Students are encouraged to participate in athletic events or teams. I'm convinced that our swim team is the best in the country, not because we win all the time, but because we get along so well and we have the most amazing coach in the whole world. Before college, I had never swam on a team or even taken a swim lesson, but my coach was proud to have me on the team and transformed me into a fantastic swimmer. I highly recommend the swim team!!"
College Freshman,5,"I had no difficulty getting into my program. My major isn't one that the college offers, so the Biology department allowed me to create my own major, which was wonderful. Academics, leadership, and community service are the most important criteria for admission. The best decision I made throughout my admission process was meeting with and admissions counselor for a personal interview. This allowed me to explain certain things about myself, my application, and my high school transcript. An interview is an absolute must!"
College Freshman,5,I feel like I am getting the best education possible.
College Sophomore,5,Campus life is wonderful! The majority of the buildings are very new and the upkeep is very good!  The housing process can be a bit confusing sometimes but for the most part is fair.  Social life is very welcoming and friendly and there are plenty of places that are welcoming to hanging out.
College Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere is perfect for those who enjoy a mixture of rural and urban.  Within 5 minutes of the campus you can be shopping or visiting attractions in Hershey. However you can also drive the other way and view beautiful scenery.  The campus itself has beautiful land, is very safe, and a wonderful family like atmosphere!"
College Student,5,"The freshman parking lot is about a half mile away from my dorm and I feel completely safe walking there by myself, even at night. We have emergency phones all over the path and all around campus so if something were to happen, I would be able to get help quickly. "
Sophomore,4,"I liked Lebanon Valley College because they have great professors and curriculum. Whenever you need help, the professors are right there to answer your questions. There are also a lot of other resources to help you if you are not quite understanding something. They have study pods and tutors for courses that can be a little harder. Another aspect that is great about Lebanon Valley College is their Breen Center. They help you to prepare your resume and even practice mock interviews so that you're ready for the real world. One thing that they could work on is making classes work better for commuter students. Sometimes the requirements they have for certain classes conflict with times that would be decent for commuter students. Commuter students do not want to have to take a night class and a morning class on the same day."
Sophomore,4,"Lebanon Valley College is a great institution to further your education. While academics are challenging they are also rewarding. As a smaller private college, you are able to develop relationships with professors and with other students within your field."
Freshman,4,"This campus is so nice (visit in the spring). Everyone is so friendly and inviting. I have met so many friends so far (S/O hannah <3) Academics are kinda hard. You will def be stressed 4/7 days of the week. Parties suck so if you want to be be geekin' out everyday this is not the place for you. Food is bad, but the pizza is rockin'. I encourage everyone to apply. I love LVC and the scary dutchman mascot."
Junior,4,"Lebanon Valley College is an upstanding academic institution. The 11-1 student to faculty ratio allows students to have personal connections with their professors that you can't get at bigger schools. It is located in Annville, PA, which is a very small and quiet town. Having a car on campus is a must, so you can venture to Harrisburg and Hershey."
Freshman,4,"I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could. Really enjoying my time here so far! The department I'm in, while small, is great and I feel like they will be able to set me up for success. It feels like the school actually does care about me as a student and an athlete. The campus is beautiful but FINISH THE BRIDGE.

Overall enjoying my time here so far!"
Freshman,4,"Lebanon Valley College is a great small school of a little over 2,000 undergraduate students on campus during the semester. There is plenty of opportunities for campus engagement, a lot of free activities to do on the weekends, and all of the professors are the best. Everything here goes above and beyond the typical college experience."
Alum,4,"Decent variety of classes to take, strong in most majors (would not consider any to be bad majors), professors and staff are very kind and resourceful."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at LVC has been extremely positive and worthwhile. I feel that I have grown so much since beginning my higher education there in August 2018. I credit this growth entirely to the environment that LVC has put me in, both academically and socially. I have been been surrounded by some of the best professors in the country who truly care about the success of their students. The few changes that I would make includes more diverse classes to choose from and improvements made to the food and on-campus housing. With these changes, LVC can be the top college in America."
Junior,4,All the classes that I need are located here.  The campus life is good and have made many great friends and am still in contact with many that have already graduated.
Freshman,4,"The price tag is a bit startling, but if you truly want to go here, do not let it scare you away from attending. LVC offers great scholarships and financial aid. In the end, It cost the same amount for me to attend LVC as it would have if I had chose to attend a state school. Also the price is worth it! Just from visiting, I could tell that the environment of the school was much better than other colleges that I had visited. Many of the professors are absolutely amazing! They really care about getting to know you and helping you academically and personally, which can be rare at other schools."
Senior,4,"My four years at Lebanon Valley College were hard, but well worth the grind. I made connections with several companies during my stay at LVC, one of which I'm currently interning with, which is Members 1st Federal Credit Union. I met many new people I hadn't known in high school, and I would say that many of these people will now be life-long friends of mine. Lastly, the professor care to take one-on-one time and ensure everyone's success. LVC was simply fantastic."
Junior,4,"I have always felt welcomed at this school through clubs, organization, and faculty. People are always willing to help you find your way if you are a freshman and lost on your first day. I have not been discriminated against because I am Hispanic nor because I am a woman and I consider myself priviledged to be able to attend such a fine facility."
Freshman,4,This college has a great academic program with great professors.  The campus is beautiful and is always taken care of.  The food on campus is very good and is better than most other campuses.
Sophomore,4,Lebanon Vally College is a great school. I feel welcome every day and feel that the professors really care and want me to succeed. I don't feel like just a number at this school.
Sophomore,4,Great school with wonderful professors. They really do care about their students and work on their behalf. The science research opportunities are outstanding. Placement in your field of study is way above normal.  I can't say enough good things about the science staff and how they really care.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the faculty and staff at this college, but the administration advertises itself as open-minded and student-oriented when in reality the situation is very much switched."
Freshman,4,"Currently, I am a freshman at Lebanon Valley College. There is a strong Physical Therapy Program here and many Biology Majors. The math program is also very strong. The campus is small but growing. Lebanon Valley College is a predominately white campus, although there is a strong support system for diverse students. Not all dorms have an air conditioning unit. Public Safety constantly picks up any fallen tree branches, shovels snow, and checks buildings to keep the campus safe. Annville is a small quiet town and the elderly are not afraid to call the police if the parties get too rowdy.  The campus food is not the best, but there is always a salad bar and deli. Turkey Hill also supplies the ice cream. Overall, Student Life is wonderful because of the small campus atmosphere, residential life, and strong support systems."
Alum,4,It is a small school but has a beautiful campus and is in a good area. School is pretty difficult because the faculty really prepares you for the real world.
Freshman,4,I like the small college atmosphere for education because it is easy to get one-on-one help from professors and be able to get a better understanding of what I am being taught. This college offers many services to help students excel in classes and get help with building a resume and preparing for a career path. I am only a freshman but am already pleased with my experience at LVC and look forward to the years ahead and look forward to getting help with internships and career options.
Freshman,4,"I love LVC. I love the campus, the people, the classes, everything about it.  It's not a party school or anything, but I wasn't looking for a party school.  There are a lot of opportunities for me to learn in and out of class."
College Sophomore,4,The courses are fine and will get more interesting as time goes on.  The professors are nice and care about the students overall.  I like the school a lot and I am glad i chose it.
College Sophomore,4,I don't mind it.  I wish there were more options and that the housing with kitchens did not require a meal plan.
College Sophomore,4,The athletic training department is great. They really work closely with the athletes.  The facilities are immaculate for such a small school and a large majority of the school participates in some form of a sport.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the school, it definitely has some thing I would change course requirement wise, but there is never going to be a perfect school.  I really like the school in general.  Its very nice and welcoming and I didn't feel very out of place when I was a freshman."
College Sophomore,4,"The lottery system is stressful, but you can usually get the housing option you're aiming for. There aren't tons of different options, but the options that they have are really nice."
College Sophomore,4,"For a division 3 school, we enjoy our athletics programs and the student support is awesome!"
College Freshman,4,"If you want to go to a party, everyone is welcoming of letting people go to the party."
College Freshman,4,"The school is very on top of every individual getting their best education. At LVC, the professors do one-on-ones rather than labeling you as a number, which is very convenient for whenever you feel the need to get help with a certain subject."
College Freshman,4,"My experience at LVC has been great and I would not change anything about it.  The professors are above average, the course selection is diverse, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Class size is small which is nice for me and there is a good mix of class styles."
College Freshman,4,"While I have no personal stories to tell about sports on campus, the school and students promote a great athletic environment that is a big deal on campus, but in a good way."
College Freshman,4,My overall experiance has been a great time! I know that I have picked the right school for me and if I had to do the application process I would pick LVC all over again.  Everyone from the staff to the other students are very nice and super polite.
College Senior,4,"Campus is safe. I feel very comfortable walking from library to dorm late at night by myself. If I feel uncomfortable, then easy access to get someone to walk with me."
College Senior,4,"The facilities, student involvement, fan support are all great."
College Freshman,4,"Public safety is always there for you no matter what, and will work with you through whatever you need."
College Freshman,4,Before accepting my acceptance to LVC I talked to my principal since I want to be an educator and he said that LVC is a school that produces quality students.
College Freshman,4,"I got lucky and had a triple room.  My housekeeper is also very caring about the people on the floor, as well as getting her job done properly."
College Freshman,4,"I would choose my school again.  The food can be a bit rough sometimes but the school truly is a family atmosphere.  From the friends you make, to the faculty, to the students you've never met."
College Sophomore,4,The campus and dorms are very updated and close to classes and dining hall. The only draw back is they are updating the air conditioning and some halls do not have air in the dorm rooms and are very very hot but that is just a small disadvantage.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are very hands on and enjoy seeing everyone in their class succeed.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the fact that some of my friends live right down the hall from me so I don't have to worry about trying to find a time to hang out with them because I can just walk not even twenty steps to see what my friends are doing. We even have 'Girls Night' where I sometimes join in if I'm not working. My RA Taylor is very friendly and makes sure that we are all doing fine and not wanting to pull our hair out.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not very much of a sports person, but from what I understand the sports here are very competitive and very well played."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing is very nice, not all dorms have air conditioning but it it not a big issue."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Mary Green Hall. There is no AC in there since it is cheap freshman living so it sometimes gets very hot, but my dorm room is a good size and a nice place to live. The lounge has a pool table and a nice tv, so a lot of people hang there."
College Freshman,4,"I believe over 2/3 of the school partakes in varsity sports, myself included. It is an awesome experience being on a collegiate team, and the kids I definitely hang out the most with are my teammates. Hockey, basketball, and soccer games are super fun to watch."
College Freshman,4,The health services are great. Very helpful and very nice people.
College Freshman,4,It's great! It's a nice building and all the girls in my hallway are really nice.
College Freshman,4,It's a really good school. The campus is beautiful and all the people are so nice.
College Junior,4,Traditional is meh but upper level is great
College Junior,4,"Everything is pretty good. Teachers are great, classes are interesting, etc."
College Junior,4,Everything is pretty good I guesss
College Sophomore,4,"I feel generally safe when on campus, I have never heard of any extreme incidents around campus. That being said, I sometimes feel that the reason that the campus feels so safe is because crime is nearly non-existent in this area. I'm not sure how safe I would feel if anything bad were ever to happen."
College Sophomore,4,I feel that a degree from this college will look better than a degree from most colleges.
College Sophomore,4,"Most classes are easy to get into and most professors are good at their job and care about their students learning. However, there are some professors (usually older) who are very difficult to follow and do not communicate their material effectively. Also, I feel that there are not enough science (particularly biology) courses that are practical or enough seats in the courses that are offered. Too often, pre-med students are forced into taking a plant class just to fulfill their major requirements."
College Sophomore,4,"The students, staff, and faculty are all very friendly. Many courses are more challenging than I imagine they would be at other schools, but I feel that I will be more prepared for life after college."
College Freshman,4,I love how friendly everyone is here. People will go out of their way to make you feel welcome and like you are a part of the campus. The facilities are great and the classes are challenging but manageable.
College Sophomore,4,"No matter what, you get a scholarship based of HS"
College Junior,4,"As an athlete for the school, I think that the facilities are good. The only problem is really when multiple sports have to share the indoor track/courts for the first few months of the spring semester. Other than that, the facilities are easily accessible and the fan support is great. We are lucky to have such a great fan base from parents, friends, alumni, and the local community."
College Senior,4,It's fun but public safety usually has it out for you and any fun
College Senior,4,It's a cute town and the people are really nice gives a great feel
College Senior,4,I think it's a pretty safe school I haven't heard of too much crime or violence there I feel safe like I'm at home
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't enough room for everyone to live in housing style of their choice. Most other colleges do not charge their students more money to live in a better dorm, suite,(on-campus) apartment, or (on-campus) house. Some of the standard dorms are much to small to have adequate living space and students aren't allowed to live off campus without very strict approval-which is just unfair."
College Freshman,2,the vegetables served are bland and the food is sometimes very bland
College Freshman,2,"The liberalism of this campus is the thing I dislike the most. Here, Christians are the minority, and our beliefs are pretty much covered up by all the liberalism."
College Freshman,2,It's bad only because it's probably the most difficult major at the school.
College Freshman,2,yes I most definitely would not choose biology again if I had a do over. this program killed my gpa.  I had the career goal of being a physical therapist. I now want to be a special education teacher. I think my new program will be better for me than biology.
College Freshman,2,"my major is biology. I was miserable, being a science major is no joke you really need to want to be a science major. even wanting it doesn't help you succeed. the curriculum is made more difficult than it needs to be in order to weed out the freshman that do not want to be there."
College Senior,2,Most days you have to settle for a sandwich
College Senior,2,"We are not a very diverse population, however we have become much more accepting over the past few years."
College Freshman,2,"Annville, the town LVC is located in, is tiny and remote. It is charming, but there isn't much to do at all. They have a tiny movie theater, a bar, and some small shops, but not much else. However, Hershey Amusement Park is only a fifteen minute drive from campus."
College Junior,2,There are not many options.  The options are hard to get to since there is not really a lot of transportation options.  Hardly any options in walking distance.
College Junior,2,The area is kind of boring.  There is not much to do and not many ways to get around.
College Sophomore,2,"Lebanon Valley College is an excellent choice, but to be honest it costs way too much. "
College Sophomore,2,There is a great mix of local restaurants along with chain restaurants. Pricing is average. 
College Senior,2,"LVC is lacking when it comes to off-campus dining the only places with in walking distance are the subway, two pizzas/sub shops, and a coffee shop. I guess that just comes with going to a small school but at the same time Hershey and Harrisburg aren't that far away and most students have cars on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"While LVC is trying to make a conscious effort to promote more diversity programs and events on campus, the fact remains that the school is greatly a ""white bread"" campus--that goes as far as a majority of the students and professors. There are a great number of students and faculty who have recently become more involved and the minority/diversity voice has become louder on campus, but the attitudes and recent actions of a select number of students have put a bad light on LVC in this aspect in the last year."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking for Freshmen at LVC is horrendous. It is at least a ten-minute walk! For those students that are required to leave campus one or two times a week for observations or things of that sort, it is ridiculous that they have to plan a lot of their schedule around walking to their cars! The parking for sophomores, juniors, and seniors is a little bit better. It is about a five minute walk. But the bad part about their parking lot is there are barely enough spots! It takes forever to find an available spot. Commuters have it made being able to park right behind the dorms, close to campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking fees are $25 per academic year. It is a hassle if you are a commuter to park. You either get lucky with the close spot, or you have the worst parking spot. Freshmen have to park about a mile away from the campus. It is first come, first serve as to whether you get a good parking spot or not. Commuters get the best selection for parking."
College Senior,2,"As a visitor, its definitely a fight to get a proper parking spot and public safety is on the patrol constantly."
College Junior,2,"LVC Is Trying – With a diversity club as well as many diversity scholarships, LVC is trying really hard to become diverse, but the area just isn't diverse enough to attract people of diffferent races.  There is also a LGBT club and and a feminist group on campus, as well as organizations for liberal and conservative politics."
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks Aren't Exteamly Present – HOusing for Greek life is very limited on Campus. In fact, there is only one Greek house on the campus itself and others are in the area surronding the school. If you like to party join Greek life, if not than it may not be for you. Other students dont really view Greeks differently than any other person on campus."
Sophomore,1,"Before I start, you will see each other reviewers telling you to ignore the naysayers and I must advise you to thoroughly research this school. The price is almost ivy league yet there is no prestige in this school outside of the Central PA area, this place is run like a business which their main priority is making their end dollar. With that being said the entry level science courses here are far more challenging then they are supposed to be and the tutors and study pods they offer do not help so most students, especially PT, resort to cheating so they can stay in the program. However if you don't want to compromise your moral integrity be prepared to retake classes a lot and then pay upwards of $1,000 for a three-credit class if you go over and overload. Teachers who are helpful are far and in-between, the general student body here is not one of the friendly kind if you are anything other then white."
College Junior,1,"There is the UG club but otherwise there are very few parties and they're bad. Make the drive to PSU, it's worth it"
College Junior,1,Parties on this campus? I don't think so
College Senior,1,"LVC is in a small town with almost everything in walking distance, but having a car will really help.  There are no other ways out of town."
College Freshman,1,"Shuttle bus trips are organized by the Student Affairs Office for day trips, but not really for general transportation of students to and from school and home. There is a train that passes the school, but it isn't a passenger train. Students have to get their own ride to and from school, as mass transport options are limited or unavailable."
College Junior,1,"If you don't have a car, you are not going anywhere!"
College Junior,1,The campus is not really diverse at all.  It is mostly white.
College Sophomore,1,"Our campus does not provide transportation, but everything needed is within walking distance or a quick 5 minute drive from campus. LVC does allow parking on campus for all students including freshman."
College Junior,1,Public Safety and campus police are pretty strict about everything that goes on.
College Junior,1,There is not a huge greek life on campus. It is totally opposite of what you see on tv. Mostly people in greek life are music majors
College Senior,1,IT RAINS A LOT AT LVC!!! and when its not raining it is usually cloudy
College Freshman,1,"There pretty much is no public transportation.  It would be so much better if they had a shuttle service to Hershey, Harrisburg, etc. 
The only transportation options you have is walking or going with a friend who has a car."
College Junior,1,Public safety is ridiculous. I think the alcohol policy is terrible. Students should not get in trouble simply for being in the presence of alcohol. I personally do not drink and have gotten in trouble for simply being present.
College Junior,1,There is not much diversity on the LVC campus.  I believe the school is 87% percent white and although some people out of that percentage do hang out with the other 87% the majority of the remaining 13% are there own friends.
College Freshman,1,"I don't ever go anywhere and there's not much to do at all. On weekends, I go home and have fun there. There is a dance/party every saturday night at midnight to 2 a.m. Overall, when you're hanging with friends, it's pretty fun. If you want to go off campus, you need a car or ride with some friends."
College Student,1,"You Need a Car – I have never seen a bus go through town at all, let alone a campus bus. You can call public safety if you need an escort late at night or feel unsafe but it's not like you can call them to take you shopping. There are few options close enough to walk to so if you want to go somewhere, you need a car."
College Freshman,1,Public Safety – Public Safety is the epitome of a waste of security measures put into place in the paranoia of post 9/11 America. This is a small private college in Annville in rural pennsylvania. Public Safety boils down a waste of my already overly exuberant tuition fees that has a job only paralleled to meter maids. THEY HAVE NO PURPOSE - LVC IS SAFE
College Freshman,1,"Nothing Around – Of you don't have a car on campus, you're stuck. There isn't much within walking distance"
College Freshman,1,I know of 5 black people on campus and have never seen an asian student here.
College Sophomore,1,Living in Hammond – I hated living in hammond the all girls dorm my first year. It was unbelievibly hot and the train tracks were right by my window. I hated it!

Alum,5,"I had minimal online classes, but numerous online activities and projects. They were usually easy to navigate and easy to submit."
Alum,5,The campus is amazing and you are right in the middle of a beautiful town. There are multiple shops and restaurants within walking distance in addition to the dining hall. You are close to the beach where you can take the most relaxing study breaks.
Junior,5,It is an amazing school that is for everyone. It allowed me to find my true self at a time where I felt very lost in my life.
Junior,5,"It was a bit of an adjustment, but I got the hang of it after a week or two. Chemistry became manageable through online"
Alum,5,"During my last years at College of Charleston, I had to move away from campus into a different town. The college offered online classes which allowed me to have a flexible work schedule. The curriculum was organized and there were many resources available to help you succeed in an online course."
Alum,5,"College of Charleston is a liberal arts college, which allows students to have a well-rounded education. The curriculum is designed to meet the interests of the students to achieve their intended goal. The classes are smaller, which allows you to build closer relationships with your professors and peers. The campus is in the center of a beautiful, historic town of Charleston, where most things are accessible by walking. College of Charleston also offers a wide variety of Undergraduate Programs, and your advisor is always easily accessible. The campus also promotes diversity, even offering programs and student activities centered around it. Overall, my experience at the College has exceeded my expectations. The only aspect I would consider changing is adding a football team."
Alum,5,"College of Charleston is a great institution, with professors that actually care about students. Class sizes are never too large."
Freshman,5,I took online courses with the College when COVID-19 fell into our laps. I feel that the professors did very well with adjusting to the new format and were very understanding for all of the students who were struggling or thriving. My online experience was a 10/10. My professors communicated so well with me and helped me to the best of my ability.
Freshman,5,College of Charleston is a warm and welcoming university for students all over the globe. My favorite portion was the location and the diversity at the school. Every student was motivated to learn as well as creating connections with others. I would recommend this beautiful campus to any and everyone looking for a great experience!
Freshman,5,"College of Charleston is more like a home than a college. With classmates like families, dorms like bedrooms, and dining hall food even better than Mom’s home cooked meals, what’s not to love? College of Charleston is like heaven on earth, with its tranquil campus, always providing an inviting place to study or lounge. Located in the bustling yet quaint city of Charleston, each student has a busy, happy, and fulfilling life. I recommend this college to anyone who’s looking to get the most out of their college experience."

-current cofc student"
Alum,5,"I loved attending the College of Charleston. I lived downtown, and that's where my classes were, so it was nice to be able to walk everywhere. You're incorporated right into the city. I really enjoyed most of my professors. They care about how their students do. There are so many available options to help your learning such tutors at the library, SI instructors, and office hours. The food on campus, I only had during freshman year. I graduated 2019 so it could have changed, but they had good options. I wish there was even more variety with the dinners. I also lived in a dorm for the first two years. I like living in Berry, and I think that there was a lot of space for the price that we were paying. When it comes to Athletics, CofC had a great basketball team, but that's the only sport I took any interest in. I actually enjoyed not having football because it gave me more time to enjoy the city."
Freshman,5,I love cofc. Everyone mainly goes for the parties and the party scene is good especially during rush week for the frats. When it starts to get warm the darty scene is great but at night its mainly bars. The food is okay nothing amazing unless bistro has chicken nuggets or Marty's has the pesto penne. Academics are okay I personally do not find them that challenging but there only GE classes right now.
Sophomore,5,"College of Charleston's campus is absolutely beautiful and it is very diverse. The college offers so many different areas of study, along with a plethora of clubs and organizations to join."

The campus holds so much of Charleston's history since it was created in 1770.The College of Charleston doesn't have a football team but, its students show a great amount of pride towards there school! There are many activities and clubs to become apart of right in the center of campus!  A really good part about attending the College of Charleston is how many connections the College has with businesses and universities. A good example would be the Medical University of South Carolina! If you plan on doing anything in the medical field, MUSC and CofC are for you! Some of the classes you will take at the College are affiliated with MUSC! This is a great opportunity to get a real life experience in the medical field before even attending medical school!"
Freshman,5,It’s a great university! I transferred from another college and I love it here. My professors are engaging and they care about my grade. The campus is beautiful and the atmosphere here is wonderful. I feel like there are so many opportunities and people who want to make things happen for you.

Freshman,5,"I started CofC this fall semester and am impressed by the school so far. The campus is beautiful and truly within the heart of the city of Charleston— there’s never a dull moment on campus. Academic-wise, the courses are what you’d expect, but the professors are amazing— especially because of their genuine care for each of their students. As for dinning halls and campus food, the food itself is average but the all the staff are kind and welcoming. The safety on campus is good, such as programs as the Cougar Shuttle for late-night commute and safety buttons situated throughout the campus."
Freshman,5,love the city the academics the campus the people I just felt like i was at home from my first visit to the Collage of Charleston.
Junior,5,"College of Charleston is very unique. There is a wide range of things that are possible to you when attending this school. I’ve enjoyed that I have the ability to explore my passions here and have been motivated to get out of my comfort zone. I’ve had ups and downs with this school as do many college students wherever one goes, but throughout all the downs I’ve experienced, I’ve learned lessons so valuable that I attribute to being a student at the College of Charleston. Lastly, one thing that stood out to me the first year here was the friendliness that you experience with other students. Random people you don’t know will say hello to you or toss you a compliment just because and sincerely, there are so many great kids who go here."
Junior,5,The college campus is in an excellent setting/location.  The school has very friendly students and professors.  Challenging courses keep you engaged.
Junior,5,The facilities are state of the art. All of my professors are excited about the subjects that they teach and are more than willing to always help their students.

This school has always been my dream school, and it has been nothing short of it since I arrived."
Freshman,5,"This college is awesome! They have a wide variety of Asian culture-type things for me to pursue and advance in my studies on...On top of this, my advisor/mentor at the Honors'College is so incredibly helpful that she is allowing me to successfully double major in Computing in the Arts AND English Language Teaching...not to mention the fact that I will be able to continuously study Japanese and potentially Chinese throughout my years here. All in all, I know this college will help me achieve my dream of becoming an Anime voice actress in Japan :) Not to mention the fact that this college has consistently been rated one of the top ones in the nation for foreign exchange...so I can go back soon! Or visit China, or Korea!"
Freshman,5,"The area and professors I have met have been amazing, I love the area and love the lower student number, which allows me to work with the professors closer and get a better education"
Sophomore,5,I like the campus overall it is so beautiful. Despite being in the city I still feel at home. Academics are slightly difficult you just have to stay on top of your work and you will have no problem.
Alum,5,College of Charleston is a liberal arts college located in the heart of downtown Charleston. I was able to invest myself in an environment that exposed me to different cultures and ways of thinking.
Freshman,5,"what I love about the College of Charleston is that it is in the middle of the city, the food is great on campus, its not too far from the beach and the campus is beautiful."
Junior,5,"I love College of Charleston! It is beautiful, the people are kind, and it had exactly what I was looking for academics wise. The professors I have had encouraged participation from students and want their opinions to be voiced and listened to with respect. Tutoring is included in tuition and there is a focus on promoting environmental health as well as mental health. The only thing I wish it would have is a larger Russian program that can accommodate classes on a more regular schedule. Other than that, it is the perfect school for me!"
Niche User,5,College of Charleston has one of the best psychology programs in the state. I had a choice to pick between CofC or UMASS and i chose College of Charleston.
Junior,5,"If you’re looking for a beautiful diverse city and college to live in you’ve found it. In downtown historic Charleston CofC has one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. You’ll never get tired of the historic building or the old oaks covered in Spanish moss. The school itself has great art, science, and history programs with ample resources. The school is very active with many clubs, organization, and Greek life. Both the school and the city are very LGBTQ+ friendly and there are many events and a school organization to bring people together in celebration and support of their LGBTQ+ pride. I couldn’t recommend a better school or city."
Sophomore,5,"I love CofC it is where I have made the best of friends and get to live in the most gorgeous city. The city life experience you get is nothing like New York or Chicago, It feels homey and has the great southern charm everyone loves. If you want the city life without all the loud noise and traffic I would definitely recommend looking at the College of Charleston.The campus is about 10,000 students which puts it at a nice medium sized school."
Freshman,5,"College of Charleston is a very unique, fun school filled with countless opportunities. I love the location, as it is centered in downtown Charleston near beautiful beaches and numerous shops and restaurants. The food is also outstanding, as there is a wide fresh variety to choose from all around. One thing I would like to change about the city, though, is the parking situation. Charleston is growing and expanding exponentially but there is simply not enough space. Parking is very limited, especially downtown, and if you want to park, the costs are fairly expensive. Overall, I am very proud to be a student of the College and if I am lucky, I may get a shot at graduate school right next door. The Medical University of South Carolina is right down the road, so if I decide on taking that path, I will be a Charleston resident once again for another four years!"
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere and the historic feel. I am proud to say that I go to the College of Charleston.
Freshman,5,I love the campus how it is directly in the heart of Charleston. It is in close proximity to the beach if you like that as much as I do.
Niche User,5,"The city campus is beautiful and historic, the people are helpful and friendly. The process of applying through registration and orientation is seamless. Lots of help and kindness. Southern hospitality and education all at once."
Freshman,5,"It is an awesome school. The campus is beautiful and the city is even cooler, with a very interesting night life. The climate is awesome and is always warm. I grew up in Southern California and the weather is almost identical to it. This was the main draw for me to go to college here."
Freshman,5,interview day was awesome i start in 4 months and i am really looking forward to it in the reach program.
Junior,5,"I have loved my experience at CofC! Being from South Carolina I feel so lucky to have gotten to go to a school so amazing as well as getting in state tuition. It's such a cool experience being on campus in the middle of downtown Charleston, and also being so close to the beach. I've loved meeting so many new people and connecting with teachers since not all of the classes are too big. Getting one on one time with teachers that take the time to learn your name each semester is great and it makes the connection to learning much more meaningful."
Niche User,5,The campus was beautiful and the lady that opened up with the presentation was amazing. This school is definitely one of my top choices to attend.
Freshman,5,"I would like to see the dinning halls improved but everything else is great. The city of Charleston is a great place to spend your time as a student, especially if you always want to have something to do. The campus is beautiful and integrated seamlessly into the city, so you never feel out of place in the location."
Freshman,5,I absolutely loved my first year at the college of Charleston. The culture of the area is very unique something I've never experienced before. I enjoyed all of my professors and genuinely believed that they wanted me to succeed.
Niche User,5,"CofC is an amazing college within a beautiful city. There is always so much to do in Charleston. The professors care about your success and the small class sizes help you be a successful student. The beach is minutes away, so you can study and relax at the same time. Safety is important to CofC and is taken very seriously. I am looking forward to many more years at CofC and I know it will prepare me for my future."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere of college of charleston is amazing. the staff and students here are so welcoming and amazing. it feels like home every single day that i’m here and i don’t regret my decision at all.
Sophomore,5,I’ve learned so many new and exciting things in the past two years here. The professors are passionate about the eduction of their students and encouraging new ideas and questions.
Niche User,5,The overall environment is beautiful and the people are kind. The school really stands out as one of the coolest colleges.
Senior,5,I love attending CofC. The campus is stunning and I made my lifelong friends on this campus. The small class size helps you create relationships with your professors that will assist you in your post-grad endeavors.
Niche User,5,"Very small, and friendly. Loved every second. Everything is in walking distance of the college which means no car, which is good for the environment."
Alum,4,"I did not take any courses online, so I am unable to speak to what online courses are like at the College of Charleston."
Alum,4,"CofC was an overall wonderful experience, though due to the shortage of on-campus housing I had to work nearly full-time my final two years in order to pay for an apartment which caused my grades to suffer.  The professors were overall good and informative and well-versed on their areas of expertise."
Freshman,4,"Professors were very willing to help out students even with connectivity issues and were patient. For online learning, students were still able to learn lots through engaging learning."
Freshman,4,College of Charleston is a very welcoming place. It is easy to settle and make friends by exploring beautiful areas in Charleston. Teachers are easy to connect with and are patient.
Freshman,4,The school is unique and very welcoming to new students. I especially liked how they handled the current virus issue. They kept us in school as long as they could and then gave use a scheduled time within 2 weeks to get moved out.
Freshman,4,"I took one online class from the beginning, and while it was my hardest class it, it was well organized. All my other classes switched to online after Covid and while the teachers weren't that prepared they all did their best to adjust and kept communicating with students to make the transition as smooth as possible."
Freshman,4,My schedule consisted of mostly science and math related classes. My professor did very well adapting to the online learning and provided many resources for extra help.
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity of the campus! I also enjoy the open campus. The campus is in the middle of beautiful, downtown Charleston."
Alum,4,Online classes are sometimes better due to some required classes that just seem like a complete and otter waste of time--giving you the freedom of getting it over with online.
Alum,4,"It was an overall good experience. The atmosphere is submerged into a downtown area so it is not your typical college experience whatsoever. It is a relatively small school, professors are very liberal (and will force their views on you), administration is organized, class selection is adequate, price is high when out-of-state.. Overall, students do not go here for the school (its called CAMP Charleston for a reason) but for the atmosphere and beautiful scenery and activities nearby."
Alum,4,"I did not take classes online, but all professors are well versed in using online adjuncts. Professors make the effort to ensure that all different types of learners succeed. I have heard overall good reviews of online classes at CofC."
Freshman,4,"With the conversion to online learning, the beauty of learning on campus was greatly missed. However, the adaptability of the professors and student body was astounding. Each and every person dedicated themselves to making the most out of the online learning experience, with an attitude of optimism that made online learning fun."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my online microeconomics class. I'm more of a visual learner and being that it's online, the visuals were BOOMIN'."
Freshman,4,College of Charleston had to change to on-line learning. I had to take orientation on-line as an upcoming freshman. It was a good experience with all the information needed to start school in the fall.
Alum,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and classes are typically no more than a 10 minute walk. Short drive to multiple beaches. Lots of events held for students. There are many clubs and groups to get involved with, and if you find the right professor, you may be able to start a club of your own."
Alum,4,I took one online class and it was great! The teacher was very helpful and great a communicating. The assignments were not stressful and everything was very straightforward. I liked the idea of learning at my own pace because this alleviated stress from completing assignments for other classes that I was taking.
Sophomore,4,"Online with College of Charleston was good, besides the fact that I hate online learning. Online classes are much harder when they are not supposed to be online. I prefer in person lectures over online learning. I would rather be able to talk to my professor face to face if i have any issues."
Sophomore,4,"I took several classes online and found that most professors easily adapted to the change. As in class, lectures continued as usual and expectations were upheld."
Sophomore,4,"It’s a very immersive environment. The college is focused around its students, holding a variation of events and activities."
Junior,4,"It is a very good school, mostly everyone, employees and staff, are very nice and understanding. The professors are really good and some classes may be more dificult they are always there to help."
Junior,4,"It is a very good school, mostly everyone, employees and staff, are very nice and understanding. The professors are really good and some classes may be more dificult they are always there to help."
Junior,4,"The College of Charleston has a very beautiful campus and everything is more or less a 5 minute walk from your dorm or the center of campus. The food is pretty good, but if you don't like campus food king street has many other options to eat at."
Junior,4,"I really love the setting and how helpful my advisors are, I just wish the student body was way more diverse."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful college located in the best foody places. Wonderful campus and professors. Everything is walking distance, no need to drive or bring a car. Great programs for diversity and career search."
Sophomore,4,"College of Charleston has great on campus meal plans, housing, and a beautiful campus. They offer a great program for business and a large range of majors and minors. The school is full of great people that are very helpful, there are endless resources for all questions students might have. There is a common problem with students who transfer because a lot of classes do not transfer, but its an awesome school with a great environment to live."
Sophomore,4,The city is beautiful and the college is very nice. There are plenty of opportunities and an endless number of activities around campus and in the city.
Sophomore,4,The campus life is very enjoyable and the professors and faculty are dedicated and driven to help their students achieve their future goals.
Alum,4,"I love the campus and the city of Charleston. If you live off campus, parking is a huge hassle and very expensive. Housing is also expensive. I definitely recommend staying on campus at least your first year (I wish I had) to maximize your experience. There's no football team, but there are other sports. There's a large variety of classes, some of which are really fun and unique. As with most schools, there's a mixed bag when it comes to professors. Some are amazing, and others.. not so much."
Sophomore,4,"The campus of CofC is incredibly beautiful and there's plenty of space to work outside in what is usually great weather. CofC also has a fantastic library and academic resources, with an especially great marine bio program. The students and culture at CofC foster great friendships and an overall great time."
Sophomore,4,I love the location. The campus is super walkable but there is not room for people to park that have to commute. Some of the online classes can be very demanding and don’t allow for much work life balance for adult students.
Junior,4,"CofC wasn’t my first choice in schools,  but now I can’t imagine myself having gone anywhere else! The city is beautiful with so much history to explore right off campus. Class sizes are small, so professors know you by your name rather than a number and they are very willing to help if you ask. There are so many opportunities for students from free tutoring centers, internships, on campus jobs, a wide variety of student organizations, and great programs for international education."
Junior,4,I like that I am receiving a well-rounded education with professors who actually care whether I am doing well or not. I think the College can improve on fun extracurriculars for students to be part of.
Junior,4,"College of Charleston has given me access to so many opportunities, including MUSC research, job experience, and volunteer services. Faculty and staff are generally nice and make an effort to assist students in all avenues of service they might need. There is always something to do on the campus and many great things to see around Charleston. The only suggestion for improvement I would make, is incorporating more diversity into everyday campus life, truthfully acknowledging ALL aspects of history that the college has, and remodeling most of the dorms. Other than that, it's a great school!"
Senior,4,Great school! Love the atmosphere and staff is mostly good. I love the fact that the college is located in the middle of downtown Charleston. This makes the life for students very fun. I have had some great professors that I will never forget but I have also had some professors that were very bad.
Sophomore,4,Very fun area and the campus is beautiful. The teachers are all nice and care about your future. The advisers are very helpful and easy to talk to.
Senior,4,Loved it all! Easy to walk and navigate.  Abundance of activities and in the beautiful historic city of Charleston South Carolina.
Sophomore,4,It is a great school. The professors care about their students and do their jobs well. The college campus very beautiful and the students are very diverse.
Sophomore,4,It is a beautiful campus. There is always something to do! I would definitely recommend getting involved on campus it is a great way to get to know your peers and make some new friends!
Sophomore,4,"The city of Charleston is like no other. It maintains the excitement of a big city, however somehow holds a small historic town vibe. The school has the most beautiful campus making students want to walk to class, and the professors want to be there teaching. It is so comforting to be around so many happy people."
Junior,4,The College offers students really easy and simple ways of getting involved. The campus is the most beautiful place in America and it is really easy to get around the city. I don't feel unsafe walking home from a friends place or the library late at night. The locals in Charleston are super friendly and always willing to chat with you about their lives. All of the professors want to see the students succeed in whatever they do and are willing to work with the students to make that happen.
Senior,4,"My experience at the College of Charleston has been positive overall. I have met a lot of nice people who will be my friends for many years to come. I have also learned a lot especially with social skills, communication, and study habits. The class sizes are nice and the professor's are flexible and are willing to compromise depending on situations. The college generally wants to help students pursue there interests if a person puts in the work."
Alum,4,"CofC has the greatest location in Downtown Charleston. Walking distance to anything  and everything downtown. 
Plenty of clubs and student activities.
Great variety of majors, wide range of courses and very friendly students. Only drawback is some of the professors, choose carefully."
Senior,4,"I've been at the College for 3 years and have lived on campus all 3. The professors care about you succeeding and there are many classes to take. The campus is beautiful and although there are athletics, the College isn't athletic based like other schools."
Niche User,4,The college is beautiful throughout the entire campus. The location is really nice as well with the ocean and many beaches nearby.
Sophomore,4,Professors are super easy to access. The students are super friendly not too hard to make anew friend. Campus life is always doing something and there are always events and activities to get involved with. There are so many clubs and organizations to be apart of and meet new people within but also great way to stay tuned in within the community. The location is very pretty and enjoyable for getting out and enjoying the scenery.
Alum,4,"I absolutely enjoyed my time at the College of Charleston!  However, there is definitely a lack in diversity and the student life is ok."
Sophomore,4,"Best to live downtown, the drive in can be a pain. But other than that great college for a great college experience."
Freshman,4,"The College is a blast. Right in the middle of Charleston there is no shortage of opportunities for fun. The academics vary, but if  you pick your professors wisely you can get the most out of your education. The students and faculty are all very friendly. Big fraternity/sorority scene, but by no means a requirement to enjoy your time here."
Sophomore,4,"Attending the College of Charleston means being apart of a community. Rather than living on a college campus solely with other college students, the College of Charleston allows for you to be surrounded by both students and people of all ages from around the city. The College provides opportunities that most other colleges would not be able to."
Freshman,4,"I like College of Charleston for its academia.  The professors are all very nice and fun and easy to talk to here.  They make sure you're challenged without making the classes unbearable.  I never feel like I'm all alone in my studies here.  I do wish that the curriculums were a bit different because I find some of the classes I have to take unnecessary.  I wish I was able to test out of some classes or even just take the final exam and get credit for a class that way.  Overall CofC is a great school for academics (honestly more so for history, linguistics, and arts).  Student life is pretty good, both with partying and with non partying.  The dorms are average.  I've lived in 2 of the best dorms here (Rutledge and George) but some of the others aren't as good to be honest.  The security is really good here.  And if you love walking a little through the city to go to all of your classes and embracing city life, you're going to really like it here."
Graduate Student,4,"The atmosphere is incredibly unique. The buildings are architecturally inviting, while there is a balance of modern take in schools such as the Science center. I enjoy the maintenance of the trees in the historical cistern yard. I would love to see the athletic program continue to improve."
Freshman,4,I love that I have the opportunity to experience taking classes in such a beautiful city and that I can study outside in peaceful settings.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshmen student at the college in my spring semester. I love everything about the school. The location is top notch, the facilities are very good, and the clubs and activities are endless. The only thing I would say isn't wonderful is how hard some of the classes are, and some of the professors could be better."
Sophomore,4,"The city is always so energized and beautiful, the people are wonderful, and the food is amazing. The college is nothing but dedicated to helping students achieve their goals, and offer plenty of resources to help, from trained tutors to peer counselors."
Sophomore,4,"It's a beautiful campus and a wonderful community. Some professors are wonderful, some are less so, which of course can be said of all universities. I am a pre-med student hoping to attend MUSC"
Senior,4,"I really like College of Charleston, but I am a transfer student. I originally lived in Charleston, but I went to a college near Columbia, SC and then transferred to College of Charleston in my third year. Transferring was a little confusing since I went from a private, small college to College of Charleston. Although the school is great, if you are transferring, you often have to go on your own to figure out the workings of the school. They set you up to succeed, but anything that they don't tell you at orientation is left for you to discover on your own."
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and the variety of clubs and organizations are amazing. I wish the Center for International Education was more helpful when I was applying to study abroad. However, the classes are great. We have a wide array of course and majors to choose from and most of the professors are helpful and really want to see you succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Classes are easy and the campus is beautiful. It's easy to get involved with the school and there's no way you'll be bored in downtown Charleston, especially with King Street."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely loved the location and scenery. CofC has been named America's most beautiful campus, and for good reason. It's in one of the best locations possible, and every building is easy to get to. The professors are amazing, every class I've been in has been an excellent experience thanks to them. The dorms are great as well, giving me everything I essentially need. If I have any complaints, it's the cost of living, attending, and luxuries. Every store around CofC has prices that are jacked up, and when you're already struggling financially, it doesn't help that if you need to get more amenities from a store, the prices are more expensive. Also, several crimes have happened around or on campus, one near my own dorm, and barely anything seemed to be done about it. It would be nice to see more cameras set up in the dorms to keep the campus safer."
Sophomore,4,Overall the classes at the college are diverse and challenging. Most professors I have encountered are invested in their students. The city is a great place for college kids to explore as well.
Sophomore,2,"When I was at the College of Charleston, I did not have any online experience, I can tell from a lot of my other friends and classmates that it was not the best either. A lot of people struggled and their grades ended up faltering."
Senior,2,"My online experience with the College of Charleston was incredibly poor, similar to many other colleges, the switch to online was incredibly sudden and underprepared, I find that I have to take my initial experience with a grain of salt. Most of my professors handled the situation in the best manner that they could, even offering more optimal office hours for tightly scheduled people. However, I do not feel that the tuition and college education I paid for was presented during this time, and I have high suspicions of these issues not being amended. A final exam that I took for a major class happened to be a 5 question quiz on OAKS. Arguably, as an incredibly busy student, this would be ideal - but only for the student who is lazy and wishes to pass a course without retaining what has been taught. I am incredibly unhappy with the education I have paid for and will continue to pay for throughout my adult life, being mindlessly taught online in such a lethargic, unideal manner."
Sophomore,2,"I go to school here, but plan on transferring. I took community college classes senior year of high school and had a 4.0 GPA. I donate hours of my time studying every day at the library and have a C average GPA now as a sophomore. I’m also out of state and had a $28,000 academic scholarship. I lost this despite how hard I work daily. Now, it is nearly $50,000 a year for me to attend. I’m not the only person that has experienced this. Tests are formatted on choosing the “best answer” instead of showing what you know. Save your money and go to a school where you’re taught to actually learn."
Freshman,2,"My time at cofc was really hard.  it's a very high energy environment; lot's of stress and anxiety. There are definitely good things about this college. However, for every person i spoke to who seemed to like it, I would speak to two more who were really struggling to feel any sense of well-being in the chaotic energy that permeates that school. I felt so much depression and anxiety those first couple weeks, and I was really let down by the lack of resources or awareness they have about emotional health, especially considering how much the student body seems to need it. Maybe it's a good school for the right person, but if you thrive in a calm and balanced environment, i think you'll have a hard time finding that at cofc."
Freshman,2,Some teachers were great but many were not. classes are way too easy and if you are a bio major forget about hands on experience opportunities.
Sophomore,2,They lure you in and then drop you through the cracks. Terrible advisors. Very difficult to self advocate. The timing of crucial info is poor and lacks clarity. More concerned about brand and recruiting than taking care of students.
Sophomore,2,"Sometimes, I wished that I could say that CofC was the only school for me and how I couldn't imagine myself to be anywhere else. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case. I went to CofC purely because of the merit scholarships that gave me, which in hindsight, was definitely not a coincidence. 

CofC has a very poor reputation in the area which I found out not through the school but rather the Uber drivers I took around the city. The college is trying to overcome extreme heroin, hazing, and sexual assault issues. The partying is frankly out of control and downright dangerous. I wouldn't recommend the party scene to any woman out there.

The academics are severely lacking. I'm not challenged whatsoever in any of my classes, and because of this, I'm considering a transfer my junior year."
Senior,2,The user interface of the cofc website is insanely difficult to navigate. There's never anyone available to assist with any problems. No one tells/helps you through anything ahead of time but rather helps you through it when it's due after actively seeking out help.
Sophomore,2,"The College of Charleston has been rather a learning experience for me. It is not at all what I expected. Charleston is a beautiful place but this is definitely not a campus school and you spend way too much money down here. It is almost as if you take classes at the college but live in Charleston- its not College of Charleston. There is also a lifestyle you definitely have to live up to and everything is so exclusive, people here are not welcoming."
Junior,2,"It wasn't for me. Its not very welcoming for people who are not your typical Charlestonian. However, the campus is gorgeous and the city is full of culture and history. "
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the Greeks are the richest at the school, and let others know it. Not to mention they are the ones stumbling around town drunk and obnoxious."
College Freshman,2,There is relatively no attention paid to sports on campus. There are very limited facilities as well.
College Freshman,2,"Due to the fact the college is in downtown Charleston, there are bound to be incidents. Many people have been robbed and some have been physically hurt. There has also been a recent problem with date rape drugs. I try not to walk campus alone for these reasons."
College Freshman,2,I have been here for only 2 semesters but I have not had one good teacher. Most either are trying to trick the students into getting questions wrong or simply do not teach the information. Without the SI sessions for science most students would fail the classes. the SI sessions depend on the quality of the SI leaders.
College Freshman,2,Dorms tend to be dirty and small
College Freshman,2,"Sorority girls are generally uptight and look down upon GDI's, and frat guys tend to be cliquey and extremely fratty."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus housing is not very clean and not very spacious. McConnell, the all girls dorm, is very small, and features eight girls to a suite. This can get very cramped. It is also not very clean, and has mold. All of the dorms are in an extremely close proximity to campus."
College Freshman,2,I have had some issues with the Public safety department
College Freshman,2,They need to be updated badly
College Freshman,2,"It's nice that the class sizes are small, but the poor quality of students ruins a lot of the academics."
College Freshman,2,The classes are too easy here.
College Freshman,2,very confusing and didn't help much
College Junior,2,"To find a reasonably priced place to live, you have to go at least a 15-30 minute walk outside of campus, and even then it is still hard to find anything under $650 a month. If you start looking early enough, you may be able to find that one gem where is it cheap yet close to the college. The college does nothing to help you look for off campus living, you have to do it on your own through agencies usually in Charleston."
College Junior,2,"For in-state people the scholarships are endless because this is a public South Carolina school. However, being from PA, it is near impossible to get any money from the college. The only way for out of staters to get scholarships is to go through the Honors College, and even then is it really work all the extra pointless work and classes?"
College Freshman,2,"There are only two dining halls and while they have a decent amount of options, most of them suck. The quality is very hit or miss, and if you don't like the options in one dining hall, you have to wait 30 minutes until you can swipe and go into the other dining hall. The dining dollars are great because the Stern Center food is actually pretty good. The cleanliness at the dining halls, mostly Liberty, is astonishingly bad. Plastics cups and plates are merely rinsed and sometimes you end up with plates with residue still on them."
College Freshman,2,"The cost of some of the dorms is not worth what you get. Most of the dorms have very small rooms that are cramped. Most are not very clean and seem to have mold or other pesticides that make students sick. In some dorms, like Liberty, you cannot open the windows so the air is very stagnant which is not healthy. McCallister and McConnell are both decent dorms and with a suite with more people, it is easier to make friends."
College Senior,2,Its really hard to get scholarships
College Freshman,2,looked down on a lot
College Freshman,2,"They dining halls often make weird combinations of food. Generally, they do not make simple food very often. They usually try to make fancy things that end up not tasting good."
College Senior,2,Not enough money is budgeted for athletics.  There is just no room in downtown Charleston.
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus housing is very difficult to come buy without busting out a bunch of money. From my own research, the average rent is $800/month per person- and with that, don't count on parking or laundry units. Expect to share bathrooms."
College Freshman,2,"I live in the most expensive dorm(McAlister), and it is not worth what I am paying for.  Having a private bathroom and kitchen is nice, but the actual bedroom is very small and the cleanliness of the building is not very good.  I have also found that there is almost no sense of community in the building, as I have been here 3 months and don't know any people in the rooms on either side of my suite.  I feel like this is in part because the suites open up to outside corridors as compared to indoor hallways.  If I had to do it again I would have lived in Liberty instead."
College Freshman,2,"No football team, not much school spirit, and the athletic facilities/fields for students are either far away or not plentiful enough(basketball courts)"
College Freshman,2,"C of C has no football team and no school spirit, and the sports situation only seems to be going downhill. They recently announced that they're cutting the swimming and diving team because the pool is too much to maintain. They have excellent sailing and equestrian teams, but most students don't know or care about these sports. Basketball games have the best crowd turnout and they can be fun to go to, and sometimes students will travel to University of South Carolina over the weekends to attend their football games."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of parties, but people do wayyyy too much. Friend of mine partied so hard that she ended up in the hospital and bit a nurse. Access to alcohol for persons below 21 is too easy."
College Sophomore,2,"The College as a whole as an extreme lack in diversity. It is easy to get lost in the numbers, but it is still possible to find a niche of diverse and inclusive people, which does exist on campus. In my first year, I have met a community of people in the LGBTQ and POC spectrum that is extremely active and trying to change the numbers at CofC."
College Junior,2,this school provides scholarships? really? to whom?
College Freshman,2,"If you want to park near campus with someone other than through the school, you will be paying upwards of $500-$600 per semester. If you get parking through the school, for the best spots, it's about $450/semester. However, you must have 30 credit hours in order to get on-campus parking."
College Freshman,2,"I think the whole Greek Life system is messed up. For girls, it's pretty hard to get into a sorority - for the most part. I just disagree with the entire concept of letting some people in, but not others based on strictly superficial qualities. However, if you REALLY want to be part of Greek Life, it can be done, but you may have to rush a couple of times."
College Freshman,2,"Our basketball team is great and lots of people go to those games, but that's about it. Not many students go out to any other sporting events. If you live and breathe for sports, I'd highly recommend you choose a different school."
College Freshman,2,"The CARTA bus system is the public transportation from the city. The buses often times run late and off-schedule. Not great to rely on, but they are okay if you must use them."
College Freshman,2,Sometimes the floods become very extreme and it makes it hard for people to get to class
College Freshman,2,Outdated crappy classrooms with unmotivated and unstimulating professors
College Freshman,2,"Literally basic girls and guys at this school. White, preppy, republicans..."
College Sophomore,2,Its great but it definitely costs way more than it should. It's ridiculous what people pay for rent and is super pricey and is impossible for a student to go to school and work enough to pay rent and utilities which is the reasoning behind why i have to move back home.
College Junior,2,"Greeks are friendly, but they all dress the same. Boat shoes, salmon pants. It becomes an eyesore after a while. Sorority girls can also be sort of ditsy."
College Senior,2,"I'm in greek life and the thing is, greeks are snobs. Most non-greeks do not look fondly on greeks and greeks are often nasty to each other, especially sororities because many girls here think they're entitled."
College Freshman,2,I am undecided.  They do not offer my program here.
College Freshman,2,Very poor network reliability and wireless access
College Freshman,2,"I would not know, I haven't looked at off- campus housing.  I know the cost is high to get housing close to campus, so most go far from campus but safety is a big issue.  The farther off campus you go, the less safe the area is.  Parking is very hard to find in the city."
College Sophomore,2,"It's obvious to tell the boys who are in frats and they make that pretty clear. Seems like most girls in this school are a part of greek life but that isn't necessarily true. Being in a frat affects you severely, not being in one is normal here"
College Sophomore,2,I honestly shocked me to how many students do do drugs. Living on campus in a dorm all I hear on the weekend is people talking about how they can't wait to get high or drunk. On some occasions you may see it but you hear about it more than you see it.
College Sophomore,2,our school provides no campus transportation at all
College Sophomore,2,i applied for financial aid but wasn't granted any. although i truly need financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,I know many people who get caught up in the party scene and it ends up ruining their academic careers. Stay smart!
College Senior,2,"As a minority, it's hard to feel accepted here. Faculty, Staff and other students sometimes make it hard for you to feel like you belong. It's an everyday struggle."
College Senior,2,Charleston is very segregated between rich and poor. But there isn't a bubble protecting the campus. Be careful because girls get snatched up and people get robbed sitting in their living rooms. 
College Freshman,2,The weather here is very very unpredictable.Be prepared for anything.
College Sophomore,2,"You don't really need public transportation in Charleston, but it exists. The CARTA bus system is the city bus system that CofC students can use for free. It's really confusing to use and kind of sketchy, though."
College Sophomore,2,I do not participate in parking but I hear it is bad
Sophomore,1,The academics were pretty poor and I would not recommend students to go there unless they want to party and lose all of their money due to alcoholism.
Junior,1,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous and the city is amazing. However, the academics and faculty are extremely sub-par. Some departments are better than others however the majority are quite terrible. The math department in particular is absolutely terrible. The department chair and higher up faculty care more about diversity of Proffesor’s than the quality of education they deliver to the 10,000 students at the school, the majority of which pay over $20,000 to attend. It’s been an absolutely disgusting experience having to take math classes at this school and it is shocking how unprofessional and the lack of moral and academic interfaith that exists in this department."
Freshman,1,"This school sucked. I came here as a freshman from a great boarding school. My first roommate was a drug addicted sophomore who was on probation. He wound up getting kicked out less than 2 weeks later. I got another roommate who was a great guy and we decided to pledge together. A complete nightmare. Some of the brothers were abusive lunatics. A couple of my friends had their hands broken by having them slammed in doors. I personally was kicked by a number of brothers for 10 minutes because I had class and didn’t finish his laundry. The school was informed what was going on and not only outed the students who reported the hazing but did nothing to the frat. After dropping out after a couple of weeks the fraternity blackballed and bullied endlessly. They told my roommate he had to move out. I spent a miserable, lonely year at this pit. I am now at a great school and pledging a normal fraternity. CofC is a shithole."
Freshman,1,"I left last semester as a college freshmen. I can honestly say if you want to go to school to party this is the school for you but if not , DO NOT GO HERE. It was so hard to make friends being an out of state student and not joining a sorority. I hated my roommate and suit mates the dorms and food were incredibly overpriced and awful.My classes were easy but the teachers are pretentious and don't really want to help you, I can't say I learned much. I am back at  a community college in MA and the academics are 100% better then at CofC and I feel like I will be able to transfer somewhere where I'll be make a successful salary when I graduate. I did not have that feeling at all with the lack of help at CofC."
Freshman,1,"It's been two months and I dread getting up everyday knowing I'm still here. I am a very outgoing fun person and have 0 friends. No one speaks here its so odd. It is a very clicky school, most kids are from South Carolina or you are a commuter so everyone already knows everyone. Also, something they don't tell you here is how revolting the food is. I have spent well over 1,000 dollars here just so I don't starve. I'd recommend the 300 dinning dollars package because then you can atleast get chick-fil-a (which doesn't have all the normal options and has yet to have milkshakes).  If you go here you need to WANT to go here. If you are looking for an inclusive/community experience aka REAL COLLEGE/TRADITIONAL such as UT  you will NOT find it here. Choose wisely. I cry everyday i'd never recommend CofC. I went home after 11 days here. I have a countdown until fall break which allows me to see how many days hours minutes and seconds are left until I am OUT of here. "
College Freshman,1,"I hate living on campus, with suitemates, and a roommate. I constantly hear slamming doors, people yelling down the halls. My neighbors blast their music and I can hear it through the walls. The cost is very expensive and there is not a lot of space."
College Freshman,1,"Theres little diversity, but minority students are not looked at any differently"
College Sophomore,1,"Typically when you apply for a school they give you financial aid options, but as a transfer student I was not given a financial aid package from the school. Many of the scholarships are specifically for freshmen which makes it a hassle for me."
College Freshman,1,"Mold on the vents, mold in the mattresses, mold in the showers... and work orders to have it dealt with are ignored for weeks and weeks on end. It has us sick just about every week. Incredibly over priced, too, considering the low quality."
College Freshman,1,Cofc has no school spirit which likely stems from our lack of sports teams
College Sophomore,1,There are barely any scholarships available for students that need help and are working hard in school like me but also have a job and trying to pay for rent and utilities and books. Its horrible and is going to be such an inconvenience for me to move back home and have to commute and help my dad with tuition because its so high and I don't have any scholarships.
College Freshman,1,They do not offer it.
College Freshman,1,Charleston is a huge drug campus.  Mostly everyone drinks and does drugs.
College Sophomore,1,There is no parking. unless you pay hundreds for a spot on campus
College Senior,1,"I don't feel that students that I have met on campus have any idea what's going on in the world. They are ignorant about the most basic things like the tax structure. Even health majors have no idea about healthcare reform. I guess they don't feel a need to be concerned about it now because their parents take care of them. It is very difficult to be a minority on this campus. The students aren't outright bigots or racist, they are just ignorant about the real world."
College Senior,1,Very expensive to park. Park at the Citadel mall and ride the Express bus downtown for free. 
College Freshman,1,Off-campus housing is very limited and expensive. It is usually better to stay on campus as long as possible
College Freshman,1,"The College is making efforts to increase the amount of diversity, but the school still remains predominately white."
College Freshman,1,Pretty segregated. If you are looks for diversity this is not the place for you. Best way to meet a diverse group of friends is to get involved in as many clubs as possible.
College Freshman,1,I got no financial aid from CofC even though i have 3 siblings entering college soon.
College Freshman,1,"It's downtown Charleston, the on-campus parking is overcrowded, & at times expensive."
College Freshman,1,"There is really no need for a car on this campus because everything is walking distance. You can find everything you need on campus by walking to it, and if you were to have a car you would probably earn a few parking tickets as it is very difficult to find parking since the college is located in downtown Charleston."
College Sophomore,1,The dining halls suck and the meal plans are a waste of money.  OCMP is definitely the way to go.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is extremely limited. Garages are expensive. Meter-maids pounce as soon as your meter is up. Permits are very expensive. You don't need a car on campus, walking and biking is easy and nice, however, a car is good to have for grocery stores, going to the beach, etc."
College Freshman,1,Parking enforcement is everywhere. Don't park your car in the wrong spot and blink or you'll end up with a ticket
College Sophomore,1,"In Charleston there is a lack of parking spaces, this is not the schools fault, it is simply the product of being in the middle of a city."
College Junior,1,CofC really lacks diversity. I believe the school has a 90-95% Caucasian ratio. Other races make up the other 10-15%.
College Sophomore,1,"I recommend not having a car to say they enforce parking with an iron fist would be an understatement. Parking spots are really hard to find unless you go to a garage, which on the positive side are actually really cheap."
College Freshman,1,"If your 21 it is great, bars and clubs everywhere. If not most house parties are exclusive and/or cost like 5-10$. A pretty good local musics spot.
Hope you meet someone with their own house you are close with"
College Freshman,1,"Be Prepared to Pay!! Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars, and then the school makes upperclassmen pay over $1000 a year to keep their cars on campus"
College Freshman,1,The financial aid department was VERY slow in giving me my money.
College Freshman,1,Difficult to Get – it's really hard to get financial aid here and out of state tuition is ridiculously expensive
College Freshman,1,"We were so excited when CofC won their division in football this year! 

Just kidding, we don't have a team. School spirit is relatively low here, but that's something that comes with many urban-set schools. Basketball season is starting, which many of us hope will pick up the oomph around here, but really- how many times have you heard a CofC grad talking about their school pride?"
College Freshman,1,Drinking Gone Wild – The drinking on our campus is out of hand and the so called public safety does not even try to get it under control. No check point they as well as staff just turn their heads.
College Freshman,1,"People are incredibly superficial. Many girls wear so much makeup that they look like their wearing masks. The 65-35 ratio is omnipresent, so if you're normal looking prepare to be bombarded by strange guys. Guys can basically get away with anything here.   If you're not into frat guys, don't come here."
College Freshman,1,"If you are considering going to this school from out of state, think again.  Most people here are either really preppy, grungy, or surfers from icky towns in South Carolina and already have friends from high school. When people visit, they fall in love with Charleston because it's such a beautiful city. But it's really not worth it. If you don't have a car, you're basically trapped on the peninsula. The nightlife sucks: frat parties are exclusive, house parties get broken up by 12, and undercover cops relentlessly bust people at bars.  The dorm life also sucks because most dorms are suite style, so nobody is very friendly.  Berry is the worst of the worst. It's all girls, so everyone has a catty attitude. The windows don't even open in the rooms, so it's always cold and sterile feeling. People skip class all the time and are incredibly unmotivated.  People don't care about politics or current issues.  If you want to get a rigorous, liberal education save yourself and DO NOT GO HERE. YOU WILL REGRET IT. I am most definitely transferring out, and so are about 10 other people I know. "
College Freshman,1,"always the same food, always really busy, never really good."
College Freshman,1,I had a 4.0 GPA in HS but because I am out of state and both my parents have a job...no financial aid or help what so ever for me!
College Freshman,1,"Girls and Girls...What Boys? CofC has a 1:6 ratio so ladies be prepared to share your man with 5 other girls. You can really tell the difference. Also, the boys know how many females they are so if your not DTF on to the next five. There are a few exceptions but they are hard to come by. Also, if khaki pants, boat shoes, and button downs turn you on than come to CofC cause it pretty much consists of southern frat boys. There are a few surfer/skater kids but its not very common."
College Freshman,1,"Its awful. There is absolutely no where to park without paying a lot of money. There is no need to have a car unless you want to go to the beach or get out of downtown for a bit. Being out of state, my friends had a hard time visiting because there was no where for them to park."

Freshman,5,"I am starting this coming Fall Semester, and everyone I have been in contact with have been so helpful. There has been some helpful Zoom meetings that have helped me a lot. I was able to enter a program that will assist me through my years I am going for my Bachelor's Degree. I can't wait to start my classes!"
Freshman,5,"I have not started classes yet, but they have this online study guide for their math placement testing. It take me through some subjects that are covered in the test that I can go through before re-taking the test."
Junior,5,"I like the amount of classes I was able to take online, as I work full-time while taking classes full-time."
Freshman,5,"I liked how the campus was not so big that it became stressful for incoming freshman. I also like the tours that they provided and how they always tried to make themselves available for any questions we may have had. They also came to my High School and introduced themselves and helped all those who would be attending their school sign up for classes. Since I live in Fairbanks still, it was nice that they put fourth the same effort they would if a person who lived in a state was applying. The campus was also very nice and clean and the teachers were very welcoming. I think overall I would recommend this college to anyone who would ask me."
Freshman,5,For my first semester I did both online and in person classes. I do believe that was better than just taking online classes. Since I did have a break in between classes it made it a perfect time to work on my online classes which is great. It was a great learning experience on what was best for me to be successful.  I did enjoy online classes though. What makes a difference is having good online teachers who care about their students and encourage them to not get behind. UAF by far has the greatest online teachers. Even in high school when I had online classes they did not put as much effort into making sure there students were doing well and staying on track. I would also recommend if a person works better online that they attend this school.
Senior,5,I love that UAF has an amazing social work program where distance learning is made possible. The professors put a lot of work into their online lectures and classes in general. They also walked me through the process of applying for practicum. Offices and professors are very responsive and easy to contact. The amount of resources available for distance students is amazing. They really show that they want us to succeed. The way they handled the pandemic was also great and they were very understanding of everybody’s situation.
Senior,5,"Professors are really invested in their students, including online students. Participation was a must as professors wanted to provide the best online class experience through zoom."
Niche User,5,"uaf has been responsive to the diverse needs of the student population- options include online classes, late start courses, and available technology."
Alum,5,"The University of Alaska Fairbanks is a very diverse college that provides students with the necessary tools to have a successful career. With a variety of degree opportunities, no matter what students are looking for they will likely find it at UAF! I highly recommend this university!"
Sophomore,5,This campus is so amazing. There are so many tutors and help throughout this campus. The thing I really enjoy is that they have a math and writing center available on the weekends. I work full time during the week. With these hours it works out for me. I think the only thing this place needs to work on is the parking permits. You should be able to purchase one parking permit and be able to use them both at the uaf campus and CTC campus..
Sophomore,5,"I love the friendliness we get from professors, students, and faculty members. Everyone is helpful and understanding. I love Fairbanks climates! Reminds me of home"
Freshman,5,"I went to UAF for this summer program twice in the years 2016 and 2019 and it was a wonderful experience to get used of the way life was in the dorms and places to explore before I head there in less than a month for the spring semester. The staff there is friendly and trustworthy with everything, especially your information and help with anything you have to ask them about the campus and being away from home. You get to make friends there from around Alaska and other places, which is good in case you bump into them and they can help you with any future needs. I am excited to attend classes there because my family went there before me and they were successful with their lives after college."
Alum,5,"The University of Alaska - Fairbanks (UAF) institution is an excellent school. Traditional on-campus education is the best in Alaska.  UAF also has a very strong online presence with highly trained staff to support the professors who teach online. If you are looking for on-campus or online higher education, UAF is the best option in the State of Alaska."
Freshman,5,"I’m an online student of this school, so I can’t tell you much about what the campus is like. So far, I have had good professors that know what they’re doing."
Freshman,5,"It's been a great year so far. I can't wait to see what the next semester and years have ti come. All of the committees that are around campus are amazing. Equality is something big around the world right now, especially the US. The UAF environment is so welcoming when it comes to anything. Equality rights are fantastic."
Junior,5,"The University of Alaska operates 4 months out of the year in complete darkness, with an average of about 1-3 hours of sunlight a day from November to the end of January. The University offers ice climbing and ski passes to the local lift. In the Fall of 2017 and Spring of 2018, I worked with the student government, ASUAF, as a student senator. It was a wonderful opportunity to advocate for sustainability on campus, focused on food insecurity in Alaska and we developed an on-campus food pantry system where students can come get weekly groceries for free. 
Accessibility is important to me and in December of 2017, I purposed a bill where changing tables were issued into men, unisex, and women's restroom in every building on campus. 
The university has also removed all gendered pronouns from residence life handbooks and ASUAF handbooks in replacement with more inclusive terms such as they/them. The university allows students to take control and advocate for changes as needed on campus."
Junior,5,"Overall culture on campus is great, virtually all the professors, faculty, and staff are caring, professional, and generally great people!"
Alum,5,"I have had a few courses At UAF through distance education classes. They seems like a wonderful campus and the counselors do the best to answer any questions, as well as, find solutions for any issues. There is nothing I would change."
Niche User,5,"The University of Alaska Fairbanks is a great college. They really work with you and connect with you the best they can. If you don't know what you want to do yet, you can decide to do 'general studies (undeclared)' if needed. They are also very good financially."
Freshman,5,"my experience on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus has been absolutely amazing. the teachers and professors are very caring, fare, and academically involved with the students. Their is never a question that goes unanswered. I think that one thing that make this university amazing is that the students get to the opportunity to be involved with everything, including hiring new staff and evaluating the courses available. I think it is important that we know as students that the choices and decisions made are base on the minority vote of the student population. There is always staff somewhere nearby to be of assistance and point you in the right direction. This university really does care about the students on an academic and personal level."
Freshman,5,"I've been to the University of Alaska Fairbanks during the summer of 2017. Students from all over Alaska, including myself, participated, stuck through, and graduated the program called Rural Alaska Honors Institute; or RAHI. This amazing program allowed me to graduate one semester of college with 10 credits. I love that the university allows students like me to take advantage of this rewarding opportunity. One thing I would change is their bus route. Man was I tired walking to my professor's  chemistry lecture."
Sophomore,5,"All of the professors I have had so far have been amazing at teaching all of my classes. Everyone is so nice and its a really welcoming environment. The university has a lot to offer in ways of helping students, between the shuttles that will take you anywhere on campus to the writing, speech, and math labs that can help you with your classes. The University of Alaska Fairbanks is an amazing school and I am very happy to be going there."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Alaska Fairbanks is an excellent college, where you can have fun and get an education all at the same time. I have been going there for about two year now and think the professors are great. I have gained a plethora of knowledge. The curriculum is challenging and you have to study hard, but the reward pays off. I hope to continue my education there."
Freshman,5,"I loved that the professors were laid back. They give you time to turn in any missing assignments, correct exams, and are there to help in office hours when you need it. What I'd like to see change is the campus food, because sometimes I get tired of having or seeing the same food everyday."
Senior,5,My new advisor is amazing. He was able to actually help me graduate. I had issues with my previous advisor but once I changed departments I was finally about to short everything out and we are good to go now. It is a shame that I lost so many credits in the university transfer when UAA is supposedly a sister but it doesn't matter now that I'm gonna graduate.
Freshman,5,University of Alaska Fairbanks just might be on the top of the list of 1 of 3 universities in Alaska. I love the diversity of our school where people with unique backgrounds could join together and make our school an amazing environment. I would highly suggest UAF!
Senior,5,"I chose the University of Alaska Fairbanks because it was affordable and the community was amazing, welcoming and fun."
Freshman,5,I like that its mainly in one area. That we can basically walk everywhere. That its a smoke free campus.
Junior,5,Great college. Like it a lot. Neutral resource program is phenomenal. The classes are good. Good curriculum.
Sophomore,5,UAF is a great school.  There are many clubs that help everyone get involved and they have great programs for incoming freshman that help you get settled in quick.  All the RA's are great to talk to and to help with readjustment.  Everyone on campus is super nice and most teachers are very helpful during office hours.
Niche User,5,"It is an interesting school located in interior Alaska. No other state is as beautiful. It is tantalizing, and inspires awe. Get a glimpse of the magical land known as the last frontier; you won't be let down."
Senior,5,"America's Arctic University. #nanooknation. From Finance to Physics, UAF has a place for anyone brave enough for the cold winters. Students work together at UAF no matter their political views, religious views, gender identification or etc. Residence Life even has gender neutral housing.  Being just out side of town the University has miles of ski, bike and hiking trails. With a new life sciences building and engineers building, biology, chemistry and engineering labs are state of the art."
Junior,5,"I started college back in 1980 but due to many tragedies in our family I was forced to put my education on hold for many years. I have recently returned and I found that a lot of things have changed since I was here last...wow...technology is the big one. It is challenging yet rewarding when you can get on step and really start the learning process. The professors are very personable and understanding when it comes to ""something came up"" and they allow you time to make up your assignments. We have a lot of weather issues here in the winter so they just about have to be lenient. I love both campuses because they are conveniently located and have awesome sunny places to study and in our dark winters we really need the sun. I find that our college is very important to our economy here as well as good for the education of future generations of people who desire to live here."
Junior,5,"I am currently in the pipeline of the Rural Human Services moving on to my Bachelors in Social Work and I absolutely love it! I've graduated with honors getting my AA and intend on graduating with the same as I approach my Bachelors. Classes are cohort style with indigenous people from all over Alaska. 
Only change I'd like to see is more internship done in lower 48 reservations to see how our other villages/reservations are doing their work, so we can bring it to our smaller communities."
College Freshman,5,Everything in UAF is amazing
College Freshman,5,Everything in UAF is wonderful
College Junior,5,"in my field (arctic ecology/biology) this is a great school, and I'm confident about my future job prospects"
College Junior,5,A fantastic university in a beautiful natural setting very close to the Arctic Circle
Recent Alumnus,5,"Good  opportunity  great scaled models and there  is so much  opportunity 1 on 1 with proffers,  online it's just incredible !"
College Sophomore,5,There are so many ways to get part time jobs on campus. It great for traditional students
College Sophomore,5,I love this school and wish that there was more time to be there.
College Sophomore,5,I love how diverse my school is there is always something new to experience and I enjoy the small town feel as well
College Senior,5,"There is a variety of classes offered, but the general ed requirements make it difficult to take fun classes when you have to spend extra money on them."
College Senior,5,Never had a problem myself.
College Senior,5,"Applying was very easy, and you are very likely to be accepted."
College Junior,5,Many people are in varsity sports or part os sports teams
College Sophomore,5,I do not live on campus although when I am on campus grounds I feel very safe. Usually I hear that when their is suspicious activity going on it gets called in and campus police are all over it.
College Sophomore,5,"This is only my second year attending college and I have not gone to a sports game yet. I like sports but being a single mom and full time student, I haven't found the time to attend a sports event. But I hear that the different sports games are great and the gyms are very useful for athletes and non athletes."
College Sophomore,5,"Choosing and attending the University Of Alaska Fairbanks is something that I would not do over in life. I have such an amazing experience at UAF. I attended college right out of a very easy high school and did not have much experience with a lot of homework and the hard work. Luckily UAF had and has a lot of resources available such as the writing center, Rural student services, free math tutoring. Not only the resources but the Professors were great because they were willing to answer all my questions and make time to help me understand the work. One of my favorite experience is that UAF's RSS center has great get together's and everything is free there. I love the classes that I am able to take because I have a large amount of choices. Which makes everything just so much easier, being able to pick and choose which classes I want to take and with who."
College Senior,5,Great professors and academic adviser.
College Senior,5,My academic adviser is more than willing to set me up with an internship.
College Senior,5,I have only had one bad experience with a professor.
College Freshman,5,I really like this higher education school.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my experience at UAF.  From day one, everyone was very friendly and welcoming to me.  There are many clubs and organizations to be involved in such as Chi Alpha (a Christian youth group), aerial arts, Spanish Club, and French club.  I briefly joined aerial arts, and I am continually involved in Chi Alpha.  Without these two clubs, I would not have enjoyed my college experience as much.  It really gave me a group of friends with similar interests.  There was never a moment where I felt alone or out of place.  UAF is located in Fairbanks, so we get a full range of weather from 70ºF to -40ºF during the school year.  It definitely makes it interesting walking from class to class!  I am so happy and content with my choice that I would not change my process in choosing UAF."
College Sophomore,5,It's pretty good! This school is definitely career focused. There's a center to find jobs for their students and it's pretty credible. More than likely to get a job through them.
College Sophomore,5,"All the teachers are so helpful and passionate about their work. If you have a question, they are more than happy to help you understand the material. Always friendly and understanding."
College Freshman,5,Hands down the best best environment to succeed in your studies. You can lock yourself in a cubicle in the library in order to study or you can comfort yourself to other aspects of work.
College Freshman,5,"Since I am from a small town in California, attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks caused others to look down on me with displacement. After attending, I can say that it has been the single best decision that I have ever made. This University offers a chance to excel in your studies and research, all while enjoying Alaska's adventures."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school, and I love all of the great opportunities that I have been given by sttending. I get to be close to my friends and family, while meeting international students, and other locals I didn't know before.

The professors are ecouraging and if I ever have a problem, the support system has been there."
College Freshman,5,I got scholarships and grant that paid for most of my tuition
Junior,4,"I love the campus environment, everyone feels welcome. Some of the facilities could use some updating."
Freshman,4,I have been taking online classes through this university as I was in high school. It was very nice because it was not to overly stressful but yet it challenged me.
Freshman,4,My online experience has been very good. The professors communication is very good and very helpful. They are very willing to help. It is challenging academically but also not to hard to where it is overly stressful.
Niche User,4,"It was fine. I ended up dropping out, but that's on me to be honest. Now I work at McDonald's. Don't make my mistakes!"
Freshman,4,Buildings are very spaced out. Scheduling can be difficult if needed to travel from one end of campus to the other. School is very culturally diverse with students from a plethora of backgrounds.
Freshman,4,"This university has so many students from all over the world, it also has so many resources in every department and I enjoy the atmosphere of the school, and my classes I’ve taken are so unique."
Freshman,4,"The University is Alaska Fairbanks excels at providing students who desire further academic enrichment beyond the scope of their selected courses in terms of career opportunities and detailed information in specific fields of study to allow students a better idea for their future. If I could change it, I would make the campus larger and provide more organizations and clubs to increase the school’s low levels of student engagement."
Freshman,4,"The University of Fairbanks is a very laid back, inviting school. That being said, it is very cold and not for everyone."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the environment and diversity. There's a lot of different people and you get to witness a lot of different things.
Freshman,4,"So far it's been pretty good. My classes are a lot easier than I expected, however, I definitely get the feel that professors don't care about you much. Obviously, that's fine, because I know that they're busy, but it's definitely tiring to have to go to classes where the professors put little effort into them. However, there is way more freedom here, and I love that I can build my own degree if I want to."
Senior,4,I liked how close the people seemed to be. During the winter the walking outside is not ideal because of how cold it gets during the winter but there is nothing to fix that issue.
Alum,4,"I loved the sense of community here. I always felt that the student body, faculty, and staff were all in it together!"
Sophomore,4,Very good school if you want teachers that are approachable and willing to help you both inside and outside of class.
Freshman,4,I am excited to continue my education at UAF is the sciences. I have had some great experiences already and can't wait for that to continue.
Freshman,4,Overall good experience. The engineering program is very prominent. There is a subway on campus what accepts meal plan money.
Freshman,4,"Even though the food can be pretty terrible at times, the people and opportunities here at UAF make it all worth it.  You are connected to the life on campus and have amazing opportunities to learn from some of the best and get the great Alaskan experience."
Alum,4,"The professors were amazing and incredibly helpful. It was obvious they loved their job and they were passionate about helping students. However, the campus struggled to maintain its budget and raised tuition in the years that I was there."
Freshman,4,"UAF is a great school with lots to do and explore while getting the best education. They offer something for everyone whether that be sports, clubs or just fun campus events to attend. UAF professors are really great, in my experience they are very willing to help you in any way you need."
Niche User,4,"I enjoy the environment of Fairbanks Alaska. There are many activities to participate in year round. The campus is close to pretty much everything and is well kept. The student activities are endless, and can be almost anything."
Senior,4,Able to take classes via distance education. Application is easy and registration for classes is easy upon advisors approval. Everything is easy to access via website. Classes can be either taken independently or with others on a semester basis. Books can be ordered online. Overall I am impressed with this college given I am a single parent and it works with my schedule.
Sophomore,4,"This is a pretty average college to attend. If you're an engineering student then this is one of the best places to attend in the country. If you can survive the harsh and cold winters in the coldest city in the US, then you can definitely achieve success at UAF!"
Senior,4,"I have been attending UAF through their distant education program and I love our it; only flaw? The proctors exams because I have to drive 45 minutes out of town, on top of the gas I use, I pay for the proctor as well."
Sophomore,4,"I have never had a problem where I couldn't find the help necessary to fix it. For my first year of college I was able to take classes at another University of Alaska while  still fully pursuing my chosen major for Fairbanks. The campus itself and the area surrounding the campus is beautiful, even in the winter."
Senior,4,I really like that UAF is a close community. There is a lot to do around campus to help with the cold and dark winter months. Professors are personable and want you to succeed. The only thing I would change is that there is not many options on times and days to take a class. You have to register for a class whenever it is offered that semester.
Freshman,4,I love UAF! It was a lot of Natives on campus so I wont get homesick. I love the scenery especially the sunset. The classes are flexible and the food is amazing because its all I eat and anything I choose. I recommend this university to many alaskan natives.
Senior,4,"This school excels at the sciences, though most people don't believe the math department is up to par. The student population is an interestingly weird one. I think that just might be Alaska talking, as Alaska attracts some of the oddest weirdest people. Not necessarily a bad thing. I love a good amount of the professors. They love what they are doing. There is not very much to do in Fairbanks. Having a car is vital if you want to get around. The buses will work in a pinch but they can be unreliable. If you want to have fun while you are here, get into winter sports. UAF gives you free admission into nearby SkiLand!"
Freshman,4,I really enjoy attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks because It is  really great campus and has a good sense of community. the teacher seem pretty good so far. The dorms and food are okay. One bad thing about it is that it is very cold here the -20's are not at all uncommon and it can get down to -40 occasionally.
Freshman,4,"I moved to Fairbanks a few years ago looking to engage in my community. Lately in my academic career I've been searching for a way to make it as a non-traditional student. University of Alaska Fairbanks advising worked with me to get things rolling in a way that is condusive to my lifestyle. For people who are interested in the Arctic life, a thriving art community, and a forward thinking college town, I would highly recommend UAF."
Alum,4,"I liked the small-town feel, where many people are connected through mutual friendships/classes/interests. The campus and community were diverse though with constant new faces as well. New students coming and going at the university, as well as new faces coming and going from the military bases, made  for a fun and adventurous experience."
Freshman,4,"Good staff! Very nice class sizes! And plenty to do! All at an affordable rate! I am truly happy that i chose University of Alaska Fairbanks it offers a wide range of courses to help prepare you whether it is a liberal art or a technical degree, you get the most out of your experience."
Junior,4,UAF is a decent school if you can get in with in state tuition or the Western Undergraduate Exchange(WUE). I wouldn't suggest it to students that would pay out of state tuition primarily. It's simply not worth it.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed my first year there. The teachers seemed competent enough. There were a lot of different  students from all over. The campus is easy enough to get around in. There really isn't a lot to do in Fairbanks but that's fine with me.
Sophomore,4,UAF has amazing staff and I can feel like they truly care for their students. However some of the class structures are not as enjoyable as others. I thought I would be done with flipped classrooms in high school but professors still have the need to provide it as the only option for their classes and It's quite infuriating because I learn by getting taught the subject.
Freshman,4,"This university keeps things real, they know they're not the largest school, but they also aren't the smallest."
Sophomore,4,The accounting program here is incredible. I love all the of the opportunities I have to better my soft skills as well as develop my professional life. There is a lot of diversity here and it really feels like home.
Freshman,4,I like that is is a local school and it has some great programs offered. All the professors I have had have been great.
Sophomore,4,"Great student to faculty ratio, and hands on instructors! Would like to see better supplies and equipment"
Senior,4,"I absolutely love many of the services offered by UAF, such as the Rural Student Services who offer help with academic advising, connecting with groups, free food on campus, and tutoring. I also appreciate Student Support Services, who offer assistance to first generation college students, low income students, and students with disabilities. They also offer tutoring, academic advising, scholarships, and free food and refreshments."
Works Here,4,"The University of Alaska Fairbanks has one of the most diverse group of students around. From race, to culture, to religion UAF has a bit of it all. Makes a great atmosphere to learn not only about our studies, but also the world through other students. The thing I'd like to see change most is the amount of sexual assault that happens on campus. Which is shockingly high for the volume of students living on campus."
Senior,4,All the faculty are really helpful and seem like they care about your success. Career services are also really helpful for looking at resumes and cover letters.
Senior,4,"I love UAF! Coming from a community college, it definitely feels more like a community, which is nice. Of course there is no perfect place, so there are things that could be better. I like being involved in campus activities, but I wish there were sororities and fraternities that students could join. But, overall I'm glad I came to Fairbanks for university!"
Graduate Student,4,"My graduate level classes have brought together students from a wide variety of backgrounds, with stron academic abilities. The variety in interests resulted in a much more rounded educational experience."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Alaska Fairbanks is a wonderful school for people with strong character. The location is very unique, with winter temperatures as low as negative forty degrees Fahrenheit and daylight as short as four hours. This subarctic environment is ideal for hiking and skiing on campus and in the surrounding wilderness. Full-time students are given free passes to a local alpine ski area. Professors are friendly and invested in the success of their students. The science and engineering programs are some of the best in the country and provide many opportunities for research and job training. Intramural sports are a popular activity.  The Honors Program is recommended, it allows students to enroll in advanced classes with a small group of peers and offers scholarships and counseling. Some people find Fairbanks to be a challenging environment. The cold and darkness can lead to severe seasonal depression. Sexual harassment is unfortunately fairly common."
Freshman,4,For me UAF has been great. The classes are interesting and enjoyable and the professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. Campus life tends toward studious. The is a variety of extracurriculars. If you are living on campus the weekends are quiet.
Freshman,4,My experience in the University of Alaska Fairbanks is quite amazing to be part of it. The professors of this university are very nice and helpful. What I like about this university is they do so  much for the students who need anything they need to ask for.
Freshman,4,"The Niche website is extremely helpful to me on my path to gain a higher education. It would be nice to see an improvement in the application process, though I do appreciate the amount of scholarships available throughout the website. "
Alum,4,"I loved going here as the classes are smaller and the instruction is very one on one. When I took German, my teacher made the class dynamic and engaging. The math department had amazing tutoring and even their online classes had live assistance if needed. "
Recent Alumnus,4,There are people from all over and you never know who you might meet or where they may be from.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have never seen or heard of anyone on campus using drugs, and have never had to deal with drunk students."
College Freshman,4,The residential life is great here.
College Freshman,4,"The pool, student gyms, and trails are amazing."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience so far at UAF is great, and I wouldn't trade it for anything else!"
College Freshman,4,So far I have had more interviews about jobs than I've had at home! The career options are open and there are so many for students to try!
College Freshman,4,"Good matching process, but the room could be a little more spacious but I'm getting what I need done and that's all that matters!"
College Freshman,4,"From the time that I've been there, I have already felt the positive energy that radiates off the students and faculty. They do all that they can to make you feel welcome and secure at school, and I couldn't be happier about making this decision!"
College Junior,4,I forgot to submit my application but they let me after the due date.
College Junior,4,"Generally I feel safe on campus, but I'm usually not here too late."
College Junior,4,"I don't participate in athletics here, but I attend the hockey games and the university team is awesome!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"UAF is dominated by atypical students, older and non-traditional."
College Junior,4,"The swimming pool is too small for the locker room and the gym is too big for the locker room. The food here is great. The cafeteria is massive, they have a all you can eat dinner for 10$ with a wide variety selection of food. Overall people are respectable in your typical school settings. Stay on track and you'll do great. I would choose this school again because the in state low tuition. There are only to universities in the state to choose from. This campus sits on a hill away from traffic and is huge and there is a lot of history involved and there is a lot of activities for student to take part of."
Sophomore,2,The college is dying. There are fewer and fewer courses being offered for many departments and the University is struggling to keep funding from the state. It is having a direct impact on students because required courses are not being offered.
Sophomore,2,The views are great but when it comes to academics and funding it's not good. Majors are being put completely online. Food service is terrible. Just all in all not the greatest experience.
Sophomore,2,"Recent budget cuts have made lots of students weary of continuing education here. Many programs have already been cut. Tuition price is great, in comparison to other colleges. My experience with some professors have been quite unsatisfactory, but I have also met some of the greatest professors that are willing to go above and beyond to see you succeed. The quality of the education I've received here taking general classes is low. 

Although, I was apart of the Early Childhood Education program, which is where I had the best experience with teachers, coursework, advising, etc. You definitely need to allow yourself to find the right people that are willing to help you with the hard stuff.

Definitely do other research on UAF to help ensure this is the place for you!"
Sophomore,2,UAF doesn't care about your education or well being they are in it for the money and you can tell. The only way to get straight answers from anyone is to drive and walk to what ever office you need and talk to someone face to face.
Senior,2,"This University is nothing to get excited about. The academic environment is not outstanding and there is not an atmosphere to achieve high standards. There are some good professors and some bad professors, it's just the luck of the draw when you sign up for classes. Almost the entire school year is winter, which can be difficult leaving you very unmotivated and apathetic towards your education. There is little to no student life involvement, everyone keeps to themselves and the University does not involve the students well in clubs, activities, and student events. There’s a new food center but the food is not good. The school is very inexpensive, low tuition costs, which makes it more appealing to go here. The dorms are average, shared bathrooms for every floor, mid sized rooms, but there is no student community within them. Fairbanks is not an exciting place and has no feeling of a college town. There are not many athletic teams here, and the few that there are aren't very good."
College Freshman,2,There are only two fraternities and no sororities.
College Freshman,2,"I think we have one fraternity, and you can't live there. So it's not really what most people would call Greek Life, but it's still a pretty cool experience for any student who wants to get involved in something like that!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Everything  costs so much even for students , gym racquetball wall climbing and the water is contaminated  yet they continue to serve the fountains sending emails out saying  drink at your own risk!"
College Junior,2,I never get any offers.
College Senior,2,It seems like  alot of stuff is just thrown out there with no concern about whether the students understand it.
College Senior,2,"Now that I'm getting ready to graduate, I'm seeing just how unprepared I am to enter the work force."
College Senior,2,"A little bit of everything, but only a very little bit."
College Sophomore,2,I don't really know how to describe it but someone gets sexually assaulted like once a year on campus. But I guess you can't really get around it when you're by yourself and someone meaning to harm you. Good things Alaskans have the right to bare arms.
College Senior,2,"The courses I was interested in at this school are very limited. Being a computer science student, most of the interesting subjects had only one class on the subject. For example, there's the one introductory AI class, and the two classes on computer graphics. Also, keep in mind that if you come here for computer science, you need to be doing lots of self-guided work outside the classroom. The classes teach the needed basics, but you could go through three years of the curriculum and never know how to get a program out of an IDE. There is a masters program offered, but you will be in the same class alongside the students taking the basic class. You just need to do a presentation each week, I believe. About half of the teachers in the department seem cool and care, but the rest do not. The math teachers are good though."
College Freshman,2,"So far, the food that I have had on campus is very good. However, I do not like that I cannot get a meal plan through financial aid for the summers."
College Freshman,2,"I have not lived off campus other than living with my parents, but I have friends that live in apartments off campus. From what I've heard, it is extremely difficult to find a place off campus and it can be expensive. The idea of moving off campus scares me a bit, honestly. The apartment my friends rent is surprisingly nice. It isn't particularly close to campus, nor far away, but it is quite expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"I miss the friendly financial aid advisors in Juneau Alaska. Here its kinda the complete opposite, although they do try help as much as they can."
College Freshman,2,"Not many. If there are, no one hears about them"
College Junior,2,I only know of two fraternities and they are not that big. I do know that they want to be involved in as much as they can be though.
College Senior,2,"dirty, tiny, and very close proximity (wickersham)"
College Senior,2,ridiculous prices for garbage places. it is nearly 4 times the cost of rent here for a place that is falling down than it is anywhere else in the lower 48
College Senior,2,The curriculum is pretty standard but the professors are lacking. In the mechanical department there are only 2 teachers who speak english in a way that can be understood easily. The rest however have such thick accents that you spend more time trying to figure out what they said instead of understanding the material.
College Senior,2,the campus goes a bit overboard on the visitation in the dorms.  The fact that I am 30 years old and have to check in with an 18 year old to have a friend over to study is a bit ridiculous.
College Senior,2,"I was told by the financial aid employee before moving 4000 miles away from home that pretty much everyone who applies for scholarships gets them. She also went on to say that they have so much scholarship money that they cant ever seem to give it all away because not enought people apply. Now, going into my final year I have applied every year with good grades and not a single scholarship."
College Junior,2,Not many scholarships are given out unless you specifically talk to a professor and practically beg them to give you money
College Sophomore,2,"Most parking lots on campus require a permit. Otherwise you'll be fined. Even if you work on campus, you have to get a permit."
College Freshman,2,"It is just so cold in the winter, but it's manageable.  In the spring/summer it's almost too hot!"
College Freshman,2,I think that the school is too strict regarding visitations in dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"Every one is white or Native Alaskan. The white people don't like the Native's that much because they say the Natives have a drinking problem (yeah ok.. but the university has a pub on campus and a bar down the street) anyway...The only time I have seen black people was in the spring semester, in the winter I never see them. The Natives are cool and they always feed you with good traditional food (ok I like it some may or may not). Some Spanish people are here  but not many. The international students have good food and they are happy all the time (if you can, you should get to know some. So you can eat good food an be happy as well). Everyone is mostly republicans they are the ones with the money but you will never tell because no one flaunts it up here. But the hippies are the best people on campus and the real traditional elders and Natives are the best people to get to know. because you learn the true Alaskan ways and you learn how to survive when its -56F. The other people just drink and party...that gets old after a while."
College Sophomore,2,"The coldest I have seen is -56F on campus and the hottest I have ever seen on campus is 96F. Basically you have winter and summer up here. Its very dry so don't freak out about the cold, just bring some fur and good lotion and you will be alright. O and the mosquitos are the size of a quarter and they have fur on them!!! (mind blown)"
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus housing definitely could be better. I live about 7 miles away where I have to go through town, and it takes some time to get to campus. The price is really high, but they allow dogs (which is rare), so I am willing to pay a little more for my Abigail. I would love to live closer to campus, however there hasn't been any good prospects in months. Most of the apartments that I have seen available are pricey, plus you have to pay for most utilities. I only pay for electricity in mine. The landlord is sometimes a pain, but I've never heard of one that's not. The only help that I have looked at from school I papers posted on message board around campus, but that's it."
College Freshman,2,I really don't think there are even a handful of Greek/sorrority houses here. I feel like its kind of overrated for us here at UAF. Its not about being in a sorority here its about enjoying the outdoors and doing what you love.
College Freshman,2,"Not many spots, and they fill up quick."
College Freshman,2,"There are only two places on campus to get food from, and it is basically the same food everyday."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The only scholarships have a due date of Feb. 14th, which is pretty darn early and there is no other financial aid through the school. The Financial Aid office can also be really frustrating because they bounce you back and forth between them and the Bursar, which is really frustrating especially if you have to keep waiting in lines over and over and over."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have lived on campus all five years I have attended UAF, and sometimes you really feel like it is not worth what you pay for it. The policies change in subtle and weird ways and costs go up despite the rooms all still being tiny, dirty, broken and very low quality. Most of the furniture is very old, the carpets look chewed in many places, and most improvements end up not benefiting anybody, such as automatic lights in the dorm rooms which turn on if you roll over in your sleep and then turn off if you sit still studying for too long. Students are obviously not taken into account in these sorts of processes, and it shows. The process for getting housing is also out of date and if you want a particular room you don't already have you had best wait in a line which starts days in advance to sign up for that room. If you don't get it, the waiting list is an option but don't expect to be moved to the room you want until finals week or even the next semester. There is a cleaning service for the shared bathrooms and main rooms but they never clean very well or very often despite being in the building for eight hours every day, so showers, toilets and floors are regularly gross and bathroom products such as toilet paper, paper towels and hand soap which are provided by the university are irregularly replenished at best."
College Sophomore,2,There are no restaurants. It's Fairbanks!!
College Sophomore,2,"Teeny tiny places. The cost is through the roof of the small apartment. Utilities are remarkably high. A lot of places near by are ""dry cabins"". That means without running water."
College Junior,2,"The winter is long and cold, but it's Alaska."
College Freshman,2,"I used to take the shuttle bus down the UAF hill to catch the bus and they were usually on time and kind-hearted individuals. City bus is a whole different story, they would be late and sometimes arrive before they were scheduled so I would have to wait till the next pick up time. OUCH in -30 (ALASKA)"
College Freshman,2,"First off, I worked at Campus Cache which is a convenient store for students and it was located directly below the college dorms. I would converse with the students and get to know them on a personal level because they were my customers. With that being said, I have noticed that allot (if not everybody) smokes marijuana. On the contrary, the students do attempt to conceal the fact (especially when UAF enforcement is around) that they smoke. I have been told that they would even smoke in their dorms! "
College Freshman,2,"I have yet to receive Financial Aid because I have not been accepted to UAF yet but I have received my paperwork that explains how much I will receive. The application process was tedious and over bearing at times. The reason behind is because I didn't have the necessary information and had to hunt for it (Mother's income tax information). All in all, it is a tough process but well worth it because it will help me pay for school."
College Freshman,2,"As an employee for Nana Management Services, I have found that the food we prepare for students is average. There is a variety for them to choose from and we are required to maintain food quality and safety."
College Senior,2,"Nothing is cheap. A lot of places with no running water. Almost no one wraps utilities into their rent, so its always a gamble. Unreliable internet unless you're on campus."
College Student,2,"Parking is a total and complete mess, the parking lot is either completely full or you have to park in mud."
College Senior,2,I think it's pretty average. It isn't any worse or any better than the next school.
College Senior,2,"There a number of different types of parking lots. There are some buildings that are much further away from the main campus, and they have their own parking lots, with plug ins for the winter months. Those are A+, close to the building and prepared for all weather. Nearer to main campus, there are parking lots very far away, and travel to campus is dependent on busses. That, or a very long, cold walk uphill. Those parking lots have plugins. But the closer you get to campus and the main buildings for parking, you have to pay per half hour, there are no plugins, and its impossible to find a parking spot."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the bars are so far away there really isn't a nightlife at the university. The university police patrol night and day so parties at the university barely happen either.
College Freshman,2,"The Lola Tilly Commons dining hall is honestly not the best place to dine at. I have heard of many reports of unhealthy, disgusting findings in people's food which has now become rare due to stronger management. Many people try to avoid having to pay for a meal plan. Unfortunately, everyone has to buy a meal plan unless they are a junior/senior/graduate student. This dining hall has its good days, but also its days of nightmare and disappointment."
College Senior,2,The dining hall has mediocre food with not many options for students who have special diets. Management is rude and the place is usually not very clean. There are other options for food on campus but most have terrible hours and are unhealthy.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is small, and a lot of students come from off campus to get to class. This means that it's best to get to campus at least twenty minutes early so you have time to find a parking spot and walk to class. There are shuttles that make loops around campus, so if you need to get to one of the buildings farther from lower campus you can take one of them. Most all classes are held in lower campus, and it's usually just a quick walk between buildings. Day/week permits can be purchased from vending machine-like stations, as well as semester/year permits from the Parking Services offices."
College Freshman,2,"The housing has some perks, but mainly the furniture is already beat up and pretty worn down. My biggest complaint is that they charge you for minor fixes, that never get fixed, so really it is another way for University to suck more money out of the students."
College Senior,2,"It always feels like you have to twist arms, but it is there. Unfortunately it is the arm twisting that always makes it feel like it isn't even worth the struggle, and no one really seems willing to ever make it easier."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus has limited appeal.  The Student Rec Center is nice, but has pretty limited equipment, and the pool is in an entirely separate building.  The campus is covered with snow most of the year, but even during the spring and summer, there are not many outdoor areas to study or hang out in.  The Wood Center is noisy.  The buildings are grey concrete and very unattractive."
College Freshman,2,"Due to harsh weather, transportation, which really is not too bad, becomes inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,"though i do not see the drugs, i do hear about the drugs or atleast the pot smokers. i do not do drugs myself so its not something i have surrounded in my social life or that i can notice about others on campus. I guess its all about you know and hang out with, so its not a big scene."
College Freshman,2,In most of the classes professors seem to have a low tolerance for students using there laptops or any sort of electronic even for class work or not taking. which i find alittle sumbersome in todays inovative and technological society.
College Freshman,2,"many of the professors are very understanding in remember what it was like to be a college student working full time and are willing to work with us (students) on our schedules as well as our assignments, and helping us one on one to better understand."
College Sophomore,2,"Divers population for the most part. Somewhat lacking in African American and Hispanic population, mainly Caucasian and Alaskan Native, with a good amount of Chinese and Indian populations. Dress is dominated by the cold winters so trendy and classy styles are less prevalent. Campus social life can be slow if allowed to be. Campus guys/girls ratios and looks aren't necessarily attractive or unattractive, but are mostly balanced."
College Freshman,2,"I have lived in Fairbanks for my whole life, and as I grow up the local atmosphere becomes less exciting and more mundane. The winter's freezing weather takes away almost all activities for people my age, except for drinking and drug use. Since I do not participate in those things, the only remaining activities are expensive and redundant."
Niche User,1,They were not helpful with disability services . They don’t explain things in a more timely manner.especially with hoe they are extremely rude.
Senior,1,"Lack of appeal attracts sub-par professors. Budget reductions led to shutting down of the career center, so expect no help finding internships or employment after graduation.  Beware the retention and graduation rates - they speak for themselves. Under investigation for Title 9 violations. Administration at odds with the student body. Long, dark winters lead to depression."
College Senior,1,"Courses vary wildly in quality across departments and especially between professors. It may take 6+ years to earn a degree by taking the right instructors at the right times.  Both semesters are very difficult emotionally because of the dark and cold, and many students do not make it out alive."
College Senior,1,"If you are thinking of coming here, DON'T.  I wish I could have the last 5 years of my life back. A dreadful place, awful administration, the worst professors, and a prevalent atmosphere of despair."
College Sophomore,1,"None, that i know of."
College Junior,1,We do not have a greek life on campus but we have a combined sorority and fraternity that is made up of the honor society and that is the only way you can join is if you are in the honor program.
College Sophomore,1,"UAF has one co-ed Greek organization.  They're almost unknown about, and personally I haven't heard much about them.  At a minimum, they participate in a UAF tradition, Starvation Gulch where teams make huge structure of plywood and burn them down.  Besides this tradition, I haven't seen them anywhere else."
College Student,1,"was told I applied for FASFA and that is all I can do, I can't apply for any scholarships or anything else."
College Sophomore,1,Way too many parties and noise
College Freshman,1,I don't think we have any
College Sophomore,1,It's horrible. You HAVE to have a meal plan if you live on campus and it's not worth the enormous amount of money for it. Would not recommend.
College Freshman,1,There is definitely not enough parking spaces available.
College Sophomore,1,"I didn't know we had a Greek life until I saw my friend doing some volunteer work... Its not like the movies folks! Only one chapter up here an I forgot there name, but in anchorage they have AKA and some others I think."
College Sophomore,1,"ok the first week of school when your sweet parents are here to help you move in they offer the best presentation of the foods and it tastes great....but when your parents leave.. its a S@#T hole. Its a all you can eat hot mess. The manager micro manages everyone even students.... she will harass you if you select to many apples to eat..(im a vegan, the only thing to eat is a salad bar an possibly fruit/ if it looks good) an if you live on campus the university MAKES you buy a meal plan :/ during spring break everything is closed even the Wood center. So that pricy meal plan you just spent doesn't help when its spring break, winter break or summer ..."
College Sophomore,1,"When you first come here your happy because every one is drinking and going to the pub on campus or to the marlin down the street or in Cutler where the house parties are, but after 2 years with out a car to go places and your friends graduate and everyone is STILL drinking it gets pretty old and boring."
College Freshman,1,NEGATIVE 40 is the worst!!!!
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,They actually don't have my major which is why I'm transferring.
College Sophomore,1,Garbage. !!! You pay a to. Of money that is separate from tuition just so you can park down a hill far from everything and oh there is never any open parking spots down there anyway. And!! So much for finding a spot to plug in you car. Because you know it Fairbanks and you have to do it!!
College Freshman,1,Its Alaska so its bound to be cold..the tempters get down to 50 below.

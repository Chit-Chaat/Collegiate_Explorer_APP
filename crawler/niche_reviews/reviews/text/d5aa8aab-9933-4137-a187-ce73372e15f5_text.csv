Freshman,5,"Kansas Wesleyan is a great four year school. It is relatively small which makes it very easy to get to know your classmates and your professors. The sports programs at Kansas Wesleyan are also pretty talented as they have some of the best teams out of their conference.The town of Salina, which is where KW is located is also nice. As one of the bigger cities in Kansas, there are always plenty of things to do off campus."
Niche User,5,Being on campus allows students to feel at home and meet friendly faces. Every faculty member or student on campus seems excited to be there and enjoys reaching out to those who are on a campus visit. Coaches are some of the most supportive people I have ever met and are concerned with their players reaching their highest potential.
Sophomore,5,I've had an awesome experience so far at KWU. All the teachers and other staff have been so helpful.
Sophomore,5,Kansas Wesleyan makes you feel at home and welcomes everyone with open arms. The professors are the best part you can basically go to any of their offices anytime and they are not afraid to help you.
Sophomore,5,Personally I would like to see cheaper tuition even though I know it’s a private school and that’s not going to happen. Maybe we’ll see tuition stop rising.
Junior,5,"Kansas Wesleyan has truly become my home away from home. I love every aspect of the school and my professors. They take the time to get to know you as a person and your interests. The campus is absolutely beautiful, peaceful and safe."
Sophomore,5,It is comparable to a big high school.  Everyone knows everyone and makes going to school away from home way easier for everyone involved.
Niche User,5,I love the campus and the environment. I'm planning on playing basketball there and the coaches are great and they girls are really accepting.
Freshman,5,I just love how Kansas Wesleyan is so diverse and really cares about students succeeding in their chosen field! Its awesome I wouldn't change anything.
Niche User,5,"I went on a college visit to this school. It was an amazing experience, and it made me more and more excited to be a college student soon. They had everything I could ever imagine on this little and home-like campus. From an all you can eat cafeteria, to criminal justice. It was perfect. They also have an AMAZING music program, with wonderful instructors. I have never been to a college and saw so much potential for myself. This school made me thrilled."
Niche User,5,The campus is breathtaking. The people are extremely nice. I love everything about it. My favorite part is the little pond/fountain in the front. The football field is fairly new and VERY nice. They are also one of the powerhouses of the KCAC Conference. 
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe here.
College Sophomore,5,The professors really care about you passing their class and they'll be with you every step of the way if you need it.
College Sophomore,5,I am a member of the spirit squad and the athletic department here is wonderful.
College Sophomore,5,"This school is very family oriented, so once you come here you have a second family to depend on."
College Freshman,5,"Salina has a variety of off-campus restaurants to choose from.  There is a convenience store down the street from the dorms, which provides students with cheap, late-night snacks and drinks.  Many students will walk down there late at night or during the day to satisfy their hunger.

There is a plethora of cheap fast-food places within short driving distance from KWU.  This includes Taco Bell, McDonald's, Starbucks, and a home-owned restaurant called Bogey's.  Numerous students choose Taco Bell or Bogey's if they have money for extra meals.  Bogey's provides American staples such as hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, corn dogs, and delicious shakes as well as excellent customer service.  It is definitely a favorite among the student population.

Next to cheap fast food, Salina also has more expensive restaurants such as Daimaru, Applebees, and Longhorn Steakhouse.  However, there are numerous and popular home-owned places such as Martinelli's.  Martinelli's is a home-owned Italian restaurant in Salina's downtown district.  It provides excellent Italian cuisine and has old-time jazz music playing during it's open hours.  It's not terribly expensive, so students wanting a more quality meal usually go to Martinelli's.  It is also across from Salina's historic Stiefel Theatre, so it gets a lot of business from the Stiefel's customers.  Places like Martinelli's and Applebees often get KWU students as part-time employees, so restaurants and KWU often have connections to each other."
College Freshman,5,i live in the dorm-
College Freshman,5,they care  about whats best for the student
College Freshman,5,very good- grants and scholarships available- no problems
College Freshman,5,very good-   good selection-  hours suite college life style-
Junior,4,Online during the second half of the Spring 2020 semester due to COVID-19. Professors were very helpful with communication and uploading lectures online. Class work was easily completed through use of Canvas.
Junior,4,"Kansas Wesleyan is a great place with great opportunity. Small class sizes with plenty of resources and professors always willing to help. 15+ athletic programs for people looking to pursue college athletics as well as fine arts programs. Only change I would like to see is a decrease in tuition but the price is understandable considering  KWU being a small, private school."
Freshman,4,"During the Corona outbreak, classes were moved online. Classes still remained very convenient and getting contact with the professors if needed was no problem."
Sophomore,4,"I like the university by how personable and exciting the experience is as a student.  The university staff and students in leadership like to involve everyone in everything they can with opportunities for work, events, and volunteering.  it truly feels like a community.  They have helped me with scholarships and I have enjoyed conversing with each staff member I have met.  The environment is one of unity and the community around the school is incredibly supportive and wonderful."
Sophomore,4,"The diversity and the acceptance of different cultures. Everyone is friendly and puts in effort to get to know each other. The Professors do a wonderful job on one-on-one with all of their students. Something that could be changed would have to be that the dorm kitchens because they do not have ovens, so the students had to just stick to microwaveable foods if they did not get anything from the cafe"
Sophomore,4,"Haven't attend school yet , but from what I seen on my visit I'm going to like it very much. The school academics looks pretty good and their athletics are great. I stayed there for a weekend and got to hang with some of the students. everybody around you brings a good vibe around."
Niche User,4,"I am a senior in high school planning to attend there in the fall. I am going to be playing volleyball there as well. I have spent a lot of time on campus, and I have always been impressed with everything. They also communicate very well, I never have to wait very long for a response to an email."
Sophomore,4,"I chose Kansas Wesleyan for many reasons. The small school atmosphere gives you that one on one experience with professors. The community is behind the University 100% it is just this family feeling when you walk around campus. I automatically felt that when i took a visit here to play ball, i fell in love immediately and i knew i wanted to be a coyote. The athletic facilities are top notch and the city itself has plenty to offer."
College Sophomore,4,"Really enjoy the courses I want to take, which are pertaining to my major. Class that are forced are not interesting to me."
College Sophomore,4,"My professors are great at making me think towards the future. They let me know about graduate school, internships, and any other options I have."
College Sophomore,4,Sports are extremely popular here. I'm just not an athlete so you don't fit in as well.
College Sophomore,4,"I really love this school, especially the professors. Tuition is extremely high though and it only increases the longer you stay."
College Freshman,4,"The services on campus are amazing. You can tell when you go to a certain part, that there is someone there to help you"
College Freshman,4,The faculty really enforce the rules around here. They make sure you aren't doing anything illegal or potentially dangerous.
College Freshman,4,"The coaches care about your school. Your education is their priority. So if you're slacking behind in classes, be prepared to do a couple of miles while studying instead of having actual practice."
College Freshman,4,"You have to unlock so many doors in the dorms. However, students tend to prop the doors open and anyone in the main stair case can access your hall. However I feel rather safe at night but I stay aware of others around me just in case."
College Freshman,4,It's a wonderful time to be a music major at this school. The professors here are so talented and they get you involved in professional programs early on.
College Freshman,4,"Professors reply to my emails so quickly. I love the professors that are involved in my major, you can literally go to them if you have any problem even if i was their former student."
College Freshman,4,I love that it's close by the main campus. It is annoying that we have to send complaints if it gets too loud rather than it being taken care of..and then nothing changes. But I get to live there for free so it's not bad.
College Freshman,4,I really like the school however it's so hard to find information or get help because their website is so confusing and they have so many offices. It's both a good and bad thing. Another problem I've had is that there were topics that weren't explained to their fullest and I had to go on a wild goose chase.
College Freshman,4,"I love being at the campus and the courses are fun to take, but challenging too."
College Freshman,4,being able to visit the gym and watching the games are a huge part of my personal involvement in the school
College Freshman,4,I enjoy this campus because I can play my instruments as well as learning my major
College Freshman,4,"Kansas Wesleyan is a dry school and a tobacco and drug-free campus.  KWU is extremely strict on drug and alcohol use, and all faculty and staff uphold this rule.  While away on school functions, professors enforce this rule.  Students, even over the age of 21, cannot have alcohol while off-campus on school trips. 

In the dorms, this policy is upheld as well.  If someone is suspected of having alcohol or illicit drugs in their room, the entire hall is inspected either during the day or late at night.  Sometimes dogs are brought in to search the room.  If this happen, refrigerators and closets can be searched.  Otherwise, room inspections are rather lenient.

Dorm visitations are rather lenient.  Most resident assistants (RA's) are lenient on this policy.  The rule with visitation in most halls is that it's okay until you get caught or make too much noise.  People can have their friends stay overnight as long as they don't make too much noise.  This is the experience I've had with my RA's.  

Overall, Kansas Wesleyan is a great campus and is strict with some policies and rather lenient with others.  This makes for a safe campus with a great student life."
College Freshman,4,"I don't have much experience with the financial aid office at KWU, but I have received scholarships for my room because of my high grades and it covers my room, but not my board.  I have, however, asked questions from the financial aid office and received prompt and courteous service.  The financial aid office is extremely helpful to students and most everything goes over smoothly."
College Freshman,4,"The housing at Kansas Wesleyan is pretty great.  There are three dormitories: Pfeiffer, Wilson, and Wesley.  I've stayed in Wilson and Pfeiffer, and out of the two I definitely prefer Pfeiffer.  It's the all-girls dorm on campus, and the only dormitory to provide individual bathrooms.  There's not a lot of social activity in Pfeiffer, which is all right with me.  The rooms in Pfeiffer are of decent quality, with some flaws.  They don't seem to be cleaned regularly over the summer, and every once in a while there's mold.  However, during the school year the maintenance staff provides quality upkeep of the dormitories and requests for fixing things are promptly granted.

The housing process is of top notch quality, too.  Forms for housing are distributed in mid-April every year, and are easy to fill out.  You select which dorm you prefer, and if you want a certain person as your roommate you list their name.  However, roommate preferences must be mutual between two people.  Otherwise, you list qualities about yourself such as cleanliness, if you are an early bird or a night owl, and how loud you are.  It's a simple process.  To get into the all-girls' or all-boys' dorm (Pfeiffer and Wesley) you have to be above freshmen status and promptly return your housing form.  The dorms are pretty filled up during the school year, as we have a large population of on-campus students."
College Sophomore,4,I have never lived on campus and i love it
College Sophomore,4,Nice athletic center. Beautiful campus.
College Sophomore,4,Alcohol in dorms not acceptable. No smoking on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Culturally diverse; Christianity endorsed by university, as it is a Methodist university, but other religions not singled out."
College Sophomore,4,There is a club in Salina that has college night on thursday nights.  Most everyone goes to that.  There are also parties on the weekends.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone in the Biology and Teacher Education departments are very helpful!
College Junior,4,"The staff in the ""Dub-hub"" are knowledgable and explain evary step of the process."
College Junior,4,"I love the teachers, classes and my adviser!"
College Junior,4,"Its all good!  I love my classes, the workload is bearable and the teachers are great!"
College Sophomore,4,The off-campus dining restaurants are regular places that you could find in most towns.  Everyone likes going out to eat together.
College Sophomore,4,The strictness of the school is good because it keeps all of the students safe.
College Sophomore,4,Salina is a great town for this small college.  The smaller size of town is good for the amount of students that attend KWU.
College Sophomore,4,The facilities of this school are always clean and everything is always being updated.
College Sophomore,4,I like that most of the students at my school are athletes.  Everyone is always involved in something and it is easy to make friends.  I also like the size of my school.  There are about 800 students and everyone knows almost everyone.
College Sophomore,4,My school is renovating two of the dorm buildings for next year.  I am excited to be living in the other dorms next year.
College Sophomore,4,"The scholarships at my school are increasing for next year, so that is exciting for all students.  The financial aid office is always helpful when you have questions."
Recent Alumnus,4,For a small town there is a lot of variety.  Anything from fast to sit down.  They have a few nice places.  It is very good considering the town I am in
Recent Alumnus,4,"I really don't see or at least notice anything.  However, I am sure there are people that take part in doing drugs on or even away from campus.  I know there is a drinking scene away from campus that our students take part in."
College Sophomore,4,"I can always find a computer when I need one.  We have several different labs around the campus.  Our WiFi isn't the fastest, but it has improved over the years."
College Senior,4,"The parking lots near the dorms can fill up quickly, but most people don't mind a short walk from the street or other lots. It's a small campus. No parking space will make you walk more than five minutes."
College Senior,4,"In small-town Kansas, you're probably not going to get the same options you'd get in NYC. There are still a lot of options. Basic fast food is always here, and some larger chain restaurants have recently moved to town. There independently owned Japanese, Italian, Mexican, and Korean restaurants within a five minute drive from campus."
College Senior,4,"The computers are available most of the time, but the library can get a little crowded. The school has WiFi access, but it is often too slow for most of the students."
College Junior,4,Strict. There are room checks every week and lots of fines handed out.
College Freshman,4,"Diversity on campus deserves an A. We all come from different countries and or states. We all accept each other for who we are, not who we are not. We have open arms and receive whatever anyone brings to the group. Regardless of political,religion, and economic background we see each other for who we are. The majority of the school is white and probably the minority is Hispanic which is the soccer team for men and women"
College Freshman,4,"the drug usage at Kansas Wesleyan is very small. Of course you have your ongoing pot smokers and parties with alcohol but other than that it is very calm and laid back here. only some people drink and those who do are very responsible and comfortable with what they are doing, people don't peer pressure others and the alcohol visibility is kept off campus in places like homes where of age people live."
College Senior,4,The academics offered at Kansas Wesleyan are excellent.. The professors are all very excellent. They do whatever it takes to help a student reach there desired goals.
College Senior,4,There is a mall in Salina which attracts a few of the college students there is a roller rink which is a fun place to go with friends. The atmosphere of the town in typically friendly and very kind to colege studnets
Recent Alumnus,4,There is always something to do on the weekends local bars and on Thursdays the club inferno has a college night. everyone goes there lots of house parties. No frats or sorority houses but no an issue. most people who go to school hear are on scholarship for sports there are sports houses like the soccer house football house and so on. we have a good time here
College Freshman,4,"I am very satisfied with the education I'm receiving thus far. The teachers are very helpful and very willing to help you with any questions and answer emails outside of their ""office hours"". I'm only unhappy with one of my courses right now and that is because of the class I'm in, not the teacher or curriculum."
College Freshman,4,"I'm very happy with the school! The teachers are all great and my advisor is SO helpful! He has been there to help me with every step of the process and from what I've heard with other students, they have all the same experience. As for admissions and financial aid offices, they are great! The lady that helped me through the whole admissions process knew me by name when I went on my visit, so that was very reassuring! I am currently enrolled in 15 credit hours and it's not bad at all. I play softball and I still have the desire to add another course and take 18 hours next semester despite season starting!"
College Freshman,4,"I really like my classes so far. My instructors are great, and the workload is large, but not overwhelming. The classrooms are neat, and the class sizes aren't too large. I think my biggest class is around 30 people. I really enjoy my classes because they are not borig. The instructors I have are connected to many people, and one used to work at the Smithsonian!"
College Freshman,4,"Campus Security – The campus security around here is very good. We are a dry campus, but that doesn't mean we never have alcohol here. If you are drunk and can't get home, any one of our RA's will come and pick you up. Our RA's are fun, honest, trustworthy people and are willing to help you with any problem you might have."
College Sophomore,4,"Unique and Open – The academic programs at Kansas Wesleyan are very good. All of the professors are more than willing to stay after class or take time out of their busy schedules to help any student who seeks help. The classes are also very student oriented as well, a great amount of class discussions. Not only are the professors helpful, but so is just about any person on campus. The majority of people you ask for help, almost always give you an answer and get you where you need to be going or doing what you need to do. A KU Medical Center was just established near the hospital, so now for Anatomy and Physiology classes and nursing classes will have an advantage with better facilities for learning and practice."
College Freshman,4,Most Students Have Good Scholarship Opportunities – Most all students receive a scholarship of some sort. All athletes get a scholarship from the school.
Freshman,2,Dorms are absolutely terrible. Need updated badly. Had huge leak in top floor of freshman dorms twice already this year and it’s only October. Would be very good university if it had equivalent dorms to other schools in area and conference.
College Sophomore,2,Dorms are very small and pretty gross. Especially the bathrooms. Some are okay if you get lucky.
College Sophomore,2,The freshman dorm at KWU are very average. The first week was fun because everyone was in the lobby but after that the dorms were quiet and boring. The RA's took their jobs way to serious.
College Sophomore,2,Almost every athlete on the softball team was transferring. They had 62 girls to start off the season and none of them had only clue that there would be 2 teams such as a Varsity and JV team. Every sports team had double the number of kids needed. Everyone said the coaches would recruit alot of freshman because they were blind and didnt know what kind of school they were going into and all the upper classman knew better and got out of there as quickly as they could.
College Freshman,2,Honestly I have heard nothing of it at our school.
College Sophomore,2,"I get no finiancial aid, which makes me only able to take a couple of classes a yer because i have to pay out of pocket"
College Sophomore,2,The parking lots for the dorms fill up quickly and most of the time it is hard to find a place to park.
College Sophomore,2,Most students would rather live on campus because you get to know more people and it is less expensive.
College Junior,2,outdated and dirty. needs restoration and renovation.
College Sophomore,2,not enough aid for the rising cost of tuition. There needs to be more scholarship choices and opportunities.
College Junior,2,Needs Improvement – Parking Could be better. There is always trouble finding a spot in the mid afternoon to late evening hours.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Great Amount – There is one 18-and-older club that majority of the students go to, especially on Thursday nights. I would comment on the house parties, but I never went to any."
College Freshman,2,"Since I live off campus parking is somewhat hard to find in the mornings. Also, when it snows the campus does nothing to plow the parking lots or streets around campus so students can park of the streets."
College Sophomore,1,After attending one full year at KWU I quickly learned it was quite possibly the worst school from the athletics to the academics. The academics are EXTREMELY easy and the sports teams are terrible. The overall moral of the school is everyone is agreement of how they cannot wait to transfer or how much they want to go home. I do not recommend this school to anyone.
College Junior,1,There are no meal plan options and the food is lacking in variety and taste!
College Sophomore,1,The dorms on campus with the exception for the girl dorms are horrible. They need renovation severely and need a little more space as well as the restrooms.
College Sophomore,1,They are not hard enough and students can pass without really learning class material in some classes
College Sophomore,1,It is a small University they are really informal not hard classes and they lie about tuition assistance.
College Junior,1,Bring Your Own Car If You Want to Get Somewhere – Very little public transportation. Only a bus that goes certain places. You really need your own car to get where you want to go.
College Freshman,1,"On campus there are no sororities or frats just ""clubs"" for certain majors."

Senior,5,"University of Central Oklahoma is a beautiful campus, and they have great programs of all types! The professors are very nice, and understanding and my experience as a transfer student has been very positive."
Senior,5,"Online can be tricky but UCO is doing a great job compromising with everyone and the online experience. I have had some issues with zoom, but it is not the schools fault, and it was fixed almost immediately, so 10 out of 10 for online experience."
Freshman,5,"All my classes are online this year. Despite this, there are many resources for your success and teachers are always willing to help."
Freshman,5,Everyone is very helpful. Teachers are dedicated to your success. There are many different ways to get involved. The campus is very diverse.
Senior,5,"The faculty has been very intentional in connecting with the students in this ew online environment. They are very approachable but you also have to do your part as student in order to succeed in this new online layout. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help. Communication is greatly important, even more so now that we cannot interact as much in-person."
Senior,5,"If you are an international student looking for a university that truly cares about its students, UCO is for you! everyone in the community goes above and beyond to help you not only academically but also personally and professionally. It is also the best-size for me (not too big, not too small) I prefer smaller classrooms since I get to know my professors better- if you do too then UCO is the perfect choice. They helped me during the pandemic by creating an International pantry where I was able to get food for free. This is just one of the many examples I can say on how the UCO community has helped me beyond my academic success."
Freshman,5,Always super helpful! All the professors are incredibly understanding and always willing to re-explain something in a new way if misunderstood.
Freshman,5,"Everything on campus is beautiful. Great staff, friendly community, perfectly suburban, and incredibly helpful. I love this school."
Alum,5,Professors are interested in your well being and has adapted to online learning. They give students multiple ways to increase their knowledge on the subject given.
Junior,5,I have not started classes but from other reviews and people I know who have attended have all said wonderful things!
Junior,5,I have just enrolled to UCO and I could not have made a better decision! You have to do an orientation after being accepted and it was so eye opening. The amount of resources and security is phenomenal. Everyone is so eager to help and get you to where you need to be! I am going to be full time online and I can not wait to get my bachelors here.
Freshman,5,"I have only had one online class with UCO and I don't usually take online if I'm allowed another option, but it was still a wonderful experience. The syllabus and other resources were accessible throughout the entire semester and the professor was always quick to respond anytime we needed help with assignments, deadlines, or technical issues."
Freshman,5,"I knew UCO was the perfect choice for me because it is close to home and, compared to other universities in Oklahoma, it's affordable. They've given me so many opportunities to pay for school. The best part is that I am pursuing a degree in Forensic Science, and UCO is the home to the top Forensic Science program in the country!"
Sophomore,5,I like the multiple advisors for each major and how easy it is to see one if you ever needed help. The system for seeing advisors is easy and the wait time is not bad at all.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a total of two classes online at UCO. The courses were well put together and they offered every chance at success.
Freshman,5,This is an excellently run and well organized school. I feel safe there and I also feel that they are very involved with their students. The students are also very involved in the school itself which I really enjoy! There is a great amount of support for all students and staff.
Freshman,5,"If I have any questions, concerns or issues I have constant, quick support to help me in time of need or confusion."
Alum,5,I enjoyed the small class sizes. I enjoyed the teacher/student interactions. I love the diversity on campus. I liked how everyone was so friendly and approachable. I wish I was more outgoing to be more involved in clubs and organizations.
Freshman,5,"Attending the University of Central Oklahoma was really fun and a good experience as a freshmen. I though had to move to OCCC for the second semester because I changed my major and planned to attend OCCC before attending the University of Oklahoma. If UCO had the major I'm pursuing, I would've stayed and finished all my years there. During my times at UCO, I met a lot of new people and made a lot of friends! The students, workers, and the professors were all amazing, everyone of them were helpful. Though I stayed with my parents and not in dorms, the times I went out to attend the basketball and football games were awesome. There were many races and I got along with any one that I encountered. The scenery of UCO was just perfect for me. The only thing I didn't like was that, raining, hot, or snowing, I had to walk to my classes. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at UCO and I didn't even get a college visit during my high school year but I highly recommend UCO!"
Senior,5,I have really loved my experience at UCO. I live an hour away from the university so I do not have a traditional college experience. The teachers are incredible! The only down side I have is that there is not very much parking at all.
Niche User,5,The University of Central Oklahoma just seems so incredibly perfect for me. The Location allows me to be away from home but not too far away from the ones I love. The schools traditions and customs seem incredible and the classes seem to be my way of learning. Every single time the representatives from UCO have visited my school I learn something new and thoroughly enjoy the experience.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at UCO and I absolutely love it here! The other students here are wonderful to be around, are encouraging, and the most supporting group of people I have ever met. I may not be living on campus, but I feel like I am still just as involved as everyone else. The professors are always there for you and are more than happy to help you if you come in for it."
Senior,5,It was great the teacher really care and try to explain the material if they think you arenâ€™t understanding it.
Alum,5,"UCO was the best school for me for my undergraduate education. The small class sizes were perfect for me to gain independent attention from my professors which lead to funded conference trips and independent research -- something that is almost unheard of at large research institutions. Without the support of my professors at UCO, I would not have been able to land in the Ivy League to complete my Ph.D. 


A word to the wise: College is what you make it. Just like every other institution, UCO can deliver and push you to new heights as long as you are willing to work hard and challenge yourself."
Niche User,5,I love this campus. The people are very friendly and the food is amazing. Their programs are also very prestigious. It's also fantastic because it doesn't cost as much as OU and OSU.
Niche User,5,So welcoming! The campus and history are beautiful. The forensics program is so good. The advisers respond within minutes of your email.
Junior,5,This university is very home-like. The classes sizes are reasonable and the professors are very engaged.
Freshman,5,The university of central Oklahoma is great! The professors and all of the other staff members are nice and engage and help when its needed. For the most part the classes are small so you get more interaction unlike other big universities. They have a lot of clubs to join and there is something for everyone. They also have a good sports program if you are the more athletic type. The classes are organized and the other students are nice for the most part as well. It is just a really great school inside and out and  I highly recommend the university of central Oklahoma to anyone looking to further their education!
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the tight-knit community of students and teachers, and how they all work together to better the school. I would like to see changes to the housing situations but the school is by far one of the best in the state."
Niche User,5,I really loved the atmosphere that the college brought. Very relaxing outside areas and every student I walked past was very polite. Everyone seemed to really be enjoying themselves here.
Senior,5,"This University goes above and beyond when it comes to education. The professors are spot on and when you need support, the advisors and campus staff are always there for You! No matter what degree field you choose, UCO will get you the education you need and deserve to be the best you that you can be."
Niche User,5,I had an awesome experience at UCO. They care about what you want and they will do their best to get where you want to be.
Freshman,5,"It is such an amazing school. The class sizes are never too big, making it easy to engage in all of your studies and it is very easy to find something to get involved in on-campus because they always have something for everyone! It is in the middle of Edmond making it very convenient and accessible to the town! I love it!"
Freshman,5,My name is Diana De Loera and I am a freshman student at the University of Central Oklahoma. I have really enjoyed my first semester all the staff and professor are very helpful and truly make you feel cared for.
Senior,5,The University of Central Oklahoma has been my second home. The professors are invested and the university is invested in the students success.
Niche User,5,When I went for a college visit a year ago I met with a lot of music majors and they talked to me about how fun it would be and how great the campus is.
Alum,5,"I loved the small town life of Edmond, OK, as well as the easy commute to my full time job. I lived off campus, but it was close enough, I could have walked to some of my classes.  I was considered a ""part time commuter student"" my last few semesters attending classes. But they still make you feel a part of the campus life. Most of my courses were held in the early evening hours.  However, when taking some of my beginning basis courses, I was able to take an early morning class at 6:30 am to 7:30 am, before going to work."
Freshman,5,im really planning to go to university of central oklahoma as they offer  many majors and many credits also they have many opportunities for international students
Freshman,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma is the place that changed me for the better. When I came into college, I did not think I was going to make it through the first week. The professors here are amazing and are really dedicated to helping students succeed."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma is a great place to get a degree from they have many different majors to pick from. The school is the third largest in the state of Oklahoma, so there are so many people to make new friends join different clubs or to do school activities with here. The professors are great they really work with you to try to help you understand the concept of what you're learning in that class. The professors try to work with you if you need extra help. The campus life is fun their are so many different things to do on campus such as homecoming, greek life, sports, etc. Uco is a great place to grow and it's a great place to go to school and to have a social life at."
Freshman,5,Wonderful and accepting school. Extreme diversity and excellent academic standards. UCO has one of the best leadership programs and international programs. Students are genuinely cared for; their health is the top priority. The school is designed to listen to students and their thoughts. Overall excellent school.
Junior,5,My teachers are so helpful and understanding. They want to see us succeed! Each teacher works to make sure that we grow into competent teachers and give us plenty of clinical experiences.
Freshman,5,"Excellent school, incredible faculty, staff, and professors, and the surrounding community has everything a college student could possibly ask for."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes. In most every class I have taken, the professors are extremely knowledgeable and available. I feel the smaller class sizes offer the opportunity for more one on one attention and time to ask questions ."
Sophomore,5,"I love UCO, itâ€™s right in the middle of Edmond with amazing resources around the location. The layout of the campus is very easy to navigate. People are kind here and the professors care about your well being. I would definitely recommend UCO to any high school student looking for a great but affordable college"
Freshman,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma is top 3 in the state. I love this college. It's not as big as all the other campus'. My campus is a very diverse campus, and that is one of the best parts! The Professors are Great!! I haven't had a bad professor yet. The student body if focused on involving you. We have a lot of clubs you can get involved in."
Sophomore,5,"Even with fewer resources than many of the schools in Oklahoma, UCO goes above and beyond to ensure the comfort, well-being, and success of its students in nearly every aspect of academic culture. While students who attend have to be willing to get out of their comfort zones, unlike many other colleges in Oklahoma, they will be thoroughly rewarded for doing so at UCO."
Sophomore,5,UCO has a very awkward campus to get used to. But once you get the hang of it things get a lot easier.
Junior,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma has an outstanding group of professors and beautiful campus. The community is such a great thing to be apart of, with many activities to be involved in. I would love to see many more students involved in activities and organizations within Edmond, Oklahoma."
Senior,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma is just beautiful, it feels like a second home. Everyone is nice and is happy to help with anything and everything. I love it, but I would add more security for all day and night. There have been many incidents around the neighborhood that it makes you sit on the edge of your chair."
Freshman,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma has a very beautiful campus and welcoming environment. It is not super big, so it isn't as overwhelming as many colleges can be. The tuition is not horribly expensive and could easily be paid with scholarships. The people are very welcoming and helpful and do everything they can to help you be successful."
Senior,5,I am an international student and I would say that this university is specifically oriented for students' studying and their acquiring degrees. The living cost in the town in which the university is located is relatively cheap and safe.
Freshman,5,"I liked the general atmosphere when I went to orientation, everyone was very nice and helpful and seemed extremely willing to do whatever they could to help everyone out. From what of the campus I saw, it seemed very modern and clean, which is fantastic, it also appeared very welcoming, not overbearing or close in any way!"
Sophomore,5,Everyone is so nice and welcoming. My professors seem to genuinely care about me and setting me up for success.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Central Oklahoma has a nice welcoming environment with great facilities and staff.  Student advisors are really responsive and willing to help their students in any way they can. Also, it's not really a party school so most of the students are serious about their education and not just the ""college experience""."
Freshman,5,"My favorite thing about UCO is that you have so many people to help you out if you get lost or even if you are going through a rough patch. UCO has great academics and you can tell, this school is for sure for you if you are interested in STEM or Forensics!"
Junior,5,"UCO has a nice campus set in a great town. Most students commute to campus so the social aspect of college life is lacking a bit, but overall the classes and area make up for it. I transferred from a D1 college and feel UCO is a better fit for me because of the class sizes and the classes that are offered."
Freshman,5,The teachers are amazing! They really care about their students. They will take the time to sit down with you and make sure you understand stuff. I really enjoyed my first year back to school here.
Sophomore,5,The University of Central Oklahoma is very personal. All the classrooms are averaged around 40 students per class and the professors really get to know you and help you succeed.  Itâ€™s amazing to walk in to class and the professors know your name.
Sophomore,5,The University of Central Oklahoma is incredibly welcoming and supportive of anybody and everybody. They do a wonderful job of making you feel like youâ€™re home amongst a few thousand other people. The only issue I have is not keeping their website up to date.
Junior,4,"UCO is a great environment. The campus is not too big, and the professors and students are all very friendly. Personally, I have not experienced a class with any inappropriate conduct and the staff is very professional and helpful. There has been recent updating of housing as well as the food on campus which also makes the campus experience better. I would like to see some things change regarding the campus-student engagement."
Junior,4,I took the majority of my classes online. Some professors were experienced with online learning and leveraged their resources fairly nicely. Others did not have much experience and their lack of organization and communication led to me missing some of my assignments. I hope that we all learn from this crazy time about what is most effective when it comes to online learning.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the University of Central Oklahoma a lot. The entire campus is just beautiful. Everyone is very friendly there. They keep the campus updated as much as possible.
Freshman,4,"My experience at University of Central Oklahoma is going great for now. The professors are really nice. The only thing that i would ever want to change would be the amount of assignments that I have to do every single day which is a mess all over my room. The dates to do the assignments should be extended so we get enough time to divide our time and do other things in our lives. However, overall studying there is amazing! My classmates helps and answer my questions. The experience here is going great for now but looking forward to it."
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience at University of Central Oklahoma is going very good. The online problem that sometimes i experience is the voice issue but other than that I can see my teachers face and the notes which really helps me like concentrate and i also have a visual representation of my teacher standing in front of me. The classes I have taken online are Health, Maths, Speech, success Central and psychology"
Sophomore,4,"I only took one online class at UCO and I liked it. As long as you check your d2l, it's pretty easy."
Sophomore,4,"I attended UCO for two years and loved it. The campus life is amazing, everyone is really involved. There are a ton of organizations and clubs to join. I also lived on campus, so there was a lot to do. There were lots of campus events but the best is move-in week. For the week prior to the beginning of classes, anyone who lives on campus has the week to get familiar with everything and can attend the events. They have movie nights, foam parties, block parties, all kinds of stuff. UCO is a bit expensive though. Some of the fees that are required are kind of unnecessary. The financial aid office could also use some improvement (I know because I worked there). The education is great though, I've learned so much and am ready to get my BA or BS from there. The campus food is pretty poor though. The food was never fresh or just didn't taste good altogether. I would change that for sure."
Sophomore,4,I don't live on campus but the people there make it feel like you still get the full college experience. They also recycle and take care of the campus which is a bonus for me.
Sophomore,4,I haven't taken any classes online but I do have the option of going virtual if I had to and the professors practice just to make sure we can get the full experience just in case. It is great that they give is an option as well as giving us the opportunity to work with what works for us.
Sophomore,4,UCO has a great atmosphere and a place for each and every one of its students. Classes are fairly small and you can truly connect with your professors and make friends that will last a lifetime.
Alum,4,UCO is a great college to get your degree! It is a positive community and has great professors that care for you.
Alum,4,"I didn't take any courses online, but the classes that shared content online for their campus classes were good."
Junior,4,"My online experience was very interesting, yet fun. My last semester was the first time I had taken any online classes. It was nerve-racking at first, but it became easier over time due to time management and calendars!"
Junior,4,So far there have been many opportunities to become involved with the school and the student body. This makes my college experience much more enjoyable because I am able to see a community being built and diversified. There are many changes the University is changing to change the narrative that has been written for years. This community has taught me a lot and I am thankful for it everyday.
Sophomore,4,The University of Central Oklahoma is a very welcoming campus. The professors know who you are and they do their best to make sure you understand the material being covered in class.
Freshman,4,"It is a nice campus and is a very open and free college to do what you want to do. The location is great because it is in the middle of a growing town, ant not far from other major cities. The amount of majors they have is incredible and I can take so many different classes. The tuition is not crazy for it being such a big school. The housing should be more diverse and I wish there were more option and different styles to choose from, but the facilities they have are nice and cleaned all the time, which is amazing."
Senior,4,University of Central Oklahoma is a great school with a lot of diversity.  The smaller class sizes are very helpful in providing student-teacher connection as well as a great learning environment.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy going to school at the university. The education program here is phenomenal and I'm so glad I decided to transfer to this school. The only complaint I would have is there is never parking. Other than that, I really love the school. I feel like I've learned a lot about the education program and good practices to incorporate into my teaching."
Freshman,4,I enjoy how friendly everybody is. You can really be yourself there because it is such diverse campus.
Junior,4,"UCO is a great school for commuters on on-campus residence alike. It provides excellent academics, friendly professors, and plenty student life opportunities. Its a quieter campus than a major state school with a friendly and diverse student body that fosters long-lasting friendships."
Sophomore,4,"The environment of the campus is very comforting. There is almost always some event going on around campus that anyone can attend. Almost the entire population on campus is friendly and willing to help one another, including the faculty and staff. The only complaint is that there are some cold buildings on campus that need to be updated."
Senior,4,"My experience at UCO has been great all around! My advisors have kept me on track to graduate on time, any questions asked were answered and a great support system is there at UCO. Something I would like to see change however is the universityâ€™s wellness center. It would be nice to have a bigger gym and more space to workout and not be so crowded."
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled at UCO and my experience has been good. I am a business major so I spend all my time at the College of Business and I am glad to say that everything I need is there. In the building, you have access to advisors, study tables, wifi, a computer lab where you can research and print, tutors, ect."
Freshman,4,i love it! great professors and great size of campus. i lived on campus freshman year in the suites and it w as pretty great as well. the only thing with UCO is sometimes they are difficult with communicating and take out pretty big random fees in your tuition.
Freshman,4,"It's not my dream college, but considering most of my applications were last minute they had an incredible response time. The environmeent surrounding the college is very eco-friendly and safe and I would reccomend going to UCO if you live in Oklahoma."
Sophomore,4,"I loved the fact that it is a small campus, I also live on campus so I can get involved with more of the events which are also fun!"
Niche User,4,What i think of UCO is it is just a place where everyone is welcoming as soon as you get their you instantly notice the room with animal heads i dont know what it's for but its amazing my experience there was amazing everyone was friendly and welcoming.
Junior,4,"The overall experience at the University of Central Oklahoma has been great. What I like most is that it has a very friendly environment, as well as a beautiful campus."
Freshman,4,The things I like about the University of Central Oklahoma is the way the teachers engage with the students in all the classrooms. They all go above and beyond for the students in their classes to help them succeed. The only thing Iâ€™d like to see change here is the food options available.
Niche User,4,"The campus is not very large which lead way to smaller class sizes (the max in most classes are 20). Also, the college offers a ton of opportunities to help a student succeed, and to get involved around campus as well as in the community."
Freshman,4,"UCO is a very good school that helps students get involved. There is events that go on at least everyday. I am involved in rowing and have made very good friendships and if you get involved, you will make very close friendships."
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity here. everyone really tries to make your life as easy as possible. The University of Central Oklahoma is the place where I call home. All of my professors want to see their student succeed, and give us all of the tools to do so. All of the people here are so friendly and welcoming. UCO supplies us with all of the tools we need to be successful."
Sophomore,4,The University of Central Oklahoma is a great college and has tons of options for involvement. The professors are very helpful and seem to care about their students and are constantly looking to help. The campus is beautiful and very well kept.
Niche User,4,"My mother went to uco and she loved it, she said it was a great environment. I am a junior in high school who is looking forward to play baseball there. they have a great Forensic Science program which is what they are known for. Uco is the third biggest college in Oklahoma behind OU and OSU. I am wanting to major in kinesiology, and physical education ever since my acl injury I have been fascinated with helping people get back to normal and get back to their sports"
Niche User,4,"its a good college with tons of majors to choose from and has a healthy positive student life, they not only care just about your class of education they want to make sure you feel like having a home away from home."
Junior,4,My siblings and I have been going here for a few years now and love the professors and the location! A great place to receive a degree.
Senior,4,The funeral service program is amazing.  All the teachers in the program are great and are willing to help the students be successful. I really enjoy all of the classes they offer because everything we learn is relevant for the field we are going into.  The only thing different I would like to see is that we did not have to share a building with the nursing students I would like for us to have our own space.
Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about the University of Central Oklahoma is there willingness to allow students to create their own groups and organizations. The diversity there is wonderful, and their love for creative fields shows. One of my favorite places is the UCO Jazz Lab, but I also love that they invested in the Academy of Contemporary Music, where I attend. Itâ€™s a dream being able to walk through Bricktown every day on your way to school, and have flexible and understanding teachers there that are more than willing to help. Perhaps their website could use a little work... maybe a LOT of work. However, as far as their responsiveness to the students and how they let everyone know thereâ€™s a place to go if you have any questions is relieving to hear."
Junior,4,The university of Central Oklahoma is an amazing place to receive your higher education. The environment is welcoming and open to all. There is a club or rec sports for almost everything. It is very easy to find something to get involved in and also the professor genuinely care about the wellbeing of their student.
Senior,4,This school has given me plenty of great opportunities! The teachers are really nice to work with and make sure you are learning the maximum amount you can. I am lucky to be going to school here.
Junior,4,I like the University of Central Oklahoma quite a bit! I come from a smaller town so this school is pretty fun and exciting for me. I wish that there were more advisors readily available instead of having to schedule a meeting a week out.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at UCO has been very good. I love how it's a big campus with a small town feel. The facilities are always kept up. The professors I have had so far are easy to work with, but expect a lot out of it's students."
Niche User,4,This community college is an amazing place to be. Every time I have visited I have always been welcomed and people are always friendly. Lastly this place has a great down to earth vibe with many good people.
Sophomore,4,UCO is a great school. There are many great professors and a variety of opportunities. I am currently a psychology major and have liked the majority of the psych professors here.
Freshman,4,"The University of Central Oklahoma is university with an amazing Graphic Design program, enriching internship opportunities and rewarding career placement programs."
Junior,4,"I feel UCO is a great University for students who don't know an exact field they plan to study, like myself at first. They have plenty of major options and are a cheaper college, while still being a good size. The option to live off campus even as a freshman is also unique for a school of around 15,000, this can save you even more money if done correctly."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love my academic life. My professors have all been very strategic in how they teach me, and each of them WANT me to succeed. This has truly helped me TO succeed. The only thing I would change is the parking. There just is not enough of it for how large of a school it is. A parking garage would be nice and effective for the school."
Freshman,4,"I really like  the professors and how they really want you to be successful. I also like the environment that your around, It's very clean and the people that attend the university are very helpful and nice."
Freshman,4,I am just finishing up my first year at the University of Central Oklahoma and I have  completely fallen in love with this school. The dorms are so clean and they have the most welcoming RA's. I have met so many people by living on campus. The teachers are very helpful and strive to help their students succeed. I haven't had a single bad experience here.
Junior,4,University of Central Oklahoma is an amazing school. My experience here as been fun. People are willing to help and all you have to do is just ask.
Sophomore,4,"UCO is student friendly! Loves commuters, funny though because the parking isnâ€™t very convenient. The professors are all amazing and helpful."
Senior,4,It is a good school that cares about its students. The class sizes are smaller than at other universities making it so the students and teachers can truly get to know each other.
Sophomore,4,"I have little to no issues with this college, though I have heard that some of the counselors are no good and don't know what they are talking about. I personally have not had any issues with them. Also, one thing I don't like about the university is the parking. It's very hard to park and expensive to buy the permit. There is, however, a bus available, Citylink, that will take you to and from school at certain times, and It's free. Overall, I love this university and as a forensic major, I found my home."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere compared to other universities that I have visited. Many of the students have the same goal and want to go to class rather than students from other universities who go because of their parents and wish to party. UCO is a good campus to stay busy on. I currently live on campus and enjoy the aspect of rooming with people who experience the same obstacles as I do, and have the same goal."
Freshman,4,"I transferred to uco my this year and during the process they were so helpful, making it an easy transition. The professors care about their students and want you to learn. Thereâ€™s many things to get involved in."
Junior,4,"Even though it is a very large school, the classes are smaller and are not overwhelming. Everyone is very nice and the professors actually care about you. So far I have been very happy here."
Senior,4,This is a  great school! Tuition is affordable and the university is ranked better than you would expect in most categories.
Freshman,4,So far everything's been up to par. I just wish they made transitioning into being in college easier. For example more in person help instead of online help. I think person to person contact is easier for myself instead of reading information online and trying to interpret the information for myself.
Senior,4,"I love UCO. I have commuted for the past five years, which is where my only real complaints come from. There is minimal parking for commuters, and they rarely cancel in the event of dangerous weather."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) provides a great environment and opportunities to connect with other students and professors. The school displays these elements through their academics as the school does offer smaller classrooms. As a result, students are more connected to the professor and have the opportunity to stand out in the class. Additionally, UCO shows that it is very diverse in its organizations and people on campus. Moreover, UCO offers great housing options from cheap to expensive dorms. UCO has an outstanding library with staff on hand that will help students with their research and studying. Not to mention, there is a wellness center or gym that provides students with modern exercise equipment."
Sophomore,2,"The old professor doesn't have good pronunciation and doesn't even use blackboards and ppts. There is no public transportation and I have never seen a shuttle bus. In order to attend this school, you have to buy a car or live in a dormitory. However, parking spaces are not far behind and dorms are poorly equipped.
The landlords around the school will not give you a deposit. The three landlords did not pay deposits. They didn't remove wasps in front of the garage or repair the house after three months.

The only advantage of this school is that geese and squirrels are cute."
Freshman,2,"My experience at UCO was not great.  The food on campus was not very good, the town is pretty small and not many social opportunities.  The classes were small, so that was helpful and nice.  The professors were ok.  I feel like there could have more events on campus to help new students get more acclimated."
College Senior,2,It is difficult for students with no experience to find a job. Working on campus is very difficult
College Senior,2,the people there are rude sometimes im scared to ask questions sometimes
College Senior,2,I don't like the parties but I do like the community support
College Freshman,2,I've been offered a lot...
College Sophomore,2,The athletes on this campus is not very good. But they are sometimes fun to attend.
College Senior,2,I haven't been to an athletic event since my sophomore year and I am a senior now. I think school spirit here is really low.
College Student,2,My high school did not properly prepare me for college
College Sophomore,2,I never saw any greek students around.
College Sophomore,2,Not the best I've seen around
College Student,2,The off campus living is expensive and not worth the effort/time to move out. It is way too expensive and not very good quality living spaces.
College Sophomore,2,"The administration in the dorms are extremely strict and they are like a mean boss instead of trying to help you and being a friend. Way to many rules, it's college, I think we know how to act."
College Sophomore,2,"I've never been introduced to many scholarships, as if the school was actually reaching out to help the students, instead of ripping them off."
College Junior,2,I never received any financial aid that I really needed
College Junior,2,There are not very many healthy options for on campus food and it is overpriced for the quality.
College Freshman,2,Campus police don't have enough to do so they are always scoping out cars that aren't in line with parking rules.
College Freshman,2,I've heard the experience has been horrible so I haven't attempted.
College Junior,2,It was ridiculous to say the least. It took them until Thanksgiving to process anything and when asked why they had no answer.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of parties occur on the weekends
College Senior,2,I don't know anyone that follows them
College Senior,2,Hard to be in one and still have time to study.
College Senior,2,So much alcohol in the dorms!! and pot
College Senior,2,Not a lot of options
College Senior,2,Most landlords close to campus are terrible!!! They don't fix anything and never get deposits back. Rader Realty is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Junior,2,in general the students do not communicate well with each-other. It is pretty difficult to locate groups within the small classes and this makes it harder to bring together groups that are within the same classmates. Many times i find it difficult to brainstorm together with classmates due to the small classes.
College Junior,2,"The near campus living here in Edmond is very highly priced for its accommodations. College students are fund limited and this needs to be brought about to the public's eye. Not every college student's parents can afford to live on campus nor close to campus at these rates. The city bus may provide needed transportation, yet the housing cost are almost unbearable while in school full time."
College Junior,2,In my 2 years of attending this college i have been approached once about joining greek life. I refused the first time because i was a fresshman and wanted to see the other option that might come my way. Since this invitation i have had no other invitations which is rather uphalding. I would say that the openness of greek life around campus should be broader and more open to new people and new ideas.
College Freshman,2,Many of the students do not pay attention to the sports that are being played. The football team has a reputation for being pretty bad and for losing most games. However the cheer team is very popular and has won many titles.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are pretty small and not that great, but do cost a good chunk of money. They are renewing/have renewed the men's dorms some so that is good. Cost of tuition isn't that high but living on campus basically doubles the amount. People are easy to interact with and most buildings aren't that far from each other."
College Freshman,2,"Getting financial aid isn't hard, it's getting the financial aid office to cooperate. They're constantly busy so it's sometimes hard to get through, especially if you call or email. If you can, go in to get things settled. But a lot of scholarships don't even go through them. They're through the different departments and colleges through campus. I don't know much about loans, I haven't needed to take any out so far."
College Freshman,2,"I've heard that we have some sort of shuttle bus, but I've never seen one.  Transportation options are driving your vehicle, carpooling, bicycling, or walking.  Oklahoma itself isn't transportation convienent.  A lot of students (myself included) live a long distance from the school, which makes transportation pretty expensive.  I live forty-five minutes away and drive a '92 Chevy pickup truck.  With gas prices rising, transportation is an added expense as a college student.  Campus, local, and long-distance transporation would be a great addition to the school."
College Freshman,2,Some drivers are careless of other drivers. 
College Freshman,2,"If you don't get to school by 11 am, you will not find a parking spot. If you do, it will be a long walk. Teachers can't even find parking spots sometimes."
College Freshman,2,The on campus wifi is very spotty and slow sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,Not very familiar with the Greek life on campus. We have a rush week and people enjoy their parties.
College Sophomore,2,They are very strict on parking violations. 
College Sophomore,2,"Not 21 yet, and don't have time to have much fun anyway."
College Junior,2,"I don't go to a very large university, so the sports are hyped up by the school itself, not by the students. No one really cares about our sports team, not many people attend games."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My program was great, but it is not getting me where I want to be in life. I have changed my major completely for my masters degree and I will be entering a different field. My goal is to work globally in the health care field, and my bachelors degree has given me a starting point. It is not enough to further my career though so I have to move to a different area."
College Senior,2,Athletics are fun to go to at UCO. Unfortunately they are overshadowed by the 3 bigger colleges in the state so they are not talked a out a lot
College Sophomore,2,"Everything is a bit more ""pricey"". you can drive to the city next to Edmond and get cheaper items."
College Junior,2,"While the school is strict in places that is should be such as honor code and drug use, the dorm visitation rules are ridiculous we are adults not children!"
College Freshman,2,"I have had an extremely difficult time receiving scholarships. I applied for many scholarships but the University was not interested in my applications. It seems as if they were wanting a certain student to win. I will not lie, I'm not very involved with school activities because I work everyday after I get out of my last class until six that evening, I than must work on homework and study to keep up with the workload and my grades, which are very important to me. They seem to only want students that actively involved in school, not students who are trying to maintain their grades when they also have a disability."
College Sophomore,2,"Getting better, but mostly fake wannabes and mostly irresponsible kids who cannot keep their houses or get better ones because they won't grow up."
College Freshman,2,They are super strict on drinking and smoking. In the dorms its a lot of rules no freedom for young adults
College Freshman,2,The Greek Life at UCO in just average. They throw some parties but if you are not involved with their certain frat then you are not really accepted in. Most of them view themselves as above other students instead of trying to integrate everyone within the school together.
College Freshman,2,"The three areas where one can use their meals off of their meal plan and they get kinda old.  There are places to eat around campus that are great but if one has to stick to the meal plan the food can get very old, and after 11:00pm nothing is open so if you work late like I do it gets old.  I wouldn't suggest getting a huge meal plan unless you have a very regular schedule."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really enjoy the weather in Oklahoma at all. However, there are more positives than negatives by far at UCO, so I'll take the bad weather."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not a fan of drinking and parties, so I don't appreciate the nightlife at UCO. However, those that like parties would have plenty to do here."
College Freshman,2,"Dorms Fairly New â€“ Dorms aren't that bad, but there is no privacy and noise is a problem if you want to study there."
College Freshman,2,"I was lucky enough to get into a summer research program and got some help from that, but as far as paying the rest of my fees, I haven't gotten as much assistance as I thought I would."
Recent Alumnus,2,The apartments surrounding the campus are old but functional.
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many options, especially for students who have different types of diets. For example the dining hall isn't very vegitarian friendly and absolutely is not vegan friendly. The dining hall tends to be pretty pricey as well."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally did not live on campus nor did I even enjoy being in the dorm rooms at West Hall when I had a friend who did live there.  However, it was convenient to be so close to all the classes."
College Senior,2,Of campus housing is way too expensive for a student trying to pay his/her own way through school. You have to have at least one or more roomates to be able to afford a halfway decent place. Edmond apartments around UCO are nice in that they are conveniently located near Super Target and Super Walmart and a lot of other businesses right near UCO.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you takes classes between 8 & 1, you're going to have problems finding a parking spot. It can sometimes take 20 minutes to find a parking spot & you might have to ask someone walking to their car if you can have their spot. If you have classes during the afternoon, then you'll have a much easier time finding a parking spot. Permits cost $100 but it counts for Fall through Summer. If you park in an area that you're not permitted to park in, then you'll receive a parking ticket for $25."
College Sophomore,2,"The food at my campus dining was...well it tried very hard to be good, but in the end it was simply like going to Golden Corral. They pretended to have a lot, but most of it was really cheap and not made well."
College Sophomore,2,"I did not have a very good experience with my campus housing mainly because I was paired with a girl who thought it was okay to steal my things, wear my clothes and let her friends sleep in my bed while I'm at class. My issue would be with that Roommate pairing app they have online."
College Junior,2,There are not very many African-American professors. The campus is predominantly caucasian.  There are a lot of Asian students on campus as well.  I tink that shows a little form of diversity.
Senior,1,UCO sucks. Thats been my password ever since I started there. The website and campus are confusing. They do  a poor job or getting community involvement within the school and it's students and within the outside community of Edmond. The parking is one of their worst features. The parking permits are $150+ and theres no parking left by any main hour class starts. You might be lucky to get a spot at 8am. Visitors have to pay to park and if they didn't know that they get fined with a ticket ranging from $20-$40. The academic advisors are all incompetent acting. The university uses a lot of student workers that don't know how to answer complex questions. Overall its a awful school but because it's not stupidly expensive I'll be graduating from there.
College Senior,1,"Financial aid is pitiful. No available scholarships or assistantships, must rely completely on loans"
College Senior,1,"Legends is snooty, Chick-fil-A is pretentious and flat tire isn't ""on campus"""
College Freshman,1,"Murdaugh Hall, sucks!  It's positively the worst  place to live on campus!  I used to attend Sequoyah High School of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and the many rooms that I had when I stay there were of better quality and size than what I have now!  It is worth way less than I am paying for! I'm being robbed!"
College Freshman,1,There is next to no public transportation.
College Freshman,1,"I was not at all well-informed about their scholarship program.  As a transfer student, I was informed that scholarships would be awarded based on essay questions on my application.  However, I never heard anything about that again and should have visited the office.  I have yet to recieve any sort of financial aid from the school.  It was also a hassle to transfer my Teach Grant from my previous school to UCO.  It took over a month for them to acknowledge it, and I have been charged with an additional forty dollar late fee.  My experience was terrible, and I recieved no financial aid through my struggle."
College Freshman,1,Not much different than other schools
College Sophomore,1,"we shouldn't have to pay for parking at the school we are attending. we pay for the classes, a separate $100+ permit is absurd. college students don't have a high income, and that money is used to make payments like rent and bills on time. "
College Sophomore,1,Oklahoma in general has terrible mass transportation. Very commuter unfriendly. 
College Sophomore,1,Cops will find any reason to pull you over.parking tickets are a really big deal too.
College Student,1,was told i qualified for financial aid then they didnt give it to me
College Senior,1,After scoring a 30 on my ACT which included a 33 in the Science section I only received an out of state waiver. Their scholarships that the school offers are mainly for in-state students which I thought was unfair.
College Freshman,1,"Parking Problems â€“ Parking on the campus is horrible to non existent. New buildings are building or older buildings remodeled and decreasing the amount of parking. The univesity isn't adding any parking lots. Students complain but nothing happens. The university enforces parking rules and issues so many tickets to students per day, even though they know there isn't enough parking spaces available."
College Freshman,1,Strickly enforce parking violations but there isn't enough parking.
College Sophomore,1,"Permit Cost â€“ 100 dollars per year for a parking permit. Half the time you have to park out in the middle of no where. It is terrible to charge students 100 dollars for parking, we already pay the school enough between books and tuition."
College Senior,1,I hate UCO parking and parking tenants! they are extremely unforgiving and rude.  It is ridiculous to spend the 100 or whatever dollars on a decal and then not even find a spot remotely close to the building your trying to get to.  I have ended up having to park almost a mile from campus multiple times and having to run with my books to class. Its ridiculous.
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrible and not worth the $100 per year. You can never find a place to park and at least one parking lot that I know of has pot holes so deep my car bottoms out and they are so big you cannot drive around them. You get tickets if you do not have your parking sticker, even if you have one, you still have to pay the ticket. You are only allowed one sticker so if you are a student who commutes and drives more than one car do not forget your parking sticker. I have forgot to grab my parking pass when I had to drive my other vehicle and I was given a ticket and had to pay it even though both of my cars are registered at UCO. It is ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,"My first semester I lives in Campus housing that wasn't on campus. So when I went to drive to school and park, the Housing lot was so small, maybe 12 spaces, and it was behind the football field. It made it extremely inconvenient for me. And especially when I moved back home the next semester-I still couldn't park in the commuter lot! I got at least 3 parking tickets because as much as I don't like the parking lots, the police casing them are like ninjas."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Life â€“ I don't know if this ""sets the school apart"", but I know many people, including myself, that were so unimpressed and dissatisfied with their experience at the school that they left after just a single semester. The people are incredibly rude, snobby, and unsociable if you do not take part in whatever club they are in, the professors have no interest in the students whatsoever and are only there to do what they have to do and then leave, and it seems like the campus looking nice and functioning well is the only priority of those in charge rather than the students. I also know many people that were set up in the dorms with horrible roommates, (my roommate was very messy, rude, and her snoring kept me up at night. Plus her friends were always coming in and out leaving me with little to no privacy.) so my suggestion would be to find someone to live with before moving in. Personally, I felt very isolated on campus. There weren't many opportunities to meet people or make friends, so most of the freshmen I knew spent most of their time in their rooms. Oklahoma campuses are known for being incredibly friendly (University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University for example) but UCO is definitely excluded from that."
College Freshman,1,"The only time I had used the library computers, as the other computers on campus were either too illusive to find or not accessible to everyone, they were always crowded and a little slow with a three page print limit. I really was never able to get a lot of work done due to noise and the slowness of the equipment. Plus the library aids or whoever was put in charge of keeping the room in order would do nothing but sit around and let anything fly. Overall, I was not impressed, once I got my laptop the only times I went back were to print my assignments and such."

Freshman,5,"All my classes were in person, but if you needed to join online for any reason, you are able to do so."
Sophomore,5,"The only time I was online was when we had to go online because of COVID-19. Cornerstone did an outstanding job at making sure all the student and professors had the time to make the adjustments. All the online portion was very well-done, and it does an excellent job at allowing you to continue your educational growth."
Freshman,5,"At Cornerstone University I can be me. The professors there are always willing to help you and constantly seek your well-being. The overall experience at Cornerstone has been one of learning well and also having great student life activities that help you grow, socially, spiritually and mentally as well. Not only have I been able to learn very well, but also able to creat genuine friendships that will last me for life as well. Overall Cornerstone University has been very good."
Freshman,5,"During Covid-19 online learning, the University was able to switch over well. It was not hard to switch over because the professors were willing to help."
Niche User,5,To be completely honest I have not attended the campus yet as a visitor nor a student so I don't really have a good out look on the university yet.
Niche User,5,Looks Like great place to continue my education. Can't wait to go there this fall! I'm about to enter this fall as an incoming freshman.
Alum,5,"My experience at Cornerstone was phenomenal. The campus was beautiful. The academics were challenging. There was good support from the professors for students due to the small class sizes. Campus life was fairly lively and there are lots of activities and things to do outside of the campus as well. I lived on the campus for three years and the accommodations aren't stellar, but it was great for building community. Overall, my experience at this school was very positive. I enjoyed my four years here."
Senior,5,"This University is great! I love being involved. The professors and staff are always very responsive and caring. The grounds are beautiful, too!"
Sophomore,5,"Love everything about Cornerstone. Great location and faculty. I feel safe and at home, we’re like family and look out for another. This is my second year and I’ve learned a lot and growth over these past two years. I’m looking forward to my Junior year and graduating with my Bachelors in Commutation in 2022. Praying GOD open more doors to help my mom with my tuition. She’s a hard working single mom and deserves the world. But I’m so thankful that GOD has already made a way for me to be here. So I’ll just continue to keep the faith and stay positive. Overall I am enjoying College life, wish we had more parties. But the campus is small and I’m able to commute without any problems. I would recommend Cornerstone University"
Sophomore,5,"I transferred into Cornerstone as a sophomore in the field of exercise science with an emphasis in Physical Therapy. I can honestly that it was the best choice of my life. The faculty and administrators really show genuine care for your success here and want what is best for you personally, spiritually, and financially. The class sizes are small compared to a public university, however, I believe this makes the college experience so much better since you won't feel like just a name or number on an attendance record. If you are looking to grow in your academic and professional life as well as your spiritual and personal life than Cornerstone University is the right choice for you."
Freshman,5,The community here at CU is incomparable. Upon walking unto campus you are immediately welcomed into an incredible family. The small size of this university is such an advantage. You can be super involved if you choose and you have endless resources available to help you succeed including your professors.
Sophomore,5,"I love my school. It has a wonderful culture, making you feel at home as soon as you step onto campus. The professors truly care about you and your academic success. They ask how you are doing, and invest in you. When you are struggling (either academically or personally), they are intentional about asking after your well being, and follow up with you if you explain you are struggling. Classes are well rooted in the college's principles, and encourage the Christ-centered life."
Alum,5,"Great college, fantastic teacher ed department.  The professors genuinely love you, the president is fantastic.  The overall feel is great."
Sophomore,5,"As an upcoming Sophomore, I can say that I am thrilled to be returning to CU! I absolutely loved my first year. From dorm and campus life to sports events and classes to chapel and downtown Grand Rapids, I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of my time there. True, the cafeteria did not always have the best food and most dorms are up there in age, BUT our new science building is incredible and more importantly, our professors are devoted to our success as individuals, professionals, and Christians. I highly encourage anyone seeking a higher education to check out Cornerstone University!"
Sophomore,5,"This is an amazing university. The community is awesome and there is always some sort of event or fun thing going on. The RAs and RDs really care about you and want to help you out with anything you are having trouble with. The professors are really good and want you to pass the class. They will help you out if you are having trouble, and there is always free tutoring if you need it."
Sophomore,5,"Cornerstone has such a great community there. The professors are approachable and always willing to help, they actually care about all the students they have and want to see them succeed."
Niche User,5,I love the program that I am in! It has been challenging but I love my professors and they always offer such great insight and feedback!
Sophomore,5,The community is just amazing.  The campus is beautiful and the food is great too!  It can truly change your perspective on the world.  The dorms are a bit unusual but they make it easy to meet people.
Junior,5,"Cornerstone is a community that cares about your success.  The professors get to know you on a personal level and push you to succeed in areas you never knew possible.  Not only do they care about your academic success, but also your spiritual life and emotional well being."
Alum,5,"I completed a Master's degree through an online course at Cornerstone.  The professors were very knowledgeable and helpful, and the administrative support was excellent. The coursework was challenging and interesting and the online system worked very well.  The tech support was great to work with when needed."
Junior,5,Cornerstone University has a beautiful campus.  It employs caring and intelligent teachers who teach smaller class sizes to it feels more close-knit.  There are a lot of annual events held for students that are a lot of fun to see and participate in.
Senior,5,"Cornerstone is a very diverse, well-rounded school centered around Christ. I love the professor to student ratio, and the compassion that the faculty has for their students. They offer aid to 99% of incoming students, and work hard to make their tuition affordable."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Cornerstone University and I love it there! It is an amazing four year college, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to grow closer to Christ while gaining a faith based education."
Freshman,5,"There were so many good things I loved about Cornerstone for just being there one year! CU has a small environment that you see familiar faces daily. I feel the professors really care about me. I know I have created relationships that will last a lifetime. I am excited to build stronger relationships next year. I know my faith has grown so much. Being away from my family and developing what I believe is true for myself has been an awesome journey. I have learned to hear from God more. My year was far from perfect. I would describe my first year at Cornerstone overwhelming. The word overwhelming can be a bad thing but can also be a good thing. I learned to let go of many situations and let God. I learned God can turn any bad situation into a good one to bring Him. I am excited for years to come to learn more in the education setting, athletically, with relationships, and with my faith. I have learned so much so far and cannot wait to learn more. Highly recommend Cornerstone!"
Freshman,5,Cornerstone is a great place to choose for your college experience. I would have to say that I made a smart decision choosing Cornerstone over Calvin.
Niche User,5,The people working at the university is one of the best things that the school has. They make you feel in home everyday and they are willing to help you in whatever you need. The location is also a great thing for Cornerstone.
Freshman,5,I plan on attending Cornerstone in the fall and have loved all the visits I've been on. The professors are awesome and the food is good too. What sold me on Cornerstone is the new creativity and innovation honors program that they are offering.
Junior,5,Cornerstone's dynamic approach to a liberal arts education has allowed me to educated broadly and make myself more employable in the future. Everything from Philosophy to upper level Marketing courses have provided me a unique opportunity to analyze problems in the world and seek to bring positive and culturally satisfying solutions to the table.
Graduate Student,5,"The best decision I ever made was to attend Cornerstone.  It has been a great experience with students, professors and courses."
Sophomore,5,"Cornerstone University is a super well rounded school! It has small classrooms which allow you to get to know your classmates very well and your professor. The professors are amazing at answering questions, setting up meetings, and caring about your success in all aspects of life."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Cornerstone University. The school has created an amazing environment for growth as an individual, as a follower of Jesus Christ, and as a young professional. The faculty and at the school is phenomenal, personal, and individually invested in each student! The approachability of the leadership is one of the aspects of CU that sets it apart. Students have a great opportunity to enter into mentoring relationships with many of the faculty and staff, and are given the ability to truly shape the campus and culture of CU."
Sophomore,5,"After freshman year, both of my roommates left the school; however, I still feel attending is the best decision I made toward my future."
Niche User,5,"From what i have been around when on campus at Cornerstone, I love it here! The professors are very dedicated and connect well with the students! not only will you grow in education but you will grow in your christian faith! Great Recommendation"
Niche User,5,"I've visited the campus before, and it is very lovely. The students make you feel welcomed, the classes are small, and church service is really involved. It is a very likable campus, I don't have any disagreements on how the college is run."
Niche User,5,"Its an amazing campus and very friendly atmosphere.  I can't wait to attend here next year, because it's so amazing.  Great Programs."
Freshman,5,"Cornerstone is flat out amazing. The professors genuinely care about your education and almost always pray before each class or at least the beginning of the week. The food is A++, love it. The dorm life is pretty good. The rooms are a decent size, with about three/four pieces of furniture for each person. All of the faculty and RA/RDs are always happy to help. There is little partying even though there are no curfew hours for sophomores and upperclassmen. Activities are always happening and there are a blast. The sports are really fun to watch and Cornerstone has some pretty amazing teams. Overall, who wouldn't want to live somewhere so cool?"
Freshman,5,"The first time I stepped on campus, I felt like I was at home. Everyone is so amazing here and I can connect with others through my faith in Jesus."
College Senior,5,The safety on campus is wonderful! I've never felt threatened
College Sophomore,5,We are the safest college in Michigan!
College Sophomore,5,"Cornerstone is the best. Our president, Joe Stowell is amazing and very loving. The atmosphere is great, and I have already made lifelong friends."
College Senior,5,I love my school and the people I've met there
College Senior,5,"I have never felt unsafe while on campus, either in the daytime or at night. Campus Safety is very helpful, approchable, and consistent."
College Sophomore,5,Caught with drugs/alcohol= kicked out
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe. I only ever hear about dorm fires.
College Junior,5,"I have only lived in Pickitt and Keithley, so I can not speak for the other dorms, but I have really enjoyed my expereince in the buildings I have lived in. Some of them are older than others so I don't expect the old ones to be that great when it comes to how appealing the interior looks."
College Junior,5,"I have learned so much through the classes I have taken and the professors all care about not only how I'm doing in school, but outside of school as well. I have made friendships that I know will last a lifetime, and I have enjoyed the atmosphere that this school has provided."
College Freshman,5,I love the curriculum in the courses that I am taking. The workload depends on which classes and the number of credits one is taking.
College Freshman,5,There is a ton of diversity on campus. I love the amount of diversity at Cornerstone
College Freshman,5,I have never seen or heard about drugs on campus
College Freshman,5,"There is little to no crime on campus. The police are never seen on campus because there is never a need for them to come. I feel very safe on campus, even when walking back to my dorm from night classes."
College Freshman,5,I love my courses and my professors. The professors really care about the students and their success. They are passionate about their field and they love the Lord.
College Freshman,5,I am looking forward to my internship as well as my job placement. Cornerstone does a great job helping students find a job that they love in their field of study
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus! The community both inside and outside of the dorms is the best. I love my dorm!
College Freshman,5,"Cornerstone is fantastic when it comes to sports. Whenever there is a game, there is a huge turnout. The best part is that the teams play for charity and they always do their best."
College Freshman,5,I love my school! The best part about my school is the community. Everyone is so kind and accepting of others. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
College Junior,5,I really enjoy my time here :)
College Freshman,5,Athletics is a pretty big deal here at Cornerstone.
College Freshman,5,This campus is extremely safe.
College Freshman,5,Campus is very safe and secure.  Health and safety is taken very seriously.
College Freshman,5,"I feel completely safe and secure on campus. Campus safety does a fabulous job of creating an atmosphere where students are comfortable and secure. I do not know of an crimes that have taken place, though I can't say there haven't been any I just haven't heard of."
Freshman,4,"Cornerstone is a nice small college. It has a great community. The professors are great and they’re there to help you if you need anything. The dorms are really nice, and the campus is easy to navigate."
Sophomore,4,"Cornerstone exemplifies the Christian culture. If you want a university focused on community and growing in Christ, then this is the place to go! The only downside is the small campus means there will be small classes. This may seem like a positive at first, but you will most likely run into scheduling difficulties at certain times. However, your academic advisors go out of their way to ensure you matter to them, and they are with you every step of the way! If you truly want to build a life that matter, attend Cornerstone University."
Junior,4,"It's been good, considering no one planned for this. The professors were so understanding and checked in with us all the time. Didn't do zoom calls so that was nice because we could do at our own time."
Junior,4,"I loved Cornerstone University. Small class sizes, everything is less than a 10 minute walk from all the other buildings. Great community, but could be better. The chapel services and worship is good too. It is a pre-dominant white culture if  you like to look into that. Has a great international student community, every international student is friends with the other and therefore, you'll be fine coming here."
Freshman,4,"The Bible division professors at cornerstone are top notch. They truly care about their students’ lives and ministries, and they are always willing to take time out of their schedules to grab a coffee and chat. They model discipleship really well, and they’re insanely smart. I love the campus. Art and sculptures can be found all around campus, always reminding me of God’s great story."
Junior,4,"Very small Christian conservative college, students are strong in their beliefs so are the professors."
Freshman,4,"For the most part, it is great! However, the freshman class that you have to take is awful and unneeded."
Freshman,4,"I love that Cornerstone University cares about their students. The campus makes it easy to feel at home, rather than just another day at school."
Freshman,4,"Cornerstone is an amazing university with amazing people, students and professors alike. It is not as expensive as most private schools, but it is still expensive, and the food could be better. Overall, the academics are great and the programs solid. The dorm life is great. Would recommend."
Junior,4,"Overall, staff and faculty really care and are willing to work with you. However, organization in a lot of the offices is somewhat lacking."
Junior,4,"Cornerstone University is a good University to attend. As a Christian based University, the instructors really show that they care about their students.  All departments from Student and Financial Advisors have been remarkable. I find the cirriculum and assignments to be highly enlightening and useful in the workforce. The assignments are manageable for a busy work and home life. I would highly recommend returning adults to utilize Cornerstone University if they are choosing a school to continue their education. I have had a veey positive and have been very successful at Cornerstone University and give them a high reccomendation.  If you are looking to further your education, I suggest you call Cornerstone University. They offer in class and on- line  classes for adult PGS students. Choose Cornerstone and I promise that you will not regret it."
Senior,4,A small conservative christian university with baptist roots. Diversity is something they lack but that is something that is getting much better. Profs are great and truly care for their students
Junior,4,"Cornerstone University is a Christian based university that focuses on ways to find who you are. At this school it focuses on how you can improve your walk with Christ and to understand how to express who you are. The campus is not that big so getting to class is no problem. And the professors genuinely care about your academic success. I would recommend this school to those who were taught in smaller schools, and to those who don’t want to move that far away from home. It’s located in Grand Rapids which is a great city for many opportunities."
Senior,4,"Cornerstone University is an awesome school for students that desire a more intimate class setting. The professors are very personable and welcoming. It is very easy to connect to other students, faculty, and staff because the class sizes are on the smaller spectrum. There are pros and cons, going to a private Christian college. The school has a lack of diversity, but the staff and faculty work hard to welcome in and embrace all cultures, so that the CU community can be rich in color, background, and tradition. God is prominent in the classroom, and every class begins with a prayer. Cornerstone provides a rigorous academic program for their students and incorporates many study abroad opportunities, creating a very well rounded experience for the students."
Alum,4,"I liked the Christ-centered environment. I connected with, felt important to, and respected many of my professors."
Junior,4,"It is a great Christian college-very firm and steadfast in their beliefs, and they train all who come through their doors to reflect Christ in all they do.  Professors are the highlight of the campus, they care about your future, they will take interest in you and your life, they connect with you on a daily basis."
Freshman,4,"What I love about Cornerstone is how open they are about real life issues, and express ways we can help. Cornerstone is a community that genuinely cares about your well being. Cornerstone is very personal, friendly and open about their faith. It's not about religion with them, it's about connecting with others through the love of Christ."
Junior,4,"Overall, CU is a decent school for returning adults.  You can take advantage of weekly 1 night evening classes which work best for your busy schedule.

One thing that was good in theory was not so good in practice.  Their PLT's or Professional Learning Teams were a bugger.  It was nice to be teamed up with 3 or four other students of which you could learn from.  However, after the niceties wear off people can be at each others throats.  Some don't complete work on time thus putting you against t he clock to get things done.  

In the end, it is a personal choice you have to deal with."
Senior,4,"As a senior, I've had the opportunity to reflect on my entire four year experience at Cornerstone. While no university can be perfect, this campus is going in the right direction. The professors cared for me and the learning of all of our students, the staff and faculty want to see the campus positvely progressing, and the extracurricular programs fostered spiritual growth"
Junior,4,"It's a great university and you can connect with others easily. The atmosphere is fun and people genuinely care about others there. Unless you like to party, drugs, or drink alcohol, the campus is amazing to attend and beautiful."
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience here has been trilling and exhausting. Between our transition or Terra Firma week before classes and the hard academic life here at CU, I've managed to meet so many wonderful peopleand faculty. I'd love to see more emphasis and development in the film program so that aspiring filmmakers like myself get even more experience and funding for our projects."
College Senior,4,"The professors care, the classes provided function as they should, and the atmosphere is wonderful. Obviously not perfect, but still great!"
College Senior,4,The new Center for Student Success is a great visionary team dedicated to helping students find and create a career. Couldn't be happier. It was a sore missing spot in the academic side of campus that has now been filled.
College Senior,4,"The community life is, by far, the best aspect of the dorms. Dorms are dorms, they just aren't big, so the community makes up for it."
College Senior,4,"Cornerstone isn't for everyone. I understand that. But, for those who are invested in learning and growing spiritually, it is a great place to do that. Since I started going here, I noticed need for change on campus. Since then, I've applied myself wherever I can in order to help make these changes. The university puts so much in the hands of the students, so I've been able to see noticeable, positive change in the community. If you put in the effort, staff and faculty can see that and will reward you with responsibility."
College Sophomore,4,"Cornerstone is 4th in the state in my field (education), and that;s comparing it to all the big schools like U of M and Michigan State."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school. I feel like I am learning a lot, academically and spiritually. I love my friends, I love my RA, and I hope to be an RA next year. I wish Cornerstone had better science facilities, though"
College Sophomore,4,I love the dorm life. The RA's are the best
College Sophomore,4,We have the 2015 winners of the NAIA championship and an amazing baseball field
College Freshman,4,"Christian college aside, it's very much based on community. Everyone is friendly and accepting."
College Senior,4,I really enjoy my lab courses
College Senior,4,There is a lot of opportunities in the GR area
College Senior,4,I always feel very safe on campus
College Senior,4,I love my RAs and the people who I live with
College Senior,4,As an athlete I love the all-student integration
College Senior,4,The professors in my program and at the university in general are very proficient in their field and offer unique experiences and information. The value of each course I have taken is high and I will use the skills I have learned in my professional life.
College Senior,4,"I have had no trouble receiving internship and job opportunities in my areas of interest--the career and life calling office helped place me with an internship and encouraged me in my abilities. There is also a job networking site that all students can sign up for through the school, which makes job searches easier."
College Senior,4,"There are several housing options on campus that allow you to experience dorm life suited to your current year--the community life is excellent in each dorm, and provides opportunities to make close friends while staying close to your classes."
College Senior,4,"The basebal field is one of the best in the region, and many other schools use it for practices as well. Several athletes have been awarded state and national awards for their outstanding performance as student athletes, and recently one of our baseball players was drafted to play baseball for the Pirates."
College Senior,4,"I am constantly learning about what loving and caring for others with the love of Christ looks like in my field through interactions with my professors and classmates. As CU prepares me for my future as a counselor, seeing these lessons translate in to fruitful, meaningful work and interactions in my daily life has been one of the most rewarding things about choosing CU."
College Freshman,4,Hardly anything ever happens on campus and the crime reports are extremely low. There are cameras in every building and we are able to call campus safety at any time.
College Freshman,4,"The school is very helpful in providing internship and job opportunities for students, and many of the workers on campus are alumni."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors care deeply about all of their students and want them to do the best that they can in their courses. Class sizes aren't huge, the biggest ones are the general classes that everyone has to take, and I like that they are pretty small. There isn't a huge variety of courses offered but the ones that are offered, are pretty decent."
College Freshman,4,"The housing process is difficult the lower you are in the number of credits. Living on campus is fun but during the weekends, most people go home and campus is dead. Some dorms are better than others when it comes to social atmosphere and the open dorm policy is rough sometimes."
College Freshman,4,"I love that Cornerstone is small and that it's easy to get to know almost everybody. Most of the professors are very willing to help you in any way, or just sit and talk about life, and are interested in getting to know the students."
College Freshman,4,"I love being able to go to my room and being able to study, but as the same time leave my door open and socialize with the girls in my hall. I also love going to campus events such as swingtime, open mic night, night of nets events as well as hanging out with my friends, swing dancing, section sneaks, and movies,"
College Freshman,4,"Cornerstone's athletics program is very good and that shows. A lot of people, both students and the community, com to the games. The school is very supportive of their athletic teams."
College Freshman,4,Cornerstone University is a great school that encourages you in you academics as well as your spiritual life.  I am learning a lot here and would highly recommend it to most people.
College Junior,4,I think its difficult but doable.
College Freshman,4,There is a big deal about no drugs or alcohol on campus. Don't try it here.
College Freshman,4,"Academics are rigorous, yet achievable.  Help is offered every step of the way."
College Freshman,4,I love Cornerstone. The Faculty is amazing and the students are friendly.
College Freshman,4,Career prospects are very bright.  Cornerstone is very helpful in acquiring internships and jobs before and after graduation.
College Freshman,4,Campus Housing has a great social atmosphere.  Everyone is very friendly.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Cornerstone University are fun, wholesome, and competitive."
College Freshman,4,"Cornerstone University is a great school.  Everyone, from the faculty and staff, to the students, is welcoming, caring, and involved.  It is never difficult to find someone to talk to or to find help."
College Sophomore,4,"This is a great Christ centered community and there is no doubt about it. The small size makes it so you will never be a number, but rather your professor will take an interest in you personally and know your name. That means however that there aren't as many opportunities as a larger school, but to me it's worth it. Classes will challenge you, but it will not be too difficult that you can't handle it. Some schools pride themselves on academic rigor, and although this school values that, that is not the largest focus to Cornerstone."
College Freshman,4,"While I haven't had to use the career services to look for internships quite yet, I know that they are pretty helpful. I have heard from many other students that the online services, as well as the counseling they provide in person, are very informational and advantageous."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the classes are all great. The professors are all kind and Christ-centered. They all model godly living and push us to do the same through interactions in the classroom setting. They are knowledgeable in both their professional subject areas and knowledge of the bible and Christian faith. It would be nice if more courses were offered during more times. It can be hard to schedule them all at convenient times. Class sizes are great! I love that they are fairly small and allow for more individualized learning and relationship building."
College Freshman,4,The Athletics are great at my school! The students get excited to go support the teams play and there is a lot of school spirit. The pep band that plays at the games is phenomenal and they are excellent at getting the crowd excited and loud. The athletic facilities are pretty nice. They are up to date and are kept up nicely. They are cleaned and taken care of well.
College Freshman,2,"Always hot, not very clean, OLD buildings...etc."
College Freshman,2,"Well it's a ""Christian"" college proclaiming that Alcohol is evil. What does that tell you? On the other hand, they only have a Freshman curfew."
College Sophomore,2,"If you can afford it, living on campus is a fun experience. You meet new friends and participate in a lot of cool activities. But even if you can't afford it, you have to live on campus, and the probability of getting the room or even the dorm you want is slim because of the jacked-up lottery system."
College Sophomore,2,"It's not that there aren't places to live off campus because there are. It's that the university does everything it can to force you to stay on campus because that's where they get most of their money. It's cheaper to live off campus but you're only approved if you're living with your parents/legal guardians, or over 21. That means, if your parents aren't living in Grand Rapids, basically you can't live off campus until your senior year."
College Junior,2,"We are only about 20 minutes away from Lake Michigan, so we have really bad winters. This year alone we accumulated so much snow it was a tad ridiculous! Other than the snow we do not really have that terrible of weather. I mean last year we had that time when it rained every day, and the Grand River flooded in Downtown and life on campus was muddy. Thank goodness for rain boots!"
College Freshman,2,"Snow, snow, snow and more snow in Grand Rapids."
College Sophomore,2,We do not have Greek life at my school.
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife at Cornerstone?? Sometimes we have things going on, but the odds happening every night, yeah, that does not happen. This is not a party school, so don't plan to find many places close by to do so or people going to them. "
College Sophomore,2,It's michigan...It is pretty cold. Fall is awesome but the rest of the year unitil may is cold.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to do anything off campus, you need a ride to get you there. very few take the bus."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't feel like an adult with some of these rules. i understand why they are in place at times, but other times they suck."
College Sophomore,2,"Cornerstone does have strict policies. But it's a Christian school, the rules are clearly laid out in the handbook: you know what kind of conduct you're committing to when you come here."
College Freshman,2,"In regards to religion, even though it is a Christian university, there are people who are and aren't Christian at our school. I had a roommate last year that was Catholic and she said she was unsure at first about the customs of Cornerstone because of what she was used to growing up. There were maybe two other Catholics beside her. In regards to sexual orientation, I know that homosexuality is frowned upon in the establishment because in the contract we need to sign, it specifically says that if a student was indeed gay/lesbian, they could not show their interests in the same sex. International students also attend, but with what I see, they are very few."
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of the population of CU is white.  However, the University is providing better aid for different diversities in attempt to get more ethnics in."
College Junior,2,"Nightlife at Cornerstone in the way explained here, is pretty much not allowed. But, there are different things that students do to have fun at night....movie marathons, walking around downtown, and having non-alcohol parties! Which is probably more fun anyway. There is just not the normal kind of college partying on campus here."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a lot of parking on campus. So, sometimes you have to park pretty far away from your class or dorm. The buildings are centrally located though so walking isn't a problem."
College Sophomore,2,"If you are looking for a school with a great focus on resident life and attempts to improve their sports then this is the school for you. If you are going to school for the right reasons, academics, then I suggest looking into a different school. Unless you are going for a bible major or music major, seriously consider other options especially if you are going into the science field. Outdated lab materials and horrible facilities are only a few of the frustrations. Professors are nice but you know a school isn't very good if one of the professors is recommending you transfer to a better, higher ranking school. Don't be fooled by the ""nice"" admissions counselors and perks such as the laptop program. After your freshman year, things go down hill and they basically forget about you. Also, your classes don't transfer very well because a lot of the general education courses are ""in culture"" so those who have told me ""if you hate the school so much why don't you transfer?"" trust me I have tried and am currently trying. My admissions counselor said the reason why not many people graduate from the pre-med program is because it is ""very rigorous"". I'm pretty sure they transfer because it just isn't a good program. 
Honestly, I feel like I wasted my money at this place. I could be going to a much better school for half of what I'm paying. Hopefully all my credits will transfer and I'll be at Calvin in fall 2013. "
College Sophomore,2,"Plenty of Places - If You Can Live Off Campus – Students are supposed to live at home or on campus until they are 21. This has become a bit of a problem for the housing on campus, as more students are coming to Cornerstone.  If you are able to get an exemption for living off campus before you're 21, there are apartments and houses nearby!"
College Junior,2,You're on Your Own – There are no off campus housing oppurtunities provided for the school. You're on your own on this one.
College Freshman,2,Dorms Are Tight – The dorms really bite here. there rly is no room at all. you have no personal room and the upperclassmen get the short end of the stick. and the bathrooms are not cleaned well
Senior,1,"As a ""Christian"" university you'd tend to believe that they loved God more, but they have a huge misdirect about where their priorities lie. A couple of years ago they focused on Christ, but now all they focus on is a profit. 

Another fallback is their favoritism of athletes, I cannot tell you how many times my basic needs were denied because an athlete got their way. I had to live in a dorm room with constant banging on the wall at almost all hours of the day for an entire year, athletes were to blame, when I would complain it was if nobody heard me.

If you go here, expect to be frustrated about 90% of the time, unless you are an athlete, then they will love you."
College Sophomore,1,I'm not sure this is a thing.
College Sophomore,1,It does not exist on campus.
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life here at Cornerstone.
College Junior,1,No parking and not very safe.
College Junior,1,"Absolutely terrible environment for young people to find themselves. No privacy, too many rules and NEVER ANY PARKING EVER"
College Senior,1,They are obsessed with athletics. They even cut stuff for them.
College Freshman,1,"I think that because we are a christian college we assume that all parties are bad, so we don't have any! I think that there should be parties, they just have to be fun and regulated."
College Junior,1,"As a private Christian Institution there is very little partying on-campus, if any. "
College Sophomore,1,"The one drawback to the Grand Rapids area is the lack of public transportation. If you can find a bus, if your destination is more than a few miles away it could take a good while to get there. "
College Freshman,1,"Because of the contract we must agree to before enrolling into Cornerstone University, drugs and alcohol are prohibited. In regards to transportation, I have heard about buses that come to the school, but I haven't actually seen them. Freshmen are only given a curfew (midnight on weeknights and 2am on weekends). There are no fraternities or sororities, and there are no parties to my knowledge on campus."
College Freshman,1,Most people just stay in their rooms and do homework or watch a movie. Not many people are out in the hallways having fun. It is kind of boring at night time.
College Freshman,1,Mostly White Middle Class Americans – There is not really any diversity here. Like maybe a handful of students whoa rent middle class white Americans. There are 5-6 International students..but thats about it
College Freshman,1,"Social Atmosphere – Nightlife is extremely boring at Cornerstone. There is absolutely no drinking or parties on campus, but if you look hard enough you can find a few upperclassmen that do drink. Drinking can get you into a lot of trouble at Cornerstone, so most people keep it quiet. But, it is easier to party than at other comparable Christian schools because there are plenty of colleges nearby. Most Cornerstone students do not accept people who party or anything of the sort, so if partying is a main concern, Cornerstone is not a good choice. There also aren't very many things to do on campus at night, just a lot of sitting around and watching tv with friends."
College Freshman,1,I have never gotten a student discount for food in Grand Rapids area.

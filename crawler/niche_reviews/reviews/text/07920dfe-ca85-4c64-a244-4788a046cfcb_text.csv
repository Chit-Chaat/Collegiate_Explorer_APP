Freshman,5,"NYSID’s interior design program is thorough, but quite labor intensive.  The adjunct faculty bring qualitative anecdotes that can be amusing and/or astonishing, but always noteworthy. I am confident that upon graduation, I will have a thorough understanding of my field, will have access to resources and a network of friends and contacts in ID, as well as, opportunities for further my education through a masters program.  I am and older returning student, still, I am unaware of a “party scene” at NYSID; but this is NYC, the whole city is a party scene.  In that same vein, most students don’t eat campus food, choosing instead to eat out as a group and any number of restaurants, diners, or grills that surround the Upper East Side.  There is a very active student life that offers weekly symposiums as well as visiting speakers.  There are also a number of clubs and organizations that offer great opportunities and value for the minimal dues paid."
Niche User,5,The atmosphere of this university is just awesome.                                                                                           ...............................................................................................
College Freshman,5,"NYSID: the Best Interior Design School – The New York School of Interior Design is a very unique educational institution. This is because it is the only college devoted to the study of Interior Design. It is a small school where the teachers and students are capiable of having one-on-one time with one another. Also, the teachers are actual designers in the interior design industry and they provide extremely insightful adivce and guidence to their students. This is the best college for anyone who wants to become an interior designer."
Niche User,4,I like the different options to complete my certificate program. The instructors are very helpful and share resources to aid in comprehension of course work. NYSID offers open meetings with industry experts and promotes student involvement.
Sophomore,4,It's a good school but small. The classes get canceled sometimes because of under-attendance. Tuition is too high!!
College Senior,4,Worked out fine with canvas!
College Student,4,"My school only offers one major, so everyone understands what you are doing. Classes are fun, and professors are helpful. I would choose this school again if I could do it over."
College Junior,4,"Graduate school campus is great, designed by the famous Gensler firm."
College Junior,4,"NYSID offers a lot of opportunities outside of class for students, but they don't have a better way of connecting with students outside of emails.  Focusing a career in interior design, my favorite experiences have happened outside of the classroom, being involved in organizations such as the Contract Club and IIDA Representative.  These experiences have proved invaluable in networking and meeting professionals in my field."
College Junior,4,"As a graduate Interior Design student, I feel I am supported by my professors.  There's always one person that is difficult, but I don't blame NYSID for that.  There are opportunities to grow and learn a lot, but we don't have time to really explore them.  Facilities are great, however it would be better to have doors on our studios for more privacy.  Workload is extensive, it would be nice for professors to have more interaction so that projects could be intertwined as opposed to jumping from class to class and minimizing ""busy work."""
College Sophomore,4,"One of the things I do like about the school is the amount of places were you could print all your projects, the wireless access allows us to use our personal computers. They've placed computers in the classrooms but I feel like it makes it hard for us to draw our drawings with a computer monitor on our desk"
College Junior,4,There is a great diverse group of people in my program ranging from different ages and ethnic backgrounds with many international students that always makes it interesting.   You are learning from classmates as well as from the instructors.
College Junior,4,"It was very convenient, plenty of reading required, and very informative"
College Freshman,4,i have only taken 1 class but it all went smoothly
College Junior,4,"As a commuter and part time student, the work load is very demanding.  All classes I have taken are related to my major, but some classes could be combined to improve the quality of the curriculum.  The job opportunities are limited to the school's state and wish it included more growth in neighboring states."
College Junior,4,"Every professor is somehow directly involved with the interior design, or architectural industry outside of the classroom. The majority are active working professionals in the field. You gain connections, and valuable insight just by being in the classroom. I am very grateful to have been able to learn from such knowledgable and creative people - each and every one of them has had something of great value to contribute to my education thus far, and I highly doubt that I will find myself disappointed in the future. The class sizes are small: usually between 10-15 people (aside from the lecture courses, which tend to be much larger), and so you really are able to get the personal attention from your professor that you may not be able to get in a larger school. I think NYSID is an amazing gateway to the interior design world in NYC, or otherwise - they send their students off well prepared. I'm very happy having chosen this school. :)

College Student,4,"All different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities. the down side is that there are no off days for any holidays except thanksgiving"
College Student,4,"The classes are amazing, teachers are great! it is not a cheap school, but its well worth the money"
College Freshman,4,"NYSID: Hassle Free – There has honestly been not one negative thing about my experience so far with the New York School of Interior Design. I have had no problems with scheduling my classes, or transferring credits."
College Freshman,4,"NYSID: Helpful in All Aspects – The New York School of Interior Design has reasonable tuition costs. It also has a very helpful staff in regards to financial aid. There are many oppertunities to recive financial aid from the school itself, and they are very helpful with providing other options for scholarships, grants and loans."
College Senior,2,They fired the last financial aid individual and rightfully so.  Most people understand that a college can't tell you what financial institutions to select for financial aid - but they should provide help in selecting them and educating the student body.  They didn't even offer financial aid through the government directly when I started there.  This came with the new financial aid individual.
College Senior,2,"Again, they are very limited.  They do not have a career center and the job prospects take advantage of students - in regards to how much they are paid and how much they actually learn."
College Sophomore,2,The Financial Aid process has made my experience very negative
College Sophomore,2,My experience with Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office hasn't been as great as it's been with the other schools I've attended.
Recent Alumnus,2,A lot of networking opportunities as professors are professionals in the industry but very difficult to focus on networking when so much time is spent trying to figure out the courses and complete demanding coursework in such a short amount of time. 
Recent Alumnus,2,Only one major in this particular school which means all Interior Design all the time. Makes for a very competitive environment and very minimal talk about other subjects
Recent Alumnus,2,Workload is extremely heavy. Very difficult to attend full-time and carry a job which is necessary to pay for the expensive tuition.
Recent Alumnus,2,Value of education is not worth the large amount of money spent. Courses are given in an order which makes it difficult to grasp the curriculum and expectations.
Recent Alumnus,2,Materials Library and access to a handful of libraries throughout NYC
Recent Alumnus,2,"No athletics, Student groups are unorganized with rarely any meetings or benefits. Campus appearance is very poor for a school of Interior Design"
Niche User,1,"The poor treatment I received by one of NYSID's professors and an academic advisor, Judith Gura and Katie Tomko, was enough to make me shun this school for good.
I had a minor and temporary medical disability and found Judith Gura and Katie Tomko to be both inflexible and unsympathetic to making any reasonable accommodations in coursework (after I paid full tuition, naturally). 
As a continuing ed student with a BA and MA in Art History I had an absolutely horrible experience at this school."
Graduate Student,1,"The only thing I like about this school is how easy it is to get in, almost anyone applied can get in. I've seen my classmate got in with a portfolio that is just a bunch of terrible quality jpg files not even laying out on pages, and the overall student work quality are just subpar comparing to other NYC design schools. There is no peering learning at the school, the physical buildings' locations (uptown and midtown) and interior layout (sarcastically it's an interior design school) does not incouraging peer learning, and their policy of accepting anyone they can does not help with peering learning either.  
The thing that annoyed me most is that the school does not assign students with a .edu email address, which is very inconvenient for us to have to mix our personal email with school emails, and having trouble registering student software licenses and student organizations."
College Senior,1,"No flexibility of classes, hassles and frustrations are typical weekly."
College Senior,1,"There is no campus, although NY City is the campus.  However, there is a $ requirement each semester for activities that are very limited and do not consider the entire population of the school."
Recent Alumnus,1,Computers are too old and slow to support heavy design software mandatory for course work. Printers are always down and a struggle to get simple print out.

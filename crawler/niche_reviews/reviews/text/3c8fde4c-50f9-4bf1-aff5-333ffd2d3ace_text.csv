Graduate Student,5,"I have taken several online classes at UHart via Zoom and Collaborate. The professors have made the transition to online learning smooth and easy. Of course, nothing compares to in-person learning, but I have been able to receive quality information online as well. The professors are very patient and understanding when students have technical difficulties."
Freshman,5,"I am entering the university this fall, and it's already an overall good school. I had about two visits, one was for a campus tour, and my other visit was for national portfolio day, both visits were exceptional. The teachers are very professional and kind, the students are welcoming. The overall environment is positive and homey. I am very excited to attend and pursue a career in the arts at the University of Hartford!"
Freshman,5,"As an incoming student I can not say I had an online class experience but due to covid orientation, and campus visits have been delayed or done online. The online orientation was great! It was literally like meeting in person, I know due to the current situation, online classes will probably be great."
Senior,5,Their transition to online platform was much smoother than I imagined it would be. Once we were released from school for COVID-19 we were back to classes within no time. Professors did well with making themselves available and overall the University provided a lot of assistance and hope for the future during the challenging times.
Freshman,5,I can say very honestly that I love going to Hart. I love being on a sports team and the environment of the campus. I love the people and the campus is not bad. The only thing I would say that bothers me a bit is the quality of the education for the price.
Junior,5,What was so unique about the University of Hartford was the overall atmosphere. Art felt like it had its own field along with the academics which is rare to find.
Niche User,5,"I love this school. They have great vegan and vegitarian options in the dining hall if that is something that you need. Also, I highly recommend the over nights they offer. This really helped me fall in love with the school and the area."
Niche User,5,"This university is more like a family than a traditional university. I greatly appreciate the small classroom setting which is better for learning and retaining information. Then professors actually care about you passing and ask about how your doing. Also, if they notice your falling off they would help guide you back on the right path. This school also offers several opportunities such as studying abroad, internships/ job opportunities and more. This school has a lot to offer."
Freshman,5,"I love the community feel, the surrounding campus, and the classes. The one thing I could say that should be improved is the quality of some of the professors as it’s very spotty whether you get a great professor or a terrible one here."
Works Here,5,"I have been doing contemporary music research in The Hartt School for one year as a visiting scholar. Contemporary music development here is very perspective. I have been listened 20 more concerts of contemporary composition in two semesters with ensemble, wind ensemble, orchestra and none of them are repetitive."
Niche User,5,I like University of Hartford because they have great academics and extra activities to keep the students engaged.
Alum,5,Offered great experience in community Nursing.  The program was flexible and able to complete while working and having a family. I especially enjoyed the opportunity to work in the community of Hartford.
Freshman,5,The experience at the University of Hartford is beautiful. I am a freshman so I am very excited to be on my own. The campus is very big and beautiful. The food could be alittle better.
Senior,5,"The University of Hartford changed my life. In high school, I wasn't very involved in clubs, the community, or my studies. The campus atmosphere is incredibly inviting and I was able to open up right away and take on new opportunities that will lead me to a brighter future after graduation. Within my first year, I felt confident enough to involve myself in the Women's Advancement Initiative (an organization unique to UHart), a community service fraternity, studying abroad planning, orientation leaders, and in student government. I stand out amongst my peers when it comes to public speaking because of my involvement with the university. There is not a moment that goes by on that campus where I do not feel at home."
Alum,5,"Great curriculum, wide variety of majors, great on campus involvement, and plenty of support from staff and students!"
Senior,5,The student to professor ratio is impressive compared to other colleges in the area. Quality of education and impressive faculty members that are dedicated to helping students through their college careers in anyway they possibly can. This increases student confidence and enthusiasm to work hard to accomplish individual goals.
Sophomore,5,Everyone has a smile on their face around campus. the professors are very credible and love what they do.
Junior,5,"I've been here for only half the semester but, it truly has been a great experience and I'm glad I chose this place to start my art degree."
Junior,5,Opportunities are available for everyone of a variety of backgrounds. There’s a place for everyone to grow and develop at the rate that individual needs.
Freshman,5,What I love about the school is the diversity. When I got there I felt welcomed like it was the best decision I made in my life.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed every moment I've spent at the university! I became super involved and met some of my closest friends and I couldn't be happier with my college experience!
Freshman,5,"What I like about the University Of Hartford community is just everything about it, the academics are fantastic, the athletics are outstanding and the community itself is just very vibrant and good energy. There's so much to do on campus, the staff is amazing, I've met so many wonderful friends I'm proud to have for life and just very grateful for having the chance to come to a school like this. This has really change my-life for the better, in more ways than one speaking. One thing I would like to change to the UHART Community is adding more bus service on campus for students traveling on and off campus, along with added a couple more sports to the athletics department. However, overall I'm rather please and grateful that I have the opportunity to attend a wonderful school like UHART and to please not only myself, but everyone around me in the process. It's fantastic and I wouldn't change anything about my decision to attend this school."
Junior,5,The University of Hartford has given me so many great opportunities to be involved with my community and help other broken communities. The faculty at the University are very helpful and easy to communicate with. Everyone is very understanding and I feel like I have a voice and it can be heard. The environment and other peers are great energy and very homey. I love it here!
Graduate Student,5,My experience is with the University of Hartford's Master's Nursing Education Program.  It has smaller class sizes and is convenient for the adult learner. I feel that the program is helpful with ensuring success for their students.
Sophomore,5,Uhart has a great community. You immediately feel like family there and have great pride for your university. There is so many options for help on campus. The class rooms are small as well so you are able to have a teacher student interaction which I find crucial for understanding the taught material.
Sophomore,5,"University of Hartford is a really wonderful school that provides an immense amount of opportunities to its students. As a student majoring in education, it is extremely useful that I am able to start getting experience in a classroom in the first semester. It's easy to connect with people, and there is a real sense of community within the school. Meeting new people is easy too, so you can form an intimate group of friends quickly. The class sizes are small, so the professor knows your name early on in the semester. As for things I would change, however, I would want to change the dining hall situation up a little so there are more healthy options so certain students who are struggling with their weight aren't tempted as much to eat very fatty foods. Overall, the school is a wonderful place to go for education, making friends, and truly earning your degree and getting out there in the work force as soon as you graduate."
Freshman,5,"I'm a student at the Hartt School, majoring in music education. I have to say that Hartt (and the University of Hartford as a whole) is a great place with a lot to offer if you work hard. The music program here is extremely challenging and the faculty is great, and the faculty for the classes I've had outside of Hartt are pretty much just as good. The dorm life, food, and athletics are also pretty good. If you're considering the performing arts as a career choice, UHart is a really smart choice in schools."
Niche User,5,"I am an incoming freshmen at the University Of Hartford, and I am very excited to be attending in the fall. When I visited, I was happy to know that the campus had the homely feeling on the campus. I love how friendly and involved everyone was with one another. There isn't anything right now that I would like to change about the school."
Freshman,5,I love this school... check it out for engineering ... it’s a great small program. At other schools professors don’t even know who you are.  It’s not a big campus which is nice. Excellent job placement after graduating as well.  They rank right up there with Carnagie Melon in US News reports
Sophomore,5,"UHart has a been a great experience thus far. The academic class sizes are very small and most of the professors are friendly and approachable. the largest lecture hall only seats 80 people, and I have never seen it more than half full. The Hartt school is a wonderful school with a variety of opportunities for people who wish t minor in the preforming arts."
Niche User,5,"Thus far, I have had a very good experience with University of Hartford. I am not a student there, but I hope to be in the fall of 2018. The online application was easy to figure out and not too complicated of a process. I have also heard very good things about the Hartt School, which is the performing arts school that is part of University of Hartford. When I visited the campus in October I was very impressed with how the school was run and the faculty and students I met. Overall, I believe the school is a very good school for anyone, because of the amount of majors and diversity of interests among the students."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the University of Hartford. Ever teacher engages with their students. Everyone is kind and looks out for each other like one big family
Junior,5,"My overall experience at the University of Hartford is great. The atmosphere there is very pleasant and welcoming. You can also feel the greatness of the school. Before I came to the college I lived in a bad area where motivation, greatness and aid from anyone just wasn't there. When I entered the school I felt like I can complete anything if I put my mind to it. The school itself is a bit of  the pricy side but it's worth it. The whole faculty puts in 100% of their efforts helping you when you are in need. The college is completely safe. Public Safety is out there making sure everything is okay and they do this 24/7. You will always see them around. The food here is amazing. The school understands that there is a lot of students from different parts of the world so they change it up everyday. I would advise anybody I know and their parents to learn at the University of Hartford"
Freshman,5,"Its such a welcoming school, all the teachers and student want you to be successful and want you to be active as much as possible with things around the school."
Junior,5,"The professors and admin are wonderful and helpful to getting the students where they need to be academically, finically, and mentally. The campus is beautiful and offers just what students on and off campus need. I would change the opportunities for scholarships- there are not many offered, and I've met several students who had to drop out due to the expenses."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I enjoy my time at University of Hartford and feel that it's worthwhile to attend the school. Here are the things that especially stick out to me:

The food is top-notch. I actually eat better at school than at home!

Student facilities are pretty nice, too. There's ~50 practice rooms (each with a piano) that even non-music students can use, several large common ""hangout"" rooms (some with ping-pong tables and the like), and an impressive library.

I have no significant complaints about the school."
Freshman,5,"When I visited the University of Hartford I like it, even if it wasn't my first choice of university but i said I'll just apply for it and from there within 3 weeks I got a letter in my mail box. It's a pretty nice university their classes aren't full decent student."
Junior,5,"Great staff and outstanding student body, but if one thing needs to be changed it would have to be the tuition cost."
Niche User,5,My experience at the University of Hartford was great! I went there to audition for the Hartt School of Music and everything was well organized. The professors and students were very helpful and heart-warming.
Sophomore,5,As a second semester sophomore at the University of Hartford I have learned so much from my professors. I have learned how to be independent and free for all. I have learned great ways to study and be prepared for the real world.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Greek Life is one of many organizations on campus that have the highest GPA and raise the most money for their philanthropies and the community. Of course they party, but that's not just what they're all about."
Recent Alumnus,5,"This school made me into the leader and professional I am today. Thanks to amazing professors and joining Greek Life and other organizations, I feel fully prepared to go out into my field. For those who complain about UHA, take a step out of your comfort zone and actually DO something. Join a club, get to know your professors... this University is small, but it offers A LOT."
College Junior,5,We have such a diverse campus! The students that go here are overall extremely accepting or just don't have an opinion about other people. It's a safe environment to be whoever you want to be.
College Junior,5,"Gen-eds are a requirement, but those classes give you a variety of perspectives from students you wouldn't usually have in your classes, especially if your major is more of a cohort. The courses within and outside of your major are all amazing. There's always something to find that makes a course worth going to, whether it's the topic, the professor, or your peers. Class sizes are always small, capped at 25, and the professors are there because they really love to teach and love their subject."
College Junior,5,"Degrees from the University of Hartford are well respected out in the ""real world."" It's known that to get a degree from here, you've worked hard and learned just about everything you need to start a career. Career Services on campus is willing to help you build your resume, find an internship or job, even after you graduate."
College Sophomore,5,"I have no regrets about choosing the University of Hartford. The school has a very warm and positive atmosphere. The students are very welcoming, the professors care about their students and take the time to get to know them, and the student body is very diverse and open to different cultures."
College Sophomore,5,My dorm during my freshman year was bigger and better than I thought.
College Sophomore,5,On weekends the night life is great. Always a good time if you have good friends to hang out with
College Sophomore,5,Partys are usually always great. If the one you're at isn't cun. you'll be sure to find another one somewhere else on campus
College Sophomore,5,They're so many different programs you can take and it totally up to you
College Sophomore,5,from what I've witnessed at Uhart I love it. Which i why I fell in love with the school and had to be there.
College Sophomore,5,I believe a degree from this school is going to do my resume justice.
College Sophomore,5,I don't know if i'm being biased but I definitely think this is my dream school. I literally spent my entire summer working and preparing for this school year just to attend school here. If you are supposed to be here it will feel like home and you won't want to leave.
College Senior,5,Public Safety does a lot to keep this campus safe and they are doing a great job.
College Senior,5,University of Hartford puts a lot of money into the sports complex and it shows. It's a very nice complex with multiple gyms and two pools. The sports center caters to both athletes and nonathletes. Overall it is Awesome for the small school.
College Sophomore,5,I've gotten involved in Greek life as well as club rugby and have had numerous discussions with professors about my concerns and questions regarding classes as well as my education in general.
College Sophomore,5,"The school has an excellent engineering program, graduates from it get the same jobs as those from Ivy Leagues."
College Sophomore,5,I really did not expect to enjoy it as much as I do.
Recent Alumnus,5,Finding an internship was a great experience! My academic counselor assisted me with this and I have 3 different internships while there and recevied college credit for them! This was a great opportunity to get me out of the classroom and applying the knowledge I had received. I highly reccommend internships!
Recent Alumnus,5,"Joining my sorority was a geat experience! Meeting people from all different backgroungs, interests, major, etc. made it worthwhile. I never felt alone and always had a friend to go anywhere/study with. I know for certain these ladies will be in my life forever."
Freshman,4,"Most of my classes this year have been a hybrid, which means that half of the classes are online and the other is in person.  This model works for many people  and there haven't been any problems."
Freshman,4,"All of professors I've had are supportive and genuinely want you to succeed.  Since the class sizes are small, you have a chance to form closer relationships with peers and faculty."
Senior,4,"The campus life is nice, and teachers are kind.  Do not go to this school if you are looking to study Computer Science or Computer Engineering; their program is significantly lacking and I would have gotten a better education from somewhere more specialized in tech and Computer Science."
Senior,4,"My computer science professor did not take advantage of the online format of classes during Covid-19.  It was essentially the same experience you would get in person: sitting in class with a computer and listening to a powerpoint presentation, then doing some minor coding or theory."
Graduate Student,4,"The University of Hartford has excellent programs in every college/department/school. The school I attend, the Hartt School, is a top-notch performing arts conservatory that connects students with professionals around the area, along with providing a world-class education from impressive faculty. There are also a variety of certifications that you can get along with your degree, further bolstering your career prospects."
Junior,4,University of Hartford has a really nice campus. Most courses are easy to get to since all the academic building are next to each other. People there are very diverse.
Junior,4,University of Hartford has a really nice campus. Most courses are easy to get to since all the academic building are next to each other. People there are very diverse.
Freshman,4,As a first year student at the University of Hartford I would have to say I love the campus. There are so many calming areas to eat and relax or study and just enjoy the weather. Majority of the areas are places where students can really get alone time to focus when places like the library are overcrowded.
Freshman,4,"Whether it is zoom conference calls or consistent clarification within the classroom environment. Certain professor, specifically my all time favorite Professor Rastede. She bring enthusiasm to the classroom and has changed the perspective of taught chemistry more understandable and easy to complete."
Sophomore,4,"UHart isn't the largest school, but it's plenty cozy. When you live on campus, anything you'd need is no more than a short walk away. Friends, food, classes, whatever it may be, it is all within reach. Aside from the fact that I have to pay to be here, I don't really have any complaints."
Junior,4,"My online experience was honestly so stressful, but it couldn't be helped. As a Hartt music student, most of my classes are skill based. Many of my assignments were recordings that I had to submit. Many of my classes just didn't happen in lieu of new weekly assignments. I ended the semester with straight As, but it was very difficult."
Junior,4,"As a music student, I spend most of my time at the Hartt building. I don't see much outside of Hartt, but what I see at Hartt is generally great. The professors honestly care about their students and classes are small enough often (8-15 students, sometimes smaller) that it's easy to build rapport with each other."
Sophomore,4,It's a pretty good school once you get used to it and learn the ropes. There is a lot of on campus things to do once you put yourself out there
Junior,4,"I have only taken one online class at UHART. I have had other classes that integrated some online features in addition to the in-person classes. My overall experience has been fairly adequate. The professors are timely with their responses, and the online portal we use is easy to navigate."
Junior,4,The main reason I enrolled to the Hartt School at University of Hartford is because the class sizes are quite small. This makes for a better learning experience. I have felt that I received more attention and dedication because of this reason.
Sophomore,4,"My freshman year at Hartford was good, to say the least. I liked a lot of my teachers so I guess i was lucky. The food there is great but I wouldn't suggest going to the cafeteria in-between meal times unless you want to just snack on fries. The freshman dorms could be better though, I lucked out by getting Hawk Hall but the complexes need work if we're all gonna pay the same price for housing."
Sophomore,4,"I personally didn't like online learning. I wasn't bad it's just that I learn better in a classroom setting so online learning was a struggle for me. Sometimes my internet would go in and out so I would miss part of the class or I would get bored of staring at a computer screen for an hour and lose focus of the task at hand so, yeah. Not my ideal college experience."
Senior,4,I love the diversity on campus and the willingness to advocate on taboo topics. Being at the university and surrounded by open minded individuals helped me grow as a person while getting my education. UHart has shaped me into who I have always wanted to be.
Senior,4,"I love the professors I have had at the University of Hartford. They are very personal, and very involved in their students success. I have traveled abroad with a professor, which is one of the most amazing experiences in my life. It makes going to class everyday easy and pushes me to exceed."
Senior,4,"I, like many, took classes online with my school due to the virus. Though my teachers and academic advisors were not familiar with teaching remotely, I think they did a great job adjusting. I had multiple video meetings every day, and felt like my work load was comparable to what it would be normally.

Another good thing about Uhart is that they offer online classes to take while you are still full time on campus. For example, I am registered to take and Epidemiology class online this coming fall, which allows me to open up some time for a part time job to help me pay for tuition. Having the option to do this, and having advisors who form my schedule to my specific situation is what has allowed me to succeed at Uhart."
Alum,4,I took 2 online courses at UHart. The professors gave the course material ahead of time and you worked on the assignments as needed.
Alum,4,University of Hartford was a good school to attend for my BA. I was a student that commuted so I did not experience the dorm life but did visit fellow students  and hang out.
Alum,4,"I liked the feeling of safety i felt at this school, especially with current events. The campus is relaxing and allows for solitary studying time outside."
Sophomore,4,The academics are pretty good and professors care a lot about what they are teaching as well as their students. Many kids go home on the weekends but if you decide to stay on campus or will have a great time here and make a ton of friends. Greek life is huge on campus and it’s a good idea to get involved in it or one of the many clubs in order tower the most out of your time at Uhart
Freshman,4,I've only been at Hartford one year so far but I really love it. I've made a lot of friends here and all my professors are really nice but still serious about classwork.
Freshman,4,"As a college freshman, I didn’t really know what to expect but overall my experience was great. I met friends and explored campus life, and found groups that satisfy my interest, I’m am sad about my freshman year beating cut short due to COVID-19. But as a Black female I would like to see more representation of Black professors/ sororities included in my college experience."
Junior,4,"I've had a very positive experience at UHart. I'm involved on campus and really love the program that I am in. UHart is the type of school that you get out of it what you put in. If you get involved, put your self out and take every opportunity that you're given you'll find great success at this school."
Niche User,4,"The staff is very supportive and open-minded, and encourage creativity and acceptance. The campus is large but local, and the buildings are fairly easy to navigate."
Niche User,4,"Its in a good area, very clean campus and environment, they're very big on safety especially during the graveyard hours, different majors, D1 sports, Hartford just has everything you're looking for"
Freshman,4,The University of Hartford is a great place to spend your time in the pursuit of a quality college-level education. One of the biggest pros regarding UHart is the staff/professors are exceptional and are clearly there to help you succeed in whatever goals you desire to accomplish. The campus is well-kept and there's constant innovation to the structure of the University as well.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my undergrad here. Definitely prepared me for my career and there was a lot of student life clubs, events and resources to help and allow me to become involved in campus."
Freshman,4,"Attending university of hartford has been a great experience so far. I just finished my fall semester here and it was better than I expected. One big pro of The University of Hartford is the class size, this enables so many students to become connected with their faculty as well as great connections. The school does need to work on their eco-friendliness because they are slacking and have a problem with the lack of recycling on campus which is disappointing."
Niche User,4,I loved this school! The environment of the school I feel safe and comfortable. There are many clubs and activities to do on campus. They have my major at this college which is Psychology. This is one of their top majors at this college. I do see myself going here!
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my experience at University of Hartford so far. It is a small school atmosphere so you have to be okay with that and be able to embrace it. It sometimes feels like everyone knows each other and the class sizes are small which can be very helpful.
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the large amount of options to choose a major, club, team, etc. There is a chance to get involved in many things related to student  life and you never get bored."
Freshman,4,"As a first year college student, I was worried about who my professors would be, but all of my professors this semester are very helpful and invested in student success. I like most of the facilities here and the food is okay. The party scene isn't huge here, but the small campus lends itself to partiers being in a close vicinity to people just trying to sleep."
Sophomore,4,It’s very expensive otherwise I enjoy the school environment. There a lot of tolerance and acceptance. The teacher are all nice and really care about the students progress and interests.
Niche User,4,I was there as a freshman in 2017. It's a neat enviroment and there's a variety of people to meet. The place is expensive though.
Junior,4,"I like how tight the community is on campus, there is a real sense of closeness and everybody cares about you."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I'm enjoying my time at the University. The professors and staff are very kind and show you respect if you treat them like human beings. Some classes and semesters will/can be challenging, but with the right friends and understanding in yourself, you'll get through your struggles. The environment is beautiful, and the areas off campus are close and full of different and interesting activities. What I do wish they start working more on is the food. It's...passable but sometimes unbearable, which is when the dining dollars from the meal plan of my choosing sweeps me off my feet and carries me to the other food areas on campus.  :)"
Graduate Student,4,This is a great school in a very good area. There are a lot of things to do in this area. The teachers and staff really care about the students. The sports programs are good and the facilities are incredible.
Freshman,4,UHart is an amazing school & very diverse. Fist year housing isn't the best but it's livable. Hawk Hall is gorgeous and newer than the regular freshman housing. The professors are very helpful and super sweet.
Freshman,4,The school is an open campus and public safety is around all day  so everyone on the campus can feel safe. the school is very big on academics which is very important to me.
Sophomore,4,The staff and faculty at the University of Hartford are fantastic. I really liked the community and the diversity of the campus.
Alum,4,"I’m a recently graduated alumni (class of 2018) and I can honestly say Uhart is a good school but they have some improvements that they could 
make.  I was very active on campus But it can also be very cliquey, if you’re not Greek or SGA/Red key/Red Cap you can be a little exiled from having what most would consider a normal college experience. 

Some majors are better funded and have more diversity then others. As a marketing major I had to substitute a lot of my major electives with communications classes and other management classes rather than actually receiving a marketing education which is a shame because I learned a lot in the few marketing classes that I had.

They should become more selective with their admissions to create a more intellectual and competitive learning space."
Freshman,4,"Having only completed one semester of college and currently taking the second semester of my freshman year, I am not very experienced in all the University has to offer. That being said, so far I have been overwhelmed by what it has already offered me. University of Hartford has been a breath of fresh air compared to high school. Campus life is relaxed and laid back, the classes are challenging but not insurmountable, and the professors are diverse and engaging. Student life is full of sports programs and clubs, guaranteeing anyone a place they can call home."
Sophomore,4,"I think it is amazing how well they focus on academics and put an emphasis on it, but the social life could be better. They should have more student events and encourage students to get more involved in the community of the school."
Alum,4,Good education and great experiences. Full of diversity in both student population and class selection. Best undergraduate school I could have gone to.
Freshman,4,"Small school with the feel of a big university. Academics are great, clubs and organizations are huge on campus. Only thing I wish could be better is the housing."
Sophomore,4,I have learned a lot in all of my classes so far. Most of my professors have been understanding and more than willing to help if you ask for it.
Sophomore,4,The school is very good with a lot of good professors and a few terrible professors. The overall campus is nice though.
Freshman,4,"I really like this Private University, great majors as well as excellent programs!  I wish the tuition was not so expensive, however."
Alum,4,I had a great undergrad experience at the University of Hartford/ Hartford Art School. Great professors and facilities.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed all of the classes and the curriculum. It prepared me for the future and I was able to get a great internship. The campus is nice, but the dorms could be better. Living in Hawk Hall was a great idea since it is the most newly renovated dorm. The village quad apartments definitely need an update, I know someone's parent who went here and said the apartment has not changed since she was going to school there! 30 years ago!"
Niche User,4,"UH has an amazing image all together. With a great graduation rate, great programs, affordable cost and being relatively close to home, this school has one of the best offers I've seen. As mentioned before, UH is close to home for me, and I really appreciate that fact because I'm not used to coast to coast travel. Being closer to home really sets me at ease, as there would be less distractions from home sickness and ultimately, making me a more focused student.  Knowing that I was in need of financial aid, I saw UH as an opportunity for a chance that most colleges at the time didn't have a the time: a chance to learn the right way in a affordable cost."
Graduate Student,4,Helpful and encouraging professors in the bio dept. But needs more funding for experiments and research
Niche User,4,I took my first college class here as a duel enrollement. The campus is beautiful and the class was taught well. All students were involved and present in the classroom. My only complaint was the seemingly outdated registration process.
Niche User,4,I have had a great experience here at the university of Hartford. I am currently in the post baccalaureate pre medical professions program. This university is one of the few to even have this available. My advisor has been amazing and there are so many resources to help you. The university is in a great location with plenty of things to do off campus. I am a commuter and I wish there was more parking but I haven't had any other issues.
Sophomore,4,i like the environment. the people there are really friendly. The campus is large but easy to navigate
Junior,4,"One of the things I like most about UHart is the different options you have either it's your major, housing, food, and activities. The learning environment is very driven. The faculty and students are willing to help one another to become a better you from academics to your personal needs."
Alum,2,"Online courses were not efficient. I did not feel like i learned anything. It was a bit difficult and i had to teach myself, which I didn't like because I paid money for a professor to teach me."
Sophomore,2,"The university itself is a great place to be and you'll receive a quality education. The school itself isn't great in terms of taking care of student needs in my experience, something to consider."
Freshman,2,If uhart is your top choice I would tell you to reconsider. Food choices here suck and you are more likely to get food poisoning at least twice your first semester here. I truly do not feel safe on this campus. Anyone can easily get in and out of this campus. It is an overpriced college that charges you for everything and has empty promises.
Alum,2,Extremely expensive. There were some amazing professors and plenty of subpar professors. Spring Fling was fun I guess. Mediocre school at an exorbitant price.
Freshman,2,"Its very diverse! Everyone is very helpful and welcoming. However ,it is a bit small but its a great size."
Sophomore,2,"I really was interested in coming to the University of Hartford at first, but after awhile attending the school. I realized that this school wasn't for me. My major Communications) didn't have a good program to help me excel in my field. The campus is very lifeless, there is no type of school spirit. The food is trash, there's barely any diversity and this isn't a party school whatsoever. The only good aspect about this school, is that I met some amazing people here!"
Freshman,2,"So it has been 3 months now, still have not had that ""I love it here"" moment. My professors seem to me jumbled all the time with the exception of one, the people form cliques from day one and never branch out. I came here for the physical therapy program, but I'm not sure that is my path so I'm transferring. "
College Senior,2,"The acedemic side of campus is beautiful and the professors are mostly pretty helpful. The class selection is good and the advisors are decent. (Depends on who you get) If I were a commuter student I would give the University a much better score. However I am subjected to living on campus. The residential halls are a joke. They are very run down and old. When you visit the campus, they will show you an example dorm room, but don't fall for the trap, the dorm rooms they actually put students in don't look anything like that. The furniture is old I don't even want to think how long the mattresses have been the same.  The upperclassman housing isn't anything spectacular either. It's also very run down and in need of large renovations.  Dealing with residential life is a nightmare and the housing selection process is very outdated.  The food on campus is by far one of the worst parts. Meal plans are expensive and the food quality is terrible.  The dining halls on campus of undergone very expensive renovations, but they still have yet to increase the food quality to a point where it actually tastes good. The best times to get food on campus are during  orientation and parents weekend when the school shows off to the parents, then the food goes back to being terrible. Overall University of Hartford is a good school for academics and to get a degree, but living on campus, room and board, has much to be desired."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms were one of the things I liked when I toured the University. However, I was only shown the freshmen dorm. After the first year, the dorms change drastically. The designs are nice, but the quality and the environment are not the best. The distance from the dorms to the academic side is also far for the non-Freshman dorms. Honestly, I think that the cost for these rooms are priced more than they are worth. I wish that more money was invested in renovating the dorms."
College Freshman,2,No specific housing for Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,Very cliquey and most are annoying.
College Freshman,2,I honestly do not know much about Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"From what I've heard, they're all snobby."
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus would be better without Greek life
College Senior,2,"the housing complexes could use a lot of work and updates in the amenities, the beds could be a lot better and the bathrooms are not always cleaned as well as they should be. for the price of living on campus you do not get your money's worth in terms of quality in housing."
College Junior,2,Really only degree worth getting is a music related degree.
College Junior,2,It's really a shame of a place to live in. Quite unimpressed.
College Freshman,2,"No regulation. The bridge constantly smell like Marijuana, people use at parties, unlimited alcohol, the first week of school several ambulances were called to the school."
College Freshman,2,"I felt as though the teachers weren't that great, but they loaded you up with a bunch of homework. I didn't become enriched, I just had a bunch of homework to do every night. Also the social scene is hard to get into, many people just stick with their group and don't branch out. I wish I had gone somewhere else."
College Freshman,2,too many students per counselor
College Freshman,2,"Parties here are pretty small unless it is off campus. They don't let too many people in, drinks run low, people are terrible and all the parties end early."
College Freshman,2,"If you're a graduate student or live close to campus, you can utilize this. If not, you're out of luck."
College Freshman,2,"I asked for an updated financial aid package after the university released projected tuition price increases, and they told me to wait for August, when I would have already paid for housing and registered for classes. What is the point of paying those fees if I don't know how much more money I will need over the course of the summer to cover all my expenses? And if they're out of my price range, my debt is only going to rise. No student needs that. They're basically driving away students. It's a surprise anyone would even apply here."
College Freshman,2,"The places that have the best food require dining dollars, and everyone is forced to purchase a meal plan. This rips off the students, especially if they have more meal swipes than they do dining dollars. They have to eat subpar food the majority of the time, and it isn't even healthy for them. It makes it difficult to eat any type of meal with people, since they all want to go to expensive - and different - places."
College Senior,2,"I personally have not had very good experiences with Greeks on this campus. There are some that are fantastic, and others that are downright horrible. I've also heard that hazing is a huge thing here, but of course no one would admit to it."
College Freshman,2,Not happy that there is no handsoap & towels in bathrooms. I guess kids in the past have prevented that because they would destroy them. Have to bring our own.
College Junior,2,All the food is extremely unhealthy
College Junior,2,"No time of anything except homework and studying. I never have any time to attend any of the school events because of all the work that I have to do. The teachers are very good, but some of them suffer from not being very organized. One particular case worthy of mention, I had a teacher add extra materiel the night before the final exam, and just informed everyone via e-mail. Class selection is a pain, even if you already know what classes to take, and are in you senor year, you still have to talk to guidance and get a registration code before you can sign up, and their hours are not that flexible. Internships are not mandatory, and are not pushed very hard at all. Internships can be rather hard to get, because there are not that many of them. On campus jobs however, are not as hard to get, but most of them are ether food services or cashier jobs, that pay the absolute minimum wage possible."
College Junior,2,"There are party's, but most of them are on campus, and invite only. the average party consists of music, alcohol and drugs, and so many people crammed into a dorm room that you cannot even move, you are shoulder to shoulder. Normally it ends up getting so hot that someone vomits, and it takes 10 minuets just to get enough people out of the way that it can be cleaned up."
College Sophomore,2,You dont get what you pay for even with scholarships. Programs are good but facilities and general campus aren't.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a safe campus, poorly lit, with inadequate safety measure like the ""blue polls"" to call PS with. PS also will not escort you after hours if you feel unsafe. They are good about parties but care little about safety. More lighting and higher personal safety is needed- it shouldn't just be about parking tickets."
College Junior,2,"Not that much to do especially without a car, Hartford is a boring city also."
College Junior,2,"Pretty bad, not many options.  The updated Commons which is the main cafeteria which is slightly better than it was before but still not the greatest."
College Junior,2,"Campus police are here mostly on the weekend, I know how to contact them and get to them if I really need to but they are not particularly present.  I have a friend who has been sexually assaulted on campus but she did report it so I am unsure how that would have worked out.  I know of counselling services available but I am unsure of anything the campus does specifically for sexual assault.  In general I don't feel totally safe, I hate walking around alone at night and we are not in a particularly great neighborhood and some people here give off really creepy vibes."
College Sophomore,2,Not very good as it is usually sitting waiting to be served for a long time. The options get tiring as nothing changes.
College Sophomore,2,"West Hartford is not bad, the school provided shuttle takes you to two places in West Hartford, the mall and walmart. After a couple weeks it is very boring. People usually go out of necessity to food shop."
College Sophomore,2,"People say there are tons of parties, however there are probably about one or two per month realistically."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some pretty shady places. Hartford itself is not a safe city, so living off campus is not recommended, but living in West Hartford could be better, but much more expensive."
College Senior,2,"Financial aid is really my only complaint with this school and it's a big complaint. I am very in need living with a single parent when I'm not on campus and for some reason my school does not consider me in ""need"" it's the most frustrating thing ever considering right now my school is being paid with all loans. I am doing my best to apply to different scholarships in order to make it manageable because the very little aid I do get from the school is not nearly enough."
College Sophomore,2,The same classes are offered every semester leaving lack of variety for students.
College Sophomore,2,"I love my major and i still wish to have my career. If i was to go back i would still do the same major but defiatly do more research for my program. I have concerns since what i want to do, no one in my department can help me with. They've been in one part of the field where I want to be in the other. So i rely on outside guidance to help guide me."
College Sophomore,2,Depending on the major internships are required. It is not required in my program but even still the is no setup if i did want one. I would have to go out and find one myself instead of relying on connections or networks within the school or department. Which is an added hassle and worry for a student who doesnt know what to look for.
College Sophomore,2,So computers on campus are limited. If you have to rpint something it has to be done in the library plus printing isnt free. Its so annoying to bring my laptop to the library especially if its only to do one thing but what other choice do you have when computers are not open. Every classroom has a projector and a computer which is nice for presentations. Also there are ports for both mac and pc so you dont have to get a brand new computer for school. The campus has wifi which works and is avaiable all of campus.
College Sophomore,2,I dont get how classes for my major are not the most important part of my time here. It seems like the general education courses are harder than my actual major classes plus i spend more time in them which does no make sense to me. I cam here to study what for my career why am I spending mroe time in fields that dont matter to my career?
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't do drugs/drink, you aren't invited to parties and therefore are isolated from most of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I was completely screwed over by Hillyer college.  As an education major, there are certain requirements to meet in order to get your bachelors degree, but Hillyer only gears you towards your associates.  I am a whole semester behind!  The work load is ridiculous.  I know that college is a lot of work, but the amount you're expected to complete with little to NO help (especially with online classes) from Professors, its unrealistic.  I'm transferring next year because of their horrible job when it comes to academia and dealing with their own mistakes."
College Sophomore,2,"To pay $500 for parking for the whole year is ridiculous.  I'm paying $48,000 to be here... I should get to park for free!  Not to mention if you get there too late, you won't find a spot.  Period.  And public safety are jerks!  They will give you a ticket and bleed whatever little money you have out of you.  Its disgusting how much money this college wants!"
College Freshman,2,Generally OK looking people. Usually good looks come with a more challenging school.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't live in Hawk Hall, you're basically screwed, and everything becomes less accessible."
College Freshman,2,"Housing in the complexes is terrible. If you don't live in Hawk Hall, you deal with a plethora of annoyances."
College Sophomore,2,"My friends and I are convinced they just try things out on us to see if its good like lab rats. They make food that you have never heard of and do not want to try. 

Some days are good some days are bad its hit or miss. 

On the weekends their is only one dinning hall to eat at till dinner time which makes every line so long since the whole campus pretty much goes to this one place"
College Freshman,2,WHAT AM I PAYING FOR?!
College Freshman,2,"the class are a joke, the kids in them clearly only got points on their sat for writing their name. some professors know what they are talking about and others are stingy. their personalities are equivilent to eating granola without yogurt DRY AND PAINFUL. read rate my professor"
College Sophomore,2,FOOD IS ROUGH. Just stick it out until you can get an apartment with your own kitchen.
College Sophomore,2,It's New England....very chilly throughout most of the year.
College Sophomore,2,"Get your own computer! You will literally never get anything done without your own. The wireless network stinks sometimes, but with so many people using it at the same time, expect nothing less."
College Sophomore,2,Commons is just awful.  Apparently they're re-doing it BIG TIME this summer though.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people get around by taxis, which are expensive.  The campus shuttle to the mall and stuff only runs until like 7, and only comes around every hour."
College Freshman,2,"If you aren't in the Hartt School, Art School, or School of Communications then have fun dealing with small programs minimal funding and people treating you poorly."
College Freshman,2,There is no set requirement to get into the Cinema program.  There are little to no challenges
Sophomore,1,"The switch to online classes was very rough. Professors had no idea what they were doing and many students decided to drop their classes, drop out or put very little effort in to the classes. I for one will he leaving the university for some time if we have online classes in the fall."
Graduate Student,1,Hides its history of hate crimes against black students. It should get a 0 star for diversity in my opinion. Black students ARE NOT SAFE AT THIS SCHOOL.
Freshman,1,"University of Hartford is an expensive, disorganized, non-professional pile of imaginary promises. The entire campus is just eye candy to hide what they really are. The professors are very unprofessional. I will give a few personal examples. Two of my teachers, were so horrible in their teaching based on their students, that they had to get fired  AFTER I took the course. Another teacher had not shown up for more than 80 percent of the classes. So what am I paying for? Another example is my calculus teacher was a PHYSICS teacher, which is NOT the same thing. The food is disgusting, and the dorms looked like used motel rooms. The safety is horrible in this place as every week there was a different warning about some suspect/stalker in the campus threatening people, and we all can't forget about the Brianna Brochu case. No wonder why the freshmen drop rate is almost 50 percent or maybe even more..."
Senior,1,I have never experienced such horrible behavior. The school mistreats minority’s to the fullest. The administration there is extremely rude. I feel bad for the professors there because some of them a really great but working at uhart makes them seem less . I won’t advise that anyone attends this school. I dont wish this experience on anyone.
Sophomore,1,"I have never been so miserable in my entire life. Nothing is unique, the school is dead, the people suck, the professors suck, the classes are like a community college. I hate it. Never again. I wish I could sign on to be a tour guide just so i can tell students and their parents to STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM HERE."
Sophomore,1,"Ranked #720 college, seems about right. Housing is terrible, surprising amount of drug use here. Seems like a place for C+ type stdents."
Sophomore,1,"i was disappointed to find out how local this school is.  There is a surprising lack of students from around the country.  Almost half is from CT (around 45%), and almost all the rest are driving distance from neighboring NY, MA or NJ (that's probably around 90% of the school). I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, its not the kind of place most people are going to travel 2000 miles to go to."
Sophomore,1,coming here was a big mistake. Cant wait to get out. Just a sad place overall. I think they let anybody in here.
Sophomore,1,The teachers are ok. The facilities are pretty run down. A lot of local students who leave on Friday and come back Sunday nite. Most students here aren't very serious.
Senior,1,"Just a very below average place. I unsuccessfully tried to transfer out, but didn't apply to enough schools and didn't get in anywhere. A community college with a four year college cost."
College Sophomore,1,I find it very difficult to find an internship. I am not sure on who to ask for assistance.
College Junior,1,The dorms are among the worst in the country. Facilties are generally medium poor.
College Junior,1,"Its typical bro type scene. Nothing special, just ok."
College Junior,1,Zero school spirit. This is a commuter type school. No one follows the sports teams or cares.
College Junior,1,"Would not choose again. Safety school for low achieving students. Dorms are horrible! Food is bad. Place is dead on the weekend. A lot of people drop out or tranfer, it seems like most don;t graduate. Most don't want to be here. Classes are mostly a joke. Overall would not recomend!"
College Senior,1,Housing on the University of Hartford campus is horrible.  Very old and run down For how expensive it is!
College Freshman,1,The Greek life is very important to a lot of the social life and not being part of it has its drawbacks. Also its around $400 to join which is expensive
College Junior,1,Public safety is an extreme pain to work with. They feel very entitled and are very abusive with their power. A few good people there but mostly are quite terrible people.
College Junior,1,Extremely bad professors who do not care about students. General academic courses are much too easy and are really community college level.
College Junior,1,"The Hartt department (the music department) Is the only positive thing about this school. They help bring in a lot of money to the school with all its performances and the success community division. However, this is offset completely by the incredibly nauseating atmosphere this school has as well as the terrible administration, public safety, housing, and basically anything that should in fact be beneficial for students. This university is in shambles and should really be ashamed of the way they distribute money to certain factors of the school. As an average student in high school, I thought I would have to work a little hard on the Gen. Ed's and such, however, they are so simple that I cannot bear to waste my time in these classes anymore. It is appalling how many students struggle with these general academic classes when their lives are surrounded by academic studies. I've often heard this school compared to the capability of a community college and I can assure you it is absolutely true."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a fan of this school at all. My number one goal while at this school is to get good enough grades to be able to transfer somewhere else. I will say that the classes are good and interesting especially the business classes. However the people there are not the people I want to become acquainted with. I have noticed there are lots of drug dealers on campus and basically everyone I have met uses. Dorms always smell like weed and many other parts of the campus. There is not much to do on campus. Public Safety is not doing a lot to make the campus safer. This school needs to renovate dorms and improve security. In my current dorm it has a push lock that you and your roommates need to remember to lock every time you leave and go to bed otherwise someone can just walk in, which has happened before. You can go to Hawk Hall that makes you slide your card to enter your dorm and it does lock by itself, but you have to apply to be in that dorm."
College Freshman,1,They are terrible with financial aid. They have stolen money and are increasing the tuition of school by 2.26%.
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to travel anywhere, very far from any and all classes, not worth the money."
College Sophomore,1,"Not safe at all, PS only cares about parties and tickets but there is little they can even do to improve actual security. They do not provide escorts so if you walk alone at night it is terrifying."
College Sophomore,1,Only one shuttle runs on the weekend and for a limited time. Taxis are overpriced and hard to get a hold of.
College Sophomore,1,"We dont have offcampus parking, its all done on the univsersity. Having your car on campus is crazy expensive and really not worth unless you have student teaching, off campus job, or internship."
College Sophomore,1,"I dont think we have any off campus housing through the school. Since we do live outside a city, if you want t olvie off campus you have to look for a space you're self."
College Freshman,1,if you walk by the bridge almost always you will smell pot
College Freshman,1,"aboslutely awful I have had the worst professors, I had a high school algebra teacher teaching calculus 1, a chemistry professor who was fired from a different university and most of my other professors were more interested in their research than the topics they taught."
College Freshman,1,in a rich CT suburb with alot of snobby people
College Freshman,1,"Despicable athletic department, no one really cares about any team except for the soccer and basketball teams who are visibly well financially endowed."
College Freshman,1,"Pretty bland, no parties really, and they get shut down even when people do decide to host."
College Sophomore,1,The campus is below sea level so its always windy and it gets really cold in the winter and every one basically hibernates
College Sophomore,1,The party scene died along time ago. I'm a sophmore and their have been a significantly less and less parties every semester
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing to do on the weekends. I have had plenty of friends but because it was so boring almost all of them transferred and many more are to. 

You can join a frat didn't really find one for me and have a better time but other then that not many clubs to join to get involved in."
College Freshman,1,"if you go into the health services they make you take a strep test even if you have a clearly inflect skin infection because they want the $20 copay. I see more cocaine than i do than people studying during finals week, the movie savages sums up our weekend activities."
College Freshman,1,There is a new case of food poisoning every week.  The people who work in food services will try to bribe you will your favorite food.  The University does nothing about this.
College Freshman,1,"Sororities haze a lot.  Sigma Alpha Epsilon are known as the ""rape factory""  There is little to no connection between the different chapters"
College Freshman,1,If you aren't involved in Greek Life or play rugby then night life sucks.
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing around campus. NOTHING. It's so difficult if you don't have a car or want something other than terrible campus food. So inconvenient and no fun at all. You have to take an overpriced cab to get anywhere!
College Freshman,1,I got straight A's without trying.  My hardest classes are at the Hartt school. My general academics are very very simple. Honors classes are not challenging whatsoever.
College Junior,1,NO one likes the complexes because they're dated and falling apart and very dirty.
College Junior,1,"It's awful! It's the same three fast food restaurants and that's it, and the campus shuttle doesn't even go anywhere near them."
College Junior,1,There's no variety to choose from and minimal places.
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms are pretty old and outdated.  Tuition has sky rocketed for both crumby food and housing.  The best amenity would have to be the schools gym facility.  There aren't many social gatherings for students to partake in, so the social atmosphere is pretty dull."
College Sophomore,1,Off-campus housing in Hartford is hard to obtain especially due to the proximity to campus. Affordable apartments are in bad neighborhoods and are hard to come by.  You would need to travel to school by public transportation if you don't have a car.
College Senior,1,Parking for residents is $470 for the year and parking is far from most residence halls.
College Freshman,1,"Track and basketball are a big deal but that's about as far as it goes. No football or hockey team. There are more choices on intramural teams, but if you're serious about a sport other than basketball or track, this probably isn't the place for you. Students are somewhat enthusiastic about sports but there's not the same passion you would see at a school like Boston College, for example."
College Freshman,1,"Public safety under-reports the number of crimes on campus. When they emailed out the list of crimes saying how great it was that there were so few, I knew that the numbers were wrong because of a few that I had reported myself. 

Also, Health Services referrals to local doctors are awful. They sent me to a doctor so incompetent that I had to return home to get proper care and miss almost a week of classes."
College Freshman,1,"If you have an allergy to anything that could prevent you from eating the food, they will make it extremely difficult for you to get off the meal plan. I had to pay for two semesters worth of food that I could not eat."
College Freshman,1,"The biggest issue that I've seen is that lots of guys brag about how many times the parties they've been at have gotten them roofied (like, the punch bowl was spiked and it got them drugged too) so village parties really aren't safe."
College Sophomore,1,"This school is caught between West Hartford (the good side of town) and downtown Hartford. Keep your doors locked when driving in downtown Hartford. You'll find a lot of culturally diverse people here, but shopping options are below average."
College Freshman,1,"this place sucks dont come here, for the love of god its not worth it what so ever"
College Sophomore,1,"No Car – the parking is awful, there was a flood and most got washed away, I wouldn't bring one if you are a freshman. Also the Public Safety officers are very strict about parking and are not afraid to give a parking ticket. There is a shuttle that will take students around if needed"
College Sophomore,1,"I hate the parking at the University of Hartford and so do most students. Im working on fixing the whole system but its not easy. I commute and there is almost no commuter parking, and the little spot there is is on the academic side only. We have to register our vehicles to park overnight as commuters, and we have to park in a lot on the academic side of campus. Tickets range 10-50$ usually for parking."
College Sophomore,1,Awful. The close parking spaces are often taken. It's hard to even find parking on certain occasions. There's a flood zone where your car could potentially be underwater. It's so expensive. 400 and you get nothing. Public safety are moronic ass****s.
College Sophomore,1,"Boring. Nothing to do on the weekends. People go home. No options for food. If you're vegan or vegetarian, you won't even survive here. Students are morons and just overall trashy, well most of them. It has one of the highest crime rates. The campus is pretty and West Hartford is a cute town but that's all this school has going for it. I'm leaving. Oh yeah and everyone leaves after a year or so."
College Senior,1,There is not a need to have a car on campus because of shuttles that go to malls and shopping plazas. To have a car on campus its a total $470. Everything you'll ever need is on campus. Also the student parking is awful
College Senior,1,Every time it rains there is a flood on campus! Many cars were ruined this year because of this. Every time it rains half the students have to go out to the parking lot to move their car.
College Sophomore,1,"there are not many scholarships at the university. If there are, it is a long process that one has to stay on top off. There are only about 4 a year, and given to only a few students."

Sophomore,5,"I personally like in campus classes, but during this pandemic, we have to take online classes. Even I don't like online classes, but still I like their teaching styles. Teachers try to spend more time out of the class also to explain which stuff makes me confused."
Sophomore,5,I really like the disciplined environment there. All the teachers and staff are really nice and supportive. They help me whenever I need assistance. One of my teacher recommends me to visit tutoring center for extra help. I went there for math tutoring and now I am impressed with their nice attitude and supportive help. I mostly go to math tutoring and writing center for help. I will recommend others to take their Associate's degree from Community College of Denver. It will save your money and gives you peaceful environment.
Sophomore,5,"I began taking courses at CCD at the suggestion of my coworker. I love the professors I have had thus far, they are attentive and understanding. I am interested in the INP program that they offer for BSN programs"

Freshman,5,My experience with online learning at the Community College of Denver has been great so far. The online class interface is easy to understand. The professors are present and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I am taking classes both online and on campus. With the COVID, my classes were put online for the safety of the students and staff. Even though, taking biology lab part was online, it was a nice transition."
Freshman,5,My online experience was great it was easy to understand and the lectures professors were available if needed any help on our assignments.
Freshman,5,It’s a really great college that helps you on choosing what to major on. Small classes make learning more easy and helping me prepare myself to transfer to an 4 year college. It’s also a really affordable.
Freshman,5,"I have been attending CCD for 2 semesters now, and overall I have had a great experience. The campus is shared with a few more colleges and it has diversity, and the professors have always been great and very helpful. I highly recommend this community college before deciding to step into a university."
Graduate Student,5,The school is so amazing! The teachers are really caring about the students and wanted them to pass without a doubt!
Freshman,5,"As a freshman in my second semester at CCD I do not believe it is a bad school. The first couple days of classes they have 'guides', basically a person who seats behind a desk at the entrance of the building and helps you find the room you have class in. It was really helpful. If you are unable to find these 'guides' the other students are a great resource too, they are really friendly. One thing that I would like to mention is that if you go in with the purpose of applying to the dental hygiene program you would be placed with an advisor who is not in the campus and therefor is not as involved in your studies. I got lucky and my second semester I was got a new advisor, who was able to help me with FAFSA, go more into detail with resources, and start a plan to meet all the requirements for the dental hygiene program."
Junior,5,I am currently taking classes at the Lowry Health Science campus and I am loving my time here. Classes are small and interactive. Students can create a relationship with the professors and it shows that they want students to succeed.
Alum,5,"CCD is a beautiful campus rich with incredible professors that you can tell are passionate about their work. Of course, there will be a couple professors that are a bit high maintenance, however, I remember one professor in particular Mr Birdbear, who truly gave me motivation to continue college. Physics was the hardest class I ever took and yet that professor made me not only push through it but also his positive attitude gave me courage to go on after passing the class. CCD has many resources and is right next to 16th street so you can go the mall between classes... Awesome. 10/10 would recommend."
Alum,5,"CCD is located on the Auraria Campus in the heart of downtown Denver. Metropolitan State University and the University of Colorado also reside on this campus, meaning that CCD students get to use many of the same resources as the university students at a community college price. The labs, restaurants, libraries, classrooms, and arts centers are all in great condition. There are countless places to eat, study, or meet with friends both on campus and nearby. The campus is very vibrant, green, and safe. There are emergency phones all over campus and guards who can take you from class to class or to your car during the night. I also have loved all of my professors at CCD. They are always very understanding, supportive, and they make the class interesting. Another thing that makes CCD great is public transportation. Students who purchase the $20 student RTD card have unlimited use of not just the public transport around campus (many bus stops and light rail stops) but all over Colorado."
Sophomore,5,The staff is super helpful. I'm going back to school after a few years off. I feel very comfortable asking for help navigating the path back. I'm looking forward to classes.
Freshman,5,It’s an nice and easy going experience. All the professors really care about your future career. The dorm life is calm nothing crazy and the new building are really nice
Freshman,5,It has such a nice staff and understanding professors. It is also a very unique campus that is shared with two other colleges.  And tuiton is very affordable.
Freshman,5,"This is a wonderful school for those who either don't know what they want to do yet, or simply just want to get their prerequisite classes out of the way in an affordable manner. The student support is excellent, and the campus is very diverse."
Freshman,5,The best thing about this college is the students and staff. Everyone from the very beginning was outgoing and helpful. Unfortunately I enrolled during the fall semester and had to deal with trudging through winter weather because the amount of parking around the campus is minimal.
Sophomore,5,The campus makes this unlike any other community college. It’s a great reminder that community college is just a step to something better and allows participation with the more involved University’s.
Freshman,5,"Meeting people from several backgrounds has been an eye-opener for me and the people I live with. Getting to know more about the different beliefs, ideas, and thoughts is important to me as I grew up in a very secluded and close-minded area. The professors are always supportive and love what they do which is an entirely new thing for me to see. The dedication the teachers put into teaching the students is priceless and I would never ask for better nor more."
Freshman,5,"I am the first one in my family to go to college and never knew if college was for me. I applied for other community colleges and some universities. After looking through al the colleges I chose community college of Denver,  because there are many opportunities waiting for everyone. Of all colleges I've looked through this is by far the most diverse college that focuses on equal opportunities for students who don't often get that in their lives. I started over a month ago and enjoy learning here everyday. If this sounds like you, you'll love it here!"
Junior,5,"I love the diversity within CCD, and the welcoming community it has to offer. All the professors are friendly, and patient. Not only are there many places nearby to go to, but it's within the downtown area so there's always activities to do with friends after a class."
Freshman,5,"My experience at the Community College of Denver by far has been very great. All the professors I've had have been really amazing and helpful with whatever you need help with. The more you communicate with your professor, the more it will benefit and help you out. I like that my classes are fairly easy, understandable and interesting! Definitely a great community college for anyone that doesn't know what exactly they want to major in. Advisors help out a lot on what classes to take, financial aid help, and simply just helping out with your mental health when it is needed. The college also has writing, math and reading labs for anyone that needs it. They have tutoring from students themselves. It is a great college with amazing help from the professors, advisors and students."
Sophomore,5,All of my professors have helped me out so much. Shout out to Professor Jones who had helped me improve all of my writing skills. I was a hard two semesters with her but I would do them over as I feel she has help me better my self and look at writing in a different way.  Thank you. Also to professor Jamal who always went out of his way to make class interesting at eight in the morning. Great business professor. Thanks
Niche User,5,Loved it here. Variety of courses connected to University of Denver and Metropolitan University allows students to not only study and tutor with other students enrolled in their college but with a greater community as Auraria campus allows. Lots of flexibility with online or campus courses and affordable tuition without compromising  education.
Freshman,5,It is a small campus and all the staff are helpful. All of my professors have really set me up for successs.
Freshman,5,Great community college. Professors are really helpful. People around the campus are very nice and helpful as well. The resources around the campus are great.
Junior,5,I liked the Community College of Denver. Most of the Professors were very nice and very supportive and are there to help you succeed. I think what I would like to see changed is maybe the room for classes they tend to fill up very quickly.
Freshman,5,"I am very new to CCD and so far I feel very welcomed. I am extremely excited to become a city hawk. Just after my new student orientation and tour of the campus, I felt like I had been going there for years already. I love the campus, but am a little worried about the surrounding areas, and don’t want to see drugs on campus."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about this community college is that every one is very nice, very welcoming. Every one knows each other."
Freshman,5,The community college of Denver is a game place to start your educational career. You will receive lots of help from counselors and teachers. They have many help resources and the location it's easy to get to with lots of parking.
Freshman,5,My experience with ccd was great I was able to do their speech class and the professor That was in my class was very helpful she helped us with what should we do when delivering a speech and her tips were useful to me because now I can deliver a speech with fluent speech
Freshman,5,"I like it because they are very affordable. I found every class so far online, which makes it more accessible to me. Because they are a smaller campus you can always find someone willing to help you out."
Alum,5,Great teachers and a lot of options as far as class times and options. Especially for a college in the city I always felt fairly safe.
Niche User,5,Community College is one of my favorite college because of the academics. I dont want to chane anything becaus I think it is very as it is now.
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed visiting the campus and the staff there had great communication. I think that the Community College  of Denver would be a great fit to those in the state of Colorado in search for a college, but are indecisive and don’t want to know what they would like to major. Also the Community College  of Denver doesn’t judge. Like other community colleges Community College of Denver makes you feel welcome, they accept anyone who reaches out to them. It’s an easy process to get into and is a great secondary or third options for any and everyone. I’d recommend it."
Junior,5,"My experience at CCD was good, i took college classes in my junior year in high school. The teachers were very nice and the campus was beautiful. I think overall the campus is fine how it is."
Sophomore,5,"I love CCD and the professors here, everyone I have met on campus is always eager to help with your college journey."
Junior,5,"Community College of Denver is honestly such an amazing and affordable College. School is in a campus with two other Colleges and it is just amazing how diverse it is. Located right down town of Denver transportation is super easy from RTD, Light rail or Carpool. Professors are always going the extra mile to help their students and offers a number of courses."
Junior,5,"CCD has great staff, an amazing library and huge array of programs to get you to your education or career goals!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the Community College of Denver. The Academic Advising center responds to me emails so quickly, and the office helps me right away. I'd like to see a few more healthier options in their food courts, but I usually can find some fruit to snack on. Navigating the campus was a bit confusing at first, but shortly after that it became second nature to me where I needed to go."
Sophomore,5,The location is everything. Campus is close to the light rail station plus sharing a campus with two other major Universities is pretty awesome. The only thing I would want to change would be to have more afternoon or evening classes added to the schedule.
Sophomore,5,"CCD is an amazing school with amazing teachers, and a great community. The school recognizes the need to feel all students welcome."
Sophomore,5,"My time at the Community College of Denver has influenced and prepared me to transfer to any four-year institution. I have grown and developed immensely in the last two years – as an individual, a leader, and a storyteller. The school’s diverse and encouraging environment continuously challenged me to step out of my comfort-zone and made me discover my potential. The highly motivated professors have been the highlight of my college experience thus far. They pushed me to become the strong leader that they knew I could be. Over the last two years, they taught me how to adapt my acquired knowledge and skills to circumstance and life. CCD provided me with my first college experience and for that, I will always be grateful."
Sophomore,5,I love this school! I’ve been to 2 others community colleges and none of them were like this one! When I started getting low points the school sent me ans email and my counselor got one as well! She was able to talk to me and try ans understand what I needed in order to succeed in that class! The campus is beyond Beautiful! The people are supper friendly and the professers CARE! and that’s what makes CCD stand out!
Freshman,5,What I like about this community college is that it's a great school to start your post education because the classes here are good and you will be able to save money by attending the first two years here and then transfer to a four year university.
Freshman,5,"Community College of Denver is very diverse. As a Mexican American it feels really comfortable to be in an environment with many different ethnicities, races and religions."
Senior,5,"Really enjoyable school! They help keep you on track to fulfill your ultimate goal! Really nice and friendly people (students and staff). Discussions in classes can get hard at times but everyone seems to be able to respect one another, the overall hardness of the class really depends on your participation and attendance."
Sophomore,5,"CCD counselors, teachers, and even students go above and beyond to help you in any way possible to meet your goals."
Senior,5,I really enjoyed going here. They worjed with a schedule I needed and I didn't feel less important for being part time. Had to take a break a couple times for personal readons and I was able to pick up were I left off.
Sophomore,5,"I had a very good experience at Community College of Denver.  My experience in college not only prepared me for my career, but it also prepared me for life outside of my career.  I gained skills that cannot be taught.  through interactions with fellow students, professor, internship supervisors, and co workers, as well as other college staff."
Freshman,5,"I've been very pleased thus far with my experience with the Community College of Denver.  I have been able to utilize several of their resources from financial aide counselors to academic counselors.  Additionally, I have found the degree specific information sessions to be very helpful in showing me what kind of career I want to pursue."
Freshman,5,"So far, I have had an incredible experience at CCD! The classes are wonderful and really teach me something, the instructors all have been kind and helpful, and the campus is awesome! I would definitely recommend this college."
Junior,5,"Community college of Denver is very good college.this school is very diverse I enjoy being able to get a glimpse of different palaces around the world during classes discussions.Everyone is no nice &welcoming.they have completely updated their campus $for the better .i had taken CIS teachers are so helpful everyone is always willing to help from the financial aid ,advisor to guid you for the right part .so I recommend who ever wants to start your college please go in this school 😀"
Sophomore,5,"I love it because there are great teachers , flexible hours, campus is a nice area, daycare, many sports actives."
Freshman,5,I love the environment and teachers. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The student advisors do a great job with helping students chose their classes.
Freshman,5,"what I enjoy about the community college of denver is that the professors are there when you need them, and the students are diverse and respect each other to every extent. the classes are professional as well as education In every little detail and I'm glad to day thay I can be sort of community for my college years. I believe I will be able to accomplish my goals and be able to graduate with a career waiting for me."
Sophomore,5,The community college of Denver is a great investment for your future! The school and the faculty really care about it's students and their lives/education. They want to see people succeed and i am very grateful i get to be a part of its community!
Sophomore,5,The Is No Community College IN Such As CCD I really like being there as student and it's always been good because you get help for anything you need.
Freshman,4,I have been going here we'll online school for a week now and so far I absolutely love it. the teacher is very nice and helpful as well.
Freshman,4,so far I have been taking one class for a week and start my next class next week. very flexible with you schedule. professor is very nice as well.
Freshman,4,"The online programs at Community College of Denver are easy to use, affordable and a great way to get a higher education. The professors are responsive and kind."
Sophomore,4,"I decided on this college since it was super close to my home and workplace. They offered online courses, which made it easy for me due to my work schedule. My advisor is always in contact with me. The professors are nice and they know what they are teaching. They are also quick to respond if you need more help."
Junior,4,I am attending the Lowry Campus for Dental Hygiene. Parking is good but I wish there was public transportation for students to this campus.
Junior,4,"CCD is a great local college. They offer a wide variety of courses and majors and care strongly about their students educations. They offer an integrative nursing program which transfers to a nursing school, which is awesome. Couldn't be happier with my experience at CCD!"
Freshman,4,What I liked about the community college of Denver is the diversity the campus and the class has. Although what I want to change is to add in more a diverse list of language courses.
Sophomore,4,"Great campus, love all the resources and the fact that there are other schools surrounding. My teachers have all been great and engaging. The only complaint would be the parking, overall an amazing community college."
Alum,4,"The college is set in downtown Denver, so there are issues with parking, however there is a light rail stop right outside. There is a mandatory RTD pass that is included in tuition, even if you don't use it. CCD is part of a network that includes Metro State University and CU Denver, so for lab science classes you are able to use their lab classrooms instead of working in the typical online lab that you get with most community college science courses. The main building for CCD is fairly new and up to date, there is also plenty of options for food on or near campus, as it is located in an urban setting. It is easy to access by bicycle, as it sits right next to the bicycle path on the Platte River. I had an overall positive experience here, even though I only took a few classes. The instructors that I had were all well educated and knowledgeable in their fields of study. All credits from this institution easily transferred to the University that I am attending now."
Alum,4,"I loved Community College of Denver for three main reasons: Inclusivity, Professors and Resources. Everyone there always made me feel welcome and included to any event, class or activity. The professors are very encouraging and helpful. The career and academic resources were extremely helpful and helped me build a resume, find an internship and look for job options. I would like to see CCD change or reevaluate the academic advisors because it can be challenging to get an answer or help from them."
Freshman,4,I like that the Community College of Denver has such a diverse population and that is conveniently located downtown Denver. There would be a couple things I would change such as pricing of tuition for in state students because it Is not much cheaper than for out of state students. I love that I can walk or ride the light rail to get around and the school is easy to find.
Freshman,4,"This is a nice school. Most of the teachers are very caring since it's a more intimate environment, but it feels like they need to have more knowledgeable people in their front offices. When I first enrolled, there was an issue with my residency, stating I was an out of state resident even though I have always lived in Colorado. They gave me the complete runaround with different people telling me different things which was frustrating. Otherwise, the school itself is nice, huge campus, and I've been getting a nice education. I'd recommend it if you're like me and didn't know what you wanted to do and you want to explore that further."
Sophomore,4,"Small class sizes and campus, is centrally located in downtown Denver. Good public transportation and a bus pass is included in tuition. Good online classes, and teachers are attentive. Lots of resources for filling out financial aid, scholarships, and tutoring."
Sophomore,4,Nice staff. Great Campus. If you do not go to college in person to get something done for your file than it most likely will take a lot longer and you may even have to deal with staff making mistakes or not doing their job throughly.
Freshman,4,Community college of Denver is great with their communication! Theyre very professional when answering questions and concerns.
Niche User,4,"Community College of Denver is very diverse and offers a lot of career opportunities. Community College of Denver is a very small college where it is very easy to get to know people in a very small, familiar place at a very low cost. CCD is the type of college that fits into most peoples budget that offers classes that are a good start to move onto a 4 year college/university institution."
Sophomore,4,"CCD is a great school to figure out where you want to start, the campus has great resources and wonderful teacher. Small classes, small sizes, and just a great community."
Junior,4,"Community college of Denver is a great school, especially for students who aren't sure where to start their career after high school. This is where I went right after high school and I've learned a lot and up until now. The location is great, the campus holds up with two other schools, and downtown city is right near by.  The convince of trains transportation is perfect, plus there is all sorts of housing for students to stay at. Overall its a pretty great experience from what I've witnessed."
Freshman,4,"CCD is like any college, if you're willing to search out quality and opportunity there are plenty of professors and staff on board who are willing to help you find it."
Sophomore,4,The Community College of Denver is a great school for students who can't afford tuition in a four-year university. They offer great bridge programs that can help you pursue the career you choose. They also have many resources for students that can help with school and outside of school. Classes are a perfect size and your professor all know you by name.
Sophomore,4,"I like how it's close to two other universities. They have many people that can help you with any questions you may have. Their classes are small, but the professors actually knows your names."
Freshman,4,"Frist of all, this is my first year in Community college of Denver. Why I choose Community college of Denver? This college is the best college for me to start of with because there are many subject that I still have to take as a basic classes. There are many peoples who are willing to help me with my needs. I felt comfortable walking around the campus and I felt safe. There are police around the campus when ever we need them. Most of my professors are nice and claver.   
Go into community college of Denver, I don't have to worry about paying for my tuition. I had enough finical aid to pay for all my classes."
Freshman,4,"So far, the classes are informative and the professors are great. The campus is clean and safe. Since it is on campus with three other colleges,  it makes you feel like you are all connected. They provide passes for the lightrail and it's very helpful"
Freshman,4,"I just began my first semester with CCD, but so far it seems ok.  I get the impression the staff works hard, which is important to me.  Everyone is just a bit more patient when they know an individual is doing their best.  I like the fact that both the light rail, and parking lot are close to the building.  And if need be there is a shuttle that will take you to the car.  I get the feeling they have anticipated most of the pitfalls a new student can encounter.  It takes a special person to figure out how to hold your hand while allowing you to hold on to your dignity."
Junior,4,"Community College of Denver  has been a good experience, a lot of resources to help you succeed, good teachers, easy to navigate online support, scholarship and financial aid opportunities. Lots of campus events. The online classes are more expensive which is disappointing and a little bit more interaction in online classes would also be helpful. I would also like there to be a wider range of textbooks available for rent."
Freshman,4,I love the diversity of the campus and the beauty of the buildings. I am a non-traditional student and I love it that I'm not the only person like me there.
Freshman,4,"Faculty is very good, you are getting what you are paying for, recommend for everyone to go! Has a lot of diverse in the community and different culture, and people are very nice their at the school!"
Sophomore,4,"It's a great college to go to. The campus is shared by two other colleges so the area can get pretty crowded but not as much as it should be. The staff is very helpful in showing you what you need to do to apply, register for classes, and answer any questions that may arise. The instructors are very lively and helpful while also taking their job very seriously. 
Since the school is located downtown, there is much to see, do, and eat during off times from school. The school helps with this by giving you a transit pass. The only issue is the price of the food at the campus. Even fast food places in the area do not have a dollar menu."
Sophomore,4,This college is a great fit for those who want to earn a quick degree for a tuition that is not high compared to other universities and colleges in Colorado.
Sophomore,4,"It's a centrally located, affordable school to get all of your general education credits done prior to transferring.  You can earn your associates or pursue an advanced degree upon graduation/transfer, and it's FAR more affordable than traditional 4-year schools.  The environment during the day is upbeat and friendly, but because of it's location, it can become less favorable at night.  Professors are decent, and classes are small.  It's easy to find help from faculty or tutors.  All-in-all it's an excellent place to start your education."
Alum,4,"Very diverse campus in a location convenient to downtown. The campus itself is co-located with Metro State and UC Denver, so it has the facilities of a major four-year institution at a reduced price. Most of the professors are engaging and want you to succeed. Parking can be a problem (hard to find and expensive), but that's why the RTD bus pass (charged as part of the fees) comes in handy. 

The enrollment and financial aid process goes much smoother if you plan ahead, apply early (for admission and financial aid) and don't wait until the last minute. 

I went here, got my AA here, and my BA at UCDenver. Everything transferred over to UCD seamlessly."
Niche User,4,The Machining and Welding program is an amazing program and I am looking forward to being able to use what I will learn.
Freshman,4,I love CCD. I really like the teacher and the tutors. The only thing I would change is parking. The price should be reduced and there is not enough places to park. The parking lot is always full and has caused me to be late for classes even tho I get the 25 minutes before class even starts. It should not take 30 min to finally have a spot to park in.
College Freshman,4,All my credit are supposed to transfer fine
College Junior,4,my Experience has been up to up every day and self learn .
College Junior,4,The post- grad services; are very quality to put students grad on time and accurate with information
College Junior,4,"Community college of Denver it's wonderful place in the center of Denver Downtown; Start here and Go everywhere, the favorite experience is all resources available include Computer labs and all level Tutoring here.

the one things made my school unique is Students; they around world with Different cultures and traditions in here, I choose this school because I want to start from here and go everywhere.

Thank you!"
College Senior,4,It is difficult dealing with financial aid
College Senior,4,It is a small school
College Senior,4,I don't know enough yet
College Senior,4,It is similar to a four year university so that's nice
College Freshman,4,I've been taking classes that are just for general education so far but I'm sure once I begin to take classes specific to my major they will align with the exact things I need to be learning for the degree in my field.
College Freshman,4,CCD offers a variety of classes at a wide variety of times and days so it's pretty easy to work school into your schedule without getting too overwhelmed.
College Freshman,4,One of the biggest focuses is to prepare students for 4 year universities or careers so there are so many good resources for students and alumni.
College Freshman,4,"Although the main focus is to help students either obtain a certificate or transfer to a 4 year university, CCD has a very good career center that helps students find jobs and career opportunities while they're in school and in the future."
College Freshman,4,"I think a lot of people look down on community colleges as if they provide poorer quality education, but CCD is a good school for learning and gaining new skills. It's on par with traditional colleges/universities."
College Senior,4,My program will eventually transfer to a 4-year university and the curriculum is the exact same compared to if I took the classes at other schools. However all of my professors have been helpful and resourceful and the price can't be beaten.
College Senior,4,"Community College of Denver was a great, new school with amazing resources. All the professors I have had have been wonderful teachers and very resourceful. Definitely helps students get prepared for harder 4-year universities."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm able to finish all my classes at my high school, go downtown for those classes, and still have plenty of time to get a part time job"
College Sophomore,4,My class sizes are great and it's really easy to ask the instructors or other students for help.
College Sophomore,4,"I've been passing all my classes with easy A's, can't wait to get to the real life stuff!"
College Sophomore,4,"We are all just they to learn. No cliches, no gossip, no one cares I'm only 16. It's pretty great to just blend in and be like everyone else."
College Senior,4,"Majority of the professors I have had are wonderful.  Out of the the many, so far, I will say there were only three that I did not care for."
College Senior,4,I wished I was able to take courses that pertain to my major.
College Sophomore,4,like I said I love taking online classes here because workload is definitely manageable and professors are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,They actually transferred all my credits with no problems so it was great!
College Sophomore,4,It is definitely manageable! I love taking online courses because it is easy to register for and even if you don't meet in class most professors are around campus and are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are perfect because professors have time to get to everyone in the class and answer their questions. They are also very helpful when it comes to needing one to one help.
College Sophomore,4,The career services are very helpful and have flexible hours so everyone can get the help they need.
College Sophomore,4,I like there is always someone there to help you through it all. especially when your the first in your family to go to college and have no idea of the process. I would come back because it is not expensive they have what I want to study and they always offer you help with anything you need.
College Student,2,Some of the teachers are really good about working with you while most of them don't care at all. some of the teachers are really good about working with you while most of them don't care at all. The first class I took was a Tuesday Thursday class and the teacher wanted to assign a quiz every Monday at noon. I work a full time job and was unable to take it quiz on Monday so I went to talk to him to reschedule it to one of the days that I signed up to take the class and he told me that I was responsible for taking a college course even if it was a Tuesday Thursday and I would have to take the test on Monday at noon.
College Student,2,The teachers are not clear about assignments and I had a speech class where the teacher have the assignment two days before it was due instead of two weeks as he said he would in the syllabus.
College Junior,2,The instructors randomly change class times mid-semester with no regard for the students. One instructor handed out the syllabus 2 months late. The staff is VERY disrespectful to the students. I want to transfer to another school but I will have to wait for a student to drop out for there to be an opening. Also I will have to take an extra semester of classes at the other school.
College Junior,2,"The teaching staff is very underqualified. A physics teacher walked off the job mid-semester. The replacement was not qualified. A lot of strange ego, personality issues in the department."
College Junior,2,"I had a bad time with my math teacher before. The whole semester she would spend her time yelling at us, and treating us like elementary kids. She didn't understand that sometimes we like to work independently and as college students we can be responsible for myself."
College Junior,2,In the current community college that I'm attending right has a drafting program but not an architecture program. Since I want to be an architect and they don't have an architecture program I'm planning on transferring to a four year university.
College Junior,2,"School can be really experience when you don't get financial aid or scholarships. Also in if we want to take a class in the summer and you have a scholarship, it wont cover it. This is not so grate for someone who really wants to keep attending school."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the students transfer to a 4 year college or if they graduate they are offered work on campus until they find a job in their particular field.  CCD do have job fairs but usually caters to graduates in technical field.
College Junior,2,"Personally I am not allowed to have access to any ""final aid"" or any other governmental final help due to the fact that I'm an international student living in the US. But in comparison to the what in state pay verse out of state, is drastic. Its 3x the amount and for community college overboard pricey."
College Junior,2,People are only there  for money in most cases.
College Student,2,My Math teacher is great. She understand when you miss class because of personal things and she will always let you retake a test or make up homework. My English teacher on the other hand will take points off of your grade if you miss class or are late. She is not understanding at all. She also has missed many days of class her self and I doubt her pay check is getting docked for it!
College Student,2,I think the Community College is a base for people to start at. No one seems too happy or friendly. the staff in the student center and offices never know how to help you. I think a stronger training for staff would be very helpful since they are who have to help the students. 
College Sophomore,2,Average my book money was late.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is about what I expected. Not very challenging
Recent Alumnus,2,"I think that for some classes their needs to be exceptions to mature students, I have worked in medical field and have vast knowledge of Biology and yet they are making me take first year classes because my sciences are older than 10 years...a waste of money and time for me."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I feel the help for online students is lacking, office hours are lacking and one on one help online is difficult in some subjects like math."
College Student,2,I needed help with money for school and or help finding a job... but nothing not much help to help find grants or alternatives Solar resources are not very well.
College Junior,2,"I have not used the resources at the school, I had to find out what was available from my advisor, but I plan on using some of them this semester."
College Junior,2,"At my school, you can be seen or talk to the right people if you are there hours before you need to be. They are so busy and do not take appointments so its first come first serve. So I just plan around it. I do get whatever it is I need done, but I go as soon as the doors open to ensure I am one of the first people to be seen"
College Sophomore,2,"Computer lab is good, but wireless is pretty pathetic. Very spotty even in the Tivoli (student union), and nonexistent between buildings and even in some buildings (like Science(!))."
College Senior,2,"Considering the funds available to community colleges I believe CCD does attempt to accommodate students. However, from my experience most of the administrative employees have no interest in helping a student succeed. When I began attending CCD, I would visit the Academic Advising office for guidance and was thrown blindly into classes that did not contribute to my degree. I found I have had better luck navigating the requirements on my own accord and with my own research."
College Sophomore,2,Councilors  are often too busy to help wether you make an appointment or not.
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office is usually very busy. That being said, the value of the education I'm receiving is well worth the wait. A tip for success with financial aid is to stay on top of your forms, pay attention to your emails, and turn everything in on time!"
College Freshman,2,I never looked into these services so I cant comment on them.
College Freshman,2,"This school is somewhat unorganized. Anything you need to know or should know, you must find out on your own"
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a lot of cultural differences here on campus. A lot of demonstrations from other cultures happen during the year as well as a lot of street fairs. There is not a lot of things to bring students together unless you are of that religion, culture, or click. A lot of CCD buildings are really old and gross inside while the other two school, UCD and Metro are upgrading and building new facilities."
College Junior,2,I got out of the miliary in July and the finicial aid office needs proof that Im not in the military anymore. So I have to get IRS form stating that Im not in the military and not getting paid as much as I was while I was in. I think this process needs to be fixed when it comes to Veterans transitioning out of the military to become student because it is really a hassle.
College Junior,2,"As a new student, I feel that students should be told or shown what labs you can use and the printers that you can print for free with your account.  I still have no idea where I can go to for a comuter lab and not every area in the library you can use for CCD, as the library is shared with 2 major universities."
College Junior,2,I find the number one problem with our financial aid is that there is poor or no communication to the student. Mixed messages or none at all.
College Freshman,2,"They have good flexibility with class schedules, however many of the classrooms are sad.  We are in an ""overflow"" classroom for 2-D concepts when we should be in the art building.  This room is very dirty and has no where to store art supplies.  My art history classroom is very tiny and cramped feeling.  There is also a lot of construction taking place (super noisy!) so hopefully they are fixing the classroom issue?"
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office still says they are missing information from me relating to income, yet when I go in there they say it is their mistake.  If this is true then why am I still receiving emails saying I did not provide proper information?  I also do not agree with high out of state tuition rates.  Why should I have to pay so much more since I'm from another state?"
College Sophomore,2,Im a business major and my classes are somewhat i expected. My professor teaches very fast and has minimal time to answer questions.
College Sophomore,2,I wish the preofessors had more time to work with kids out side of the classroom. They should be there for their students everytime their students need help with something. They should not gbe rude seeing that they chose to be a professor.
College Sophomore,2,They don't give out information in a very accurate way.
College Junior,2,"Don't Have Time – I really just go to school for class and nothing else.  I don't get too into extra curricular stuff like this.  I am sure that it is wonderful, but I don't partake in student body stuff."
College Sophomore,2,The network really depends where you are at on the campus. Inside the computer labs and libraries the connection is fast and tolerable. When you try to hook up your own computer to the wireless connection it hardly connects and when it does it usually losses connection within minutes.
College Junior,2,"What You Pay for – The headline of this school would be you get what you pay for. It is cheaper than most schools with similar programs. However this means that there tend to be unexpected troubles. I have done very well in all my classes and the school does offer tutors for when you are having trouble. Unfortunately, not all the tutors take their jobs as seriously as I would hope. Also, I live somewhat far away so even though a bus pass is provided to all students, transportation was definitely an issure for me. I am looking to transfer schools to finish my education elsewhere."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Im Pretty Satisfied With My School. I do not like the fact of older (senior) professors, becuase i had to deal with my math teacher and he would always forget things and loose stuff and he would never speak up and could never hear us. Class registration process was a pain. I could not find space in any classes for the full load I wanted to take on. Special progrsms i do not know of because my advisiors are always busy and hard to get ahold of."
College Freshman,2,Lots of Computers – Lots of computer labs but most are for other schools on campus which is frustrating.
College Junior,2,"OK Experience – Filling out the forms was not a problem, but the communication between the employees and departments is abysmal. There is little to no notification when they need additional information and they people who answer the phones are not at all friendly or helpful."
College Sophomore,1,I would never take online classes again its not the same as being inside a class room learning from a professor.
College Senior,1,"When I was taking a biology class online, I had to drop it since I was having problems using the online microscope.  I would never recommend an online science course."
College Junior,1,For Rad Tech these things don't exist. We are on a separate campus from the main campus.
College Junior,1,When we get enrolled in my school we have to take a test that is called acuplacer. The acuplacer test you if you are at a college level which most students are not. Those who don't get in college level end up taking developmental classes to get into college level. Been on a developmental class takes forever and is a wast of money since you end up taking more classes. This is something that I don't like about our curriculum.
College Junior,1,Monitor your financial aid very closely because it's not uncommon for a mistake to happen! As long as you're knowledgeable about financial aid then you will be well equipped to deal with the financial aid office. It tends to be a hassle but not unmanageable. 
College Student,1,I have gone to the financial aid office many times for help and they looked at me like I was crazy! I asked them simple questions and they jst passed me along to the next person until I gave up.
Recent Alumnus,1,I did not get credit for any of my past courses and they are making me take again. Then financial aid was so messed up that I was unable to register for the classes I needed and I am now unable to get in as they are full.
College Senior,1,There are always problems with CCDConnect and D2L is almost impossible to use without it losing your work.
College Junior,1,I work full time and am a full time mother. I attempted to take a math class and was there almost every day and tried my hardest to pass it and at of the end of the semester I got a D and was sooo discouraged by that class I did not want to return. I even went to tutoring and the math lab and the teacher I felt did not take any of that into consideration
College Freshman,1,"Don't Wait Until Lasst Minute. I waited last minute to change my major to receive financial aid because every time I went in the office would be closed. Also, they weren't  very helpful when it came to answering my questions."
College Junior,1,"Getting Used to It – This was my first experience ever taking an online course. I was actually surprised by how easy most of the assignments were and how easily I was able to keep up with the workload. However,the site used for classwork caused me so much frustration navigating and accessing my assignments that it greatly skewed my veiw of this class."
College Junior,1,"The online classes I've taken were thoroughly awful. The teachers job seems pointless as they just instructed to read from a textbook. The assignments were obscenely easy, and there was hardly any peer-contact, and the little there was was forced and awkward. Online classes at this school are not for me."
College Sophomore,1,"I am a part-time student.  1.First financial aid.  I am only getting a partial amount now that i have requested a student loan.  2. It takes 45 minutes to get to the bus stop from the other side of campus. 3. Now, the school is restricting summer school, you need to be a full-time student or you can't go at all. 4. There are NO JOBS AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS, I have been on a waiting list FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
College Freshman,1,Its hard to get the money I need for classes because the financial aid process still hasn't went fully through yet and now I'm being threatened to be dropped out of all my classes.
College Junior,1,Honestly I know that it takes most student more than two years at this school so I havent really seen any post-grad students at the school or what the school does for them. I woud think that it is ok about average. I would not want to come back for any services because you get serviced by a student not professionals work-study students its a pain for me.

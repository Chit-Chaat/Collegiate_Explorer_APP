Sophomore,5,"I'm loving the online experience. It was a bit difficult in the beginning but now staff has been sending many email reminders, and we also have set voluntary meeting days. This is very helpful in developing a semi-routine."
Niche User,5,I have heard amazing things about stanbridge uni. I have friends that attend and I have seen the campus and it is absolutely worth applying and attending for those interested in medical field such as my self.
Freshman,5,My overall experience with Stanbridge University is excellent! I fell in love with the school and their programs the second I toured the school. The staff is absolutely amazing and really care about their students and want to see them succeed.
Freshman,5,I have just started the Veterinary Tech program here at Stanbridge. I took a tour here when I was a junior in High School and fell in love with it then. If you love animals and I mean any kind of animals this is the school for you.
Freshman,5,The advisors are great. They really listen to your goals in becoming a nurse. My advisor answered all my questions sincerely and did not pushed me to making a decision right then and there.  There is no need for a push to make a decision; the school speaks for itself. The technology and all of the student services that Stanbridge University offers surpass those other schools I toured.  I am so thankful that I made the right choice.
Freshman,5,Enjoying my experience as a student and the professors are really good and know what they're doing with the students.  I highly recommend stanbridge college.
Alum,5,"Since this is a vocational college, the setting was very intimate and black and white. One can walk in financial aid, the registrar's office or the Dean of Nursing's office with or without appointment and everything you need be done shall be in under 15 minutes. The administration listens to the student's opinions a lot so they may improve for the next class. Since this is also a private school, they value their students a lot. The once a year graduation for every course is grand and they process your paperwork for the state board exam right away as long as you submit your requirements on time. This was a really tough school for me because I was in it full time- meaning M-F usually 0630-1600 but in the end, every tear and struggle paid off and I'm currently excelling as an LVN. Thank you, Stanbridge!"
College Sophomore,5,Its exciting. There is never a dull moment with the program. Everything we learn comes straight from those in the actually field and can be applied to actually life. They are the only school besides the University of Cornell to have an electronic dog simulation where you learn CPR and other scenarios. They also start at the basics so you can fully understand what you are doing.
College Sophomore,5,"Stanbridge College is more than the best, it is excellent. The admission department was very helpful from day one.  They assured me that asking questions for any reason is highly encouraged and they are there to help no matter what. They have several student services, like stress and anxiety counseling even debt relief services."
College Junior,5,I had attempted to go to college and it just wasn't for me. I got extremely amazing support from the whole faculty to see me succeed at Stanbridge!
College Junior,5,"Stanbridge College has made my graduate experience a lot easier from the beginning of our application to our current studies in our first term.  This school really cares about it's students and their success.  They assisted me in every way possible, and the professors are very engaging and personable.  Because of the smaller class sizes, they are able to really get to know each and every student.  If we were to e-mail professors with questions, they are very quick to answer, and are available even after hours!  This school really looks at the students and who they are as a person.  During our orientation, our cohort as a whole made a comment in which we felt like we were really wanted by the school, and weren't just another number.  The professors and staff members truly care about helping us with succeeding in our studies, and to promote community engagement as well as giving us many resources to experience real-life applications.  The other cohorts before us are very interested in making everyone feel welcome, and this college really has the right tools to help students succeed in their future endeavors.  I feel lucky to have been accepted into such a prestigious school, and am excited to see what they have in store for future students.  If you are looking into a program, I would highly recommend Stanbridge College!  The labs they have installed are top-notch and very futuristic, and there will be more added onto the campus.  I was surprised at how approachable the professors were, even our president is very down to earth and willing to help us in any way.  Overall, this has been an amazing experience thus far, and I am proud to have made the right choice by choosing this school for my Master's in Occupational Therapy degree."
College Junior,5,"They have tutoring, student lounges, lots of restrooms, and provide vending machines."
College Junior,5,the education i am getting is worth the tuition. I got some financial aid that helped.but i am okay with it because I know that after I graduate there are jobs waiting for me.financial aide helped me with everthing and even emailed me when I had to renew anything.they even helped me apply for a few scholarships.
College Junior,5,Loved meeting career services they were very informative and helpful.
College Junior,5,"Labs Are Amazing! They have very realistic lab settings at Stanbridge. Some labs are set up like a hospital setting would be, some are set up for home care. They have state of the art equipment and are up to date with the newest products. Also, a really great thing that Stanbridge does, is to have a testing review at the end of each term that helps you prepare for your license or certification tests."
Freshman,4,"Before the online transition due to COVID, I was really enjoying my educational experience at Stanbridge. I loved the intensity of the program, and I really was able to dedicate myself to my studies. I learned more about myself academically, and was able to find ways to learn that were beneficial for me. I spent all of my time outside of school in the library studying and going over my notes. I felt a lot of encouragement from the staff that worked in there to help me excel in my education."
Freshman,4,"It is a resourceful school and teachers are great! This lockdown has made it difficult to communicate well with the staff, but everyone has been nice."
Sophomore,4,"They are a good school that will really increase your critical thinking skills; however, YOU will have to be the one applying yourself. It's a small private school so staff is always available to be of assistance. The bathrooms are always clean! Always!"
Freshman,4,Standbridge has a wide variety of resources to ensure that it's students succeed. They require volunteer/community service hours in their programs which help us students to be more well-rounded.
Freshman,4,Great campus and labs. The staff is very friendly and supportive. I definitely recommend this school if you are looking to get your RN.
Sophomore,4,I am half way through the Veterinary Technology program and I have learned so much! Hands on expirence has definitely helped prepare me for my future career. This is an accelerated program and face paced so the workload is very heavy. This program is very very difficult  but with dedication you will succeed!
Senior,4,The administration and department director treated me very well.  Whenever I had a problem or question the department director would always take time to address my  problem of question in a timely manner.  The teachers really care my opinions about some of the course assignment and if I thought an assignment was not explained well or caused confusion they would address the problem and make necessary changes.
Senior,4,"Learning wise it’s great but very overwhelming, I’m in the vet tech program and is in sane. So much to learn in 2 years and schools regulatings suck! 
As a student i was very stressed, thank god almost done just working on my intern."
College Junior,4,Very helpful in seeking career opportunities
College Junior,4,The application process was very easy and straightforward
College Junior,4,I have learned a lot that will help me in my career
College Junior,4,"So far, stanbridge has been a well put together school and makes me feel like I am going to be very prepared for the OT field"
College Senior,4,"The way the cohort's are set up makes it a very comfortable experience. We are with the same 30 students from start to finish so we have created an excellent support group for each other. After almost 2 years together we have become more like family and this is a very unique concept for a college experience. The workload fluctuates so you have to be good at managing your time and preparing ahead of time. The restrooms need updated, but the rest of the facilities are nice. We all have two 8 week long internships. The internships allow us to apply all of our knowledge from the classroom to real patients."
College Senior,4,"Our school is definitely accepting of everyone and students come from all over Orange County, Los Angeles & San Diego. Many of the students have already been working for awhile and they are going back to school for a change of career. Very few are fresh out of high school. We have a diverse ethnic population and everyone becomes very close within their cohorts. Many of the students in my classroom are working part time-full time and a lot of them have families as well."
College Senior,4,Career services has reached out to me and offered to help with anything I need. I am not currently in a place where I have utilized their services yet so I can't provide the best feedback.
College Senior,4,I feel Stanbridge has provided me with a great education and they really focus in on the information we need to know! I felt prepared entering my second level II fieldwork. I personally feel the anatomy and physiology class should have been longer and gone over more information in detail. The labs are excellent and all of the professors are either Cota's or OTR's so they have a lot of valuable information to share with the students.
College Senior,4,"They offer a student resource center where students can go if they need any computers/books/printing needs, or just a good place to study!

Plus they offer tutoring free of charge! It's easy to set an appointment to get tutoring and they really do care about your success!

The school itself is situated in the beautiful city in irvine close to many food options!

They offer many volunteer opportunities as well.

They also have a career services center with people who actually help you find a job in school or for graduates!"
College Senior,4,I am currently just starting classes and everything is well organized without having to run back and forth finding classes! You really only have one class (different instructors for theory and clinical) so it's easier to keep track and everything is concurrent so there is no confusions!
College Senior,4,"This is an amazing school in general.
It's a private vocational school that offers programs such as Licensed Vocational Nursing, IT, OTA, PTA and soon to have a Vet Tech program.

The enrollment process was very simple, there usually is no wait list. They just need your basic info/diploma/GED or equivalent.

Financial aid was a breeze too, the financial aid officers pretty much do the work for you...now I'm currently enrolled in their full time LVN program and tuition is about 30-35k. Depending on your family income, the financial aid can vary but they are very informative and helpful with that.

The classes themselves are nice, you each have your own comfortable seat with a computer in each seat. All classrooms use smart boards and instructors are super helpful and kind.

They have a state of the art Sim-lab as well. Classes are at a set schedule and you also get the schedule for the whole year!

Overall, the people and the environment, very clean, good looking school with amazing instructors. Your quarrel with the students vary."
College Senior,4,The financial aid officer I worked with was wonderful and super helpful. Other classmates have not been as fortunate. Is the education worth the amount I'm paying? Won't know till I graduate.

Junior,5,I have definitely made some of my best friends for life at this school! I was unsure about going to a school far away from home but being at Stonehill has given me a new home that I am grateful for. I have been given access to some of the nicest and very knowledgeable professors which as definitely made my academic experience that much better. I was able to learn about real world experiences in my classes and able to learn about the real working world. I am very grateful that I chose Stonehill College.
Junior,5,"Even with the pandemic, the professors have done a really good job at making the semester as normal as possible which I really appreciate."

Sophomore,5,I absolutely love college so far. I am currently in my second year. I commute to Stonehill College which is about a 35 minute drive for me. I love commuting because I can go home to my own room and home after school. I love making my own schedule to fit my life. my campus is beautiful and my classes are never more than a five minute walk from my car. I love Stonehill!
Alum,5,"As a recent alum, I am so proud to have attended Stonehill. I am grateful for how amazing my 4 years were- from the challenging academics to variety of clubs and organizations to the inspiring professors- it is absolutely worth it. I have made life long friends and feel confident in my first job after graduating. I hope to continue to be successful and be able to give back to the school one day!"
Sophomore,5,The last few months leading up to move in day my freshmen year were nerve wracking. I was not sure if I was going to find friends right away. Luckily with orientation and the activities at Stonehill College I found forever friends as soon as I walked on campus.
Freshman,5,"I have enrolled for the fall 2019. I attended orientation and had a great time! Beautiful campus, good friends, friendly new friends, and great Peer Mentors"
Junior,5,I transferred to Stonehill asa sophomore and absolutely loved it! I am involved in leading tours and hosting shadows. It was a really easy integration process into the community and I really connected with the professors and students. My classes are really interesting and the professors are always available to meet. They are very passionate about their interests.
Alum,5,Loved spending 3 years of my life here. Made lifetime friends and the professors are the best. It was a home away from home. I loved getting involved on campus
Sophomore,5,The campus is so beautiful and has a true homey feel. It feels like a home away from home. The professors are so nice and easy to talk to and easy to contact about getting extra help. The school is decent size so it feels like you know everyone but every once in a while you will see a new face and it is so refreshing.
Senior,5,"I loved the community at Stonehill College. There was such a sense of inclusion on campus that made it truly feel like home. The activities, the education, and the faculty all made my experience the best possible one here."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at Stonehill College, I would say I have never felt more accepted in a very diverse community of people. Everyone at Stonehill has such a passion for academics but also making the college experience a very memorable one. I am able to express myself and surround myself with others who resonate with me. As well, there are also a lot of opportunities to join clubs and other activities and events to balance out school and social life. I am excited to continue my journey on this campus and community for the next four years!"
Sophomore,5,Stonehill is a fun environment with caring professors and a beautiful campus! I wouldn't want to go any where else.
Sophomore,5,I love Stonehill! I just finished my first year and I can't wait to move back in. It's the most beautiful campus with the best classes and the best people!!
Sophomore,5,"Stonehill is welcoming, inclusive and a family feel environment. Chapel is beautiful, with a very active campus ministry program."
Alum,5,"It was a great place to go to school, a safe place to spend your college years.  Very expensive, but I can't put a price on the opportunities I was afforded by going there (service trips, athletics, etc.), and the fact that going there set me on my current career path (starting graduate school in occupational therapy in the fall)."
Freshman,5,All of the students are so nice and professors are always willing to help. The campus is gorgeous and two new buildings are currently being built to expand the campus. It is a very welcoming and warm community.
Niche User,5,Stonehill College is a welcomes anyone that values traditions along with the applied mechanics of studying your preferred major. SAT scores are optional and you'll find yourself with a career after you've finished your 4 years at Stonehill. There is also an assortment of clubs that you can join that are inclusive of everyone. The food is provided by Sodexo which isn't your bestie. Financial aid is what this college might pull you off sometimes.
Freshman,5,"I'm a first-year student at Stonehill College and while I've only been here for a semester, I can say that I've loved being here. The staff and professors are nice, everyone there is rooting for you and just wants to help you do your best to achieve your goals. The grounds are beautiful, the facilities are very nice, especially the science center, and I don't really have any complaints about it other than sometimes it takes a while for work orders (repair requests) to get filled. I'm not a partier, but I know there's a party scene and it's bigger than Stonehill's admissions act like it is. Overall, with how caring the school is and how it's helped me so much academically so far, I give it a five out of ficve stars."
Sophomore,5,"Stonehill is a great place to be. Most professors care about you and go out of their way to help. Students are generally friendly. Community service is huge and there are plenty of ways to get involved on campus and off. The campus feels very safe and I am not afraid to walk around alone. Overall, I love Stonehill."
Niche User,5,Stonehill has un-comparable academics for a small catholic school its size. The professors are accommodating though the work is challenging. Party scene is okay but there is stuff to do regardless of how much you party! love stonewall great school
Freshman,5,"Stonehill was my top choice during the application process, so when I put my deposit down for freshman year, I couldn't have been happier. Now that I have been on campus for a month, I can honestly say this place feels like home. Every student, no matter the grade level, will say ""hi"" as you walk by, hold the door open, and will engage in a conversation between classes. The professors have office hours, but those don't apply here because if you aren't able to meet during those hours, the professor will shift their personal hours for you to get assistance. The research opportunities hear are incredible, and the professors will get you doing as much as possible. I am a freshman and am working with a senior on her thesis involving the activity levels in guppies under different stress stimuli. I've been told that college is the best for years of your life, and just from one month on campus I can say they will be."
Sophomore,5,Stonehill is a great college . It is not a big college but doesn't feel small . It provides everything you will need to advance into the future. Great programs advancements all around campus . Stonehill is the big time in a small setting. The campus is beautiful easy to  navigate ....thevfoid is actually pretty good  esoeciallt the chicken sandwich.  If you havent checked out Stonehill please do you will be surprised at everything the college has to offer. I really love it here I made the perfect choice to attend here.....
Sophomore,5,"Stonehill College is an amazing 4-year college. From the absolutely beautiful and spacious self-contained campus to the outstanding academics to the welcoming and inclusive community, Stonehill is worth the investment."
Freshman,5,Stonehill College offers a very supportive community in addition to its' great academic program.  The professors are very accessible and want to see you succeed. The campus itself is beautiful and offers many quality services. I highly recommend Stonehill College.
Alum,5,The friendships I made while there are ones that I will have for life. I am always finding a way to get back and connect with others that have interest in going there.
Alum,5,"The best part of attending Stonehill College is the sense of community. It's large enough that there are plenty of academic and extra curricular events in which to engage, yet small enough that professors are friendly and accessible, and each student has a place to belong. As an institution of the Congregation of Holy Cross, Stonehill students have ample opportunities to pursue religious education and celebration of faith without requirement or burden to participate. Athletic varsity and club teams are competitive yet fun. Campus lies between Boston and Providence. Dorm residence is comfortable and lively. A Stonehill education is truly rounded, thorough, and meaningful. Stonehill graduates are prepared for the working world and to create a more just and compassionate world."
College Junior,5,"Great career services, help you from the start.  Get your individual pathway going."
College Junior,5,"Very happy as I have incredible internships available along with student research opportunities, engaging faculty.  The students are helpful and kind.  Community service is a big factor."
College Junior,5,Beautiful dorms and on-campus housing.  Lots of space in them and lots of on-campus apartments.  Well above average housing options.
College Junior,5,I love this school.  Has great opportunities available.
College Sophomore,5,Everything is great and professors are easy to get along with
College Junior,5,"For the alums that have graduated that I meet in either my freshman year or sophmore year, they are either in a year of service, they are in GRAD school, or they have an job that they love."
College Junior,5,The police are good at going about the sexual assault cases
College Senior,5,"Professors are awesome - they really care!  Give you research opportunities - more than I've seen at other schools for undergraduate.  Great people - most are happy and friendly.  Great school, location close to Boston, love everything about it."
College Senior,5,So many internships available - everyone has one or two.  Leads to great connections and jobs.
College Senior,5,I visit many friends at other colleges and have yet to see better housing.  Stonehill has the best housing - spacious - beautiful - and lots of apartment options.
College Senior,5,We are very competitive and win lots of conference championships in multiple sports.  School spirit is high.
College Senior,5,Really happy with this school.  Lots of support and opportunities to grow and learn with professors that care and friendly classmates.  Everyone is happy and helps one another.
College Sophomore,5,You need to work hard but you get a lot out of your classes. Professors put a lot into the classes
College Sophomore,5,Lots of internships to choose from - career services will help you find one if you have a special interest - and many students are doing undergraduate research with professors.
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy at Stonehill - everyone seems to be happy and helpful
College Sophomore,5,Our campus housing is beautiful - apartments - most live on campus all four years - so there's a strong sense of community.
College Sophomore,5,Lots of school spirit.  And the athletes support each other's games and events.
College Sophomore,5,"I'm so happy with Stonehill, I love this school.  People are so friendly, everyone supports each other.  And students are getting great jobs.  There is strong career services and internships, they really help you get a job in your field.  And lots of students are doing undergraduate research.  Overall fantastic experience."
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about this school
College Sophomore,5,They work hard to support students until graduation
College Sophomore,5,good people = good place to live
College Freshman,5,Absolutely love Stonehill and everything they have given me
College Freshman,5,Career Services works with all of us as freshman to get us to be as prepared as possible for jobs and networking.
College Freshman,5,"Brand new Sports Complex lets everyone have equal access to athletics, varsity or recreational."
College Freshman,5,Stonehill genuinely cares about its students and their education. It cares even more about how they are doing following graduation.
Alum,4,Amazing college experience with amazing opportunities. Hard to say goodbye but the school made me ready.
Alum,4,"I was a psychology major and sociology minor at Stonehill and I cannot speak highly enough of the professors in these departments.  Stonehill is a small school, so we have a strong community feel.  I made the most incredible friends here and my courses and connections helped me to feel prepared to enter the real world.  However, I do wish they had more options for mental health support and that they would value diversity more strongly and realistically."
Alum,4,Academically an excellent school. Professors that care and are willing to support you in many ways. Socially not the best. The school attracts many of the same type of people therefore not very diverse. Parties are slim to none and usually busted. Plenty of clubs and on campus activities.
Junior,4,Stonehill College provides an excellent education while also creating a community of like-minded individuals that want to excel in their pursuits.
Senior,4,"I love Stonehill College. The quality of the education and the compassion of the professors make the school worth every penny. I do wish the administration was a bit more compassionate, though. I also wish they cared more about their commuter students."
Niche User,4,I attended Stonehill College for my freshman year and it was an outstanding experience. The professors were all very knowledgable and the classes were challenging yet engaging. My only complaint is that the school was not very helpful financially - part of the reason for me leaving. I would have loved to continue my studies at Stonehill for the rest of my college career.
Sophomore,4,"I love Stonehill College! The community is amazing, they make it so comfortable and easy to learn! The professors are so understanding and helpful, they never refuse to help. The financial aid office is so nice and understanding."
Alum,4,"My background: International student majored in Economics and business
Education: 80% of my professors, especially in my field are really smart. Learned a ton. If you're looking to challenge yourself, take the harder courses. The work for an average elective isn't too demanding. The academic environment in the classroom is not competitive
Advice: if you're smart and want the highest quality education where your classmates are competitive and entrepreneurial, apply somewhere that’s harder to get into. If you care mainly about enjoying the college experience and getting a “good job” after graduation, stonehill is great.
Politics on campus: From my experience, 90% of students and professors are on the left or far left. (I had one class where the professor blatantly embraced Marxism and no-one in class had dissenting views."
Junior,4,"Stonehill offered a good education and a nice environment to do it in.  If you want a large party scene or importance put on sports, then this is not the school for you.  It is relatively quiet for most of the time while you are on the beautiful campus.  While they are working to change this, there is little diversity when you are sitting in a classroom and look around."
Freshman,4,"- campus is beautiful
- students are very close to one another 
- easy to connect/network
- course material is challenging but get a lot out of it
- close connection with my professors
- campus safety is taken very seriously
- campus police do rounds every 15 minutes and there are emergency systems around campus
- D2 for sports
- can go down the street to a restaurant with friends or stay on campus for bingo (where you win free stuff!) or karaoke night. 
- only some lowerclassmen and upperclassmen have AC 
- housing is very expensive (approx. $16,500 for 2019-2020)"
Junior,4,"very competitive academics. Professors care so much about students succeeding, they're willing to help in any way possible."
Freshman,4,I love the academics and how many opportunities Stonehill has provided me with. The campus is beautiful and everyone is very friendly. I feel at home and comfortable on a day to day basis and feel challenged in my academics.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Stonehill College’s community, professors, and students. There is not much I would change. thank you"
Niche User,4,"It was a beautiful campus, and the people there were quite nice. It was also quite small compared to other colleges. Pretty cozy environment."
Junior,4,I appreciate the relationship students are able to develop with faculty because of the student to professor ratio in the classroom. I also appreciate the opportunities this college offers in regards to internships and job offers.
Junior,4,Academically challenging! Far from a party school but there are many amazing people here. Professors get to know you on a personal level and truly help you to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Stonehill has a wide variety of things to do inside and outside of the classroom. The professors are very helpful, and they want to help you succeed. Everyone on campus is very nice as well. If I could change anything, I would like to see more healthy options to eat at the dining hall."
Sophomore,4,"I love Stonehill College, they really focus on the community as a whole and really hope every student does well. They are open to help everyone that asks and all they ask for is hardwork in return. Stonehill is family."
Sophomore,4,I love going to school here! Having such small classes and a close group of people I know is great. Most of the professors are wonderful and truly care about their students that they have.
Sophomore,4,"Stonehill College is a beautiful school located in the suburbs of Easton Ma. This school is small and tight knit, but very inclusive. Even though the school is a Catholic affiliated college, you do not have to be Catholic to attend. They are very open and accepting to all, and have many programs to support diversity. The schools resources are very good, and help both academically and for your career. Some of the services that are the best are their career services, the center for writing and academic achievement, and counciling services. The professors at this college are very helpful and you will get to know them. You are not just a name on the roster for the lecture."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman I have not had a lot of time to truly comment upon my experience, but for the few months that I have been at school I have had a good experience. Obviously, no school is perfect but I do not have anything to really complain about."
Senior,4,"Stonehill is a beautiful place but is lacking in a lot of areas. It is very much a small, Catholic school, and has a lot of growing to do to be a more accepting place."
Sophomore,4,"Stonehill College has a pretty campus with easy access to classes and I feel safe even walking late at night. The professors I've had so far have been great. There is a wide variety of clubs and extracurricular activities for all interests. The food is good and plentiful. The dorms for freshman and sophmores are in need of long over due upgrading however, the RA's I've had have been great."
Freshman,4,"Good education, get some of the feel of a big time in college in the parties and social life. Low school spirit although, no one really goes to the games for any sport. Not much to do directly off campus but the school makes is less than $5 to get into Boston and only takes about an hour. Campus is the most beautiful sight in America and it never gets old to look at, no matter the season. Dorms are relatively good, no huge or glaring problems to report. Biggest problem is the food, the service they use also serves many prisons across the world, (Sodexo, look it up) but the students are making progress in changing that. School is about to undergo a huge change and open up a new business school, as they are already one of the top business schools in the area. 8 out of 10 from me."
Freshman,4,I love this school a lot I just wish that they paid more attention to the commuters. A lot of people don't realize how many there actually are.
Freshman,4,I like the size of the campus. I like how close-knit the community is. I like how many opportunities there are.
Freshman,4,Stonehill has easily become my brand new home over the past few months. The class size is ideal and all my professors are amazing. I am being challenged in my academics and in my ability to manage my time. I absolutely love it here!
College Junior,4,I feel safe at school.
College Sophomore,4,"Drug use is not visible, no one really talks about drugs. Alcohol is pretty abundant in wet dorms"
College Junior,4,Other then one professor that I had a snag with my overall expericne with the professor on campus ae excelent. The do not allow the students to fail and give them many opportuities to proseper inside of the classroom and out. It is also easy to build a good relationship with a professor who in not in your major to help you with academic assistance.
College Junior,4,Depending on where you live it can be a hit or miss
College Junior,4,I love the opportuinity that the Stonehill brings
College Sophomore,4,Going to a small school can be difficult to interact with people outside of immediate friend groups because people seem to be very clique-y
College Sophomore,4,"Enough to do on campus - and Boston, Cape Cod, Providence are close - great location.  Down the road is Gillette Stadium."
College Sophomore,4,It's there if you want it and plenty to do if you don't want it.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe but there could be improvements
College Sophomore,4,Great for athletes and non-athletes
College Sophomore,4,Best decision was coming here
College Freshman,4,Great housing with a strong sense of community
College Sophomore,4,There are many safety poles and campo is allways present
College Sophomore,4,The rooms are fairly clean and no huge problems
College Freshman,4,My professors are always willing to help and they grade very fairly and dont give a lot of busy work. I also like the small class sizes.
College Freshman,4,The teams do well and there is a lot of school spirit as shown by game attendance. The athletic facilities are very nice and new.
College Freshman,4,"I like this school because i have felt very welcomed among the students as well as the faculty. I like how there are a lot of opportunities for people to get involved, making me choose this school again if I could."
College Freshman,4,"The sports complex is wonderful for athletes, and for those who just want to exercise in their personal time."
College Freshman,4,They were very nice when i went
College Freshman,4,I like most of my professors
College Sophomore,4,"Since my first year on campus, there have been three reports of sexual assault. In addition, just last year, we had a bomb scare and the entire campus was evacuated. The students were asked to go home or to go home with a friend. Since then, the campus police have been very visible, patrolling the campus almost constantly. On Saturday evenings, the gates for the driveways into the campus are locked. There is only one way onto the campus and cars coming into the campus are stopped at a checkpoint and campus police ask to see student identification."
College Sophomore,4,"The college just completed a state of the art sports complex and although I do not participate in any sports, I do use the facilities to exercise. The complex is beautiful, clean and inviting."
College Freshman,4,I don't like sports but they are very into sports and have the best teams possible
College Sophomore,4,Stonehill is incredibly competitive both athletically and academically. Stonehill usually finishes within the top three in their division in terms of student-athlete academic success.
College Junior,4,Stonehill is a great small liberal arts school that has a lot tooffer. The small size means you get one on one attention and professors know your name. Everyone is very friendly.
College Junior,4,"I love my school. The academics are great and I feel like I am really learning a lot here. However, I do not believe it is worth the hefty price tag. If I were to choose a college over again I would pick a much cheaper school."
College Freshman,4,"It's a great school that is highly underrated. Many of the students here end up going to grad schools in Boston including Harvard, BU and Northeastern."
College Junior,4,"Stonehill College is great intitution for higher education. Teachers focus on helping the students as much as possible in order to grasp concepts and have the ability to apply it to test on their own. As a varsity athlete, I feel looked up to by the student body and I appreciate that. Your coaches make sure that you give the same amount of effort in the classrooms as you do in the playing fields. Even though it is sometimes challenging to juggle both athletics and academics, it is achievable with hard word and dedication. Along with superior academics and athletics, Stonehill offers a variety of fun extra curricular activities that anyone can be apart. These fun filled activities give students a chance to unwind and escape the pressures of class and sports to blow off some steam."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't begun taking classes yet, but I'm so impressed by the level of commitment and devotion Stonehill College has to its students. My school is small, focused on community service and personal growth, and full of friendly people who want to make a difference."
College Sophomore,4,I would definitely choose to go to Stonehill if I had to do it all over again. The people there are great and very welcoming. There is such a strong sense of community that really makes the college experience worthwhile!
College Sophomore,4,The college is so boring and small that I spend most of my time at the gym. There's no pool though which is really annoying.
College Sophomore,4,"Policies are very clear, they go over them very clearly at orientation so there's no way you can say that you didn't know about certain policies."
Sophomore,2,"Because of corona, most of my classes are online. They are fine, but definitely worth the amount of money they charge. I'm better off going to a community college."
Sophomore,2,"This school is not absolutely horrible, but it's not great. At first, I liked it here, even though the parties took a while to pick up. I'd say second semester of my freshman year was the worst. It is so small, so if you are remotely normal or outgoing, people will know about who you hook up with or what you do. The girls can be absolutely brutal, it feels as though I go to a small private high school. They gossip so much, and are so territorial over the bum guys. Don't even get me started on the athletes. The girls are cliquey and claim all of the male sports team players. The male players are absolute dogs and could not respect women less. The parties pre covid era were not awful, but they are very repetitive. Campo is ungodly with how strict they are, if you even stumble they will transport you. The aspects I enjoy are the professors and I do enjoy knowing everyone, however I feel as though I know everyone there is to already, and most of them aren't accepting."
Niche User,2,"Stonehill was not the worst I made some good memories there. Yet, it was bad enough that I did transfer out. The higher-ups have no idea what diversity is and think it's all about race and sexuality, it’s not. There was no diversity in personality, looks, class, or lifestyles. If you are even SLIGHTLY different from your typical white wealthy attractive person, I do not recommend Stonehill at all. I have never been surrounded by so many self-absorbed students AND professors. I have had girls stare, whisper, and ""ew"" me like I was in high school again, these are ""adults"" and nobody is teaching them how to act like grown-ups. I have had the same immature attitude from several professors too. PLEASE if you are even the least bit different or mature, do not waste your time, look elsewhere for an environment that will prepare you for the real world and embrace your uniqueness. This is the place for sheltered students who grew up in religious schools and wealthy neighborhoods."
Freshman,2,"Stonehill College is a very small school, with an insane lack of diversity. The surrounding town is very small with very little to nothing to do, and getting to Boston is a hassle. The professors, however, are very good."
Alum,2,"I had a rough time at Stonehill College. I had chosen it because it was highly recommended, had a beautiful campus and beautiful new facilities for me to pursue my college career for the medical field. What I found in my time there was impatient professors, a status quo I did not fit into. They preach diversity but there really was none. Rather than help and nurture my yearn for learning, I was told at one point I should just give up, switch to something easier."
College Freshman,2,They handle sexual assaults very poorly
College Freshman,2,"We have no gates around our campus, and during the week no one is checking who comes in and out of campus. This makes my friends and I feel nervous and afraid that someone crazy could come in as they please! Not cool."
College Sophomore,2,"It's really sad because there are so many majors available, but students here don't care about academic success."
College Sophomore,2,"The professors are terrible, but they try really hard. I've had very few professors that I highly thought of."
College Sophomore,2,"I never hang out in Easton. I always take the shuttle to braintree, and on the weeks I go an hangout with my boyfriend in Boston because he goes to Northeastern"
College Sophomore,2,"The health part is great, but there is an unreal amount of sexual assaults of students on students. They send out a notice whenever one happens. I don't feel safe walking alone at night, and carry mace and a rape whistle even though the campus doesn't allow mace. I'm planning on transferring, but I'm working on creating an on campus support group for sexual assault victims whether on or off campus."
College Sophomore,2,It's like having freshman housing forever.
College Sophomore,2,Party Scene? Are we talking about the same school? There really is no party scene at Stonehill and it kind of sucks sometimes because it is college.
College Junior,2,"Over the last few years the party scene has been declining because of policies put in place to help protect students. Though the administration means well, hurting the nightlife also hurts the students opinion of the college, and if some students cant find things to do, they then transfer to other schools."
College Sophomore,2,"I live on campus , the location around is very pricy"
College Junior,2,The school is very strict about partying. Try to visit other schools if you're looking for a big party scene.
College Senior,2,"The amount of school spirit this school has is a joke. Literally. Everyone always jokes about how little school spirit we have.  There is no school spirit. No one goes to sports games and no one generally cares about the sports teams expect for the people on the teams. Overall, we're a pretty average D2 school. I think our best teams are our men's and women's ruby teams. Our football team is usually pretty bad. 

As far as facilities, the gym is really nice, especially if you are on a team. If you're not on a team the gym is still nice but there aren't enough machines for the amount of people that use it. Sometimes you'll have to wait for one to be open before you can use it."
College Freshman,2,The strictness gets a bit insane at times. It started out fine but after three sexual assaults they've cracked down. We have to show IDs to get on campus from my dorm and again when you get in the dorm.
College Freshman,2,Wrong atmosphere for an forward-thinking English major
College Junior,2,"I received a decent amount of scholarships based on my academics but I wish they could do more. Also, my forms always seem to get lost in their office."
Niche User,1,"Stonehill is complete garbage. Student accounts is especially rude, as well as financial aid and the deans. They’ve taken years to find a provost and do nothing when women are assaulted. Do nothing with bias incidence reports. Campus police aka meter maids only write tickets, they don’t actually help you. Professors are completely unreasonable during the pandemic and straight up rude. Athletes get preferential treatment. No party scene even pre covid. Sodexo food has given students food poisoning. Mold and insect infestation in Boland hall. If Stonehill was a public school it would need to be desegregated."
Niche User,1,Technology incapable and too frustrated to try.                                                      The professors don’t check their emails and IT fixes what’s not broken
Freshman,1,"I had better educational opportunities in high school. They have no grasp of distance learning.  They do not answer email, especially if you have a problem with a class. There is no oversight of instructors, like they are happy just to get someone in there. It is like Southern New Hampshire University at 4 times the price."
Freshman,1,"They spend alot to advertise but there is no reality to the sales pitch.  Teaching assistants teaching businesses classes that have no experience in business.  Instructors who fail students for internet issues when they cannot even run the software. No accountability,  Instructors inaccessible,  and massive overpriced room and board in run down dorms. These private colleges are a hustle. Stonehill is a collosal waste of money."
Niche User,1,"I don't recommend Stonehill at all. I attended my freshman year and Stonehill just lacks everything that makes a good college environment. Academically, the classes aren't very hard, but the professors are all super nice people that are willing to work with you about anything that comes up if they can see you're putting in effort. However, the social life here is absolutely dead. The school has an active stance against any parties on campus. I would understand this if the parties were out of control, but most of the time they are just 50 people standing uncomfortably in a room. There is also no real social events that take place at the school. The sports teams are mediocre and nobody bothers going to football or basketball games, so don't plan on those being fun. Not to mention a counselor recommending that I seek inpatient treatment for what was later diagnosed as a minor panic/anxiety episode. Left Stonehill and I've been very happy with that decision."
Niche User,1,"Went here for my first year of college and will forever regret how they manipulate and exploited kids for money. The people at the school are still in highschool with the brain capacity of a struggling alcoholics making it to the weekend. The staff are also extra useless I was sick with a medical disability and had to withdraw. They treated me like I had the cold. As a result my mother had to scream at them while I was in a hospital bed bleeding out my rectum. Thanks to the compassion not found at this school all they want is your money. But the whole place is a losing dump and the dorms are depression. Plus don't leave the campus cause it's next to Brockton aka crime central. Finally, I remember nobody would talk to me or ask to hangout because I didn't have alcohol or was a jock. It might as well be called stonehill highschool since living here will provide you with sucicdal thoughts if you have half a brain."
Alum,1,"Stay. Away. Like honestly if your parents have the money then fine go here, but if you’re taking out loans don’t go here. It’s miserable, snooty, and you’ll regret going there by month 3. The people who praise this school are too stupid to realize they got swindled or didn’t pay for their education."
Sophomore,1,WAY too liberal. Don't come if you're a Republican. Don't say you support the president either. NO other views allowed here besides Democratic ideas. All training for jobs is legit brainwashing. Miserable. Don't even get me started on the professors.
Freshman,1,"The school strong-armed me into staying there another semester by withholding my transcripts over a 100 dollar cleaning fee. My roommates and I had a vicious  and abusive relationship which the school was fully aware of and did nothing about. The professors are biased and hold blatantly ignorant views which they force down the throats of everyone who they teach, and fail those who openly disagree with them. I do not at all recommend this collage. It is classist and corrupt."
Niche User,1,"Big-time campus security issues, especially for girls. Do your homework! My daughter was assaulted on campus. Pursued a Title IX investigation and took a semester off to deal with the trauma. When she tried to re-enroll, Stonehill did everything to push her away. Housing was a fiasco, no help from academic advisor on creating class schedule, and they cut her financial aid in half. Stonehill has long history of assaults on campus, and makes life difficult if you report it."
Freshman,1,"Tiny, oddly isolated for people without cars. Classes feel about the same difficulty as community college nearer to my house. One of the least diverse places on the planet. The administration could not be worse. Tiny campus and dangerous surrounding area."
College Sophomore,1,"The diversity is terrible. I have never seen such a white washed place in my entire life. Everyone is rich and proudly displays that by wearing vineyard vines, lily pulitzer, hunters, etc."
College Sophomore,1,"If I could do it all over again, I would go to a large school with greek life and plenty of diversity. I cried so much my first semester at Stonehill because I was so unhappy. Honestly, the only reason I didn't drop out after my first semester was because I met my boyfriend at Northeastern and I left every weekend to hang out with him and escape Stonehill. I had friends at Stonehill, don't get me wrong, but they were all so stuck-up and preppy. I honestly can't wait to leave and transfer out after this upcoming semester. I hate the professors, I hate the students, and I hate the campus for all the reasons listed in my survey. It could be for some people, but it is definitely not for me. I'm a first generation college student and have never felt so out of place in my entire life."
College Sophomore,1,We dont have greek life because we are a catholic school
College Sophomore,1,"THERE IS NO DIVERSITY... all catholic, white preps from the northeast"
College Sophomore,1,only the football house is off campus nothing else
College Sophomore,1,my major is undecided so i cannot say at all really
College Junior,1,"As someone who isn't Caucasian, Irish, or Catholic this school doesn't even come close to being diverse."
College Freshman,1,"Hardly any, and most are wealthy"
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life or housing because Stonehill College is catholic

Freshman,5,very enriching. I found that the toxic school culture does not translate onto the Zoom meetings which is very great.
Alum,5,"USC has so many resources to give you a headstart in your career. If you want to work in television, you can join Trojan Vision, a fully student-run television station. If you want to start a business, you can test the feasibility in an entrepreneurship class with the support of your professor. USC students work hard and play harder. My only regret is not using every minute I had there to explore something new. Four years is not long enough. And you can't beat the weather."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes. The online resources were fine, although they really should put more effort into improving the job board."
Junior,5,"I have yet to start my first class, but I have received great reviews of several professors who are trying to make the best out of this very difficult and unprecedented situation."
Junior,5,"It has the number one film school in the country. Although I have only recently transferred and am about to start my first semester online due to the pandemic, the professors have been working to help provide the best educational experience they can for rising members of the film industry. We have been given incredible opportunities to attend workshops with well respected industry professionals (all from diverse backgrounds/races/genders) and an amazing chance at launching our film careers. I am hopeful, excited, and beyond grateful to have been offered acceptance at such an amazing and respected institution."
Sophomore,5,"While learning online can be a challenge, USC has done everything they can to ensure that students have the appropriate resources to be successful"
Sophomore,5,LOVE going here! The environment is so encouraging and the professors are willing to help you be successful.
Graduate Student,5,"As a result of COVID-19, the latter half of our spring semester was put online, as well as this upcoming fall 2020. We are using Zoom like many other institutions, and it has been smooth. There are no faults with how USC has done online learning-- but online learning is definitely not as helpful as in person. It can't be helped, though."
Junior,5,"Online classes were seamless for the most part, teachers really embraced it with open arms and continued to make classes work better."
Junior,5,Great school! Love the vibez and blessed to be apart of the Trojan Fam! Fight On Trojans!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sophomore,5,"Professors and the USC faculty were very understanding and lenient with online learning based on my experience from Spring Semester. Allowing students to Pass/No Pass their courses instead of letter grades after receiving their final grades was very thoughtful and helpful for many students such as myself after experiencing the drastic change in our learning setting. Nonetheless, students were kept very updated and the quality of education and the professors' hard work to give the best education they could never wavered."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Southern California offers a diverse expertise in multiple fields, both academic and artistic. With world-renowned classes for science, drama, music, business, design, architecture, and so much more, USC is determined to give the best education for students who are pursuing careers in all fields, making sure that different needs, hopes, and dreams are accommodated."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes while at USC...I cant skip this question. 
I did not take any online classes while at USC."
Alum,5,"I have studied at two universities and worked at another and can say without a doubt that USC my favorite. They have a beautiful campus and fun surrounding living area. Most students live near campus. The courses were all interesting and challenging. The professors and TAs were all great and accessible. The opportunities for extracurricular activities were amazing. The reputation of the school is great. I always get great comments when people find out I went to USC.  I would recommend it unless you want to study in a small college town, then this might not be for you. I personally learned to love LA and it offered so much fun things to do and great places to intern as well, even while I was in school."
Works Here,5,"I start on August 24th and I can honestly say so far it’s good. The academic advisors are really on top with helping students. Given the current circumstances of the pandemic, the staff has reached out making sure we still build the connections"
Works Here,5,I have not started my fall semester yet. Looking forward to start this online experience. The faculty has made sure that we are all okay and reaching out providing resources to how to prepare for this semester giving instruction is going to be online
Junior,5,"USC is such a well rounded school that it deserves to be on Top 10. It’s like everything you dream of in a college - beautiful campus, diverse student body, rigorous academics, world renowned professors and strong emphasis as a research university. Business, Engineering, Communications, Film, Education & Law are top notch and expect to be competing and working with talented and like minded smart individuals.  It almost like when you heard of LA, it’s most likely that USC run it and made it as vibrant as it is today. It’s a Disney for college with a work hard & play hard culture. Trojans don’t just make the work done, they make it fun. Yes, it’s still a party school and what’s wrong with that? College supposed to be liberating you to new experiences not exhaust you to death."
Junior,5,"University of Streaming Classes (USC) is literally ten times harder than in person. They’re out to get you, you’re expected to download a third party software while taking exams or open your camera on zoom so the professor can monitor you. I personally didn’t like that but I know it’s for the sake of academic integrity. I love how professors utilize break out rooms to promote collaboration and getting to know your peers."
Junior,5,"USC was my dream school ever since freshman year of high school. The Trojan Family was the one thing that attracted me the most. Although I didn't have the GPA or the SAT score when compared to the average USC students, I was still accepted due to my passion in studying Psychology. USC is a beautiful campus and it fits me very well. USC does a wonderful job of creating a friendly environment for their students to learn and socialize. Honestly coming to USC has been the best experience of my life. I've grown and learned so much since the beginning of college."
Graduate Student,5,I applied to USC because of the wonderful online virtual classroom platform and so far they have not disappointed me. The teachers are passionate teachers and it shines when they teach.
Graduate Student,5,I applied to USC because of the wonderful online virtual classroom platform and so far they have not disappointed me. The teachers are passionate teachers and it shines when they teach.
Junior,5,"Location is one of the best things about USC. The weather is generally really nice. Professors are a big key to what makes USC awesome. I've yet to encounter the stereotypical stuffy, monotone professor who makes you want to jump out the window. As for sports, I know our football team is great, but we are a pretty good school academically, too! Although I am not dorming, the dorms are top of the line. Commons can be a good place to hang out, if it's not too crowded or loud. My favorite place is one of the many cafes sprinkled around campus. You can watch news, do work, eat lunch, and enjoy the weather all at once. Although we're right near downtown Los Angeles, the area immediately surrounding USC's campus is not very safe.  Hence, the walls and gates around the campus make you feel like you're in your own little bubble sometimes. School pride floods USC. Everyone has at least one USC shirt or sweatshirt."
Sophomore,5,"I haven't been online yet. But, I'll assume they are doing the best that they can with the resources that they have."
Sophomore,5,"USC is a great school and has amazing opportunities for people in so many different fields. USC leads in the business, film, music, engineering, design, and theater industries. The return on investment is good depending on the major you are in. Don't expect to break even on the 80k per year you are spending if you are a Sociology major. The campus is amazing, it feels like a resort. The dining hall food is not spectacular but the food places nearby like wingstop and chipotle are great. There are endless resources at your fingertips so I recommend doing your research so that you know what is available to you as a student."
Niche User,5,"I'm Still applying to the school but they are very helpful in guiding me through the process. From helping me schedule to sending me documents, they  have been a huge help."
Alum,5,"I didn't take any classes online, but all of the in-person classes were phenomenal. Great faculty, unique courses, and challenging curriculum, with the benefit of individual attention."
Alum,5,"There's truly no school on this planet like USC. It has offerings for literally every type of student out there, and is the most incredibly community in the world. The alumni network is just one of the aspects that makes the university so incredible, but definitely sets the school apart from others -- especially as students embark on careers and search for jobs. The Trojan network is unparalleled and lifelong. Choosing to attend USC was the best decision I've made in my life, for the incredible experience during my 4 years there, and the future it has set me up with. Fight On!"
Junior,5,Online classes were not stressful and yet still allowed me to learn. The professors really try to make the most of this time online.
Junior,5,"I have met so many people from all over the world in this incredible university. It has everything from academic opportunities, to parties, to arts, to athletics, and so on.  No regrets, and I am sad I am already 1/2 through. Also, this university is so proud of its students and this definitely is felt on and off-campus. 
This university is global and definitely teaches you perspective, exploration, and critical thinking. The professors are very passionate about their work and will definitely push you to break your comfort zone and become a stronger and deeper thinker. The students are not competitive against each other but ambitious with their own academics pushing themselves to succeed. Simply being in this academic atmosphere of constant critical thinking and discipline with rub off on you."
Works Here,5,USC's online platform is very well organized and well prepared. There are multiple pieces of training available for both students and professors. Ready for online learning at USC in the upcoming years.
Works Here,5,"The University of Southern California is a profit school, which people think is very expensive. But the funds available for students are huge. It may end up with a cheaper cost compared to state universities."
Sophomore,5,"The school has literally everything you can think of in place for its students! The price tag is hefty, but the networking opportunities and access to amazing professors are worth it. Pretty much everyone on campus is opening minded and welcoming, I haven't encountered anyone who is rude or judgmental for no reason. The school spirit is crazy high, and dorms (the new ones) are like hotels. The school is undergoing lots of updates to old dorms and added The Village which has great food and a Target and Trader Joes! 10/10 recommend. Theres round the clock security too, so don't be worried about that. The school feels super, super up to date with current issues, and is NOT a stuffy environment like many of the ivys. Kids are crazy tenacious, but often work together, and the campus is surprisingly more diverse than I (a minority) was expecting."
Sophomore,5,"Zoom is awkward, but teachers haven't lost their drive to teach at all! I wish we got some tuition back, but the education was still great."
Alum,5,"The online Social Work Program is world renown. I did not take online classes while at USC, but they are industry leaders in online education."
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience at the University of Southern California! The professors are excellent teachers as well as world class researchers. You will be treated like family, The Trojan Family, and not like a number as many public schools in California treat their students. You will always experience professionalism and respect from administrators. In California, where disrespect and ego run rampant, USC represents a touch of class and elegance. After you step on campus, you'll feel like you never want to leave!"
Sophomore,5,"USC is well balanced with academics, social life, networking, etc. The price tag is worth the school!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Southern California is a top tier school with endless connections and opportunities. This private university has a great balance between education, professional opportunities, extracurriculars, and sports. The University of Southern California has a diverse student population and finding a group of likeminded people is not difficult on this campus. The majority of the professors at the University of Southern California are professionals in their field of work and study and have great knowledge of the subjects being taught. Though the cost of attendance is quite hight, there are many opportunities to reduce this cost (financial aid, student loans, federal work-study, etc.). The University of Southern California has a lot of work-study positions available all over campus. The best part about the university is the constant bustling energy all over campus. Students, workers, and professors all seem to enjoy their time on this campus. Overall, USC is a great university."
Sophomore,5,"I think USC has a great campus. There's a lot of security 24/7 so you do feel safe walking around, and if you don't, there's always services to walk with you or take you to your destination. The campus is beautiful, and it's a very good environment to be with friends in or make friends."
Freshman,5,"The best decision I ever made. The professors are brilliant, classes are engaging, there are so many activities you can be involved in, and ""trojan family"" is not just a slogan."
Freshman,5,Perfect campus in the perfect city. The atmosphere on campus is incredible with motivated students and professors that care about educating the next generation.
Freshman,5,The University of Southern California has been doing an amazing job of keeping incoming freshmen updated and connected even through this pandemic. They're effectively using social media platforms to make the student feel as if they really are on campus.
Graduate Student,5,The University of Southern California is an amazing school! The staff makes you feel very welcomed and excited to be there.
Junior,5,"As a transfer student, the University of Southern California has exceeded my wildest expectations for a four year institution. The moment I stepped foot onto campus for summer orientation, I fell in love. As someone who is from the opposite coast, I had my reservations about the famous Trojan Network. Once I got on campus, I was immediately able to feel the synergistic aura of USC and it's unique sense of community. Before enrolling, I thought I would be just another ant on the ant farm. That thought was quelled by the collaborative environment amongst students, professors and faculty. Trojans are always there to help each other as we are all representing the same institution. A final note about USC is how it differentiates itself  amongst competing schools by facilitating a stress-free environment on campus. The implementation of the new mental health floor at the Engemann and professors willingness to work with students' issues is a testament to the environment they have cultivated."
Freshman,5,This school has everything you could be looking for. Any type of student would be able to find what they are looking for here. No regrets.
Niche User,5,"The campus, the academics, the faculty, and location are all amazing. Definitely the best choice I ever made- I love it here!"
Junior,5,Amazing and beautiful campus with incredible opportunities. The out reach to the entertainment industry and Los Angeles is unmatchable.
Freshman,5,"I love the energy on campus. Everyone is always super friendly wherever you go on campus. Academics are very rigorous, but professors generally want you to succeed and help you. All the facilities on campus are relatively new and kept in very good condition. Two out of the three dining halls are very good, which is nice. The Village shopping center right next to campus is very new and super fun! There are tons of areas to study, get food, coffee, and groceries. Overall, a very beautiful and pristine campus filled with spirited, kind Trojans. The best school ever."
Freshman,5,"I am a student at the University of Southern California and I absolutely love it! It is a perfect balance of rigorous academics and a fun, social environment. The campus is great. USC has it all."
Freshman,5,very niche and selective. loved the opportunities it gave me throughout my years there i dont know how i can live without those times and the lessons i learned. my life has been changed forever
Freshman,5,"The best balance between an amazing education and a social life. Very much a work hard, play hard school. The classes are amazing and there are so many resources available if you need a little extra help."
Niche User,5,"amazing! the campus, the sense o belonging to a real family! USC experience is really great. top academics, great lifestyle, safety and security. it doesn't get any better than this. fight on!"
Freshman,5,"USC has, so far, given me a great variety of opportunities that have only enriched my experience here. Not only are my professors great, but they are engaged with their students and what is happening around us. As an architecture major, there have been challenges, but the professors and university has been nothing but helpful."
Niche User,5,Overall very good and clean. Great place! Everyone is very nice and friendly and the cafeteria is really amazing.
Junior,5,Academics are as good as the ivies.  USC and Los Angeles is the best place to be for a future film/ tv/ stage actor.  great financial aid and merit scholarships.
Junior,5,"Being a student at the University of Southern California is like no other. The campus is beautiful and the academics are stellar. The whole school feels like one big family. The athletic programs are top notch and really bring all the students together. I love being able to attend countless games while seeing cheering fans who truly love where they go to school. The best part about the University of Southern California is the Trojan alumni. With over 425,000 Trojan alumni in the world, you are always connected to a Trojan. The wonderful Trojan alumni are there for you beyond your four years. They give opportunities to advance in your desired career field, as well as be there in a new environment. No other university is this connected between current students and alumni. I am proud to attend USC, where academics, athletics and alumni blend together making the ultimate college experience!"
Freshman,5,"I love it! USC has really offered me a lot. As I continue with my USC journey, I hope to be part of the narrative that creates recognition for not only diversity but also inclusion across campus. Although USC has proven to incorporate a diverse student body, diversity is more powerful with the implementation of inclusion. I hope to use my role in USC’s Undergraduate Student Government as a student leader to create policies and behaviors that aid the recognition and celebration of all kinds of differences, whether it be culture, gender, or any other group. Best of all, as my experience has taught me, I know USC will support my commitment like others who advocated for inclusion and diversity to create a more aware and embracing community."
Sophomore,5,"I’m very proud to be admitted at USC, it is very expensive but it is worth. The campus is amazing. The student life, the safety ... everything is excellent. I only wish they could offer financial aid for international students, for us it is very hard to get a job."

Graduate Student,5,"Amazing. I am a student at the Rossier School of Education and the graduate program has an emphasis on equity and inclusion in education. The professors are very supportive and provide lots of resources to continue learning on your own outside of classes and to challenge yourself. In addition, the coursework is paired with practice in the field, and there is great flexibility in where you may choose to complete that field practice (as long as the school has high-need in some way)."
Works Here,5,"USC is great academically. Good private school and competitive that can be as competitive as other ""popular"" private shools such as IVYs."
Freshman,4,Being a freshman on Zoom is not the move but the professors are very understanding. People are pretentious but not intentionally.
Sophomore,4,"Love it! USC has been so welcoming and fun. However, I wish they were more focused on campus-wide advocacy and promoting change. USC has a reputation and I want to help change that!"
Sophomore,4,Online school has been easy to get used to and honestly feels the same as learning in person now. I wish it was easier to find people to study with
Graduate Student,4,"Loved USC for all the resources it provides for its students, the small class sizes, and great facilities. However, it is extremely expensive, and USC has had a lot of scandals tarnish its reputation in recent years. Relatedly, USC needs to work on how it responds/deals with these scandals."
Niche User,4,Its a nice school that is close to many thing in LA. it is very big and full of many people from many places
Niche User,4,Professors are really nice classes are large but some can be small. would recommend this school teachers really care about students
Sophomore,4,"The online experience at USC is different from the in person courses at USC. I feel like I tend to be more lazy in my courses when they are online, but the professor and course still have the same type of value."
Sophomore,4,"I love the resources, dynamic environment, and welcoming atmosphere during my first year at USC. The amount of experiences available at my fingertips is clearly shown in every direction I go in, and I am truly grateful for the events and people I have encountered."
Sophomore,4,The professors are very intelligent and caring about the students. Improvements can be made for increasing diversity.
Sophomore,4,"Personally, as a Classical Vocal Performance major, I have had an amazing time at USC. I have had many amazing opportunities, and very capable teachers who understand what I wish to accomplish in my 4 years. I don't have any complaints for myself, but something that all parts of the music school needs to better at is diversifying the types of music and the performers mainly being featured. I myself am a white, European heritage female, which unfortunately allows me to have opportunities that many of my friends are never even given the chance to attempt."
Junior,4,My overall experience with USC has been wonderful. Pre COVID 19 I was so proud of my university and the experience they had provided me. The most wonderful students and professors out there. Now I am not so pleased. Since the pandemic my University had failed to show their support for the student body. They have failed in giving us information in June that was not accurate to what they planned to do in the fall. The School of Dramatic Arts at USC has also failed to show support for their students during this difficult time.
Junior,4,"I don't have any online learning experience at USC but I hear that while the courses are rigorous, they are very much worth it!"
Alum,4,"Overall, I loved USC! It has a beautiful campus and so much to offer in terms of classes, student resources and activities. It was very easy to connect with other students from Day 1- there are so many events and activities, from concerts and open mic nights to food festivals and a myriad of clubs. Yes, it is an incredibly expensive school - I highly recommend applying for scholarships and grants as much as possible before attending because it adds up quickly. The area is not so great, there were some times when I felt a little unsafe walking around off campus but that's just something to be aware of in general for the LA area. The classes were challenging and I was able to pursue my other passions like acting and architecture along with my major. Fight On USC!"
Niche User,4,"I'm Still applying to the school but they are very helpful in guiding me through the process. From helping me schedule to sending me documents, they  have been a huge help."
Sophomore,4,Even with all of the recent scandals I feel as though my education at USC has not been compromised. My main issue with USC is the fact that it continues to hike up tuition for current students and even though its financial aid is treating incoming students great I feel as though it has forgotten about its current students and leaves us struggling to balance multiple jobs and classes in order to be able to afford attending.
Sophomore,4,Professors have definitely dealt with the recent crisis in different manners. I have been fortunate enough to have mainly professors that have adapted well and am learning well online but others that have had difficulty transitioning and are not as flexible which makes their grading unfair.
Sophomore,4,"USC's professors care for their students, especially during online classes, so they are willing to accommodate to students in order to help them during these unprecedented times."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Southern California did its best job of trying to make the online learning experience as easy as possible. Professors and administrators were very accomodating when it came to unprecedented circumstances. The school extended the pass/no pass option to after the date of final grade input to provide ease of mind to the students who were negatively affected by the pandemic academically. All of the lectures were made available online due to possible time zone issues and other unavoidable circumstances. The university even prepared for the possibility of online classes with a trial run before the pandemic spread. This was proactive and game both students and staff to understand the basic features of Zoom before being forced to continue on with this style of schooling. Professors did their best to understand the online platform and continued teaching as normal as possible. Overall, the University of Southern California did very well with the online learning experience."
Niche User,4,I have taken courses at the University of Southern California on behalf of the Neighborhood Academic Initiative program. This program provides high school students the opportunity to take their math and English classes at USC as well as provide courses in the summer. This school has a lot of diversity and helpful professors who I have associated with. One thing I would like to see or change is the availability of more scholarships and internships for high school students.
Alum,4,"With professors at USC, it can be a hit or miss. Some are very enthusiastic about what they're teaching (almost all my English professors), but some don't care and even read off old power points, making me feel bad I'm spending so much money to self-study. There are a lot of clubs and student organizations available and the Office of International Students are good at helping most of the time (but there was one at the front desk who had no idea what he was talking about, so make sure to make an appointment with an actual counselor)."
Niche User,4,The campus was so beautiful and the school is very good with education and getting a job after graduating. The area the campus is in is very unsafe.
Sophomore,4,"I love this school, I truly do. There are lots of benefits to going to a private school like USC- there’s rarely been a class that I wanted to take that I couldn’t. Many of the seminars are very specialized as you can have classes with five people in them as an undergrad, allowing for a better connection to the material and professor. There are so many clubs that I lose track; if you love something, you can guarantee that lots of other people here do too and you can find that club/community. As far as professional benefits, USC holds many career fairs both for on campus jobs, but more importantly for careers and summer internships with all types of companies- big ones like PWC and smaller more personalized companies as well. SC is definitely a sport school. We go crazy for football here and with the team and the marching band, you can’t help but be infected with school pride. I’ve loved my time here so far and look forward to the next few years. Fight on!"
Alum,4,"I loved the quality of the education that I received, as well as the resources that were available.  I had many wonderful, brilliant professors who were passionate and made great contributions to their fields. I also enjoyed being a part of a large university that offers so many opportunities for their students to become involved on campus and within the community. I would like to see improvements to the university's administration and mental health services, which seem to be underway."
Sophomore,4,I really like how engaged the professors are with the university community. There are many positions within extracurricular and research labs for students to get involved in.
Alum,4,"I loved the relationships I had with my instructors and peers. I like that even though it's a huge school on a big campus, it had that small-town family feel. It was rather expensive though, and I'll be paying off loans for a while. The scandals also kind of tarnish the reputation it once had."
Alum,4,"I loved the culture at USC, particularly surrounding the football games. I also thoroughly enjoyed my major-specific courses. I was not the biggest fan of the options and requirements for general educations courses, nor did I appreciate being unable to replace some of my general education courses with AP test scores of 4 or 5."
Freshman,4,"The USC Campus is really lively and beautiful, especially if you have a chance to stay in the village. Many of the students are thriving due to this. While classes and athletics are good, there are minor issues with them. Also, the diversity is a bit lacking."
Niche User,4,I wish to see more diversity among the students. There tends to be just a huge population of one race/orientation.
Alum,4,"It's a great academic institution with a lot of opportunities and a mostly enthusiastic faculty.  The campus is gorgeous and the extracurricular options are endless. My main gripe is how expensive tuition is, and how large many of the general education classes are."
Freshman,4,"Most people here are very passionate about what they study, and it shows. Lots of diversity and exposure to different cultures. It can be kind of difficult to find a group of friends if you aren’t into partying or don’t have the money to go out every weekend. Lots of resources for the students; I’m glad I chose this school."
Freshman,4,"To be totally honest, I love USC. As a Film and TV Production major, attending the number one film school in the world hasn't disappointed. The resources, industry connections, and professors are amazing. In addition, the people I have met at USC have been phenomenal collaborators and friends. USC could improve on its rodent infestation issue as many mice are seen traversing the campus."
Senior,4,"I really liked some professors and classes, especially the ones for my major and minors. However, I thought some of the GE classes were unnecessary and took away from my time to focus on my major. For example, I had to take an Earth Sciences GE that required a lot of studying, but my major is Economics and realistically, I don't have much to gain from learning about Earth Sciences.
I really enjoyed the extracurriculars at my school and loved getting involved on campus.
I think the mental health services on campus are a bit lacking."
Freshman,4,Great academics! I love my classes and there's many opportunities to get involved around campus. The people are a bit different though - just hard to initially connect with.
Freshman,4,"It is an amazing school where you can work hard and play hard. However, I got a feeling that the school cares too much about its publicity rather than the students' well-being."
Junior,4,"A school that has everything you could ask for, as long as you're willing to seek it out. One drawback is how stratified/fragmented the campus is but that's difficult to avoid at any university this size."
Junior,4,I love the community and the support on gets at USC. The student faculty ratio in my department is small so I get to know the professors and theres a lot of opportunities here if one looks for them.
Niche User,4,"For a school as expensive as this one, we are a bit surprised by the lacks we have found. One dorm with A/C. Students dealing with health issues not ""allowed"" to tend to health because it puts their grade in jeopardy. Being charged for everything and anything. On the other hand, we believe in the school and the opportunities it can afford our student."
Sophomore,4,"USC has been an amazing experience so far. There's a large selection of interesting courses, the professors are usually very helpful and active in their relative industries. Networking and socializing are highly encouraged on campus and the school offers many mixers and events with speakers, allowing students to make great connections for the future. The campus is beautiful and the student body is very diverse."
Freshman,4,"I like how included everybody makes everybody else feel. The campus itself is beautiful, and USC does everything they can to make everyone feel safe."
Senior,4,"Almost everything about the school is amazing. The environment, the campus, the professors, the networking.... 5 stars. The one con = it's VERY expensive."
Senior,4,"I love the opportunities and the amenities the school offers, as well as the professors who make it worthwhile. However, it is a tad difficult, which is to be expected. The elitist nature is a huge point of contention."
Sophomore,4,"USC is an overall great university in all aspects from academics to quality of student life. However, as a spring admit, I believe the integration and transition of spring admits is not fluid. There is a lack of information and communication between the school and students, which can be frustrating. However, once I adjusted and situated everything, I found USC to be a good experience."
Junior,4,I love the students at USC. I am from California and feel USC has the perfect balance between academics and fun. Some professors can be biased and it is a very expensive school but so far it has been worth it.
Graduate Student,4,It's always been a dream of mine to go to USC and so far I'm loving it. The only reason I give four stars is that sometimes I feel out of place.
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at USC. There are people here from all walks of life, so everyone will find someone to connect with. Academics are tough, challenging, and rewarding."
Freshman,4,"I just attended the late June orientation and was able to stay overnight at one of the dorms. The overall campus is beautiful and the orientation staff was very helpful and motivated. There is an incredible amount of school spirit and a focus on collaborative student encouragement rather than the competitiveness of other similar/highly ranked schools. Registration was quite difficult due to the time and demand of the more ""interesting"" classes, but this is to be expected due to the open schedule of sophomores, juniors, and seniors looking to register for classes before then."
Sophomore,4,"The academic expectations of USC are very high, and professors genuinely care and try to help you achieve your goals.  From my experience, the professors I've had had all been very approachable.  Student life is very lively, especially during football season.  Overall, this is the four year experience that anyone could appreciate."
Freshman,4,"I am thoroughly impressed by this universities academic and research opportunities available to its students. USC is a wonderful place to diversify, learn, and expand upon in your prospective field of study. There are world renowned professors and facilities at the disposal of students and bountiful opportunities to engage and succeed."
Freshman,4,"USC is an amazing school in terms of academics. There's definitely a higher standard and you have to work for your grades but you come out having learned a lot. Because it is a private school with lots of appeal in the heart of Los Angeles, it does attract a fair share of ignorant, privileged people. However, you can definitely find genuine people, just keep looking and being you! USC has so many perks and resources and I highly recommend getting involved whether it be sports or clubs! The professors are very experienced and amazing."
Alum,4,"I love USC and it's an amazing school with great professors and a great learning environment. Given that the administration is putting a damper on its reputation, it's not necessarily worth the cost."
Graduate Student,4,"Going to USC will connect you for success, on top of that, it is in the middle of Los Angeles with a million opportunities for success."
Sophomore,4,"If you are looking to be challenged academically and professionally, USC is the place for you. USC has so many resources where you can develop experiences and resume-worthy experiences right on campus that is cater to your specific career paths."
Senior,4,"Really great personal experience HOWEVER, during my time here, there have been more scandals than ever before. I would love to see USC clean up their act because this is a great school that deserves nothing but praise for its efforts in helping its students succeed."
Niche User,4,They have a variety of facilities and I loved how everyone seemed to be focused on their own thing. The vibe was calm and I loved how the school is in the heart of LA. There is so much to do.
Freshman,4,"USC is an excellent school with a lot of great opportunities for all sorts of social lives. This college is a great way to influence yourself in the right way a
rid with the right varieties of diverse cultures."
Senior,4,I loved this school i had a good time i hope i graduate next year i love the weather it is so warm i lived in a place where it snows a lot this school brought me out of my shell.
Freshman,4,"As a student with a STEM major at USC, I can easily say that this school is not simply a ""party school"". USC is quickly rising in the ranks of universities in our country and its acceptance rate is falling consistently. That being said, for a STEM major, this school is very challenging and academically capable."
Senior,4,"Excellent professors, some of them have changed my life. However, horrible student culture and horrible administration. To be honest, any man I've met working in USC's administrative body has been terrible to me, this school's female leaders are the reason it produces such amazing students. Whenever I have needed something, it is the female staff and faculty that have come to my aid."
Senior,4,"I transferred here and am pleased with my choice to come here.  USC provides a great deal of need based financial aid, has opportunities for work study, and has great networking for post grad life.  There is also a lot to get involved with academically, socially, and abroad."
Senior,4,"Surprising international Chinese population. Very diverse campus. Good for comp sci, architecture, film, business, and communications. Can have VERY weak majors like economics and physics. The area around campus is not safe.
Excellent food. Housing is hit-or-miss. The culture is predominately sort of extraverted people but you’ll find all sorts. Very career-oriented school that will give you a lot of opportunities if you care even a little bit."
Freshman,2,"Pre-med.
TA's: entitled & rude. They treat you like you should be honored to be in their presence. At the very least I'd expect staff that wants me to succeed. 80k a year & I was self-teaching out of textbooks far too often. I couldn't justify the debt for the academic experience I got. 
Amazing campus. Tons of study nooks & meal options.
Gentrification.
Campus Safety: Lots of groping on& around. ‘Closed’ campus but you'll see homeless people on it. DPS does have a large presence.
Blatant disregard for student mental health. My psychiatrist joked about how many student suicides we had last semester. They severely messed up my medications multiple times. I'm lucky I noticed.  
I’m liberal. But I don't support professors who use their position as educators to push their ideological agendas. Don't come here if you're conservative. You'll be alienated.  
Bottom line: if you like greek life, enjoy echo chambers, don't have mental health issues, or do have a trust fund, come to USC!"
College Senior,2,I don't think it's good for students to be involved in Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,It's way too big on campus and promotes horrific gender roles like you would not believe
College Sophomore,2,"At least in my dorm, somebody got kicked out."
College Freshman,2,@Max Nikias can you PLEASE put some air conditioning in all freshman dorms. it is 2016 and we are sweating like animals !! It is Los Angeles in tall brick buildings !!! I measured the temperature in my dorm and it was 120 degrees !! I got heat stroke just from being in my own dorm !! I had to sleep at a desk in the library for a week !!
College Junior,2,The class size is too large for in-dept learning.
College Junior,2,"For the amount of tuition, the quality does not reflect the quantity."
College Junior,2,"I am not a participant in the greek system. I think it is the worst thing about USC and is holding back some of the growth within the school. I wish it would be a more balanced part of the undergraduate experience so that the better parts of the school, like its academics, arts and undergraduate programs could flourish more."
College Freshman,2,"Living near a community that dislikes the University for its overly preppy and insensitive students, USC lives up to the safety concerns. The fact that walking a block from campus in any direction offers a safety risk, the constant sirens, and insecurity at night poses serious issues that USC does not address. Though it cannot change its location, its lack of safety should trouble any student or parent."
College Freshman,2,"For 16,000/year I would expect something better than the average hotel room. For that much money, do I have access to a hot tub, pool, game center, arcade, etc. ? No. You get an average apartment/dorm room that would cost significantly less anywhere else. Also, if you care about your health, avoid the water in general. You know your living space is crap when your facets consistently smell of sewage."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to relive High School where clubs and cliques are pronounced, then Greek life is for you. Each house fits a high school stereotype, just look for the one you want to fit in and be sure you have enough money and no life. Being Greek gives you unprecedented access to STDs, alcohol poisoning, and drastically increases your chances of sexual assault. Of course, you can join a service frat/sorority that not only perform projects a few times a semester but offer non-sustainable solutions to problems. If you want to think you make a difference without actually doing so, service frats/sororities are for you. Then again, if you want to be a lonely nobody you can pursue your education."
College Sophomore,2,Sexual assault is everywhere. I myself know at least 3 girls who have experienced it. It's a touchy subject I don't feel comfortable speaking out about to administration.
College Sophomore,2,"It's bad because varsity athletes, specifically football players, are treated like slaves. They are doted on by the school in many ways. Don't get me wrong, they get tons of stuff for free. But, they work constantly and bring in a ton of money for the school. Administration doesn't care about their academics, though."
College Freshman,2,Greek life members are mostly bad people.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The dorm that I lived was old and was not comfortable at all. The gym was in small room in parking, and with bad smell. The heating system constantly need maintenance. The  room was painted with bizarre  brown color. Overall. It was awful."
College Freshman,2,I appealed financial aid several times and still ended up paying thousands of dollars.
College Junior,2,"I don't party on campus, but I know it's primarily the Greek system that parties the most."
College Sophomore,2,Nikias is trying to limit our partying and turn us into Stanford. We're not having it.
College Freshman,2,"Sexual assault at frat parties is a covered-up problem, and neighborhood crime is very impactful on life."
College Freshman,2,"Hazing, drinking, and hooking up are huge on this campus.  It's hard to find people who don't partake in any of it."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is attractive, but most people are also stuck up, entitled party kids.  Also, it is rare for people to date, hookups are much much more common.  Everyone dresses fairly uniformly, just in a USC sweatshirt and jeans or shorts.  It's boring."
College Junior,2,"Some of the new residential building house new options, but other options aren't as exciting - McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. Services that deliver food from around LA are very popular"
College Sophomore,2,A lot of fast food; not that much variety in the immediate area; havent been offered student discounts in nearly all of the surrounding restaraunts; a few spots with healthy/vegetarian options but higher costs
College Freshman,2,"Most off-campus housing is very expensive.  Quality not worth the cost, but most don't want to live on campus after freshman year so do it anyways."
College Freshman,2,I spent so much money ordering out last semester because I absolutely do not like the food in the dining hall. There are probably only 2 meals a week that I actually enjoy. The rest of the food lacks flavor and you can tell that some of the food that's used in the dining hall isn't of the best quality. I'm definitely not going to miss the dining halls next year (students don't really go to the dining halls after freshman year). The food isn't absolutely horrible but it's definitely not good.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly we don't have the ""intellectual community"" that colleges try to sell us (does it even exist?). People are into partying and typical high school type social life. This mostly describes freshmen and sophomores of course. Some older students, especially those in tough majors, seem withdrawn from everything besides classes. ""Most people"" are west coast white kids from norcal and above, which should paint an accurate set of stereotypes."
College Junior,2,The financial aid office is often hard to deal with.
College Freshman,2,"It is all very materialistic. Yeah, their houses are amazing and their clothes are cute. But I would not want to have to make my friends and networks in that way."
College Freshman,2,They say they are here to help people attend USC. However there are only a few who actually receive financial aid and generally athletes are excluded from this group.
College Junior,2,It is what should be expected in the LA area
College Junior,2,"I easily received my government financial aid and it was applied to my account. However, a scholarship that I received 5 years ago took almost 3 months to apply towards my tuition and then it was too late and I had to pay the remaining balance out of pocket before the scholarship was applied. It was awful. It was almost impossible to get someone to call me or talk to me about the situation. I am extremely frustrated by the situation"
College Junior,2,Campus housing was pretty miserable and also difficult to obtain on campus.
College Junior,2,The off campus dining options were pretty atrocious.
College Junior,2,"Due to the location of the university in low economic surrounding area, students are often held at gun point or knife with the robber stealing there iPhones, money and any other valuables.   There have been two incidents where foreign exchange students were killed while sitting in there car outside of the campus.

Safety is the worst for foreign students."
College Junior,2,It's pretty dangerous around the campus especially after 9pm
College Junior,2,Most non-Greeks are indifferent about Greeks. They are treated like other students.
College Sophomore,2,"Frats are pretty chill and if you have somewhat of a personality you are god. However, the girls system is pure looks, money, and sometimes luck. The chapters are very different on what they look for but, besides the bottom two chapters, recruitment has nothing to do with personality. Which at the end of the day is usually what other schools look for."
College Sophomore,2,For campus living is either cleanliness or social life. Social dorms are pretty trashy because no body cares to care for them and unsocial dorms are usually very clean and nice but its hard to socialize.
College Sophomore,2,"Near the school the neighborhood is pretty bad, school is mostly surrounded by hobos begging for money. The cool things to do in LA are usually about 30 mins from campus"
College Junior,2,There aren't great neighborhoods surrounding the campus....
College Senior,2,There have several shootings in the area around the campus.
College Senior,2,"Very tedious and very stressful. For people like me with complicated family structures and issues, this process has always been a nightmare. The people at the physical office do try to help however they can, but I still find them quite unsympathetic to my needs. 

Luckily, I am able to get aid, but it always only covers half of my tuition. I've knee deep in loans, and I've had very little luck in scholarships. 

The tips I would have is looking for scholarships elsewhere outside of the school if possible. Visit the office often and get as many options as you can. The only reason I took out loans to come here is because I feel the school is definitely worth attending and will aid me in finding jobs to help pay back the loans under my belt."
College Sophomore,2,"Rich, white, stuck-up, self-centered, greek/appearance focused."
College Freshman,2,The surrounding neighborhood is not the safest.
College Freshman,2,It's super expensive and i'm drowning in debt
College Junior,2,"It is Los Angeles so the transportation is poor, but they do their best."
College Sophomore,2,Not easy to find a spot. Be cautious of fees.
College Sophomore,2,"You're safe if you use common sense, and you're totally safe on campus. Public Safety is considered a little bit of a joke at USC. They help, and they have been very helpful to me and my friends before, but they tend to over react. Still, safety isn't as bad as people say. I've lived there two years and I feel safe."
Recent Alumnus,2,Very expensive. Structures always under construction. No street parking.
College Freshman,2,Its all on the row. And thats just annoying cause its all about hooking up.
College Freshman,2,Extremely strict with visitors and swiping in. Such a hassle.
College Freshman,2,"The cost to have a car at USC is very expensive, which can be very frustrating because I definitely feel that there is a need for a car on campus, seeing as public transportation in LA is definitely not convenient or easy."
College Sophomore,2,cost of attendance was several thousands more than the expected cost
College Sophomore,2,nothing out of the ordinary for schools in CA
College Freshman,2,There is unfortunately not really that much food off campus
College Junior,2,"Campus shuttles are OK, but are only available if you live in a very small and select area. Public transportation options are a joke unless you're taking the Expo line (which is actually kind of nice, if you're not riding it by yourself). Taxis are available, but you have to call them specially for an event, and they cost a fortune. People get around on or near campus by riding bikes, but good luck if you don't have a car and need to get somewhere in the city. (Though there is a shuttle bus to Disneyland, I've heard.)"
College Junior,2,"Unless you enter as a freshman, which I did not, and unless you have an advantageous birthday, which I do not, it's impossible to get housing on campus, and the social options are all on the Row anyway. The lottery system is rigged so that you can only get housing if you re-up every year, and even then it gets harder as you get older. Definitely live near Cafe 84 though, they have actual ice cream and crepes (not just soft serve jokes)."
College Junior,2,"Too many fast food options, not enough local/healthy ones"
College Senior,2,They do not give many scholarships to graduate students.
College Freshman,2,I don't know how people managed to get full rides or have basically everything covered.... it was really hard for me. And I still had to take out loans
Niche User,1,"It is not the best as I got very offended when a teacher was suspended for speaking another language.  The communication is terrible as there is overly sensitive people who reported the teacher when he spoke a foreign language that sounded like a racial slur.  The teacher had clearly explain the pretext before using the word.  However, some closed minded and overly sensitive people who had probably did not listen to class decided to report a professor because they do not feel comfortable."
Niche User,1,"This school does not understand and can not judge what is right or wrong.  They are too overly sensitive over foreign language.  Ask for apology from innocent people to satisfy the overly sensitive people who get offended by foreign language that means no harm.  If you’re Chinese, please think it over about going here since you have to reframe yourself from using your own language or else you will get suspended.  They are racist enough to suspend a person who spoke a foreign language that sounded like racial slur when he clearly explain it with pretext.  The staff and students are not capable enough to take foreign language.  They will always side with the overly sensitive people. So please think about going to this school over again, if you speak languages other than English, since you are heavily restricted to not speak your own language because it would offend some overly sensitive people who are racist and closed minded."
Niche User,1,"University suspended a kind professor for teaching a foreign language in which had a (REAL, innocent) word that had similar sounds to an English offensive word.  For real, USC?   As as a graduate of higher learning with a doctorate myself, an educational institution should have more class than this type of reaction.  This is unacceptable and unprofessional."

Sophomore,1,"I attended the university in 2 years but I became dislike of the university. Yes, the university became wealthier but our students became poor. I pay more $50,000 every year but still sat in large classroom. And some courses do not have good instructors. Some instructors had bad accent.

Also the neighborhood environment is terrible and not safe. Everything is expensive here."
Alum,1,"I will never come here ever again. Although the campus was okay, I disliked everything else. The restaurant food was okay, but I only ate there every once in a while because my friend got food poisoning there! Academics are nice, but teachers are creepy and weird. I hate everything about this school! Worst decision of my life!!!"
College Freshman,1,"This is definitely one of the more conservative universities in California, especially within Greek life, there are sooo many conservatives, which was kind of a culture shock because I am from Seattle, where I never really see that many Republicans anywhere besides my grandfather's country club... I honestly feel like if you parked on the row your car could get keyed for having a Bernie bumper sticker. However, while it's especially conservative among the Greek system,  there's an abundance of Republican GDIs. It makes me laugh when people say that USC discriminates against conservatives because they're all I meet. There is definitely a lot of racism, but it's more subtle microagressions rather than outright discrimination (*cough cough Mizzou*). The few minorities here prefer to stay in packs. As for socioeconomic diversity here, it's honestly the worst. I come from an upper middle class family and I still feel somewhat discriminated against, they don't call it University of Spoiled Children for nothing... It's completely centered around the very wealthy."
College Sophomore,1,"I hate Greek Life. It's extremely cliquey and like a cult, but what I hate is that they won't admit that they all just follow each other! I've always been my own person. Sure, I copy trends or jump on the occasional bandwagon. But, I think there are much better things to do with my time than Greek Life. I don't have anything to prove to a bunch of people who just want to dominate me and see me make a fool of myself while trying to conform to their standards."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Roamers are that they are many parties on row, but I never attend. There is huge concern over safety, making it difficult to have fun in general. Unless you are willing to spend money and time for nightlife in west LA, around campus there are not many options."
College Freshman,1,I've literally only used my freshman meal plan once since there's so few options for vegan/vegetarian students.
College Freshman,1,The food is terrible in the dining halls. Very cheaply prepared and they give small portions
College Freshman,1,Greek life is extremely expensive and some frats haze fairly badly. All frats are extremely exclusive and hostile towards other guys and creepy towards women.
College Freshman,1,"Huge city surrounded by streets and cars and freeways.  There's no nature anywhere near so if you care about that, this is not a good place for you."
College Junior,1,Finding a way to pay for school is the greatest stress in my life I currently have.
College Freshman,1,The USC scholarships available are pretty bad. I reapplied multiple times to little success
College Freshman,1,"The actual dinning halls are awful. Limited and usually unhealthy options, bad ingredients, and too much bell pepper!"
College Sophomore,1,public transportation in LA is a travesty.
College Junior,1,"""Local atmosphere"" is awful, if by ""local atmosphere"" you mean the neighborhood. Los Angeles as a whole is pretty great, if you have enough cash for the ridiculous amounts of money a taxi to your ""outside USC"" area costs (or a car and an obliging DD), but welcome to the University of South Central, where the school safety officers cover up or downplay the existence of shootings on or near campus, people are mugged or robbed pretty much on the daily, homeless people will hop the eight-foot-fence around your house (assuming you even have a fence) to steal from your trash, every street corner smells like piss, and it's not safe to go south of Exposition except during the day with a group of friends, to go to the Coliseum for a football game."
College Freshman,1,"If you want a relationship don't come to this school.
The nice guys are the gay ones. The majority of straight guys at SC are frat boys who are only interested in sex. There is a very prevalent rape culture here so WATCH OUT. Nobody is going to take you out on a date. They harass you at parties and if you don't give them what they want, they'll find somebody who will. 
    In turn, if you are looking for casual hook ups look no further. USC is candyland for the sexually gregarious. "
College Freshman,1,"Off campus houses are very shabby and old, and the price is very high compared to the housing condition."
College Junior,1,"No public transportation in LA, the rumors are true. (except the bus but it's awful and somewhat scary) "
College Freshman,1,"One of the worst aspects on campus. There's only three dining halls and they mostly serve the same food (although students will debate otherwise, there really isn't much difference). They close at 10, so if you missed dinner, tough luck. The food is repetitive and gets old fast. They have maybe 5 or 6 meals they just cycle through with different variations. Everything tastes kind of bland and pre-made. Occasionally they'll have something decent, but that's rare."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are very social and nice enough, but the main problem is that it's basically anything goes a lot of time. It's hard to get sleep sometimes, and it can feel a little chaotic on some nights. Other than that, it's a decent vibe. The dorms are okay -- nothing really of note. They're pretty damn expensive though, which is why I rated them a little lower."
College Sophomore,1,"A lot of the computer labs are locked almost 24/7 because they are used for specific classes. Wireless access is awesome, especially on such a large campus. I still haven't figured out how to print things on campus. I would definitely say bring your own laptop and printer. "
College Sophomore,1,"It's pretty much impossible to find a parking space, and super expensive to have one on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,It's expensive and mostly run down houses or really overpriced apartments. Share housing with friends or just stay in the dorms.
College Freshman,1,There is a parking lottery at USC for the very spots that are available so it can be very difficult to even get a spot. The permits are also very expensive with most costing at least $400 a semester.
College Senior,1,They tend to be legacy scholarships or freshmen-only. It is difficult to obtain anything as a transfer or continuing student.
College Senior,1,I am pretty sure only one library has computers and the number is far too few for the amount of students wishing to use them.
College Student,1,If a student recieves a D in any course they are subject to retake it if there future strives as a college applyer.
College Sophomore,1,"If you want to park, spend a lot of money on a permit, and then get to your spot an hour before you have to be in class."
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking situation is bleak. The parking permit is really expensive and you have to arrive more than half and hour before class to find a spot in time.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are very limited housing options for all students. I lived on campus my 1st year but after that I had to move off campus in university housing. After the second year most people have to find their own apartments in the area, which can be expensive and unsafe."
College Junior,1,"I received a very small amount of aid towards housing, but that was it. I am paying for school all by myself and I am afraid that I will not be able to graduate in a decent financial situation."
College Freshman,1,"Prevalent Racism – Though, many will disagree; racism is prevalent and needs to change to improve ties between students. It's hard to tell if it is, indeed, racism or if it's a result of differences in social class. Even interacting with professors has given a feeling that racial majority gets treated in a better way than minority students. I remember being in class once and a minority student asked a question and was chided by the professor, but then someone from the majority, racial class asked the same question; the professor responded sans the chiding."
College Freshman,1,"Minorities Marginalized – There's favoritism and it can affect your self-esteem. This is relative, though."
College Sophomore,1,"Parkside Sucks for Freshman – I lived in Parkside my freshman year, completely sucked. I probably only met my roommate and two other people in my suite and no one from my floor."
College Sophomore,1,"Subconscious Segregation Commonplace – Although for obvious cultural reasons, people of certain heritages tend to hang out amongst themselves (whites and minorities alike) it seems there is little effort being made into integrating the University's different ethnic groups. Race is hardly brought up and is a subject that seems almost taboo. USC publicly takes a lot of pride in its diversity but hardly acknowledges the reality of race divisions within the student body. 

The university is also very segregated when it comes to sexual orientation. Do in part to the hetero-normative framework that fraternities and sororities (something really big at USC) exist in, it is sometimes easy to forget that not everyone on campus is straight. When I took a gender and sociology class I realized that there are many bi, queer, gay, gender queer and transgendered students. This was when I first realized even the classes are unintentionally segregated based on sexual orientation. 

I would like for USC to acknowledge  these disparities and move towards creating a real campus of diversity. The first step of course must be to admit a problem exists."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Student Cohesiveness – As a transfer student coming from George Washington University, where I had already established my life, I found the University of Southern California (USC) to be very distant and unwelcoming. There did not seem to be any method to break into the already formed groups that were present at USC.  Personally, I enjoy when a teacher assigns a project or two that involves groups so that you meet people you wouldn't normally meet. Not only does this present the opportunity to acquire an enhanced understanding of different cultures, but it also forms friendships and alliances. I arrived at USC assuming that I would be accepted into the ""trojan family,"" but that was the opposite of my experience. There are, however, very united swarms of gender based groups that were extremely connected - sororities and fraternities.  But, again, these were exclusive groups that were not overly friendly to individuals outside of their organization. Since greek life was such an integral part of the USC experience, I believe that something should be done to ameliorate that or create events that would unite students who opt out of joining a sorority or fraternity."
College Sophomore,1,Living Off Campus. I live off campus in a near by apartment and it's not everything that I thought it would be. Living off campus you don't get to be involved with the everyday or every night campus things so it's not as fun. My housing cost is so expensive I can't afford to do anything else but pay rent. I can't even afford the last 2-3 months of rent which is very stressful. I wish that when coming up with housing cost landlords think of the struggling students rather than profit.

Junior,5,"I don't think I could get a better nursing education elsewhere. Honest to God. The amount that I have learning in 2 years is quite incredible. The online didn't bother me, I felt prepared and almost like I was in the classroom."
Junior,5,"I love my school!!! I am so glad I came here to go to school. I am currently studying nursing, which is the main reason I wanted to go here. The students here are amazing. It feels like my little home. I never want to leave."
Sophomore,5,I have learned so much in so little time. They really set you up for success. You will meet someone new every day and all around it's a great environment to be in.
Sophomore,5,The last semester of my first year was very intense but the teachers were very helpful and online classes although they can be overwhelming they were very well thought out and planned.
Senior,5,All of my professors were very good at adapting to an online format in such a quick turnover period. Online schooling itself though is an entirely different struggle than in-person classes. I am thankful for my professor's commitment to student learning and health during that stressful time.
Sophomore,5,"I’m online experience worked really well for me this semester, even though there was just a little adjusting to the change that happened so abruptly. My professors were all really great at explaining the change and expectations that they had for us. Everything was straightforward due to instructions being changed, so I felt like I was successful because of my professors adjusting as good as they did."
Sophomore,5,Teachers have been willing to communicate fully and helpful during these trying times. Some classes have been harder online but that is just due to course material being complicated. Teachers have done the best they could to make a great experience for all.
Sophomore,5,"Marquette has provided a challenging and competitive school experience. Although they push me to be my best during the school days, there are great opportunities for fun in free time. Great restaurants and activities make Marquette an amazing atmoshphere."
Junior,5,Marquette University is a school that provides incredible opportunities for all students from all different backgrounds. There are extra-circular activities that apply to all interest and allow you to always have new experiences. The academics allow students to explore all professions. The biomedical sciences department has a gross-anatomy laboratory and countless amount of pre-clinical laboratories. The professors always provide support in and outside of the classroom and really want the students to succeed. Marquette University has had an incredible impact on my life and I could not be happier with college decision.
Alum,5,"I loved my undergrad experience at Marquette! The community feel at Marquette is like no other. If I had to choose my undergraduate college again, it would be Marquette."
Sophomore,5,Marquette is a beautiful college to be in. You always find the help you need and the staff and campus are so helpful. Every profesor does what they can to help you reach your goals and succeed.
Freshman,5,"I am really enjoying Marquette. The class sizes are small which allows for a better relationship with the teachers, and the staff is always willing to help you even if your time does not align with office hours."
Alum,5,Marquette University is an amazing school that focuses on being the difference. All throughout my time at Marquette as an undergrad this motto was present. Even as an alumni being the difference is apart of my life. The MU community is strong and supportive. Wherever you go you will run into one of your alums. Can’t say enough about my love for Marquette University!!! WE ARE MARQUETTE!!
Junior,5,I love the amount of opportunities and connections that Marquette offers. As a political science major the Les Aspin Center for Government in Washington D.C. has opened many doors for my professional development and has helped me determine what I want to do once I am graduated.
Freshman,5,"Marquette is a great place to grow not only as a student but as a person. The professors are awesome and want you to do well in their classes. The people are super nice and welcoming. Student life is awesome and the basketball games are a blast. The only thing is that if you want to go to parties you’ll probably have to join a frat/sorority or else you’ll just have to go to bars, which isn’t bad either. Marquette is an amazing school and I definitely recommend."
Freshman,5,Great college. The atompshere is very good and safe. The professors care about your success and really want you to do well in their class. Marquette gives off such a good vibe and they are really a tight community.
Freshman,5,I love the way the streets of Milwaukee become your home. The churches rising from the city scape; the wind blowing off Lake Michigan. The opportunities which arise can be described as no less of a miracle. I could walk this city with my eyes closed and still find my way back home.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Marquette, majoring in nursing and I love it!  They have great resources such as free tutoring as the nursing curriculum is a challenge, but in a good way! The food is not the best, but being in the city provides plenty of great options when the dining food just isn't cutting it."
Freshman,5,Choosing to attend Marquette University was one of the best decisions I could have made as a 17-year old looking to get the best possible education in the field I wanted to go into. Besides having ridiculous amounts of resources dedicated to helping students achieve their fullest potential in their studies--you just can't beat the atmosphere of downtown Milwaukee. Marquette does an excellent job of empowering its students to become not just qualified members of the workforce but also encourages them to become dedicated members of the community. Here it is evident to see how much the institution cares about its attendees and I have nothing but positive things to say about life both inside and out of the classroom.
Niche User,5,Marquette has a close knit community setting set in a bustling town. There is easy access to transportation. People are diverse and friendly.
Freshman,5,Love the professors! Good dorms and food. Student body is passionate and driven. The campus is easy to navigate. Downtown Milwaukee is a ton of fun. The basketball games are the best.
Alum,5,"My experience at Marquette University has made such a great and positive impact on my life. Academically, I feel that I was prepared for my first job post graduation, and socially, I have learned so much about society and myself that I will cherish forever. My eyes have been opened to social justice issues in addition to how different cultures fit into the Marquette/Milwaukee community."
Freshman,5,"I love going to school here. There are so many different groups to be involved with, a diverse student body, and knowledgable professors there to help you succeed. The campus is beautiful located in the heart of Milwaukee with a multitude of fun things to do."
Freshman,5,"I really have enjoyed my first semester at Marquette. I have loved all my professors and have found that the work load for an average amount of credits is not unbearable and the professors are quite understanding. I love that the university is in the heart of Milwaukee, it is super easy to hop on a bus and go down town to explore or eat real food, although the Commons and the AMU do have edible campus food."
Niche User,5,"On my first tour at Marquette, I knew it was right for me. The community focus Marquette has is a great way for any individual to get involved in community service. Along with the overall positive nature of the campus, if you are interested in nursing as a career their nursing program is like none other! not only is Marquette a direct admit program for nursing, each class within the nursing major is nursing focused, so instead of being in a class with people focused on different majors than you, Marquette give nursing students the opportunity to work along side other nursing students in core classes like biology and chemistry."
Freshman,5,"I am still adapting to the Marquette enviornment as it is my first year,  but so far it's been awesome! The teachers and advisors help you out a lot making it easy for anyone. The campus is nice and small making it easy for you to get around and hang out with friends."
Freshman,5,"So far, Marquette has been a great experience and I have enjoyed most everything about it. The academics are great here, especially our direct admission programs. Milwaukee is super fun and parties are fun every weekend. Dorms are decent depending on where you live and the campus is very pretty. (All of my friends talk about the campus when they come here). Only thing I would definitely improve upon is the food but besides that MU is the place to study!!"
Niche User,5,"When touring Marquette University I most enjoyed the programs they offered, like any of the direct admit programs. I also liked the campus and the dorms, which both were very nice."
Niche User,5,"I loved everything about Marquette from the beautiful campus, to the newly renovated dorms and the urban setting of the school."
Freshman,5,The school spirit and welcoming community is unlike any other. Everyone is exceedingly nice and respectful. The campus is beautiful and happens to be downtown (not too far from the Third Ward or UWM). The party scene here is average at best.
Freshman,5,Marquette has very intelligent professors with amazing research opportunities. I received lots of financial aid as an independent student making attending this school generally affordable. There are many organizations one can join for almost any interest. There are an abundance of tutoring resources and quiet places to study.
Sophomore,5,"Marquette University has given me a community where I can truly be myself. I am an engineer, swimmer, and Catholic. While these things all seem so different from each other, everything about myself seems to find a home here. I am so glad I chose to attend this university."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Marquette University was very exciting.  I spent the summer at Marquette doing a summer semester with EOP (Educational Opportunity Program), I stayed in the Commons(dorm) extremely neat and clean. The two classes I took was English and Theology, very good teachers and curriculums. Also, EOP was a great aid at getting me ahead start before the fall semester.  I was taught good writing techniques that I will use in the future. The Marquette Campus was tremendously clean and nice, the flowers and grass around campus were absolutely beautiful.  However, I will like to see a change in seeing more minority students around campus. On the other hand, I am very delighted  I choose Marquette University as my first choice!"
Graduate Student,5,"I love Marquette University! I have felt as if I have been encourage to grow as a whole person, into being the best health care practitioner I can be."
Alum,5,"Attending Marquette's urban campus means having access to unlimited entertainment, shops, restaurants, and an absolutely beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline to get a break from the hustle and bustle of campus. Milwaukee offers a wide variety of professional opportunities and internships in which are easy to participate during the school year. The university itself is full of compassionate professors and staff who challenge you to think beyond just getting a job to find passion in your work and make a positive impact on the community you serve. Student life has a ""work hard, play hard"" atmosphere, and Marquette's school spirit rivals any major public school, with Marquette gear displayed proudly around campus and a lively atmosphere at all sporting events and school functions."
Sophomore,5,Marquette University has a strong academic core. The professors are amazing and caring. The new core curriculum better applies to different majors.
Niche User,5,"I know many people whom have graduated from Marquette, and I am also looking into attending myself. I've visited the campus many times, and am eager to begin my journey there. Every person whom I have met who attended the school has gone on to lead a successful career in their field of choice. I have nothing negative to say about the school. I have only heard and seen good things."
Sophomore,5,I love Marquette! Milwaukee is an awesome city and I love that Marquette encourages us to go out into the city and immerse ourselves in its culture through the service learning program. I also love our location and how close we are to downtown areas!
Freshman,5,"There are lots of things to say on behalf of Marquette University. I knew it would be the perfect fit for me the moment I laid eyes on it. I have enjoyed every moment of my time here, from the classes themselves to the time spent not working. The faculty and staff are all wonderfully kind, as are the other students. The facilities are superb, and I wouldn't change a thing."
Niche User,5,"Marquette is a great university that is located in the heart of Milwaukee. The campus and student involvement is amazing. The dorms and security is average, however the food is well picked. There is a flow to environment and the all the campuses are well connected. Parking is hard to find, but the campus is in walking distance from many things and close to bus routes. The staff and faculty are all friendly and are looking for your best interest. 
Marquette not only helped me, it made who I am today. Growing up I would always dream and wish to attend Marquette and it not only met my expectations, Marquette exceeded them!"
Graduate Student,5,I am now in graduate school and also obtained my undergraduate degree from Marquette.  My education has been excellent and the professors are excellent and very caring about the students that they teach.
Freshman,5,Marquette University is amazing. Its perfect really. The professors are great. President Lovell is amazing. The classes are amazing. The perfect balance of challenging but manageable. I love Marquette. Marquette makes college worth it. Yay for Marquette.
Freshman,5,"What I like about Marquette is how involved and open the professors are with working and helping their students. It makes it a open and welcoming environment for any student who is struggling or needs reinforcement. The classes are set up in lecture halls and are usually full depending on what class it is and at times it can be difficult to see the screen or board while in class, especially if someone has a visual impairment. On the other hand the scenery of the campus is very beautiful and all staff is very nice as well."
Freshman,5,"First semester of freshman year was an emotional struggle, with having to leave home for the first time ever,  but Marquette helped make that transition so much better. It is a gorgeous campus in the middle of Milwaukee, so there is always something to do -- all MU students receive a Milwaukee Bus Pass, so there are always places to readily explore! There are also so many different, unique clubs that anyone who attends here will find their group. Marquette is an older university (because it has been around for a while), but its still improving itself, with a brand new dorm hall, The Commons, a new physical therapy building, and renovations always being looked in to for the other buildings (there's even rumor that they are building a new rec center in the middle of campus). Marquette is also home to amazing D1 athletic teams! The men's basketball games are always a great time, as well as all the others. Overall this is a great university, even though it is a bit on the pricier side."
Alum,5,"Marquette University provides higher education while allowing the student to immerse in the Jesuit lifestyle of self reflection, compassion, and duty. The college is located in the heart of Milwaukee, and so there are many oppertunities to enjoy the night life when you aren't studying. There are ample apartment as well as amenities at walking distance. Most importantly, the professors are top notch, and the education you recieve is worth the price you pay."
Freshman,5,"I Loved Everything about it and I'm all set to go there next fall. The facilities are second to none and everyone there makes you feel as if you are a part of a second family. The professors I've met with are wonderful, and there is so many opportunities for growth. The city of Milwaukee is beautiful and there's so much to do, the city is the ""college town"""
Freshman,5,"Even though we have to work extra to go to Marquette, the school is totally worth it. Just wish the area did not have so much crime and that dorm food was more like home food!"
Sophomore,5,"Marquette University has been an amazing experience so far. I am only a sophomore, but the people and the environment that make up Marquette make it feel like home. I find that the small size of campus and the somewhat smaller student population make me so much more comfortable and excited about where I go to school. The classes are challenging, however you feel as though you are truly learning and gaining a lifelong education that will allow for you to be a well rounded student."
Senior,5,"Marquette is a great place to study. It's a little too expensive but the education is great! The campus is large and it is easy to find a quiet space to study. A lot of resources are given. The campus police, instructors, and uppers are mostly sweethearts and hard workers. I haven't had a horrific experience outside of financial crisis' as of yet."
Graduate Student,5,"The community here, along with academic excellence, amazing professors, city living, and friendliness of this campus has made my college experience amazing. The many student organizations that give their time to charitable organizations is amazing. So many students making a true difference."
Freshman,5,i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.i loved the school overall. it was amazing to be there overall.
Senior,5,"Marquette is filled with students who want to succeed and work hard. Being immersed in this environment urges all to work their hardest to achieve their goals. Although everyone has unique goals, Marquette equips their students with the tools necessary for success. For example, professors are always available to answer questions about class. Additionally, students are also very willing to help one another in order to excel in the classroom. The team environment you feel at Marquette is felt beyond the sporting events and reaches the classroom. When looking back on my time at Marquette, I will always have fond memories of participating in insightful labs, attending basketball games, and joining organizations to find my second family here on campus. I could not be more proud to be graduating from Marquette this spring. Ring out Ahoya!"
Junior,5,I love Marquette! Milwaukee is such a fun city to go through college in and there’s always something to do!
Junior,5,Marquette is g with a beautiful campus and amazing people and professors! Teachers are always looking out for their students and the smaller class sizes allows teachers to get to know you better which is great. Being in downtown Milwaukee allows for so many opportunities and everything on campus and downtown is all within walking distance! It is a great place with many things to do with friends and family as well! People at Marquette are always willing
Freshman,5,"I love the campus life. I am always impressed with the activities available for students uninterested in drinking every weekend. I hope for a more diverse campus in the future, I think that could improve."
Sophomore,5,"Very inclusive environment! When I transferred here, I knew it was the right choice for me. The community is very welcoming and the opportunities to get involved are endless and really help you to give back to the community."
Senior,5,"Overall my experience was excellent, due greatly to the fact that I broke out of the ""Marquette Bubble"" that many students get trapped in.  Being located in downtown Milwaukee, Marquette provides valuable connections to a vibrant network."
Sophomore,5,"Attending Marquette University is the best decision that I've ever made. Classes are challenging yet fulfilling. Professors really care about student success and are kind people. Many older buildings are being renovated and soon the academic buildings and dorms will be state of the art, but as of now, some facilities are dated while others are splendid. The school struggles with diversity but is actively trying to improve. Campus safety has an amazing program and I have never once felt endangered. My service at Marquette gives me meaning, and the university has a plethora of options to connect and serve with the community. Basketball games are fun, the party scene is small but alive, and Marquette has a pretty good return on investment. Internships and career opportunities are bountiful and the university really helps students out finding a job."
Niche User,5,"My college visit was an amazing experience! Everyone was very helpful and caring. All of my questions were answered and I am in love with the school. The location is perfect with having a urban lifestyle with suburban people. The campus is located only 1 mile away from Lake Michigan for summer fun and there are also numerous activities that can be done during the summer months, such as going to their D1 basketball team. Everyone has great school spirit and safety is tremendous since they have an almost 24 hour limo service that will ensure that you make it back to your dorm after a cheer-filled game or long night of studying in their wonderful library.    I recommend everyone looking into this college when they are applying."
Sophomore,5,"I think coming to marquette was one of the best decisions I could have made. The school has so many good opportunities to grow as a person all while studying to get your degree. The students are very active in a lot of different organizations and people really care about what they are doing. I am Catholic and when I was looking at schools, it was important that I found a good Catholic school. I know many colleges are known for toeing the line on many teachings of the Church, but I think Marquette does a good job of spreading the mission of the church and providing many opportunities for students to join in this mission."
Freshman,4,Overall I really like my experience at Marquette. The curriculum is great and the campus is very nice.
Freshman,4,Three of my classes are either fully or partly online. My professors have been very accommodating and have been very helpful in navigating the online format.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at Marquette and I love it! The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do. My professors have been very accommodating and are great educators.
Alum,4,"Marquette university IS a pretty acidemic school and you do receive a great education.  Campus is cool because there are tons of houses around campus each with their own name that have parties and are super fun to live in with friends once you move ""off campus""! Milwaukee is an awesome city I was honestly surprised/ impressed coming from LA . We have the most bars per square ft of any city in America that you WILL frequent as an upperclassman. The city has tons of festivals and Summerfest that happen on closed-off streets. It's a big beer city so you WILL end up going on every brewery tour and its awesome.  A lot of seniors do peddle taverns and bike ones where you basically take a bar on wheels or in the water that your group of like 7 peddles with their feet while they serve you drinks .  I was in greek life and had a great time, its not anything like the south but its still a good time and I would recommend it. You do not need to be greek at Marquette most people actually aren't"
Alum,4,It was over Microsoft zoom and I only did it during my last semester senior year. You can see everyones face if you want but most people turn off mic/video. Proffesors still go as long as class would but such is life. I only really did it a couple of months. I was a comm / digital media majoir so all my proffesors were agressivly tecnologically fluent. They didnt really have any touble with navigating the programs and online at all.
Freshman,4,"They have already helped us with enrolling in classes as we did a online gathering called SPARK at Home, this  was important to us as Covid shut down the campus for the summer."
Senior,4,"Marquette has arguably the best program for my chosen major and career path (exercise physiology and physical therapy). I could not ask for better professors; they have made me college education extremely enjoyable thus far. In addition, Marquette has provided me the opportunity to make wonderful friendships, step out of my comfort zone and better myself."
Sophomore,4,The whole staff and campus is welcoming and beautiful however as a student who is not upper class at times I feel very out of place.
Sophomore,4,After COVID hit I finished all of my 5 classes though online distance learning. For me it was not the most enjoyable experience. The professors and TA's were a great help with the transition but even so it was a major struggle. Trying to do physics labs at home or ask questions for biology when the professor can not see what I am confused about made everything so much harder.
Sophomore,4,The professors were very clear with their expectations and were flexible with individual circumstances. They were fairly quick at transitioning to a completely online learning format in order to make sure the students knew what was going on.
Sophomore,4,"The Marquette family is awesome, you know that you're always welcome on campus. There's a lot of clubs that would be happy to have you join, and so far all of my professors have been great at connecting with students, even in the larger classes like Chem or Bio. The professors and administration were good at keeping students updated about assignments and expectations."
Senior,4,"The switch to online for me personally was successful. All of my teachers were extremely accommodating and aware that everyone had very differing circumstances. I think if online classes were to continue, Marquette will continually perfect its platform in order to provide a smoother and efficient experience for incoming students."
Sophomore,4,Learning online was hard for everyone but it was hard keeping up with postings on our class site along with keeping up with the influx of emails.
Sophomore,4,"So far, Marquette has been very good to me. I’ve enjoyed the classes and majors offered to me, however, I would want to see a change in the diversity and inclusivity in clubs and just overall the campus life."
Freshman,4,I love the city of Milwaukee and the access to the city through the Milwaukee Transit system. There are so many opportunities to have fun in the city with great music and food. There are also lots of opportunities for opportunities and volunteer activities which is something truly meaningful. There is so much to do and the academics have a healthy amount of rigor and the professors are interesting and caring. Go Eagles!
Freshman,4,I took online classes in the event of the pandemic. Some professors made the class exams ten times easier but the majority of the professors assigned less busy work for their students but had the same level of difficulty for exams. All of the professors were extremely understanding of the diverse home life their students had and still made it possible to effectively learn the material. Overall I didn’t see too much change in the material I was learning but there was a lot more personal work that had to be put in.
Freshman,4,Marquette is a great college. It is in a beautiful location and has both a city and suburb feel. The professors are extremely knowledgeable and always willing to work with students. There are also tons of clubs to join and things to get involved with. There are lots of great dining halls as well as recreational buildings. I have really enjoyed my time there.
Freshman,4,Marquette is a great school. I had a really positive experience. Professors are amazing. Weather kinda sucks though.
Senior,4,"Marquette is a typical bustling campus; full of excitement, exuberance, exhaustion, sleepless nights studying for exams or writing the last-minute paper, and the occasional party. It offers a top-notch education, which unfortunately comes with an ever-increasing tuition rate."
Alum,4,I had a great experience at Marquette. Courses and professors could have been better designed to be more personal.
Graduate Student,4,A Jesuit school with high standards in studies.  Good after school social life in a big city Milwaukee.
Junior,4,"While the diversity at Marquette is practically non existent, most professors genuinely care about providing a high quality education that will benefits their students. They are there to help and provide content that is relevant and challenging to students."
Freshman,4,"I like that it is in the city of Milwaukee and I have a lot of academic resources. My professors are very supportive and are always ready to answer any question that I have. I don't like how strict the visitation rules are because sometimes it would be nice to have more than three of my friends in my room at once. It can be difficult to hang out with all of my friends when the visitation rules prevent us from doing so. Overall, I enjoy the school and all it provides to me."
Senior,4,Marquette provides amazing opportunities for students and has a great student life. Professors want you to succeed and work with you to do so.
Niche User,4,"Great school! It's a smaller university, which means classes are smaller, which helps students develop better relationships with their professors and classmates."
Freshman,4,"As of right now, I like how inclusive in some areas the school is. The many adjustments the school has made to make it a more welcoming environment for many students. 
What I would like to see changed is the parking situation, as I am a commuter student and the food options around and in campus as it is difficult for someone who doesn't live on campus."
Alum,4,"Although my experience at Marquette wasn't perfect (largely because of my own doing) the school does a great job of supporting all of its students and setting them up for success while attending Marquette and beyond. The faculty and staff genuinely care about students, and that goes not only for professors but also for the janitors, cafeteria staff and maintenance workers at Marquette. The school offers valuable and relevant majors, although the cost of attendance is very high."
Freshman,4,Due to the school's smaller campus you get more of a home type feel. It's easy to meet new people and try new things. It's also close to the city so there's a lot of things to do on the weekends.
Niche User,4,"My experience at Marquette has been gratifying. Altogether, I would claim that it has allowed me to grow as a person and broaden my perspective. The campus vibe is very calm and welcoming, and you can always run into someone you know if you're feeling lost."
Senior,4,"It's a good school, overall. Personally, I've had a lot of great professors and I've  loved the education I've recieved so far!"
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior at Marquette University and I have loved my experience so far.  I gave the college 4 stars because I believe nothing is perfect and improvement can always be made. Academics at Marquette are rigorous and the school recently changed their requirement to take two theology and philosophy courses, since we are a Jesuit University. The requirement is now one of each, making it much easier for people to be engaged in Marquette's Jesuit culture yet focus their energy towards their degree. If I could change one thing about Marquette's academics, I would want them to focus on tenuring better professors. Professors can make or break a class and although Marquette has some outstanding ones, they are not tenured and the professors that are, have below-average ratings. I think this could really help the university and improve engagement and test scores overall."
Alum,4,"Marquette has a Beautiful campus, encouraging professors, helpful student resources and services, and a welcoming community"
Junior,4,Marquette offers great courses with engaging professors! Professors are committed to helping students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Marquette University has so many amazing programs to prepare their students for life outside of campus. The hard part about Marquette, is the tough course loads and the teachers giving to hard of exams causing a lot of kids to not actually learn what they need to.  The class sizes are pretty decent where you don't feel lost or out of place. I personal think the professors need to teach more in class and make the tests applicable for students to succeed."
Sophomore,4,This campus is home. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. It is like we are in our own little community. So much school spirit everywhere you look.
Freshman,4,"I am extremely pleased with the overall student environment, extracurriculars and sports programs. I enjoy the diversity, campus environment and overall city of Milwaukee/surrounding communities."
Sophomore,4,"Marquette offers numerous opportunities in networking for your future career and to meet people. Even as a freshman, there were countless opportunities to join a club or participate in an activity (for a cause and for fun) throughout the school year. The campus is very communal. The faculty members and instructors I have encountered thus far have been open to helping students and answer any questions we had. The university as a whole is very accommodating to people from all sorts of backgrounds."
Freshman,4,"Ok so here is the real tea. Marquette is so much fun and I have made so many friends and it is a great school environment, but there are so many reviews like that. All that is true.  However, Marquette can be kind of dry, especially when you're a freshman. This is not a state school!!! Remember that, especially when it is dead winter and there is literally nothing to do. Another thing is that Marquette is a tough school. Like I came from barely trying in high school, and Marquette has been hard. They have tons of resources though, if you know where to find them. The people here are all so nice, and most of them come from the Chicago suburbs (also a lot of Boston College wannabes). Also, live in The Commons or O'Donnell as a freshman, the rest of the dorms are not social."
Freshman,4,I love the environment and the whole feel of just being on a college campus. Always lots of young energy. But the food is really one big downside of Marquette.
Freshman,4,"As a first-generation college student, it was difficult to adjust to the campus but after a few months, I felt very welcomed by students and professors. I would like to see more diversity but as more minority groups attend the college I am sure this will change."
Freshman,4,"The campus is really nice, and the teachers are good.  Only thing keeping it from a full 5 stars is the finances - it is an expensive school, but it is worth it!"
Sophomore,4,"As a minority at Marquette University I would highly recommend applying to the living learning community specifically for the Spanish floor. I've never felt more at home away from my actual home. The professors are usually very helpful and nice. The campus is beautiful however the diversity lacks. Regardless, I've met people who I will have in my live for many years to come."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see more concern for their students well being. I would also like to see better dorm buildings to be built and update the current ones. However, they do offer decent food and lots of activities for students to participate in which is very nice. The counseling center is also very professional and helpful for students."
Freshman,4,"Marquette University is beautiful inside and out. The vibe of the entire community is exceptionally welcoming. There are tons of organizations so students can genuinely find their place on campus. The different colleges for each major are extraordinary in their respective programs. The men's and women's basketball programs have really picked up, making Marquette University the only D1 school to have men's and women's basketball ranked in the top 10. This is an awesome advantage to student's social life on campus."
Freshman,4,"Since this is my first year at Marquette I can't really say much, at least not in great detail. What I like about Marquette are the programs within the University. For example, the EOP Program. This program really helped with the transition into college, especially with the summer program. However a downside to this school is the diversity. Walking into classes I could say there would be two minorities including myself."
Sophomore,4,"At Marquette, you will be expected to go outside your comfort zone which will help you expand your horizons and help you experiences things you might never before. The campus, along with the academics are amazing!"
Alum,4,"Marquette is located in a large city, but its campus is very much enclosed. While the location provides good opportunity for night life in the nearby heart of downtown and also provides volunteer opportunities that match with its Jesuit ideals, it is part of a ""Marquette Bubble"" that somewhat skews Milwaukee's deeply segregated neighborhoods. The school itself provides a wonderful, safe experience, with Jesuit ideals of Cura Personalis , or care of the whole person, included in the curriculum. It has great culture surrounding its boys basketball team. The community is irreplaceable, and alumni take pride in their Marquette heritage."
Freshman,4,Marquette's campus is very beautiful and so is the location of the campus. The classes are hard but that is only because the education is so good.
Alum,4,"I felt I would have had a similar experience at other universities. That being said, I have made some incredible friends and continue to have relationships with multiple professors. 

The price for this institution is too high and its not worthwhile unless you are given large scholarships."
Junior,4,I really enjoy the small class sizes and getting to know my professors. Milwaukee is a smaller city so it feels less overwhelming and Marquette is also the perfect size for an urban setting. My courses have all helped me to grow and learn and make me feel prepared and excited for future studies.
Freshman,4,The atmosphere of the city allows students to flourish. Everyone there is friendly and the professors truly show that they want the students to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Marquette is an urban university which is located in Milwaukee and is a short walk to downtown. I like the urban feel because it is a close representation to my home city. They have active streets and a busy city. There are many things to due in or around the city with the bus pass Marquette offers to every student. I don't like how there is a lack of nature around Marquette. There aren't many trees and this gives a bland kind of feel some days.  They have great academics though with professors who will get to know you personally and will make you feel welcomed. Their advisers feel like friends and remain active with your questions.  I feel very welcoming to the school however there  are some bad neighborhoods located by Marquette which should be steered clear of, however besides that Marquette has there police station in the middle of campus with the blue call lights located throughout campus which allows any student to feel safe."
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman, I feel that the school overall is very welcoming and gives students the opportunity to exceed I to their best potential. It creates an environment where students aren't afraid to speak up and spread their beliefs. The staff makes sure students feel safe and comfortable."
Senior,4,"Being a undergraduate at Marquette is everything one could expect, meeting new people, having memorable nights and rushing to class at 8 AM. It's an experience of your life so be sure to network because the Golden Eagle connection runs deep!"
Freshman,4,"OKAY. so as someone whose from LA, and being a minority that was raised in a predominately  white private school. Not only was wisco a culture shock but it really made me feel more latinx then I realized. It was harder to ""adjust"" yet with joining clubs, sports (HIGHLY REC) it was easier and it made me feel at home. Marquette has alot to offer and even though they are in the conservative side, they can be very open minded to all the students they accept. I believe that this schoul needs alot more students from east and west coast."
Sophomore,4,"It was pretty rough freshman year. I created many expectations coming into college, but I realized many of my expectations were superficial. I realized that what matters is your relationships and your academics. While Marquette is ""diverse"", many people tend to hang out with their own ethnicities due to the fact that it's easier and more comfortable. Parties aren't as fun if you don't know anyone, but until I found other thing to do, partying was the main option. The food is good because there are different types of food. Academically, the program is tough, but with hard work, it pays off."
Alum,4,"I loved Marquette for its academics. I was a History major with an English Lit minor and I absolutely loved my professors. They were all so knowledgeable and eager to teach and help their students. As far as student life, I made some lifelong friends after joining the women's rugby club. I sometimes felt like I didn't totally fit in on campus, as I'm sure many students feel, but by joining the rugby club, I felt like I found my second home with."
Senior,4,"I found Marquette to be an experience unique from what I was used to growing up. The academic rigor was intense, but I knew that I was being provided my money's worth in education. Despite it being a Jesuit Catholic school, there are a variety of different people that attend the school from different cultural backgrounds that are able to find a home here."
Sophomore,4,"So far, Marquette University has given me the opportunity to meet different types of people and to be submerged in an environment where I can serve the community and see my impact."
Sophomore,4,"Marquette University is a great school. This is a university where there are many professors and academic staff members who would help you succeed at Marquette. There are many opportunities offered at Marquette for school organizations you can join. Also, there are interesting classes you can sign up for and offer many majors."
Sophomore,2,"Not diverse AT ALL,very conservative and only recommend going if your catholic, raises the tuition 2,000 every year while not raising financial aid package...not worth the money for a private school only if you are in a specific admit program like nursing or dentistry etc. They force you to live in dorms freshman and sophomore year and only want your money...your honestly better off going to school ata  cheaper college who actually cares..."
College Sophomore,2,"Maybe a degree from this school might be recognized somewhere like Wisconsin or Illinois, but no one outside of those two states who I've met has heard of Marquette."
College Sophomore,2,"I've never seen a larger group of hypocritical, pretentious, self-obsessed, stuck-up, racists in my life. During the first few weeks it seems nice, but people very quickly form cliques and the only way to meet people is at house parties or by joining a fraternity or sorority. There are a lot of bad professors who may know a lot about their subjects, but don't know how to explain it to people. If you thrive off of your individuality, Marquette isn't the place for you. Being your own person gets you judged by your peers."
College Freshman,2,"I live in McCormick so my experience is different than those who live in other housing. It's small, loud, and not the cleanest, but it's livable and you get to meet some awesome people. For the price being paid, it isn't worth it."
College Sophomore,2,Safetys not great on campus. It's hard to walk around at night and feel safe. Marquette created a police department but safety really hasn't gotten much better.
College Freshman,2,"I rarely have ever seen any Greek life do anything around campus. Then are very quiet, and have no parties."
College Freshman,2,"Even though we have our own police department, we get safety alerts about scary things happening to students all of the time. I'm terrified to walk alone to my own dorm when it's dark out."
College Freshman,2,The meal plan is way too expensive and the food we get for it isn't very good.
College Sophomore,2,"The university has undergone a few administrative changes.  Such as new deans for some of the colleges.  Also, we have a new university president, who has finished his first year at Marquette.  There have been a few incidences with the administration that I have had, and have not gone well.  They are very strict and tend to not help students, such as violating code, which is met with harsh criticism even if done on accident."
College Junior,2,"It isn't really my scene, and I believe it is a negative impact on student life here on campus.  Drinking is rampant and some people just go too far."
College Freshman,2,"Although it seems that there are a lot of scholarship opportunities, there aren't many for international students, especially for Biomedical Engineering Major. I thought Biomedical Engineering would be very useful for the society nowadays and in the future."
College Freshman,2,"Safest to live on campus, but have to lock in a lease early in the fall.  The campus borders bad neighborhoods, with muggings and now armed robberies in the past year.  It's scary to think about living near those neighborhoods.  Campus security tells us to give up everything if we are held up at gunpoint since we are easy targets, with new computers, iphones, and we usually have cash, too. They have limos to take us to and from those neighborhoods but even the limo drivers don't like it."
College Freshman,2,Some dorms have people who watch closely; others not so much.  McCormick is lenient so kids drink in dorms.  No partying at Cobeen or Straz.  The atmospheres are completely different at those dorms.
College Freshman,2,"Dorm choice can make or break your social life.  McCormick is friendly; doors are open and people say hi in the halls but rooms are small.  They include people when hanging out.  Cobeen is the opposite.  All girls dorm, very cliquey, no open doors, no one is friendly and no one goes to any of the activities at the dorm but rooms are a little bigger.  At Cobeen, it's best to find a clique early in the year and stay in it or else it is social suicide.  Straz is in the middle.  Honors kids clique together, but are still pretty friendly. Rooms at Straz are a nice, comfortable size.  McCormick is safest since it's in the middle of campus.  Straz is okay, borders downtown.  Cobeen is on edge of campus and you have to walk past the homeless people, who yell at you, on your way to/from classes."
College Freshman,2,"The one thing that I hear about constantly and am sure deters potential students is how difficult it is to get into the dorms and have visitors. It is so incredibly strict that you can't even get into a dorm on campus unless you live there or someone has to come check you in, then you have to be out by a certain time. The overnight policy is even more strict ."
College Freshman,2,"I had pretty low expectations of the food coming into college and I am pretty disappointed in how accurate my expectations were. The food here is terrible. It is either completely unhealthy or just gross in general. The limited amounts of healthy food either sit out in the open all day or do not exist at all. It is hard to get fruit outside of apples and bananas, most of which are bruised and old anyways. The selections are small and the hours that the food locations are open are not good as well. The unlimited swipes is a perk, but there is really no use for them."
College Senior,2,"Living off-campus near Marquette is ridiculously expensive. It's conveniently located, but we also live in a food desert so there are no grocery stores close. Also not a very safe neighborhood. DPS does their best but there are a lot of robberies. And parking sucks."
College Senior,2,"The administration is crazy strict when it comes to alcohol, drugs, and visitation in dorms."
College Freshman,2,"I would not choose to go to Marquette if I could do it over again.

Cons:

The majority of people are cookie-cutter, upper middle class, daddy's money snobs.

Nursing and engineering are really the only programs that receive attention.

The food isn't all that great.

Housing visitation is strict and absurd.

Though close to downtown, Marquette's location is surprisingly inconvenient for necessities like grocery shopping.

Pros:

Campus offers a lot of safe programs like the LIMO service and safe walkers

Hot cookie night

Academics are still somewhat challenging, and professors are generally amazing

Bus pass

Unlimited meal swipes"
College Freshman,2,"If you're careful about substance use, you can get away with it in your dorm. If you get caught, you're in trouble though.

VISITATION SUCKS. No guests of the opposite sex past 1am, same-sex guests have to fill out a form by 10pm to stay overnight, guests under 18 staying overnight have to fill out the form 3 days ahead of time, and they are SUPER strict about enforcing these.

Attendance is taken at least once a week in classes. Policy varies by professor.

Parking enforcers will be your worst enemy if you decide to park on the street.

You get locked out of classes if you don't complete the honor code test online."
College Freshman,2,Ghetto Milwaukee Guy was shot right across the street from my dorm Muggings all the time
College Freshman,2,"Like they say Marquette is a Drinking School with a Catholic Problem, empahsis on Drinking not party school. During the first couple weeks there is stuff going on all over but then it gets very quitet and cold limiting strictly to Apartment Parties and Bars until late spring so while the party scene might be Small The Drinking standards are high in the brew city"
College Junior,2,"Marquette claims to be diverse, but it is not. Most kids are white, middle class kids from the suburbs of Chicago. Some minorities on campus would state that Marquette students are ignorant to the challenges minorities face. Overall this campus is mostly conservative."
College Junior,2,"DPS needs to spend less time busting parties and more time preventing robberies on campus. DPS is not really respected by students at Marquette. I don't agree with the drinking policy in the dorms. If underage people want to drink, they will find a way to drink. Honestly, I would think that student safety officers would rather have students drink in the safety of their own dorm, rather than out on the streets late at night, especially considering the area that Marquette is in. Visiting policies for dorms are awful. I find it a little ridiculous that college students (who are legally adults) cannot have members of the opposite sex sleep overnight. Also, guests need to be out by 2am unless same sex guests fill out an overnight form by 10pm. I understand that their check in policy is strict to keep students safe, and the desks are always staffed to prevent homeless people from entering the dorm, but I don't understand how kicking students out at a certain hour has anything to do with keeping town people out. Once you are out of the dorms, everything is much better and you have a lot more freedom to do whatever you want."
College Freshman,2,"Campus is generally a safe place during the day, but at night it is very dangerous to be out on the streets, especially on the outer fringes of campus. There are somewhat frequent reports of robberies. The campus itself is fine, but is located in a rougher area of town and it is unsafe to venture out at night."
College Junior,2,I struggle with the reality of my debt after graduation daily.
College Freshman,2,"they are annoying with visitation hours and policies, also I live in Straz, so people are very uptight about music and noise and expect absolute quiet after 10pm, however, the opposite can be said about other dorms, such as McCormick. Since students don't go to bars and outside the university for parties, it gets complicated, if DPS is there, they don't do anything about it, but if MPD shows up, people are getting in trouble."
College Junior,2,"As a former athlete, I would have to say that the facilities are lacking. As a regular student the same applies."
College Freshman,2,"This school is still extremely expensive and I feel like they need to offer scholarships that students at the college can apply for.  I don't want to graduate in debt, but I know I will because I will need student loans if I stay for 4 years."
College Freshman,2,"I am scared to walk outside at night by myself and I don't like feeling paranoid,  but I always do because I am worried that someone could grab me and put me in their car or something."
College Freshman,2,Marquette is a drinking school more than a party school.  Parties are pretty lame because everyone pregames in the dorms before and the parties usually get busted really fast.
College Junior,2,DPS is rarely there when needed and are usually only off parked in the parking lots probably sleeping
College Senior,2,"I feel that as a Jesuit institution there is little room for acceptance. God intended man to be with woman and that is that. However, that being said, there is a LBGTQ community where students hang out freely without the concern of being judged. As with anywhere I have met people who are less tolerant of those different from them, they're less than humane remarks hurt but those people are every unfortunately."
College Senior,2,"There is a lot of campus crime, including mostly robberies and drug activity. However, there is a campus police force called DPS that is there to protect us (although they seem to value writing up students for underage drinking more than keeping the streets safe, which is ridiculous)."
College Sophomore,2,"I think off campus housing is too risky and expensive. There is no safety patrol near it, so things can happen. Plus, rent is way higher than it is if one lives on campus. This is what I plan to do."
College Junior,2,"Not super diverse, but there is usually always a place to eat late"
College Junior,2,Parking is expensive.   You dont really need a  car on campus
College Junior,2,McCormick is where the party is but your GPA will most likely suffer.  I think Mashuda is  great dorm.
College Junior,2,Becoming more strict lately.  the campus police are becoming real officers this summer.  The alcohol violations became fined last year
College Freshman,2,"The problem with parking anywhere during a stereotypical day at Marquette is you're either paying to park in the structure or on the street, or you're getting a ticket for neglecting them. Free parking is nearly impossible to find."
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing at Marquette is a total F, buildings are EXTREMELY old and boring and extremely expensive for what you get. McCormick has had a HUGE rat and mice problem btw.."
College Freshman,2,"Milwaukee is a poor city, therefore not much to do nor anything of fair quality to do."
College Freshman,2,Most students in Marquette are white rich kids whose parent's pay for their education.
College Freshman,2,"Come on, what could you expect from a city like Milwaukee?"
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a fake ID, you are stuck with house parties which generally suck plus is f***ing cold most of the time outside so If you don't hear about them you won't go walking around to find them."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus, it is very easy to get away with underage drinking and doing drugs. Especially taking pills, because many students take them to stay up all night and study for exams. In the weekends, many students don't care about hiding alcohol because they know Resident Assistants can't enter rooms without a reason and you can easily pass Desk Receptionists when you get into the dorms. However, when on the streets, minority students, especially black students, are more often stopped by DPS officers and their parties are more often shut down then whites parties."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone parties, and those that don't feel very awkward."
College Junior,2,"There is not much around. There are many options in the city, but directly within reasonable walking distance, you aren't going to find anything delicious."
College Freshman,2,Except for the bars and local breweries dont expect to have a lot of things to do around town or places to go when family visits
College Freshman,2,Robberies occur frequently but if your smart about it and don't put yourself in a dangerous situation you should be fine
College Freshman,2,Buildings are old and if a freshman you better get McCormick or else life is a lot more boring your freshman year. Lottery system is confusing and seems like same people get put into best dorms
College Freshman,2,Mostly cheap college food consisting of popular fast food items like burgers and hot dogs nothing fancy or truly unique
College Freshman,2,Needs some improvement with night security.
College Freshman,2,Not much diversity. Some students try to convert others with their own ideals instead of respecting others' ideas.
College Freshman,2,I wish advisors were trained to help students be on track for their major.
College Sophomore,2,"Marquette, like most universities, like to tell their incoming freshman that it is a diverse school when that is not the case. As an African American student, it did not take me long to know the names and faces of all the other African American students on the campus. I also know that many other minority students feel the same way, Also, although there are many students who are open minded, there are still a good amount of students on Marquette's campus that seem to be racist or discriminatory."
College Freshman,2,The campus is very strict about drinking and visitation.
College Freshman,2,You constantly have to log in to the wireless.
College Freshman,2,Wisconsin weather is awfully cold.
College Freshman,2,The parking is pretty expensive that why I don't have a car on campus. Its like 500 dollars to have your car there for the whole year.
Niche User,1,I would not recommend this second-rate school to anyone. It's a narrow-minded Conservative-hating institution of hatred....
Niche User,1,The professors and the administration target students who have different viewpoints. It's a sad fact there.
Freshman,1,"BEWARE OF THIS SCHOOL. They have super strict rules for everything, and enforce them. For residence halls, you are not allowed to have the opposite sex sleepover.. what is this church camp? You can also only check in three people at a time, and they have to leave by 1 am during the week and 2 am on the weekends. This school does not give you the full college experience. RA's are always lurking, and will come in your room if you have people in there and make you dump your alc. You cant have people sleepover for more than 2 days a week. When signing up for classes, EVERYTHING GETS WAIT LISTED AND CLOSED IN 2 SECONDS. For the amount im paying, I should be able to chose what ever class I want to enroll in, and whatever time.. but NO. Theres never parties"
Freshman,1,"I am currently a freshman at Marquette but will not be for long. I’m leaving after my first semester because I am miserable here. If you want to come here to explore Milwaukee don’t bother, everyone here is so obsessed with Marquette they are constantly on campus. Most students are loaded and i’ve barely met anyone with a personality. Also, every employee of Marquette that is not a teacher or advisor is rude, unhelpful, and condescending. There is zero communication between departments/colleges and most administrative offices expect you to do their job for them. Not impressed."
Freshman,1,this school is very bad. do not go here. the people are so snobby even they are not that special at all.
Freshman,1,"Do you like drinking, basketball and feeling like you don't matter? Marquette is the perfect school for you. Otherwise go somewhere else."
Freshman,1,"A religious echo chamber. As a political science major, this is not an ideal university to attend. The university forces its own immoral beliefs onto their students."
Alum,1,"Marquette does not care much about students who come from middle-income households, as it operates with the same mentality as for-profit colleges. If a family is not wealthy, politically connected, or employed at the institution, the only hopes of receiving financial lenience will involve a sad personal story or begging for mercy. Marquette cut a substantial portion of its disability program, and most professors refuse to honor documented disability accommodations. The school supposedly takes pride in Jesuit values, but ""political correctness"" is now valued over intellectual exploration, and students are graded on subjective opinions. There is funding for athletic facilities, although most of the academic buildings and student housing were built decades ago and not updated with simple features such as central heating or bathrooms. No help is provided for students who encounter academic or financial difficulties (excluding connected students) and you will quickly be looking elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,"99% of students are white, conservative, and close-minded."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't drink, people will shun you and treat you completely different from everyone else."
College Sophomore,1,"Right from the start, you're given a list of classes and a schedule to mold yours after. There's no leniency for electives, and advisers are rude when discussing schedules. Several of my professors don't seem to know how to explain anything regarding their field."
College Sophomore,1,"It's Milwaukee, and there's a homeless shelter a block away from campus. If you don't hear a police siren at some point throughout the day, something's wrong."
College Sophomore,1,"Pretty much everyone on campus is straight, white, and catholic. If you aren't it can be hard to make friends. Campus is definitely divided into ethnic groups."
College Freshman,1,Not involved in the Greek life
College Freshman,1,Straz is the only good and healthy option and it is closed on weekends and has terrible hours
College Freshman,1,"Upper middle class, white, self-righteous people. If you don't rely on daddy's money, don't plan on feeling accepted."
College Junior,1,"Nothing offered by campus, all locally driven"
College Senior,1,"Getting into the elementary program was not difficult but staying in it is horrible. The amount of work required is so stressful that many end up getting sick from the stress or dropping the major. At Marquette you are required to double major which takes a lot out of a person. It is a full course load every semester unless you can test out of the gen eds or take summer classes though only a few actually transfer over to MU. A majority of my class will not be graduating on time however they were not aware of this until the end of their junior year, it kinda puts a damper on things. Most of my elementary major friends, myself included, wish we had never chosen the major. We believe that secondary would have been better or choosing elementary at a different university."
College Freshman,1,Milwaukee weather is the worst.
College Freshman,1,Social lives here are very tame compared to other schools but thats to be expected since this school is a Jesuit institution. Even then some rules are extremely unfair especially those directed towards freshman and sophomore students who live in residence halls.
College Freshman,1,Everyone had access to it.
College Freshman,1,"I had a horrible experience and will most definitely transfer. I went here because of the money they gave me and it was not worth it at all, too expensive still."
College Freshman,1,A lot of drug abuse here.
Recent Alumnus,1,Terrible. Just terrible. Schroeder hall has the only good food.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The weather is horrible and can be unpredictable at times. I've been told that there are 2 seasons in Milwaukee: Summer and Winter. I experienced pretty much only Winter there, and it was brutal and relentless with it becoming extremely cold in the last week of October (I'm talking 20-30 degrees). The Winter made me never want to stay for Summer."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police can be very strict about underage drinking and drug use. Also, the visitation policy is very unfair. Girls can only check girls in for overnight, and guys can only check guys in for overnight. Otherwise, members of the opposite sex have to be checked out by 1 a.m. on school nights and 2 a.m. on weekends. That goes for being on a male or female floor  if you are of the opposite sex and live in the same building."
College Sophomore,1,"We have a lot of parking structures on campus, and if you want to park for just one day or a few days it isn't bad. However, if you would like to keep a car on campus then it is pretty pricey for a parking pass. Also, if you would like to just park on the street, you have to pay the meter and parking spots can be difficult to find. Parking on the street on the weekends is free, but parking spots become even more difficult to find."
College Senior,1,One plan available. Gigantic hulking men pay the same as 90 pound waifs. And you MUST buy a plan for your first 2 years. Extremely expensive unless you eat like a cow! Then you get your money's worth!
College Freshman,1,Marquette is OVERLY strict. They will be on your back on every little thing. Campus police are too happy to catch people doing the slightest things. It's nerve wrecking.
College Freshman,1,"The diversity on campus is not good at all. There are a lot of student with different ethnic backgrounds, but they are not large in numbers. The majority of the students here are white."
College Student,1,Marquette has become super strict and there is pretty much no party scene whatsoever. A very higher number of students are transferring out compared to previous years. This seems to be the trend as many students don't want to stick around Marquette because of the lack of social scene.
College Student,1,I would strongly advise prospective students to apply elsewhere if an exciting college party scene is important to you. Marquette is super strict and campus is dead on the weekends. Wouldn't recommend going here if you are trying to party.
College Student,1,Marquette is very strict on underage drinkers. If you are not 21 it is very difficult to find anything to do on the weekends. Not much at all as far as party scene goes.
College Freshman,1,Milwaukee is known for being cold. The weather has the potential to be nice but the wind can make it unbearable.
College Student,1,Marquette is not the school it used to be in terms of nightlife. The administration is currently working on a plan to make the campus completely dry. If you want to have any fun at college I recommend you stay far away from this school
College Student,1,Milwaukee is a city on the decline and especially the area around Marquette's campus. The area is an eye sore and extremely unsafe. Overall a very depressing location for a college campus
College Student,1,"When around campus you feel as you are always being watched by DPS, who are always looking for underage drinkers. Unfortunately DPS is never around when someone's safety is in danger around the ""very sketchy"" parts of campus."
College Student,1,You cannot attend a party around campus without the fear of being arrested or fined by the campus police. Marquette has completely cracked down on partying and underage drinking of any kind and it is very hard for non-upperclassmen to find anything to do on the weekends. The new president has even begun shutting down campus bars and other bars around campus so even upperclassmen have very limited options on the weekends.
College Student,1,"I have very much enjoyed the people I have met at this school, but unfortunately I am cannot picture myself staying at this school any longer due to the awful administration. Marquette is super strict and there is nothing going on as far as social life is concerned. Also the new president is planning on making the school a dry campus as well as shutting down popular off campus bars. This school seems to be heading in a downward spiral as far as student happiness is concerned. Talking to any underclassmen you realize how strict and boring this school is. I wouldn't recommend going here if you would like to enjoy yourself in college. I can't wait to leave"
College Student,1,The worst. DPS looks for students to write up and send over to the police to get arrested. If your going out with a backpack on the weekend prepare to be harassed by a DPS if they see you. The school is looking to exploit any student over a drinking ticket to make some extra money for the school. You feel like your always been watched on campus and DPS cracks down hard off campus too. No having fun anywhere around Marquette.
College Student,1,"Nightlife is Awful. Milwaukee is a cool bar city, but unfortunately the campus is located in a very dangerous part of town and any fun bars are a long cab or bus ride away. Also the Marquette has begun shutting down popular student bars in and around campus. Soon there will be no bars to go to for under age drinkers and house parties are not even an option because they always get busted by DPS. If you want to have fun at all at college don't come to Marquette. This school is super strict on drinking and you can be placed on probation with as little as one write up. DON'T COME HERE, NOT WORTH IT!"
College Senior,1,"Holy s*** get a car. Limos dont run until 5 pm which means you gotta walk to class. The sidewalks get crowded in the winter so bring alot of socks. Transportation is awful which is why marquette is so isolated from milwaukee. I'm not hating I'm just saying if you come here for Milwaukee go to UWM, not here."
College Senior,1,"If it's not an outdated windows in the library its a locked mac in a lab. 

Honestly get your own equipment- I've had to. Marquette wont buy anything if it's not for their engineers.

They use internet explorer and the internet is on a closed system that cuts out every time you close your computer. Any no you cant use the wifi in your apt you have to get your own."
College Student,1,The local atmosphere is dismal and depressing. The campus is located in a very unsafe neighborhood and is quite dangerous for those who live off campus.
College Student,1,"Marquette is incredibly strict on underage drinking and partying of any kind. The RAs are always looking for potential dorm drinking or partying and are not hesitant to fine you or report you to the Milwaukee Police. New rules on campus allow the school to fine anyone who is involved in a situation with drinking even if they are not consuming alcohol. These fines can be over $150 even for a first offense! The Department of Public Safety is even worse. Not only will they bust any house party, but they will handout fines to anyone in attendance and are all too eager to hand you over to the police. Marquette's campus is located in a pretty sketchy/dangerous area so you would think the DPS would be around to help students avoid potentially harmful situations, but they are no where to be found when students are in danger of being robbed. It seems like the only thing that Marquette cares about is taking more money out of your pocket instead of your safety. It is nearly impossible to find anything fun to do on the weekends because every house party gets busted and the bars always get raided by the cops."
College Freshman,1,"I am an undecided major at this point, working to complete my core of common studies classes. I enjoy taking a variety of courses, but am still uncertain with what I will do in my future, which causes me a great deal of stress. I'm glad Marquette requires a core of common studies because it gives me a little more time to contemplate my future."
College Freshman,1,"Marquette is very strict when it comes to rules.  The campus police are everywhere and they bust parties all weekend long and write up any underage drinkers.  Drinking in the dorms is hard to get away with because RAs patrol the halls.  If your caught, there is a $50 fine for a first offense for everyone drinking and it increases if your the one who provided the alcohol or hosted the party.  Another thing the dorms are strict on is visiting hours and letting people sleep over.  The visiting hours end at 1am during the week and 2am on the weekends.  People who sleep over have to fill out a form and have to be the same sex as the person they are staying with.  Also, every time you walk in the dorms you must swipe in and visitors must give their IDs as well and visitors must stay with the person they swiped in with or you get in trouble and visitation privileges might be taken away.  Most of the rules are for safety, but a lot of them are ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,"People can only park on one side of the road (odd/even) depending on the day. Parking tickets are often issued immediately if parking regulations not followed. Luckily, the campus is small, so most people can get to class by walking, but i can only imagine how difficult it would be to park before class each day."
College Freshman,1,"The local atmosphere, in my opinion, is terrible. The school is located on the edge of the neighborhoods and these neighborhoods are not safe. The only place to go to have any fun is across town on Brady Street but that is only if you are into the bar scene and have means of getting into a bar."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life at Marquette is simply for those people who can't find friends on their own and who think the point of college is social experience as opposed to the degree.
College Junior,1,"Permit costs for parking are so expensive. As it is, we have to pay so much money. Also, parking on the streets is hard to find."
College Junior,1,"To be honest, no one really does drugs here. Of course there are people that do, but it's by no means the majority and it's not pushed on you at all. It's mostly just alcohol."
College Sophomore,1,"Severe punishments, very strict rules regarding alcohol (cant even be in the same room with other people drinking- you get into the same trouble as everyone else) and now there is a fine associated with a drug/alcohol violations"
College Senior,1,Parking passes here are very expensive and not included in the housing fees.  If you attempt to find free/meter parking you had better keep on your running shoes.  The parking checkers are very aggressive in ticket writing.  Most free spots have a 2 hour limit so you burn time and gas moving around from spot to spot.  You are also risking your safety and your car safety of you get too far away from the main camous area because the surrounding neighborhoods are not the greatest in terms of safety.
College Junior,1,there is definitely a lack of diversity at marquette however they are trying to become more diverse every year. Myself as a triple minorty definity notice the lack of diversity however it is  good school nonetheless and very accepting.
College Freshman,1,"Here at Marquette attrativiness is sad beyond belief. 1 out of 25 girls is attractive, the rest are stuck up daddy's girls who aren't the least bit attractive. It is sad to see a school that got top catholic party school, because the parties consist of a bunch of dudes huddled around a keg with 5 girls at the entire party not a single bit attractive. Beer goggles are a must but even then they do not help. 
If you are looking for attractive girls. Stay away from Marquette!"
College Junior,1,"Everyone here is the most important person in the world. It's not about academic or career progression; it's about how well you form relationships with your peers. Marquette has a very family oriented attitude among the student body, but they expect you to do your work and treat learning as secondary. Expect a blue collar job with this degree and no connections."
College Freshman,1,"The dorming at Marquette has many different kinds of living areas. The safety among the dorms is excellent with cops making sure you swipe in and only allow people in the building until 1 am. The living spaces on the campus make it difficult to study. McCormick,the freshman dorm, is extremely noisy and small where as another mixed grade dorm is the size of a small apartment with private bathrooms."
College Sophomore,1,"Marquette is largely comprised of white, Catholic students from the well-to-do Chicago suburbs. While the university is working hard to recruit and retain ethnic minority students, the results are mixed. I had the chance to live on a diversity leadership floor my freshman year, and thus, got to know a variety of students from many backgrounds. Ethnic diversity is here if you look for it; non-Catholic students usually have no problems fitting in either, though it is difficult for them to find faith-based programming on campus. As a gay student, I am dismayed by the university administration's dismal response to various GLBT issues, including the refusal to hire an 'out' lesbian dean and the support of a discriminatory student organization that kicked out a student leader due to his sexual orientation. The university claims to advocate for all students, but administration seems to sing a different tune when the rubber meets the road. Because of this, it is highly unlikely I will donate to the university post-graduation."
College Sophomore,1,Guys Are So Midwest – the guys at marquette are sooo different and dont even compare to the guys back in california this a definitely a big downfall about the school they are all black or total midwest guys who wear preppy collared shirts and dorky running shoes or workout clothes

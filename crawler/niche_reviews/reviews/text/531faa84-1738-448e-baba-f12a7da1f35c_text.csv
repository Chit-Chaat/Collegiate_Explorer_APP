Freshman,5,"I personally have not had to take any online classes so far this fall semester. If a person is quarantined, all classes are done through zoom. If they are unable to make it to the zoom during the class period, then whichever professor will record his lesson during that period of time."
Freshman,5,"Belhaven University is more than just a college that you attend, it is like a home away from home. Everyone here treats you respectfully and tries to make sure you are included in every event that they have to offer. The Christian view of academics that you receive is just amazing. This is most definitely a school that I have been recommending to seniors and juniors at the high school I graduated from. The atmosphere here is very welcoming. The teacher to student ratio is really good here. Every student is actually about to form bonds with their professors because of the class size being small enough to remember everyone. I would recommend this school to anyone who asked me on where they should attend."
Freshman,5,"The staff here are very friendly and helpful. I love that the campus is well kept, small, and in a safe location. If I could I would add more on-campus activities."
Junior,5,All of my classes are online. I had to figure out a better career path for me and my daughter! Their online program is very flexible!
Senior,5,I absolutely love Belhaven University. The faculty has been extremely pleasant. They always have the students best interest.
Freshman,5,"It was my first time here and I loved the living quarters as well as the diversity within the school . The professors was phenomenal . I also felt safe on campus . 
I just hopped that I had more knowledge about what needed to be done to continue my education at Belhaven."
Sophomore,5,"Since I am an older student I have enjoyed this college because it is fast pace. You get plenty of experience speaking in front of others by presenting what you have learned. This also makes me feel extra motivated to do well since I have to present the information I've learned and gathered to others.
The cost however is high."
Senior,5,"There are many things to say. I have had kind teachers who help you any way they can; they have many activities to get students together (though I am a commuter and did not participate in many), and the only thing is the finances. You have to pay each semester before you can start another, but they do offer loans. Of course, the loan without interest, only lets you use so much, then you have to use the loan with interest. The fact that the teachers help you so much, makes up for the financial issues. I selected N/A because I do not know much about those areas."
Junior,5,I love that Belhaven includes the Christian World view on majority of the assignments given. The professors are also very helpful.
Freshman,5,I like the deep learning that goes on in my classes and the fact that the professors truly care about their students.
Junior,5,"If you are seeking a small, warm environment full of Christian influence, Belhaven is for you. Most departments have amazing faculty who are committed to keeping students from slipping through the cracks and getting lost. There are multiple resources available on campus — plenty of student events throughout the semester. There are Campus ministry and small groups available throughout the week. As a dance major, I have found the faculty are well-informed, passionate, and at the end of the day, care about you as a person. I have personally never experienced a more healthy dance environment."
Junior,5,"Great place to prepare you for your future, and teachers who really care about you. Starting from my first visit to orientation day I knew this is where I was suppose to be at. The campus is beautiful and centered in the Belhaven historic district which really brings the campus to life."
Sophomore,5,The school has a beautiful campus and is tailored to art majors. It specializes in all 4 areas of art and is an overall great school.
Freshman,5,"Belhaven is an incredible institution that I am blessed to be a part of! The faculty is kind, encouraging, and supportive- while also influential! The atmosphere is so loving and welcoming, and it almost feels as though you're stepping into the 1950's where everyone was friendly with each other, no matter what!"
Freshman,5,Belhaven's campus is beautiful.  The people are so nice and welcoming.  I instantly felt like I belonged.
Junior,5,I have never seen a college quite like Belhaven. The academics are well-tailored to people's interests and the faculty have a genuine love and concern for students. My entire experience college experience has been filled with encouragement and motivation from my professors. I have made true friends and found a place with people who are as passionate as I am about what I am studying.
Sophomore,5,"I like the Christian mission statement that Belhaven is affiliated with. During each class, we are also taught about the love of God and how it is applied throughout our daily lives. Classes are not stressful because we are reminded that God will not leave us nor let us fail."
Niche User,5,"It's a beautiful place, filled with godly people who want to make a difference in the world through the training and educating of young individuals. I only visited, but it was a great experience in terms of the friendliness of the people, and the rigor of the education."
Junior,5,I LOVE THIS SCHOOL. IT IS BASED ON A CHRISTIAN FOUNDATION. BEST PLACE TO PURSUE YOUR EDUCATION. STAFF ARE FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL
Freshman,5,It is amazing going to school at Belhaven University. My perception has grown due to learning about the Christan view and putting it in play. Looking at things from a Christian view made it easier for me to really understand the material my professors teach.
Freshman,5,"Belhaven University is a unique, private Christian university in the heart of Jackson, Mississippi, that extends a warm welcome to any and all. My mother is an example of this courtesy. She returned to Belhaven at the age of 45 as a full-time student, pursuing her Bachelor's in English. Her experience was nothing short of fantastical and inspired my own choice to attend Belhaven in the fall of 2018. I have been inspired to branch out and explore different fields of interests, all bearing a Christian influence. Overall, Belhaven's focus on Christianity shines through each course you take, even math courses. The structured community around you evokes a sense of pride and encourages a growth in faith."
Junior,5,Belhaven is a great college program for working adults. I haven't been in school for a long time and I just finished my first semester with a 3.78 GPA. I am excited about my grades and what I am learning. I am looking forward to finishing my degree.
Sophomore,5,"This is one of the most amazing college families I have ever been a member of.
Belhaven is well know for its academic success and family atmosphere.
Welcome to the family."
Junior,5,"Great place to attend college and further your education.  The teachers and counselors will work with you if you need assistance with your schedules, financial situations."
Graduate Student,5,Belhaven faculty has gone out of their way to help me find the program that I needed to be successful in my career. The staff is probably the most helpful I have come accross in my academic career.
Senior,5,Great Dance department and arts. Smaller class sizes and help from instructors. Great campus with lots available for students to participate in and resources to study.
Alum,5,"Belhaven has a community that is unlike many others in the nation: it is genuinely welcoming, characterized by true Southern hospitality. The faculty on campus care about students, and the small campus allows for unique opportunities to invest in students and foster their growth. Plus, the campus is beautiful."
Graduate Student,5,"LOVE THIS UNIVERSITY! This is a Christian university based on Christian values. The professors are awesome, helpful and always communicative. Every course involves scripture that relates to each lesson."

Sophomore,5,Great administration very supportive and helpful. The professors are very inspiring and demonstrate true Christ-like character. I  look forward to every moment in class. Belhaven University is irreplaceable.
Junior,5,"Belhaven University is an amazing school. It has definitely helped me grow as a person spiritually and emotionally. Everyone on campus is friendly and willing to help others. I would definitely recommend applying if you want a smaller school that focuses on academics, the fine arts, loving the Lord, and above all, serving others."
Sophomore,5,"Great Teachers that make sure you understand assignments. There is a cafe in the student center, I have yet to try it. I love the fact that we pray before every class."
Freshman,5,They are kind and interested in your education. They are well organized and proficient in financial aid. The online advisors are the best. They make sure you are aware of what you need.
Senior,5,"My experience in Belhaven University has been great. I enrolled as an Online Student and I am almost done with my Bachelor's Degree in Phycology . It can be a little bit challenging when you are taking online courses but throughout the journey all the professors have been very helpful, provided useful feedback so we can do better on our writing assignments. The support that we get from the professors is outstanding, when they see a student that is struggling they reach out and help. Overall excellent experience."
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere is so genuine and I can tell that Belhaven University truly does enter their expectations around the Lord! They are not just a ""Christian college"", but they truly run their school in a way that puts God first, and I can tell that they love and encourage their students to do the same."
Senior,5,"I love the people, the professors, and the academics. Coming here was definitely life changing. It's an amazing school to go to."
Senior,5,Great school! I have been online with the school for the past two years. I enjoy how easy and accessible my courses are. I find that school is no longer a burden while attending Belhaven.
Freshman,5,"This experience has been one of the best in my life! I get to pursue my chosen career, the people here are so nice, and the Christian atmosphere is amazing. Belhaven is a place where anyone and everyone can fit in and feel welcome, and I am glad to be a part of this amazing family. Never change, Belhaven, because you are perfect already!"
Alum,5,"Overall, I absolutely loved my time at Belhaven. I got a really solid education in my major and made a huge network of professional connections and lifelong friends through my professors and classmates. I couldn't recommend it highly enough, especially for arts students."
Sophomore,5,"Belhaven University has a  school motto that describes it perfectly and that is , ""Not to be served but to serve"". The Professors are accessible and shares a wealth of knowledge with their students. My experience as a student at Belhaven has been very positive and I am excited about continuing my education there."
Alum,5,"A wonderful community. If you are a looking for a small university that excels in academics and the arts this is the school for you. Professors are kind, knowledgable and readily available for help."
Junior,5,"I enjoy Belhaven University. The atmosphere is so different from other colleges.  I can literally feel the love. They boldly express their love for Jesus and it is amazing, no wonder the campus is so bless.  I feel so connected with the administration. I can tell they really are dedicated and adore their students.  I recommend anybody to Belhaven. I feel like every student should experience what happens when you align yourself with the plans that Jesus have for you."
Sophomore,5,Belhaven University is a great school overall.Afier attending Hinds Commuity College I decided to attend Belhaven University because of the great atmosphere that I was surrounded by when I took my tour. I learn that the school has the highest academic score rating than any other private school in Mississippi. For students who are looking colleges to attend this school will be the best choice because of the food diversity culture and also the school the school is a great way to chasing dreams.
Alum,5,"Belhaven's tight-knit community among students and professors is unparalleled in my experience. Scintillating lectures, brilliant conversations, real Christian fellowship, and incisive art characterized my time at BU. The laughter, warmth, and careful attention in my studies has cast a glow over Belhaven's surroundings, making even the potholes in the neighborhood dear."
Niche User,5,"When I visited Belhaven University for the first time I was amazed by how beautiful the campus was.  Everyone is so nice and friendly.  I had no trouble finding any of the buildings, and the overall visit was amazing!"
Senior,5,"I am currently enrolled at Belhaven's online management program. I am a senior and I have been enrolled at Belhaven for three years now. After trying different online schools, I can honestly say that Belhaven has been the best one. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable and truly care for their students. Managing for a Fortune 500 company already; the curriculum for Belhaven's management program is in line with what is encountered in the real world. It effectively prepares students to excel in the challenging business world environment. I have learned a lot from this program, and it has helped me grow tremendously as a professional and a servant of Christ."
Junior,5,Belhaven is a great college for the one on one learning and personal level with your professors. Although it is not big as a Division one school it makes up in it academics. 
College Junior,5,"Professors provided prayer, comfort and academic help for me through my grandfather battle with cancer and death. They were also very understanding."
College Senior,5,Very easy to become a student at Belhaven University.
College Sophomore,5,My school offers an art environment like few others.
College Junior,5,I will be able to get my bachelor's degree soon.
College Junior,5,There a guards to patrol the campus.
College Junior,5,I do not know of this type of category or club but I will tell you of diversity at Belhaven University! Belhaven opens its doors to all in search of furthering their education.
College Junior,5,Belhaven University stands out because of the interpersonal skills and graciousness of their employees to help with all aspects of attendance.
College Junior,5,Really not a big sports fan and this University is not really known for sports or althletics.
College Freshman,5,This school is really safe. We have no concerns about anything happening to us because they make sure that we are safe.
College Freshman,5,"My experience here at Belhaven University has been the best. I love it here because the people are nice, the faculty and staff are nice, and everything is so organized and worry free."
College Freshman,5,It is a wonderful school. I love the atmosphere here.
College Junior,5,"I've been so happy with my Belhaven experience. If I could go back and choose my college again, I'd still choose Belhaven."
College Junior,5,"I have never come across a dance program that networks so well with the connections through dance networks internationally, but also from their alumni. I see active communication and job offerings that bring people into the program and also send students to opportunities outside of the dance program."
Freshman,4,"Just started, but my online experience is very good and easy to follow. I am able to connect with my teacher very easily with questions, and they respond promptly with answers."
Junior,4,Belhaven has been a overall great school. I am seeking a bachelors degree. The instructors are very informative and professional
Senior,4,"Nursing classes are not easy to do online. Since COVID, we have had to move our in class lectures to online learning."
Senior,4,Belhaven is a great school. Good variety of majors with very involved teachers that care about your success even if you are not in their field.
Sophomore,4,Great school with great people and staff. Everyone is nice and so are the teachers. The food is good and I love the ice cream. quiet neighborhood but also bad roads.
Senior,4,"Belhaven really cares about their students, receiving a good quality education. They are very considerate and understanding and they provide  teachers who care about their students academic success."
Sophomore,4,This University is perfectly small!! It centers it’s curriculum around God and the food is amazing!!
Freshman,4,"It is a wonderful place to get connected with other people. It is truly a safe haven here in the middle of Jackson, Ms. not to mention it’s just a great school overall."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Belhaven and it is a pretty good school  overall! I am a social work major and my professors are amazing no lie. They really care about me as a person and a student and want to help me succeed! They definitely are part of the reason why I became a more open--minded person, which I am so grateful for."
Freshman,4,So far I like the college. It is small classes so you are able to feel welcomed and not just another number listed on the school website. I have enjoyed connecting with a diversity of students.
Alum,4,"A close-knit community that includes not just the students, but the staff and professors as well, Belhaven was an amazing experience with top-notch classes."
Freshman,4,I feel like Belhaven is an excellent college. They help you succeed in multiple ways. The staff along with the students will make you feel beyond welcomed. I was nervous at first about coming to a school like Belhaven but once I got there I felt like I was at home. The school itself vibe makes you feel welcomed. I wouldn't rather be anywhere else but at Belhaven. I enjoy all the campus activities and all.
Freshman,4,"I like Belhaven University quite a bit. I like the small campus and size of the school. Although i am very new to Belhaven they offer a wide variety of classes and majors that excite me. Belhaven is known for fine arts, they also have good sports programs. My only concern about Belhaven is its surroundings. The city of Jackson does look kind if sketchy, but i know there are some good people around Jackson. There are also other neighboring colleges around Belhaven, such as Millsaps college and Jackson state university. Both schools are 4 year colleges but, Jackson State is a HBCU. I plan on majoring in exercise science and minor in business. Belhaven also has a wonderful kinseiology program which is what i am excited for"
Freshman,4,I loved the Godly atmosphere and the students and faculty are always available to help you. They make you feel as if they genuinely care for you. The one thing I would want to see change in is the on campus places to eat. You've Got many nights where you just starve because they close the cafe at 7 and there's nothing on campus after that to indulge in.
Junior,4,"Belhaven University provides an atmosphere that is welcoming. From the teachers to the students, everyone is friendly. The class sizes are small, and the opportunity to get one-on-one attention from teachers is high. It is strongly Christian-based, so the instructor do not shy away from incorporating the bible into the studies. Overall, my experience has been positive."
Sophomore,4,"Belhaven University has a wonderful, family-like atmosphere. The class sizes are small enough to where the teacher actually know your name and face, and you're not simply a number. The best teacher that you should take is Mrs. Tracy Ford. The only thing I would like to see different about Belhaven is the cafeteria choices!"
College Senior,4,They have a wonderful sports program and even have some to be professional athletes.
College Senior,4,"Love the school, staff and overall environment!"
College Freshman,4,"I love it, everyone is so helpful and cares about you and you succeeding!"
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is pretty good. My dorm is the nicest women's dorm. I do like livng in my dorm. The social atmosphere is pretty good.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at my university are pretty good! I love that there is a good amount of school spirit with them. I am a huge fan of sports and my university, so I try to go to as many sports/athletic events as I can."
College Freshman,4,"Belhaven Univeristy is an amazing university. I would definitely choose it again, for sure. One of my favorite experiences was Welcome Week. This week before classes started, we moved in, got settled, and then met our Peer Group and Peer Leaders. I had incredible Peer Leaders that taught me so much about Belhaven, what to look foward to and they also gave me a lot of great advice about starting college. This week we bonded with our group and I met many other freshmen and also made friendships with people that I am still very close with.

Belhaven also has many amazing professors. My first year has been packed with teachers who actually care about me and my education. They want me healthy, happy, and succeeding in my education and life. The teachers I had last semester still check up on now to see how I am doing and how my classes are going. They also always tell me that they are there for me, and that they are always there to help me with anything they can. That even though I am not their student right now, that they still care for me and want the best for me. Also, Belhaven is a true Christan university. All of the professors and staff are truely people of God. I have so many faculty that are mentors for me and who I know will always be there for me. Those are just a few things I absolutely love about my university and what makes it unique."
College Sophomore,4,The security staff care a lot about students safety.
College Sophomore,4,Faculty cares about your success after school.
College Sophomore,4,I have had mostly great interactions with teachers.
College Freshman,4,It's a lot of ways that we can get internships. The staff helps us out with a lot of different things while we're here.
College Freshman,4,It is a great place to be. Everyone gets along with each other very well.
College Senior,4,"It's definitely the school I was meant to attend, but after being here four years I am definitely ready to move on. I've loved my professors and how they truly care about my success and are readily available to help me. I unfortunately have been in the transition period of the changing of gen ed course requirements, so I was not able to have the best experience with signing up for a variety of classes."
College Senior,4,"I only ever stayed in Caldwell before moving off campus, and while it had it's cons (i.e. sharing a bathroom with 30+ other girls--yikes) students were mostly aware and respectful of their neighbors. The only problem was the amount of roaches. There were always roaches. (disclaimer-the building is pretty old so that is one of the reasons, not because it is dirty) The cleaning crew cleans the bathrooms almost every day. The RA's were always nice and were available to build relationships with those not on their own hall."
College Senior,4,"After attending four years at Belhaven, a lot of the perfect freshman-viewed facade falls away. Belhaven is nothing better or worse than other colleges, it just depends on what program you are looking for. As a liberal arts college, the arts are some of the best in the country, but other majors are not so much. Almost every professor I've had truly wanted me to succeed and was very helpful with whatever I asked or needed, and I've made so many friends here, most that I know will be for life. While I believe some basic campus rules are ridiculous, they are worth the experience here."
College Freshman,4,"The professors at this school are great. The class sizes are small, so it is easy to get involved and make friends."
College Freshman,4,The dorm was nice and people are generally friendly.
College Freshman,4,It's a small school with very nice professors that you can get to know. It's also easy to make friends.
College Senior,4,"Solid structure, professors and peers!"
College Junior,4,"I choose my school again,because they believe in religion and study ethic"
College Freshman,4,"My school is is small, private Christian college. Thus they have strict rules against violence, drugs, alcohol, and tobacco use on campus."
College Freshman,4,There are many houses in the neighborhood of my school. Price and decency of housing is great if you can find roommates to split the cost.
College Freshman,4,Many students go to my University because they offer a decent amount of money in Scholarships. Maintain a decent GPA and you can always receive money. The school also works with the students as much as possible to lower amount owed. Another great option is the Work study program which can either provide pocket cash or help towards tuition. There are money places to work on campus and they do their best to accommodate every student who needs help.
College Junior,4,"I make all of my own food, so I don't go out much, but when I do I love the places around here."
College Junior,4,"The administration is quite strict, as i expected it to be because it is a Christian college. I don't get in trouble, so I don't know how strict they really are."
College Junior,4,Its great because security takes their job seriously
College Student,4,I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Senior,4,Beautiful people inside and out attend Belhaven University.
College Senior,4,Belhaven offered the scholarships and remaining aid that I needed. It was actually less expensive to come here after my scholarship than many state schools.
College Senior,4,"The Dining Commons is good, but I wish Belhaven would add some more options for the dining plan, or at least let us use our dining plan off campus like some colleges."
College Senior,4,The Fondren area near campus is very supportive of students. Many restaurants offer a student discount. There is  a good variety of places within the immediate area. Rooster's is a popular hangout that is near campus. Of course there are many chain restaurants as well.
College Senior,4,"Jackson is a mid-size city. There is another college (Millsaps) nearby that helps the Fonder area feel like a small college town. There are several museums in the area. There are no professional sports teams, but its the South - college sports are more popular."
College Freshman,4,"I have not had an internship for my major yet, but I do plan on having one in the future to get more comfortable with my field of study. From what I have heard, the departments work very well with you in order to get a good internship and a good pay. The only concerns I have are that I am scared I will not be good enough or I may end up too hard on myself. I like to do well at everything I do."
College Freshman,4,"Everything is within miles of campus and it is really easy to get to everything. I like the position of campus because there is a lot nearby and a lot within a close range. There is a huge variety between grocery stores, dine in, take out or just fast food restaurants. There are also several fun and cozy coffee shops that are good for off campus studying and a nice cup of tea or coffee. My favorite place to get food is probably either the fast food joints or Newk's. Everything has very healthy options along with very cheap options if you know where to look."
College Junior,4,Very fast paced. I like having 5-8 weeks on one subject before going on to the next. Helps to be able to focus on one subject at a time. Time flys by fast.
College Sophomore,4,"The coaches are great, but football season hasn't started quite yet."
College Sophomore,4,We've had no incidents so far this year.
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is great, just a little pricey."
College Sophomore,4,The security officers are very nice and helpful but hold their ground.
College Sophomore,4,Safety is great but parking and cost are the downfalls.
College Junior,4,"There is an average student population. Belhaven is a Christian college that is focused entirely on God, which is why I chose this school. The instructors are so encouraging!"
College Junior,4,"This fall will be my first semester at BU, but I am extremely excited! I've been on campus several times, and it is absolutely beautiful!!! The Christian atmosphere is so wonderful and refreshing! The admission counselors are fantastic! They have done so much for me, including everything in their power to help me find financial aid for my tuition!!! They are amazing! I would absolutely recommend this college to anyone! I'm so excited to see what the next few years will bring!"
College Junior,4,I haven't been in the program long enough to fully reap the benefits unique to the Biblical Studies department.
College Junior,4,"The campus and the students are protected by the policies imposed by Belhaven. They are not overbearing or unfair, but rather are implemented and enforced for the good of the university at large."
College Junior,4,Typical students attend Belhaven. There is nothing particularly different about Belhaven students than there is at any other school.
College Freshman,2,"I wish we had Greek Life at Belhaven, but we don't. Being a part of a sorority would be so much fun! Having ""sisters"" that you can do everything with just sounds so amazing. Belhaven is a smaller school and also a Christian school, so I don't know if we will ever get Greek Life, but I would definitely suggest it!"
College Sophomore,2,Belhaven is a liberal arts college so most athletics are not super important to the students. 
College Senior,2,"For students living on-campus, the parking is amazing. Living off-campus, it's a nightmare. There are very few parking spaces, and they all fill up so quickly. After chapel, it can be nearly impossible to find a space."
College Senior,2,"Each of the five dorms are uniquely different in the convenience, atmosphere, and quality. None of them are coed. Caldwell Hall, one of the three women's dorms, is the where many of the freshmen are placed, and also seems to be a favorite among dancers, visual artists, and musicians, due to it's proximity to the Center for the Arts and the art studios. Gillespie, which holds the largest dorm rooms on campus, is where the other freshmen women go if they're not in Caldwell, and is predominantly female athletes and dancers that would prefer to be closer to the cafeteria, but still a short distance from the dance building. Helen White houses almost entirely upperclassmen women, and is the closest to the main campus building, and also the nicest quality rooms. The men's dorms, Wells and Robertson, are connected by a common lobby. Wells is the freshmen dorm, and is the smallest, and uncomfortably so. Robertson is a comfortable size for two, and is by far the better of the two men's dorms, though the quality of the room is on more par with Gillespie than Helen White."
College Senior,2,"The school is located in the middle of a residential area, and as such, is restricted in how much room they have. Therefore, parking tends to be tight. There are just enough spaces for resident students, and unless you are able to be on campus by 7:30 in the morning, most resident students, and even some faculty and staff, have to parallel park on the street, sometimes even parking along side streets near the campus, though the walk is usually less than a block."
College Freshman,2,There is basically no parking for off campus students and even those of us on campus are confined to whea ewe can park.
College Junior,2,"There is shopping, recreation, and activities in Jackson.  The crime rate is very high and I find the city dirty."
College Junior,2,"As an international student I don't get almost any option of financial aid. The school couldn't inform me about any option I have and also the government doesn't give me any information either. My costs are covered by the most part with scholarships, which are not enough to pay for my study."
College Junior,2,Drinking is not allowed on campus. There are still parties that go on off campus and there are a few clubs around town.
College Sophomore,2,Usually there are a few spots to park during the week.
College Freshman,2,"Security has time and time again tried to resolve the parking problems at the dormitories, all to little avail. Sometimes when I go to park in front of my dorm, all the spaces are taken by students parked for classes, even though they don't have parking stickers. When parking for classes, I often have to park down the street and walk to get to classes because all the spaces are taken. This has never been a problem, though, because the campus is fairly small."
College Junior,2,BYOC - Bring Your Own Car. There are not a lot of public transportation options in Jackson or the surrounding area.
College Freshman,2,"They have about 20 computers in a computer lab that's got pretty good hours and free printing, but the internet is EXTREMELY slow. If you want to listen to a song or watch a video on your laptop, the protocol is to leave it a the dorm during class, go back after a few hours of class and it'll be loaded enough to watch. But they say they're going to speed it up next month, so hopefully it will change."
Freshman,1,"I didn’t have the pleasure of online schooling

I really can’t rate online classes because I didn’t have any"
Niche User,1,Worst Theatre Department I've seen. The play looked as if it was in a middle school Cafe. Boo00o0o0oo0ooo0o0o00ooooo000oo0o000o0o0o00o0o0o!
College Junior,1,"There is no Greek life at Belhaven. As I mentioned a couple of pages back, Belhaven is not a party school, so fraternities and sororities are not a part of our life."
College Freshman,1,"Belhaven is a Christian school with no Greek Life, so parties are rare. We do have homecoming dance, spring formal, several little party things, but no big nightlife in Jackson, MS."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have never used the public transportation, but there is a bus that runs right by Belhaven. However, I believe it is rather sketchy and not very convenient. All commuter students either drive, walk, or bike to classes."
College Junior,1,"Costly Living – Off-Campus housing near Belhaven College is very convient and availability is sufficient. However, the cost is tremendously high and safety is definitely a big issue in most places. Living off campus serves as a great way of learning how to become more responsible on your own, as well as living on campus. Both off-campus housing and on-campus living are expensive; but, safety on campus is enforced much more."
College Freshman,1,"VERY Strict – Belhaven is extremely strict. The dorms do not allow members of the opposite sex to leave the common room, with the exception of once-a-month open halls, where from 7-10 you can leave your door open and have all the lights on and a boy/girl can come into your room, but the RA regulates. Smoking is not allowed on campus, not even on the outer sidewalks. Drinking is completely unacceptable. You must attend Chapel every Tuesday, for no credit. You cannot live off campus for the first year unless it is with your parents and you can NEVER live with a man you aren't married to. The internet blocks certain sites they find questionable ( even American Apparel and Perez Hilton).There is no curfew in the dorm, which is nice but if you spend a weekend away the RA will be very inquisitive as to where you've been. The TV (even if you bring your own) blocks MTV, VH1, BET, Comedy Central and E!. If you break any rules in the housing agreement you can get expelled from school or housing."

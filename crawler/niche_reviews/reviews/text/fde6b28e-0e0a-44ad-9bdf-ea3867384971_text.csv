Sophomore,5,Despite the circumstances with the COVID-19 crisis La Salle University used extensive measures to make sure all their students had a good academic online learning experience.
Senior,5,I really enjoyed my time at La Salle not only because the professors are very prepared and knowledgeable but also because there is a lot of diversity.
Sophomore,5,I took some courses online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The teachers were flexible and adjusted to the situation in a way that allowed every student to complete all assignments.
Sophomore,5,A really nice school and overall amazing experience! The small school offers great benefits such as a closer relationship with faculty and more opportunities in terms of internships or connections.
Niche User,5,"For one, the campus is so beautiful and personally, a nice campus adds onto the learning experience. Also, I really like how the faculty is always eager to help and reach out to help the student out in any given circumstance."
Alum,5,The school is great with multiple campus' for convenience.  The administration is knowledgeable and helpful.  The school is well known in the area and has a strong Alumni network..
Alum,5,"Such a small welcoming community where everyone knows your name and you feel at home. Catholic university, but open to all walks of life and faiths."
Niche User,5,"When I was in 10th grade, I decided I wanted to learn more about business. I was informed about a course La Salle that was providing a course just for that. Although I was the second youngest in the class, taking the class made me feel like I was equal to the other students. This is because my professor, Liz, treated me like I was. I learned a lot about different businesses and how they can compete with each other through the need for supply and demand in society. I remember being given an assignment to create my own business for a specific product. My product was a cream for eczema. Once my group and I had completed the business plan we were given the opportunity to present it to real bankers and business owners. It was great."
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at La Salle. I think that the campus has an amazing feeling to it that can only be described as community. Being a school on the smaller end, we are really able to get that community feeling that I have always wanted in a school. My professors know my name and work with me to improve. Having multiple jobs on campus has helped me become even more involved along with the numerous service opportunities I have been fortunate enough to find. I really think college is what you make it and I've been lucky enough to make La Salle my home."
Niche User,5,La Salle is underrated. What I love about La Salle is that they care about their students. They give out a lot of financial aid to help with the cost and they make the transition so much easier than other colleges.
Niche User,5,I visited Lasalle and had a very great experience. I took tour of the campus and the tour guide I had was very helpful. He showed me the dorms which were all very nice and clean. The food was good and the campus itself was very nice.
Niche User,5,The school offered much opportunity to students that were seeking it. Did not give up on making higher education something not to invest in.
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman here at La Salle and I love IT!! My professors are super understanding and they want to see you succeed. IT's a small school, so somehow someway you know everyone. You get a sense of belonging here at La Salle."
Niche User,5,I love Lasalle University. Going to Lasalle has always been a dream of mine and hopefully I can fulfill that dream.
Freshman,5,I loved that thr students and faulty were welcoming when I went on a tour. its a family friendly school. There main focus is success in every student that graduates from the school. The energy is always active and positive.
Junior,5,"Its a fun place to learn, have fun and to meet new people. The academics are very easy when you put your mind to it and focus in class. The teachers are always willing to help you."
Freshman,5,I have visited La salle numerous time this year I am go to officially be part of the university this upcoming Fall. I am very excited because my mother is an alum and I've heard of  so many good things. When I visited it I was introduced to the diversity and what the academics would be like. I learned that La Salle is very challenging when it comes to academics but the professors are their to help not torture you. The diversity at La Salle is extremely important to me because in high school I always felt like I didn't belong because the minority population was extremely low.
Graduate Student,5,This has been a great choice of university to pursue my MBA. The hybrid format makes it easy to work a full time job and complete my studies at the same time. The format allows for that in class interaction but also gives you time at home to be more independent and self reliant.
Niche User,5,It was a nice visit and I’m glad to be joining this fall!! I can’t wait to make the most out of my nursing program and succeed. I know I can do the best of my ability to make these 4 years count.
Junior,5,"La Salle University has an excellent English Department. Although there is a small collective of us English majors, the university has an abundance of rich professors and programs set in place to train future writers like myself. La Salle University has an excellent library and art museum, both are places that have helped me to write some of my strongest essays during my three years."
Senior,5,"Throughout my time at La Salle University, I have evolved into a well-rounded young woman that I would not have seen myself as several years ago. I am a resilient person who excels in being both resourceful and flexible. I am a leader, and someone who is very independently driven to succeed. I communicate well, and in a timely manner. Although I strive for leadership roles, I collaborate well with others. I am eager to learn from others and depend on it to further my education inside and out of the classroom. I am this person because of the experiences that I have had over the course of my time at La Salle, and the academic leaders and professionals that I have surrounded myself with."
Sophomore,5,"I love La Salle because of the size, it is not real big and their classrooms are not filled with so many people! Also La salle is good because I met my bestfriend there because she lived next door to me"
Freshman,5,I agreed to all what others say that the la salle university is such good in everything. On how they manifest students to study well and the value of goingto school.
Senior,5,"My experience at La Salle University has been the most impactful and challenging experience of my life. And this is coming from a Black African Female, it has taught me a lot about the life I plan to live ahead of me. I learn that money and race mean everything, regardless of what situation or circumstances you are in at the moment. Some people are born into it and others have to earn it."
Niche User,5,"The overall feel of the campus was very inviting and satisfying.  It felt professional, but still had a sense of being ""home."""
Graduate Student,5,"Loved it.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________"
Sophomore,5,"Very tight-knit community, with a wonderful staff and faculty. La Salle is the perfect niche in the large city of Philadelphia. The academics are excellent, the teachers are wonderful, and the small class-size creates and environment that promotes individual success. There is always an exciting and welcoming event going on, so students are never bored. The city is also a 15 minute ride away, so students can explore at their leisure."
Junior,5,I love the location of La Salle University. It is very close to the city and there are a lot of activities to do in the area. The professors are great and there are security guards to ensure safety.
Alum,5,"La Salle University is a close knit college that makes students  feel comfortable in smaller classrooms. Even though class sizes are small, the student community are very much involved in student life and offers a variety of organizations and activities for students. The campus is growing with new buildings and developments. The administration and professors are knowledgeable and supportive."
Senior,5,Through La Salle I have built connections with faculty and friends that have helped me to grow as a person. I have found the career I want to pursue and I could not be happier with my decision to attend La Salle.
Sophomore,5,"I love what a great community it is, so many wonderful people and amazing professors. It's small but quality over quantity!"
Junior,5,La Salle is a great and wonderful  that has provided me with great outlook at life and how i should be looking forward to life after college and every might come my way i know that i can make it though it and things will always get better form there on.
Alum,5,"Staff and faculty are amazing. La Salle is a small school with the feeling of a family. Its foundations are faith, community, and service and I efltthat everyday here."
Alum,5,"I am a recent graduate ('15) from the school of business (finance & marketing major).  I had a great experience at the school, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.   In  terms of La Salle's specific location, it is an easy uber ride to a college section of town, Manayunk.  Out of towners should strongly consider Philadelphia for those reasons.

The education I received was top notch by any measure.I was also a part of Greek life on campus, and highly recommend that as well.  Though some will say the parties have died down a bit in recent years, there are still plenty to be found (according to people there currently).

I wish there was a little bit more offered in terms of school sponsored activities.  I enjoyed the recreational flag football basketball leagues, but outside of that, there was not a ton that I was interested in."
Junior,5,"Surprised by the low score on this site. La Salle's a great school with superb recognition in the area. I'm in my junior year and already have a job lined up thanks to my professors, recruiters, and advisors. I interned there last summer and they asked me to come back. If you're a top student at this school, you can achieve anything. And when it comes to college, the next the is getting a job. La Salle can get you that (and a well-paying one, too). Don't worry about these other reviews; most focus on the pedantic issues."
Sophomore,5,"Great staff, faculty, and administrators. I've had a really personalized experience at La Sale and couldn't ask for more from a college."
Niche User,5,"I love Lasalle but even with the tuition cut my daughter will have to take $20k in loans annually. She really wants to attend but is finding it difficult due to the cost.
Any little bit will help!"
Senior,5,It has been a tremendous experience. It's an underrated philly school. Don't go far off campus it's unsafe. Food isn't good. Everything else is great. Business school and programs are top notch. Professors are mentors for life. I have met life long friends and had a wonderful time.
College Sophomore,5,"I am involved in the Business Scholars co-op program and will have the opportunity 2 do 2 co-op experiences. I know from many people that alumni are very interested in hiring La Salle grads. 

My goal is to graduate with a starting opportunity in my field of study."
College Sophomore,5,"Terrific honors program, very friendly campus close to many events in Philadelphia. I have been involved in Project Appalachia over spring break and intend on doing it again. Also pledged a great social/service fraternity and feel I truly experienced college life in my first year. I can't wait to go back!"
College Sophomore,5,Classes are amazing and I learn a lot from them. The teachers engage with their students and help them
College Sophomore,5,Coming from lasalle most work places will offer the job because they know how defending lasalle is and how serious they take things
College Sophomore,5,Lasalle goes out of its way to let every student know how they can avoid sexual assault and were they can get help
College Sophomore,5,La salle University offers so much.! They help you find what is the correct choice for you and help you with personal struggles as well. I have made a lot of friends and love this school!
College Sophomore,5,"we have programs that most schools don,t offer ."
College Sophomore,5,very strict on drug and alcohol use
College Sophomore,5,Very helpful in career choices.
College Sophomore,5,La salle has been a great experience for me.
College Sophomore,5,Its a great school that gives its students comfort.
College Sophomore,5,"La Salle is great with sexual, drug, and alcohol because of the different programs they have in which people can talk to professionals."
College Freshman,5,Some of the best housing in the country
College Freshman,5,"I love my school and am very happy to have chosen it in my college search process. I am involved in several clubs already being that it is my second semester on campus. These clubs include the ASL club, Chapel Choir, NSSLHA, a member on the Project Appalachia trip to Harlan Kentucky, a JACE (junior ""ACE"" or tour guide on campus), and a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. I also went on the EXPLORE 2015 retreat in the Fall orchestrated through our community service center. These opportunities have led me to meet so many new people and make great connections. My school also offers great outlets for studying such as Student Instructors or subject tutors that are very useful to ask for help when a nearby test is approaching. With great dining facilities, my university has healthy food choices and themed dinners for special occasions. Lastly, there is never a dull moment on campus because of all of its wonderful opportunities it has to offer. Several events are planned so the students never feel bored, and there is always something fun to do."
College Freshman,5,I'm so happy I chose to go to this school. I've made so many friends and memories just within the first few months and I can't wait to continues my journey.
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus was a great decision! I was able to meet new friends and now almost everywhere I go, I speak to many people who I did not know at the beginning of the year."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love La Salle, nothing else can describe how much fun its been"
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is great, it's awesome here."
College Sophomore,5,La Salle gives a lot of aid and makes it a great value.
College Sophomore,5,La Salle has a great business school. The classes are hands on and engaging.
College Sophomore,5,The professors all seem to be very genuine and nice people. Almost all of my professors had worked as a professional in tier field of study and it gave them a lot of credibility.
College Sophomore,5,We have a very diverse campus
Sophomore,4,La salle is a good school and they really care about their students. The only downside would be the expensive tuition.
Senior,4,the online classes were very good. Professors keep you intellectually motivated while also making the classes easy to follow.
Senior,4,I feel like most professors really care about their students and their personal lives. I don't think that the school handles Title IX allegations well. The school has many clubs but funnels too much money into athletics that perform poorly.
Graduate Student,4,La Salle University has a great 5- year Masters program for Speech-Langauge Pathology which was the main selling factor for why I chose to attend there.  The university is also a tight-knit community and friendly.
Sophomore,4,"La Salle was the only school that felt ""right"" for me. I love it so far. Im a sophomore and its really nice to be able to figure out who you are and what you want to do and what you're passionate about. Most of the profs really care about your success and will go out of their way to help you if you need it."
Senior,4,"I loved going to the college of Nursing and Health Sciences at LaSalle. The faculty have been amazing, and they have been working hard to make the campus a beautiful and fun place to be. Very commuter friendly college!"
Niche User,4,La Salle is a great school with a lot of opportunities and diversity so one doesn't feel left out. There are great events that the school hosts. There is a melting pot of diversity.
Freshman,4,Most professors are very engaged in helping students really succeed in their major and it is a very accepting school overall.
Niche User,4,"La Salle University is an amazing university. It is very diverse, has a great student life, awesome professors! The campus is easy to navigate, the staff are great in helping you with class schedule or general needs. Security will always make sure you are safe and are constantly patrolling the area! Great school overall!"
Junior,4,"Great college overall. Nice academics and teachers. Campus looks good, food is alright, athletics are  enjoyable and the student life is good overall. the only downs side is the safety, as any other college that is in a big city it is not completely safe."
Freshman,4,My first year at La Salle was very interesting. There was a big learning curb I had to adjust to.I learned quickly that everything is put in your hands. There is a freedom when going off to school and I had to learn to prioritize certain things in order to get through my first year.
Freshman,4,its a nice little university with small classes. you will like you know the teacher and the subject on a more personal level.
Freshman,4,"I am a new freshmen going to La Salle University. My experience visiting and going for acceptance day was very nice. It is a comfortable campus with really great professors. The environment and food were pleasant, we learned about the safety procedures and the different local stores. The dorms were the average size but still cozy, also there is a nice diversity  of people at La Salle. I think the college has real potential and can't wait to start my journey."
Freshman,4,"La Salle is not the prettiest campus but it still has a lot to offer. Since there are small classrooms, teachers really care about each student and gets to know you personally. They are always there to help whenever you  need. The small campus also makes it easier to meet new people and always see a friendly face no matter where you go."
Alum,4,"Overall, I was grateful for the experience La Salle gave me during my undergraduate degree. I met amazing people and learned from brilliant professors. I got the one on one attention I needed from faculty due to the overall size of the school. I also was able to join a sorority and other clubs La Salle had to offer. I met life long friends and remained in touch with not only students but some professors as well. Only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the school was very expensive when I attended, (graduated May 2016) and I am in a ton of student debt because of it. However, La Salle recently cut the tuition cost in half, which is great for upcoming freshman! Go Explorers!"
Freshman,4,"La Salle University provides a respectful and welcoming environment for me. All of the staff are there to make sure their students are prepared for the world ahead of them. You can tell on a daily basis that they love what they do. Being a school dedicated to the patron saint of teachers, St. John Baptist De La Salle, the university takes advantage of that to involve itself with the community."
Junior,4,I love how diverse La Salle’s campus is. I would like to see more food options- especially late night ones!
Junior,4,"From my experience, this school is lovely. The small classroom sizes allow for your professors to really get to know you and care about your wellbeing. 
I'm on a sports team and it's okay. I transferred from a more established sports program at another college, so the transition to a less established team is difficult for me. From my knowledge, our other sports teams are okay at La Salle. 
Apparently, the North dorms are disgusting and filled with cockroaches. Luckily, I immediately moved off campus when I transferred. 
Overall, I love it here. I am happy with my choice."
Freshman,4,"I like the school. Its diverse, the academics are very good. The material being taught isn't easy so it gives me a challenge which is expected in college."
Sophomore,4,"During my La Salle experience so far I am happy to say my professors and advisors helped me through my first year and half of college experience. When entering La Salle I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect entering my first year of college but they have helped me get the best grades and make the best choices possible. During the summer there was something called the Summit Program, that helped me through the first year epsecially. The program gave us a experience of what college was going to be like during a week long. Also, it was mandatory to attend tutoring or help to make sure we understand what was going in the class we would struggle in. That helped me finish my first year of college with the best grades possible."
Freshman,4,La Salle University is a wonderful school. The location is urban and very diverse. The teachers don't really take time to get to know their students though it depends on the teacher.
College Freshman,4,"Most people smoke and drink. If you don't drink at parties, you'll definitely feel awkward. Only a few people do hard-core drugs, there's no pressure."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely adore the small community of la salle. The professors truly care about their students and it shows. 
Sophomore,4,"I am in the Honors Program and although it was an extremely hair pulling experience and rigorous program, I can say that my brain was challenged constantly and the Honors Triple truly made me think in a new and eye opening light that has immensely contributed to my academic growth. "
College Sophomore,4,"Basketball is the main varsity sport at La Salle. It is the most competitive, since we do not have a football team."
College Sophomore,4,"My first year at La Salle was an interesting experience. I met new people from different places and cultures. I like the diversity at the school, because I was used to and exposed to a large diversity of students. La Salle has one of the best programs for my major, and has a high success rate for finding jobs post-graduation."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers in the honors program are very active and engaged in their teaching. All are very approachable and my advisors are great.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't had any problems.
College Sophomore,4,I am in the newest dorm on campus and enjoy it. Myself and all of my roommates from last year all living together again.
College Sophomore,4,I pledged the oldest fraternity on campus - Sigma Phi Lambda. Both my father and my uncle we in the same fraternity. They do the most on campus and I am thrilled to be an active brother.
College Sophomore,4,La Salle is a Big 5 Atlantic 10 basketball school. Most of the student participation revolves around basketball.
College Junior,4,I believe that the career opportunities at La Salle are amazing because they give everyone at the school a chance to become successful and be able to achieve all of their goals.
College Junior,4,I think that the safety of the students on campus could definitely be better but the security is doing all they can to make sure our students feel safe and comfortable on and off campus
College Junior,4,I really love the housing at la Salle because it's organized and they make us apart of a community as a whole. The dorms are all close by so it is easy to become friends with others
College Junior,4,"When the athletic teams are good, the students become more engaged into sports and start to support the athletes more and more as the seasons go by"
College Junior,4,What makes my school unique is that it is very diverse with the cultures which makes everyone unite and engage friendships
College Sophomore,4,Very respected school in the work force
College Sophomore,4,Great school. Lots of resources and helpful staff.
College Sophomore,4,Great staff. Lots of resources. They really care about my success.
College Sophomore,4,I live in lasalle for about 1 week and I felt very safe and it was a very nice environment
College Sophomore,4,Great teams and clubs to join. It's not just about the parties but also about making life long relationships with people
College Sophomore,4,It's great. The sport team members love our sprit and also support us
College Sophomore,4,Very social inside the dorms.
College Sophomore,4,The sorities are very open and respectful. They maintain the true college experience.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics are very diverse. We offer basketball, rugby soccer etc. Everyday you see students training in the morning before the day begins."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is a great experience, and many different cultures that are there. It is amazing to see the different opportunities that this school has overall with jobs, internships, and school activities."
College Freshman,4,My school was challenging as I moved up in the grades and the school gave me the necessary skills to do well in college.
College Sophomore,4,"I really love La Salle. It is a great with a lot more potentia, I think there are many things to improve, to make La Salle a great university. Such as having a new building for psychology and philosophy, remodeling the dining halls both structure and food, remodeling dorms and bathrooms."
College Sophomore,4,"The career and employments services does a great job at helping students, as long as students want to be help."
College Sophomore,4,"The staff really care for the safety and well being of every student mentally, phisically and socially."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the soriority and fraternities in my school are great, they do alot of entretainting and fun fundraising events for the poor and the sick. They are ACTUAL fun, it is a great way to meet new people while doing something good for the less fortunate."
College Sophomore,4,I live all the way in MA but this college simply has a positive vibe.
College Sophomore,4,"Out of my five semesters at LaSalle, thus far i have only encounters two unfair and unruly teachers that played on their tenure benefits. Otherwise, every teacher is honest, laid-back and very open about what is expected. They are resourceful and make you feel like they care. Often times, i remain social with my teachers after a course because the student-professor relationship at lasalle is great!"
College Sophomore,4,"The La Salle experience is an expensive one, but it's definitely a positive experience. The school does a great job of integratong different religions and cultures into our campus life. Though a Catholic based and rooted university- we have very secular programs, i.e., lgbt, daycare, sex/drug. They also offer a variety of extra curriculars that are all student based but widey recognized and respected, i.e., neo-african drums, step-team, sword fighting. If LaSalle has one thing, it is variety."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are relatively small, which allows you to have a closer relationship with your professors. Most professors are very helpful and understanding."
College Freshman,4,"I have no complaints about my housing experience, except that the building I am currently living in does not have air conditioning."
College Senior,4,"My purpose is to go somewhere else to do my Intership and then do a master in Urbanism. Even in Mexico city I learned more, so I want to do something"
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the class sizes and how most of my teachers really seemed to care about me. The housing is kinda crappy but it's college so I think I would probably feel that way anywhere. I like most of the people there, there seems to be a spot for everyone."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy my time here, I mean I'm sure there are better places but I like where I'm at."
College Freshman,4,"I would definitely chose La Salle if I was given the choice again because it has an acclaimed nursing program that prides itself on the students' success. They start their clinicals earlier than most schools and that helps prepare students for the work force as early as possible. The new arrangement of the nursing curriculum is slightly gruling, but it is rewarding when you see how much you accomplish in your four years."
Sophomore,2,Online was not good. I didn't like it at all and if were gonna learn online again  this year our tuition needs to be reduced.
Sophomore,2,"There is no consistency in tuition so you don't you're gonna get billed next seamster although they claim that it is always the same. The meal plan is way too expensive for the way they treat the food and also for the quality. The cheapest meal plan is 3,200 dollars and it is mandatory for all students who live on campus. As a person who is medically diagnosed with IBS I was denied to not pay for the meal plan and suffered greatly. I lost a lot of weight because of this issue, which could have been solved if la Salle would just accept my medical note. Not everyone can afford la sales meals when you're not eating them. Not only that may I mention the dormitory during my freshman year had no elevator, had no air conditioning. And during the first two days of my stay here someone passed out from a stroke and the ambulance had to be called."
Junior,2,"I left before the COVID thing happened, but talking to some people it seems like the technological ineptitude of the faculty carried over to virtual lessons."
Sophomore,2,Bad place to live even if it has a respected business faculty. There is not much to do and the area is terrible. Dining halls should have sanitary controls and food quality is really poor. Athletic facilities are D3 even if we are D1.
Freshman,2,It not a very amazing school. I sometimes find myself being easily bored. But I cant judge that because this is only my first semester. I just hope as time continues I get the college experience I was hoping for.
College Sophomore,2,"It's alright, but it's almost like the staff doesn't care about cleaning well, especially during finals. The bathrooms overflow with paper and the floor everywhere in all the building are gross."
College Senior,2,"The university doesn't have opportunities, and they don't care about it"
College Sophomore,2,I'm an independent student (which I became aware of because of my personal situation mid-semester) and it's like a fight just to find out how to get more money than a dependent student. It's like they only want to help a student to an extent.
College Sophomore,2,"The dining halls offer low quality food, more so for meals than snacks. The snacks are good, but it leaves you hungry eventually so it's essential to ration food account money and the mini-market and food stands accordingly to eat well."
College Freshman,2,I tried to get quite a few properties in that area and none seemed to work out.
College Freshman,2,food chains and Chinese stores not very good quality
College Sophomore,2,"Sports are important at my school, especially basketball. I know that I get more emails for a basketball game than any other sports game. They even give out free stuff for the first couple hundred students that get there. We also get a free ticket for the game with our student I-D which is how it should be. I have attended other games, such a soccer. I feel like the school doesn't care that much about the other sports because they don't get as much publicity. Yet, I see basketball flyers in every building. The other sports represent my school to, so they should do a better job promoting them, so we can support."
College Senior,2,Off-campus dining consists of a lot of fast food and not much of a healthy variety.
Recent Alumnus,2,It doesn't seem safe to venture off campus.
College Junior,2,There's not many food places to choose from traveling into the city is a must and the Fresh Grocer is very high for a college student.
College Freshman,2,It's not the best but you can find a place to park usually.
College Freshman,2,I don't think it's really worth it to live off campus because the off campus houses get broken into a lot because the locals know that rich college kids live there
College Freshman,2,"There's really only a few places, but the few places that are there are really good."
College Freshman,2,The neighborhood really isn't the best and you shouldn't just walk around all by yourself.
College Junior,2,We had a several days off this semester with the snow storms. But I don't complain. More time to sleep and be lazy lol.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't really any good food places around campus the addition of the taco place was a great idea though. I feel that it should be more like temples campus with variety and discount to help out campus students.
College Sophomore,2,The availability to food markets could be better. Yes there is fresh grocer but it's really high in cost.
College Sophomore,2,We still need to work on the dining halls and places around La Salle for students to dine at.
College Sophomore,2,There are not many restaurants off-campus. Just some fast food places.
College Freshman,2,"The weather is unpredictable, and temperatures can change drastically in a few days. Recently the snow has been bad and the temperature very low. The humid summers make the air seem even hotter with allergens everywhere, namely pollen."
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus a medium sized campus. The only walking distance store is a supermarket, dunkin donuts and a Rite Aid. If you need to go anywhere else you must take public transportation. The neighborhood is not safe, from shootings to robberies, I never leave my dorm at night without another student."
College Junior,2,The Campus is pretty laid back unless it is serious.
College Sophomore,2,the school has rules set in place but when you have residential advisors who allow their own rules that's where the problem comes from
College Junior,2,It doesn't have enough healthy selections. And you can see the food is not made with thought or love.
College Junior,2,"La Salle is in a pretty dangerous neighborhood, but housing is cheap depending on where you want to live. It's not the prettiest, but a good house can be split by five people for maybe $250 each per month. Utilities are usually on your own and not covered by the landlord, but a lot of houses are available in the area, and parking off campus isn't terrible. The biggest concern people tend to have is safety, but that can change from block to block and a lot of people just buy a few extra locks."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much diversity. This school is mostly all caucasians and african americans. It is hard to make friends if your not involved.
College Freshman,2,The weather sucks in Philadelphia but if you enjoy mostly could with a chance of a lot of rain then you'll love it here. In August and September it was very sunny and hot and it was fairly warm during the nights (I'm only freshman so I cannot tell you about the other nicer month). It's usually foggy during the night.  It's hardly sunny in Philadelphia ! I wish someone told me
College Junior,2,"We have a lot of ethnic diversity, kind of. However, everyone is mostly from the area around school, so most people still act alike anyway."
College Freshman,2,there is really nothing around to go to unless you go into the city
College Sophomore,2,"Where the Greeks at? Greek life doesn't dominate the school, mostly good for parties but other than that they don't serve much of a purpose."
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of different people at La Salle. Everyone is accepted though because of how different they are and people want to know more about them.
College Junior,2,"Dinning at Lasalle – Lasalle offers different meal plans, in addition to that you get either $100, $250, $300 per semester added to you ID Card, depending on your meal plans. you get to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food in the dinning halls are not bad but it gets boring over time because the only thing that changes is the main course and even that is not very good in my opion. although other cafetaria have great food so over all its ok."
College Freshman,2,"We're All Ganna Die!!! OMG!!! SECURITY ARE A BUNCH OF UNFIT/OLD MEN!!! If anything were to go down, don't count on these guys to protect you. As for strictness, as with any college or university, La Salle doesn't like getting police involved; this would bring bad press to the school. The only time I've ever heard of them going to the court is when 3 guys went on a stealing spree in North dorms. Stick to minor stuff like fighting and passing out and you'll be fine."
College Sophomore,2,Inside Scoop – Cant really think of anything that sets them apart. Nothing special..
College Senior,2,Terrible Off-Campus Food Choices – There's only a handful of places in the general vicinity of the school and they all are pretty bad in terms of food quality .
Junior,1,"Positives: There are some outstanding faculty members, they are great teachers and care for (most of) their students. The mental health counseling is also a very big plus.
Negatives: If your teacher is not amazing, which is about roughly half the teachers, they are probably dry/boring and terrible. 
The surrounding area is not safe. There is nothing to do on campus and to get to the areas where you can have fun, it is at least a 20 minute car ride. 
A majority of students in my classes do not care about their education, even if the teacher is amazing. It seems like 75% of the student body are mindless Greek life drones. Just overhearing conversations at the cafeterias (where the facilities are disgusting), there is a lot of homophobia/LGBTQ+ bashing and racism that occurs in the white student base, many of whom are often conservatives. 
A lot of the dorms are rundown and old. 
The non-teaching faculty are very clueless.
La Salle is very much a waste of tens of thousands of dollars."
College Freshman,1,"Partying is the only thing to do at La Salle and the parties aren't even particularly good. I honestly cannot find the draw in them, and I was a pretty big partier before I got to La Salle."
College Freshman,1,"I feel like I unlearned a lot of the stuff I learned in high school. Most teachers will just make you type a bunch of papers and read out of the textbooks. Want to know how pointless these papers are? I wrote papers for juniors and seniors and managed to get above 90 on every one. These weren't papers I poured my heart and soul into either. These were ""barely paying attention, eating lunch"" papers. Even the term papers were like this. I spent two hours on my PoliSci paper and got the highest grade in the class. It was 10 pages. I'm not even a half decent writer, these professors just have such poor standards that they just put a number on whatever papers fall on their desks. Or they take forever to grade. During finals week, our history class got back papers we wrote three weeks into the semester because, by this professors own admission, SHE JUST FINISHED GRADING THEM!"
College Freshman,1,"La Salle has a huge racism problem, especially present on Yik Yak and the school's Snapchat profile. One of my gay friends was called a ""faggot"" at a party, black students are frequently subjected to racial slurs and derision from other students."
College Freshman,1,"The only education I received at La Salle was about drugs. You want ecstasy? The guy across the hall from me sells it. DMT? One building over my friend. LSD? Townhouses buddy. Weed? I honestly have met very few people who have never sold pot or pot brownies before. Coke? Stop on by the ""partiest"" frat. Weird ass research chemicals and stuff that could probably kill you? Check the second floor of one of the north dorms. Alcohol? The liquor stores near here don't even card, and neither do the beer stores. Vyvanze? 1st floor Basils! Vicodin or other opioid painkillers? Hell, theres a hundred athletes getting some kind of surgery selling off their extra painkillers! Or hell, you can be one of those kids so hooked on benzodiazepenes that you get severe headaches when you try to stop (several of my friends). La Salle is a haven if you want to experiment with different drugs and learn how each one will destroy your life. I personally was made fun of frequently for quitting drinking because I was sick of VLad's and all that gross natty."
College Freshman,1,"La Salle is a terrible school that has permanently turned me off of college. Socially, this place is like high school 2.0. You get told on your graduation from high school that you're an adult now but when you get to La Salle everyone is an insecure, bratty child. No one takes anything seriously other than partying, and that would be fine but the parties also suck. La Salle is terrible academically. I have yet to take one single class even remotely related to my major and instead had to take a poli sci class taught by a woman who was running for congress and would just talk about her campaign all class. I had a history teacher who just read out of the textbook every class, then asked why I wasn't taking it seriously and was just playing games on my phone. I have had three good professors, the others all being terrible. This school is not worth 20000 a semester. This school is not worth $2 a semester. Avoid like the plague, there is no reason to go here. Go to ANY school. Go join the goddamn military. Just don't come here, it is terrible in every way. The only education I'm leaving La Salle with is one in drugs."
College Freshman,1,A basketball player was accused of sexual assault last semester but because the girl was not a student NO ACTION WAS TAKEN! There are men and women actively taking advantage of drunk individuals in a sexual manner. No one takes sexual assault seriously at all. Even victims pretend it is not a big deal that they can't remember how they wound up waking up in a strangers bed.
College Freshman,1,Student gym is probably the worst gym I've ever been to.
College Freshman,1,La Salle is a terrible school. Don't go.
College Sophomore,1,I haven't been to one yet and you have to pay $5-$10 for each frat party. Ter-ri-ble
College Sophomore,1,It's so hard for me and it's a huge hassale.
College Junior,1,"Every one is greek and if not you are not considered ""cool"""
College Junior,1,School location says it all about what kind of off campus food there is.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus depends on where you live.  South campus has plenty of spots, but they fill up quickly.  North campus can be a nightmare.  There are not enough spots for the number of students with cars, and then commuters just make the situation worse.  Many times students will have to park by Security headquarters and the grocery store near campus, but that is really far from campus and classes. "
College Junior,1,"There are few restaurants that are close to campus, and the few that are relatively close are fast food.  If you want to eat at a ""family"" restaurant such as Applebee's, Chili's, Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, etc. then you have to go quite far either to St. Joe's or Jenkintown, and you need a car.  However, you can take the subway into Center City, and they have a multitude of options, but again, that is quite far from campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school is a nightmare. Classes were great- easier than high school & the teacher to student ratio is great. But- the school has little respect among top employers. No one knows of it and those that do don't respect it. It's just not a good school. Furthermore it is in an awful neighborhood. It makes Newark NJ look safe. It's dirty and beyond scary. Anyone that thinks Lasalle has a great social life was most likely a complete dork in high school. It's very small, consists of many unattractive people and the parties are boring. There is nothing to do. Don't waste your money or risk your life going here. Lots of hicks from PA tend to go here and think it's great because they grew up in corn fields."
College Sophomore,1,it a majority of whites followed by blacks and then a few Indians and Ricans so not to much diversity but as the years go bye more and more people come to the university
College Sophomore,1,to many students have access to illegal or banned items and It affects the outlook of the school an it affects other students who don't take part in those activities
College Senior,1,"The school is in North Philadelphia which is not a safe area. The local people are not motivated to change their life situtations and have a poor attitude. Around the corner of the university is a wide variety of stores, transportation methods and food restaurants. The area has potential but only if the local people adjust their attitudes and want more for thereselves in life. Even though there is a police district down the street, that still does not make the university feel any safer."
College Sophomore,1,"I couldn't imagine a worse area for a school to be in. The surrounding streets are crumbling and littered and are totally unsafe after dark. Even during the day, you really can not leave campus unless you are in a car or are willing to make the nasty walk to the nasty subway station 3 blocks up the road. It is one of the worst areas of one of the worst cities in the US. If LaSalle doesn't deserve and F, I don't know what school does.
"
College Sophomore,1,"The surrounding neighborhood around La Salle is not safe. It is not okay to walk around alone, even during the day. Because of this, La Salle offers a student shuttle that can take students to and from the subway station."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus can become hectic if you are not there before a certain time. There are various parking lot locations, yet not all of them seem to safe. I park in the main lot but received one ticket because I parked where I shouldn't of. Even up to this current day, students park where I once parked, and they all receive tickets as well."
College Freshman,1,"The quality of housing depends on where you are located on campus. The North dorms smell bad, have mice running around, and the rooms are small and rarely cleaned."
College Freshman,1,The transportation on campus is poor and the university does not really help in helping.
College Sophomore,1,there are only few places to eat in walking distance
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is unbelievable at La Salle. Even when you do pay for a permit sometimes you can't find a spot, which doesn't make much sense."
College Sophomore,1,"A Bit Scarey – Although I really enjoy my classes, the surrounding area of La Salle is just down right scarey."
College Freshman,1,I actually visited this school before enrolling and was tricked by my host! She took me out parting and the organization that was hosting us had a lot planned. LIESS!! There is nothing to do here but the same old s****y house parties! SOME SAY IF YOU GET INVOLVED THEN THERE IS STUFF TO DO BUT THATS ALL LIESSS TOO! I was involved in the organization that hosted me plus one other and these were as mediocre as the school. Do not go here! I am currently transferring out! Save yourself time and money and go somewhere else!
College Sophomore,1,Nothing to Do – The campus is located in a rough neighborhood. The residents that live in the neighborhood are economically unstable and they depend on government assistance. There are no things to do in the surrounding neighborhood. If students want to have fun they have to go across the city or they have to create a party of their own in off campus housing.
College Freshman,1,new police force took over and shuts everything down extremely early.
College Senior,1,Just OK – Places off campus are good but dangerous to get too.  You cant always tell what the food in the dinning hall even is.
College Senior,1,"A Racist,Privately Owned Catholic School=Lasalle – I, as well as the other small percentage of here, feel overwhelmed with lack of funding and opportunities for minority students here. If you have an identity crisis as a minority, don't come here!  The overall morale and behavior of this school is indirectly stating, if you're a minority, don't bother because whites come first here at LaSalle and they are our main priority here."
College Sophomore,1,"Some of the Greeks and athletic teams have unofficial ""houses"" off-campus, however the houses themselves aren't in great condition and they're in bad neighborhoods. Sometimes seniors choose to get a house with friends and live in a suburb of Philly, called Manyunck, but it's bit of a drive from campus and not very convenient."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Good – La Salle is located in the worse part of philly, there is a lot of pizza and Chinese places that will deliver, but I wouldn't recommend ""dining off-campus."""
College Freshman,1,"Food Halls Are Night and Day – The food halls at North campus, known as Blue and Gold (or B&G) SUCK. The food is horrific and if you don't like what they are serving, you can either get a crappy sandwich or terrible pizza. There are numerous reports of food poisoning around campus and the food usually leaves you with a queasy feeling afterwards. Ms. Pat is a sweetheart though and is the one (and maybe only) good thing about this dining hall. The dining hall on south campus known as Treetops is much better. They offer cheesesteaks and quesadillas for lunch along with a much wider selection of foods. The only problem is, if you live in North halls, the walk really sucks. you could take the shuttle but it will take twice as long."
College Freshman,1,"La Salle's shuttle system is spotty at best. Though shuttles are supposed to come every 10 to 15 minutes, it is often later and can cause serious issues. Though you can call security to ask how soon the shuttle will be at a certain place they usually just lie and say five minutes without looking it up. Late at night you can call security to send you an escort but they sometimes tell you to wait for the shuttle if it's still running or to walk if you're fairly close to main campus. The shuttle does stop at the closest subway station though and and the SEPTA system does a reasonable job of making trains fast and clean."
College Junior,1,"LA Salle – Good luck with finding Financial Aid. Hopefully if they do, they won't take it away from you"
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life throws parties, thats about it. Our options aren't very broad."
Niche User,1,"F-----------.   Actually more like a Z-. SOOO SCARY. its not safe AT ALL.  the school sends out security alerts whenever there is something that happens safety/security wise, and it feels like there is a new robbing, mugging, stabbing, etc, every other day.  It's not safe at all. I'm being serious."
Niche User,1,"The area is SO BAD.  in philly, the two worst areas are North Philly and West Philly.  La Salle is in North West..so that should tell you something.  It's actually scary outside. dont come here."

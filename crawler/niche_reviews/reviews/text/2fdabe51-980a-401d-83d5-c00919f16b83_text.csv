Freshman,5,I like how it is a small campus and you get to know your teachers more personally. Experiential learning is a big plus as well.
Freshman,5,The only class I have online is my English class and that is because my professor is high risk for the corona virus.
Niche User,5,i love it it is such an awesome school the dorms are a little old but they will soon have ac and be renovated everyone is so nice and welcoming
Niche User,5,Brevard has been extremely helpful in providing me with the necessary information before I make my college decision!
Sophomore,5,The criminal justice program is a huge benefit it helps get into the field right after college. The food is not the best but they feed their students. Campus is safe and security does their job. All of the professors are nice and meet with students one on one if needed. Most class time is hands on which gives you the experience you intended. I would recommend this college to anyone that wants the college life but not a big school. I can not wait to say I am a Brevard alumni it has been a dream of mine. I give this college an amazing rating
Freshman,5,"I am currently enrolled in Brevard and starting next semester, and I fell in love with the campus the first moment I saw it. The amazing atmosphere, the adorable white squirrels, and the friendly people all attracted me towards the school."

Junior,5,If I had to do it all over again I would still choose Brevard College! The community and atmosphere is truly magical and something everyone deserves to experience.
Junior,5,"While Brevard might seem very small and earthy, it is certainly the place I never thought I would call home. With the class sizes being remarkably small, you are able to build a relationship and bond with your professors to ensure you are doing your best and getting the best education. With a variety of different events rapidly occurring at Brevard, you could never get bored. Beyond the beautiful environment that surrounds us and our amazing school, the people are what really brings everyone together. Unlike most universities, I have a relationship with my peers, professors, faculty and more. This relationship and kindness that is all throughout Brevard as a whole could never match to another. Everyone I have ever meet has only been kind and helpful to one another. The community of the town of Brevard and Brevard college come together for many events and bring joy to all. I could never imagine going anywhere else."
Niche User,5,I have visited brevard college and stayed on campus the student life was very energetic the professors were helpful and the overall community surrounding the college is very caring and nice people.
Freshman,5,I enjoy going to Brevard College the campus is nice and beautiful. The community is wonderful the students and staff are friendly and would do anything to help each other out. The classes are experimental learning which is not like any other colleges. Everything is hands on and interactive.
Freshman,5,"I like it because it is small. I have met a lot of friends. The classes are small, teachers are great and everyone is friendly."
Freshman,5,I am currently transferring to Brevard. But I did have a visit there a couple of months ago. And on my visit they made me feel right at home and the campus was beautiful and the classroom I went to look like a great place to learn.
Freshman,5,"My time at Brevard has been filled with new friends, caring professors, and a wonderful education. There is always something new to learn or experience, and the professors are always ready to help. There are so many resources and people that will lead to a successful college career.  The campus is small, and all the students are connected. There is always something to do or some activity to participate in, and when there is nothing on campus fun can be found in other areas around the Brevard area."
Recent Alumnus,5,My education was the best part about my college experience!
College Freshman,5,I have not issues with the health and safety
College Freshman,5,My experience with Brevard College has been wonderful.  The professors and other students create a nice environment for a new student or a returning student.

We work on projects that are actually utilized. I feel that while it's involved and intense at times, the hands-on education that I am receiving will boost me to the forefront in the business world."
College Junior,5,"Brevard is located in Transylvania County. As part of a class each  Brevard College student has to take, as a class the students get to see how a locate organic farmer runs his business of organic crops and such. There are a lot of local farms and organic options."
College Junior,5,"With Brevard College being such a small school the financial aid office is perfect. They have a great system. Also, the financial aid team sends emails to the students who are not clear and works with them on either payment plans, work-study opportunities and so much more."
College Junior,5,Brevard College is part of the South Atlantic Conference and is in division 2. Brevard College's ratio of student-athlete to non student-athlete is about 70 to 30.
College Junior,5,"Brevard, North Carolina is known for being the cycling capital of the United States. BC is not even a two minute walk from town so going into town to eat, shop or watch a movie is not bad and there is no need of public transportation."
College Junior,5,"Alcohol visibility is not noticeable because many people consume alcohol off campus where it be at an off campus house, a bar in town or restaurant in town. We have a no tolerance policy when it comes to drugs. It is one time you are found with drugs you are done. "
College Junior,5,As an RA (resident advisor) I am able to uphold what each and every student signs at the beginning of the year. As a housing staff we hold each resident up to the same standard. I am not afraid to ask for help from either campus security or my fellow RA'S.
College Junior,5,"I seriously could not see myself anywhere else. I know I was made to be at this school. I have been given opportunities that other students will never receive in their entire life. I have been shown what it is like to be truly accepted into a school and community. I love being here at BC. I love the fact that Brevard College is a small school because every single one of my professors knows who I am, what sport I play, and how they can help me learn and grow. I can not reiterate how much I LOVE being here at BC!"
College Junior,5,"Brevard College has roughly around 700 students. With the school being so small the professors are constantly able to work one on one with each student. My academic advisor is AMAZING! She helps me with the registration process, study options and helping me graduate on time by making sure I take the right classes."
College Junior,5,"My major is Business and Organizational Leadership. I have to take ORG 209 which is a class designated to taking one big field trip. This semester our field trip went to Arcadia Farms (Arden, NC), The Beacon (Spartanburg, SC), the Amazon Warehouse (Spartanburg, SC), and then our final stop was the Adidas Warehouse (Spartanburg, SC). This trip was real world experience to see how these types of companies work and being able to see how these companies work out their global logistics. "
College Junior,5,Each semester you get more money added to your account to print off papers. We have a super lab which is open 24/7. We got wifi installed in all of our residence halls this year and it has done wonders for our college.
College Junior,5,As an RA (resident advisor) I love building community within my hallway and dorm. 
College Junior,5,Campus strictness is not as bad as it is proclaimed to be. After all these rules were put in place for your safety and the safety of your fellow students around you. I am an adamant believer in my schools campus strictness. 
College Freshman,5,I like the college professors who are the ones that make a big impact to me on learning. Their experience helps a lot and they know and understand what is needed to move on.
College Sophomore,5,"I don't really go out and drink but I have friends that do. They really enjoy Downtown Melbourne. It has pizza, clubs, and shopping."
College Sophomore,5,I am very satisfied with my education I am receiving at Brevard College. All my professor's have been great and really interested in education and if I am satisfied with the course.
College Sophomore,5,I can take online courses that have great professors that make it very intinmate and educational. The staff is very helpful and all my professor's have been great.
College Freshman,5,The one great thing about this college is if you have any questions David Volrath is the go to and he will get back to so quick! Any problems I had with financial aid he helped me step by step. Awesomely he is on facebook;)
Sophomore,4,"Since COVID-19 I had to take classes online. In the beginning, it was difficult due to the quick transition period but after a couple of weeks things became easier and more detailed. The professors were great in their effort to reach out in order to help us succeed in the best possible way."
Sophomore,4,"I love the learning environment, this school is more hands-on and you build real relationships with the professors. They give you multiple opportunities to succeed and thrive. The only thing I would change is that most of the labs are on Wednesdays which can make it difficult to have multiple of them."
Senior,4,Brevard college is a very positive place to live in and is a great place to get your education. Everyone there is very helpful in all aspects. One thing that Brevard could improve is the food although it is more decent than many schools. If someone asked me if I would recommend them to go there i would absolutely recommend it.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Brevard College started off a little rocky because of personal reasons. I wanted to drop out and going home but I stayed there to live it try. I was stayed to play soccer and tried to see the best in everything there. Once I let everything in I loved it finally. The classrooms were great and so was the professors. It was a close communities that had so many benefits. All that said but work still need to be done, one is the cafe food. It'n not the best nutrients and needs more food that students like. Buildings needs to deep cleaned and prepared. I just wish the pride of attending the school reflects on the campus."
Freshman,4,"this school is ok , it is very small so everybody knows everybody and the professors are nice and helpful there is a family feeling of this school"
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of the small school feel and how easy it is to navigate myself around to classes and extra curricular activities. The professors are also another great part because they are so hands on and opened to finding you the best help you can get to succeed. The school has the coziest family feel and is a great 4 year school to attend in the Carolinas.
Freshman,4,Small  city with a close family atmosphere. Everyone knows you and willing to help. It’s a great place if you aren’t a party person and want to accomplish what you came there for.  Very adventurous always something to learn and do
Senior,4,"Brevard may have been expensive but almost half of my tuition was paid for from scholarships before I even stepped foot on the campus. It is a welcoming community with a different approach to academics. Experiential education makes a difference and works well with small class sizes. The professors here genuinely care about their students and you will never feel like just a number here. There are numerous clubs, activities, and ways to be involved on campus and in the community. If you are looking for small class sizes, personal relationships with professors, a welcoming community, a place in the mountains, emphasis on the outdoors, and a place to grow and explore your interests while also getting a quality education with a large networking community then Brevard is the place for you!"
Senior,4,"It is small, getting to know to people is fantastic, classes are great because they are small
Lack of activities though. 
Common day can be boring. It feels like not new activities are offered. You fall into a routine and wait until the semester is over"
Senior,4,"I like the area my college is in. We are in the mountains, which to me is very quite. This has really relaxed me for probably one of my best years in college with my grades. I was able to relax and focus on my grades. I also like the one on one relationships we have with our professors. I have also met some life long friends because of how small the school is. Things that need to be changed is more support from the community for sporting events. I love the school."
Sophomore,4,Brevard college is very welcoming to everyone and instantly makes you feel at home. Brevard is a great size school with a small amount of students but honestly it feels like a community family. The sporting events are fun to enjoy and the different activities that they put together around campus for the students are a fun experience. The college is in an overall beautiful environment and well taken care of and the academics are amazing as well as the professors.
Sophomore,4,"A small, homey college in a small historical community near the blue ridge parkway. Is a great school those interested in music,art and the outdoors. The classroom size allows for a student to get one on one with their professor."
College Junior,4,"I thoroughly enjoy my time, and I get the most out of everything I experience. There is not a single thing I would change."
College Junior,4,"There are no real incidents of bad health or behavior on campus, and there is so much support and help should ever there be an incident."
College Junior,4,"Everyone loves their roommates, and there is no issue when it comes to cleanliness and good vibes."
College Junior,4,"Thus far, everyone at this school is inviting and easy going. The teachers are helpful, and they really aim to see their students achieve greatness."
Recent Alumnus,4,Very diverse in many ways but not ethnically diverse at all
Recent Alumnus,4,Lots of opportunities to connect with schools and opportunities in the community. College is respected but small.
Recent Alumnus,4,Very supportive and well trained staff
Recent Alumnus,4,Mostly a good experience. Campus life was what made me not love my time there. But my education was excellent.
College Freshman,4,My experience at Brevard has been a good one.
College Freshman,4,"I have not compliants, when something needs to be fixed, it typically does in a timely manner"
College Freshman,4,"They offer a lot of scholarships if you're willing to work for them. I didn't receive as much as I would have liked, and they pretty much only give scholarships with large amounts to athletes."
College Freshman,4,"The freshmen dorms here are made of really thick cement walls, which make it almost impossible to hear your neighbors beside of you. Unless of course they decide to blare their music, but that is almost always dealt with swiftly by the RA's. The dorm rooms are pretty spacious and come with two beds, two desks, and two closet/dresser combos. There is no closet and the rooms are suite style."
College Senior,4,Classes are small you can also talk to your professors on a daily basis
College Freshman,4,I plan on interning and I believe that my school will assist me with this. The networking here is strong.
College Freshman,4,"The only problems that I have encountered is that classes are filled and closed quickly.  With the population increasing, the school needs to open more sections and expand the professor base."
College Freshman,4,"Financial aid is always a confusing situation but the staff walked us right through it and processed it all with no real hassles. The problem was with the actual computer service, not the financial aid. One thing though, you may have multiple offerings of scholarships and you can't overlap them here. So you choose either presidential grant or athletics, or whatever else, if offered. But you can't take them all."
College Freshman,4,"Only had a few hiccups in the aid, but received everything I needed quickly."
College Senior,4,Lots of friends from different walks of life
College Freshman,4,My only concern is having to take more classes than I have to compared to some other college towards my degree
College Freshman,4,Lots of areas of attraction including multiple water falls
College Junior,4,Our ticketing and fines has become more strict within the past year. The permit cost each semester is really low compared to other schools. I have gone two years without a car with no problem. Since BC is a small school there are parking spaces just not in the exact place they need to be. It is a process that the school is still looking at. 
College Junior,4,"Brevard, North Carolina is known for its amazing outdoors being close to Dupont State Forest and Pisgah National Forest. The rainfall is extremely high for this region but Brevard wouldn't be the same without the rain. "
College Junior,4,Officers are there and very visible
College Junior,4,I think the greek life is great they do great things for the community and share a positive light for the local youth around the city.
College Junior,4,"Small class, professors are attentive."
College Junior,4,I have not experience any problems yet
College Junior,4,The team is rebuilting and on its way to becoming a great division.
College Sophomore,4,Good professors.  Relaxed atmosphere 
College Sophomore,4,Not much parting on campus
College Sophomore,4,Great professors that really strive to help you learn. Small class size
Recent Alumnus,4,"Brevard College is a small school that advocates a healthy lifestyle. Although there is drug usage, it is not pushed and is easy to avoid."
College Senior,4,We have pretty much everything you could want in Brevard.
College Senior,4,Southern mountains but generally very nice weather
Recent Alumnus,4,There are no drugs at Brevard Community College that I have noticed.
College Junior,4,"I'm finding it's all very managable, but beware that some don't like athletes missing classes and 90% of students are athletes."
College Junior,4,"I came to Brevard from another small private college (which touted they were the ""best"" in the southeast and Forbes had backed that up recently); however, I'm finding that I'm learning much more at Brevard than the college that got all these awards, where I felt like I was memorizing and that was it. I'm really learning and the instructors seem vested in the student's education."
College Junior,4,"Love it here - dorms are a little old in places, but otherwise, everyone is nice and all is good. The town makes a huge difference for me."
College Junior,4,Network connection slow at times. Plenty computers
College Freshman,4,"I have had a very light work load, the professors are very easy going and its easy to get help if you need it. Its also small class size, I have only 9 ppl in one of my classes! There also very hands on so its enjoyable to go to class!"
College Freshman,4,There really is a bit of everyone here but we seem to get along well. The only bad thing is over half the school is athletes so if your not one you can feel left out at times.
College Senior,4,"Computer Lab – Brevard has four areas where you can use computers: the Academic Enrichment Center (AEC), the library, the Science Lab and the Computer Lab. Every area is open time ranges from 8am-11pm depending on the location except for the Computer Lab which is opened 24/7. The AEC and Computer Lab are the only two of three areas that offer pristine Wifi, the other is the Cafe. Every semester your provided with I believe 50 dollars for printing on your account and printing runs you about 5 cent per page so you have more then enough money to print. Personal computers are just a bonus."
College Senior,4,"Very Outdoorsy Town – Brevard is not your average college town.   There isn't a raging nightlight filled with clubs and bars, but there is still so many things to do if you know how to look.  Many of the students enjoy spending their days outside doing many different activities.  On a nice day, you will see many students laying out by the creek, throwing a football or frisbee.  Even if you are not very familliar with outdoor activities such as rock climbing, mountain biking, or hiking, there are usually many groups who will teach you.  We have a Rock Gym in town that offers Free Climbing for Brevard College Students.  
The town is very supportive of our school.  You will have many ""townies"" come to the sporting events, plays, and music shows.  They definitely are Tornado Fans."
College Sophomore,4,Not a Problem – Parking on campus is not a problem if you have a parking pass.  There is a parking lot for students who drive to class.
College Freshman,4,"Close and Delicious – At Brevard College there are several restaurants and fast food places within walking distance of the school, Wendys, Ingles, Zaxbys, McDonalds and Roxys are just a few of the possibilities. The cost is reasonable especially for college students on a budget and several even have discounts for the students. The variety is great if you want a nicer restaurant we have steak houses and Roxys soda shop and grill, with a ton to choose from hot dogs, hamburgers, milkshakes, chicken, breakfast food and so much more. if it's late and you want a snack right next to the college is a 24 hour Ingles where you can get anything you want food wise, Ingles even has a deli bar if you want to just grab and go. Although Brevard is a small Mountain community we have amazing options for food no matter how much we have to spend or what we want there is always something we can get."
College Junior,4,Healthy Environment – There are a few different races at the campus and more majors than can be counted. We have many foreign students living on campus and Brevard also offers a great special needs program. Living on campus with so many people encourages acceptancel. The majority of the people at the college are well-rounded and will not judge you based on any prejudice.
College Freshman,4,"Liberal Views – Brevard is very accepting of students of all religious, economic, ethnic/racial, political and sexual orientation backgrounds."
College Sophomore,4,"Although Brevard College is a small four year college they are big in selections and taste in the campus dining hall. There is a little for everyone whether you are a vegetarian,Junkfood junkie,Healthy eater or Cultural eater Brevard can meet your needs.There is also a Burger King close by campus that will accept you flex bucks. There is also the Coltrain where students can go to get one of the best burgers this side of town as well as other specialty food that can be purchased with your bucks."
College Sophomore,4,"Brevard is a small college in a small southern community. Family oriented and supportive atmosphere.Brevard N.C. hac your everyday regular shopping attractions Walmart,and Kmart.Also Ingles grocery store.The highlight of the town is the Brevard Tornadoes Football team. Alumni and other community members can be found football season every Sat afternoon at the local High school giving their cheers and support.Win or lose the players feel loved and appreciated."
College Freshman,2,"This is a very small college population. We had a sexual assault the other evening right outside our dorm.  We received a campus email that it happened, and that we shouldn't go out without another person, and that town police were going to make more drive-throughs on campus. That's the last we heard of anything. 

My clothes have also been stolen from the laundry, as have other students. We don't see patrols."
College Freshman,2,"The area pretty much shuts down on weekends. There are no bars, no clubs, nothing of a party vibe for students except for an occasional party at an apartment or house off campus or a bonfire in the woods.  That said, when there IS something going on, students turn up. Halloween had over 200+ students attend a party off campus."
College Freshman,2,"The condition of the buildings is awful. Most rooms ARE large with suite-style bathrooms, which is nice, but they're falling apart- minimal maintenance is done, at most. This past week there was a water leak on the floor above me (old pipes) and my ceiling, walls, bedding are trashed. They are very slow to respond to maintenance requests. We are still waiting for our light fixture to be repaired in our bathroom from when we moved in back in early August. its November. No lights means you don't see the rust or crumbling walls, however. :( 

Most windows do not work and there is no air conditioning here in North Carolina, nor does the college allow window units, anyway. RA's don't have a strong presence. There are often random drunk students (who don't reside in our building) in the halls at 3am knocking on doors. There was a sexual assault this past week. This is a very small school and should be manageable. Things need to change here. It's unacceptable."
College Freshman,2,Not really a safe place. The security officers are there but usually only really see them handing out parking tickets.
College Freshman,2,There are only a few students who are big fans of the athletics. The sports teams overall are not very good in competition in the conference.
College Senior,2,Hardly anything to rent in town
Recent Alumnus,2,Brevard is a small town with little to do after 9pm.
College Senior,2,"There are some great traditions and there is a lot of fun to be had; however, the student center is lacking and the library is not open on Saturday and only 3-10 on Sundays, which causes me a problem in finding a quiet place to study. The athletic centers are old and in need of a revamp to bring them up to date, but I'm an athlete and love all the coaches here!"
College Senior,2,Average stuff - and I'm a semi-vegetarian and not good selections for me or for snacks later at night.
College Sophomore,2,There are the usual fast foods but nothing like Chipotle or Tropical Grill.
College Junior,2,"There aren't many apartment choices. Houses are expensive for college students. It's hard to live off campus, afford expenses and go to school full time. Most students live on campus unless they have family that live in the area. Otherwise, you have to be 21 to live off campus."
College Senior,2,"Brevard doesn't have a night life. It's a small town that is mainly composed of retirees so the town shuts down pretty early. People mainly go to Asheville if they are looking for a late scene, which is about 40 minutes away. There are few places you can go that will offer you some type of night life though: Jordan Street Cafe which has a bar section, the Square Root, and Dugans Irish Pub."
College Senior,2,"The girls at Brevard are just like girls at any school. You have a wide variety of personalities, skills, interest, and dressing standards. You'll find girls from pretty much any state or country. That's the beauty of Brevard. Its relatively hard to find a girl at Brevard just for the simple fact that a large percentage of the girls are not in to males but it is possible."
College Freshman,2,Very Few Options – Brevard is a small town with restaurants that are too expensive for most students.
College Junior,2,"No curfew except for athletes.  no one checks who is or is not in rooms, except for freshmen. Academics standards are enforced for athletes. Very small campus everyone knows everything you do including professors."
College Freshman,1,The athletic teams here aren't very good at all. Especially the football and lacross teams. They aren't something that the school needs to continuing focusing all of its money on
Recent Alumnus,1,"There was a lot of student-on-student abuse while I was there. I felt like certain people were favored by the administration and campus leaders over others. I actually witnessed a campus leader spreading multiple rumors about a student, including calling this student a ""slut"". Recently there was a sexual assault on campus; the administration handled it by having a separate assemblies for the male students and then another for female students. They essentially told the male students that they need to keep it in their pants (blaming all men for the actions of one depraved individual) and told the female students they needed to not be so wild and walk around after dark (it's their fault for not be sheltered-little virgins). 

They are way too backward and conservative.

Also, they were having financial problems the third year I was there and the first thing they did was cut the ONLY nurse at the student health center. 

They do not care about you, do not go to this abusive school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It wasn't challenging; it's the easiest thing and world, but you're not going to learn valid information. 

If you can breath, pick up a pencil and in speak in short, slightly coherent sentences--you're in.

Also, there was a psych major in a the SENIOR PSYCH SEMINAR who could not pronounce ""psychology"" properly! The MAJOR HE WAS ONE SEMESTER OF GRADUATING WITH A B.A. FROM AND HE COULDN'T PRONOUNCE THE NAME???????"
College Freshman,1,No greek life at all.
College Freshman,1,"Since its a relatively small school, not a lot of people and when its time for a break people don't usually stay on campus. Furthermore, giving you less oppurtunity to meet people"

Junior,5,"Trinity professors care so much about their students. They are always there to support us academically, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally!"
Junior,5,Teachers connected with students almost every day and provided support in any way that we needed.  They were extremely encouraging during the hard times.
Junior,5,"I love the sense of community. Also, since we are a small campus, we get to know each other better every day. Our relationship with people around the area are vast.

The professors are great. They want to help us and support us in our studies. Our worship cultures and our religious traditions are so diverse but we are united in Jesus Christ"
Junior,5,"We use Zoom and Microsoft Teams. And both of them are great way to help the student, especially in the midst of coronavirus"
Freshman,5,Trinity Christian College has a small campus but has a lot to offer. The professor and students gather as a family leaving a nice vibe throughout the school. Trinity offers many majors and minors and has a great staff to help you along your journey.
Junior,5,I like the diversity of Trinity. Really help student get to know one another. I would like to see the school change it’s openness to people who aren’t what they are used to.
Sophomore,5,I really love this college and enjoy being here. It makes me feel like at home because when I first came here I was welcomed by so many people and everyone here is very friendly and the professors really care about students and if you ever need help the professors are always willing to make an appointment or meet up with you to talk about what ever class related or not. They really challenge you in your faith as well from attending chapels and outcry's. There are many ways to be involved at Trinity and student life here is really good at including people and making sure that our campus is safe but also that we have fun events planned for sporting events and fundraisers.
Senior,5,"I like Trinity. It's all about community and building a better relationship with others and God. The faculty and staff are good too, they really try to help you if you are in a bind and you need help."
Niche User,5,I felt right at home as soon as I stepped on campus. The administration is super friendly and helpful with anything you need!!
Senior,5,I am a current student here. It is a great school. Everyone is usually very generous and outgoing. The professors are always available to help you and give you feedback when you ask them. It is more diverse than your typical private school. I say that from a Hispanic standpoint.
Freshman,5,This campus is perfect if you like to be in a smaller tight-knit community. Professors are all very kind and supportive. They provide several resources to keep students on track with their schoolwork.
Freshman,5,At first I was very home sick.  The college does a great job getting students engaged into the life on campus.  I love that you are not forced to go to chapel and are able to meet Jesus where you are.  This is a judgment free supportive atmosphere where I am growing into an adult.
Senior,5,Small class size and great attentive teachers. The teachers go above and beyond to help you succeed. Choosing this school was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
Senior,5,It’s a great college to go to. Great for meeting new friends and great professors that want to see you thrive
Alum,5,Trinity Christian College was a step above any other college I had attended prior. The expect a high quality of work that pays off as the semesters roll on. The professors there are always willing to reach out and assist their students in any way they can. Overall my experience at Trinity prepared me for the workforce in a way that makes me stand out from my peers!
Junior,5,"Trinity Christian College is an excellent place to receive an education. They not only get you ready for your vocation, but they also prepare you for life outside of college. Their mission is to see their students succeed in their educations and vocations."
Freshman,5,"I am just starting at Trinity, but all my experiences have been very positive. The professors, and advisors I have met have been very positive and helpful. They want you to succeed.   The students I have met so far have also been very positive and everyone seems to really like going to school there.  When I’ve been out in the community, and I’m wearing a Trinity shirt, I always get stopped by people saying they went there or they knew someone who went there. Everyone is always positive!  I also am part of the athletic program at Trinity, and the coach is really great and supportive."
Senior,5,"Trinity truly feels like a home away from home. All of the professors truly care about students and want them to succeed. The professors are very personable and care about the student as a whole person; mentally, emotionally, academically and spiritually. 
Also because Trinity is located about 20 miles from downtown Chicago, there are so many opportunities to engage in learning outside of the classroom."
Sophomore,5,Trinity is a smaller campus in the small city of Palos Heights. The campus is small but beautiful. All of the Professors are very helpful and are always active in helping students with any questions they may have on the curriculum. The Class sizes are roughly 20 people or 60+ if it is a science class. The students of Trinity are one of the nicest and warm welcoming students on any campus. Trinity is an excellent college if you are looking for a more cozy feeling campus.
Junior,5,"I love the community at this school, and all of the wonderful people that make it such a positive environment."
Niche User,5,Trinity Christian College is a great small Christian college. The admissions were very kind and welcoming. I felt very welcomed and connected to the college.
Sophomore,5,"Trinity has come to be a place that I call home almost instinctively and subconsciously now. Throughout my time at Trinity, the importance of Christ's Lordship over all of creation, in every discipline of learning, has been stressed greatly. This worldview is instilled in every classroom, playing field, and dorm hall at Trinity. Diversity of culture, background, and thought is emphasized and the intentionality that the school has to bring real-life issues to the forefront of discussion is evident. Trinity has not only been a place of personal growth in relationships for me, but also a training ground for what I will encounter in the world later on."
College Freshman,5,It is super safe. There are security guards around constantly.
College Freshman,5,Trinity's nursing program is great. They had a 100% pass rate on the NCLEX.
College Freshman,5,I love everything about Trinity. Being for away from home has been difficult but my friends have helped to make me feel at home and find my place at Trinity.
College Junior,5,We have no worries about sexual assaults happening on campus. We are a dry campus and have never felt threatened or felt insecure about safety.
College Junior,5,Great housing options for upper classmen. Residential life is handled very well.
College Junior,5,"It's a small Christian school where everybody knows each other no matter the grade level. We are a small community where we welcome anyone. What made me choose this school was the environment. I am a guest host, a tour guide, and have a job on campus as the Psychology student worker. I love this school!"
College Freshman,5,The courses offered are great for those trying to get into church work or academic study.  The professors are immensely involved in their area of study and you see their expertise come out during class.
College Freshman,5,For studying Bible or theology getting a job afterwards seems to be easier than other schools.  Many churches welcome prospects from this institution and from what I hear are eager to hire from Trinity.
College Freshman,5,I've had nothing but great experiences in terms of the courses and professors.  The quality of teaching is superb.  The professor to student ratio is enough to get face time with the professor.  All around I've been amazed at the course work and professors teaching these courses.
College Freshman,5,I feel safe and secure on campus.  As a Christian campus it seems to have less problems then would other universities and institutions.
College Freshman,5,"The grad program at Trinity for me has been a superb experience.  Studying Bible and theology is exactly what I want to do and Trinity offers that opportunity to me.  The faculty is what makes this such an enriching time.  They care about who we are, about our success, and about what we learn.  They are immensely invested in what they teach and it truly is a joy to take part in the school."
College Freshman,5,"See if you can talk to a financial aid counselor, I did and she helped me a lot with things I didn't even know I could get."
College Freshman,5,"Financial aid process went very smoothly, though a bit long. Sitting down and talking to your counselor about your financial aid options from the school and comparing it to another school you might attend as well and show how much you're short and all that would help in explaining how much you really need and let them know how much more they can give you."
College Freshman,5,"My admission counselor made time to skype me and make sure that I got a good grasp of what the school was really like, since I am unable to visit the school at all. They really go above and beyond in making sure you can attend the school and take care of all the financial aid process."
College Freshman,5,Very good sports facilities for athletes and non-athletes to utilize.
College Freshman,5,No one is into the whole drinking and smoking thing here which makes campus life safer. 
College Freshman,5,Everyone is nice and social acceptable. No one is stuck up or rude. 
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of different people from different ethnic backgrounds. 
College Freshman,5,There aren't any activities to be worried about since everyone takes care of everyone around them. So this is a very safe environment. 
Recent Alumnus,5,"it's a dry campus, honestly if i saw someone drunk i would applaud them."
College Sophomore,5,Trinity Christian College is a community of faith based and godly people.  The environment is welcoming as soon as you step foot on campus.  It's an easy place to call home.
College Freshman,5,"As far as I am aware, there is not a drug or alcohol problem at Trinity because it is strictly prohibited. There is no peer pressure to do so, and I know quite a few students on campus, none of whom drink or do drugs. This policy is very strictly enforced."
College Freshman,5,"At my school, anyone who is also a music major is more than passionate about the subject they are studying. The professors are more than willing to teach and give aide outside of class. Although there is not an abundance of students in this department, those who are in the department are extremely excited to be there. It's nice to know I'm going to school in a place where my subject is appreciated and revered."
College Freshman,5,"Lots of computers in Library to use.  TrinAir can sometimes be slow.  Paper for printer is comes with Student ID so no need for printer.  Personal computer is handy, but not by any means necessary."
College Junior,5,"Trinity is just outside of the city of Chicago. For this reason, we get all of the seasons out here, which really makes for great weather. The reason that it is so great, is because you get to see the seasons on the trees and buildings, which makes for a much better experience than just having one season."
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of dining options near school. They can be hard to get to if you don't have a car but many are within a decent biking distance. Most are pretty decent with the price, and a lot of them offer student discounts so that's great. My favourite is definitely Jullianni's right on the corner of Harlem just down the road."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe at Trinity Christian. There is campus security that rides around regularly, and the campus has pretty good lighting. The campus is not very big and it is a very tight knit community. I have never heard of any crimes committed on the campus in the three years that I have attended."
College Sophomore,5,There has never been a crime on campus. The most recent one I can think of was a book bag taken from the cafeteria but that's as bas as it gets.
College Sophomore,5,Trinity has a wonderful education program and the professors really know what they are teaching. The admissions process was very easy and the people in finacial aid were wonderful at helping through the whole loan process. The curriculum is challenging but not overbearing and useful for assesing skills and attaining knowlege of what the students already know.
College Sophomore,5,Trinity is very strict on drugs. There is no alcohol on campus and in fact i have NEVER even seen anyone smoke a cigarette on campus. From what I've heard most people go home for the weekend to party. Most people feel that it is a sin to partake in such activities and are involved in Christian activities at school.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a Special Education/Elementary Education Major. I am extremley satisfied with the education I am recieving from Trinity Christian College. The class sizes are very small so the professors have close professional relationships with each and everyone of their students. The resources are available for everyone from free tutoring, counseling,and writing workshops and there is always somebody available to help answer any questions you might have. They help with making professional teaching portfolios to take with on job interviews and also help to place you at a school for student teaching. Teachers are informative and up to date on their teaching techniques and have excellent credential for teaching others to be successful educators."
Recent Alumnus,5,Lots of Good Christian People – I made lots of good friends here.  We still keep in contact for the most part.
College Sophomore,5,It's Awesome Here – Trinity Christian College is the greatest place on earth. I love it here. You have to study here; it isn't all parties. I had a rough time before I came here.
College Senior,5,"Get It at Trinity! The computer labs were pretty nice before they started remodeling. Now they have not completed them just yet, but I can assure you once they do, they will be most satisfying with state of the art facilities and technology."
College Senior,5,"The Best of the Midwest – Palos Heights is a nice little town outside of the city of Chicago on the south side. The town has quite a bit to offer, a magnificent golf course on the west side, a downtown area with local businesses, bars, shops, restaraunts, etc. The great thing is that it is located right by the highway, so access to the city of Chicago is very convenient as well. If you can bear the winters here you'll really enjoy yourself because there's nothing like this area in the summer time."
Recent Alumnus,5,The admissions department takes good care of students!
College Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience with the financial aid department at Trinity Christian College.  They explained everything well, were very helpful and efficient, knowledgeable, patient and kind."
College Sophomore,5,"Trinity is an amazing school. All the staff members are friendly and reply to requests and questions within a very short amount of time. Students are all friendly and get along well. The teaching at Trinity is great and way better than other colleges I have attended. There are so many options to volunteer, participate in activities, and get to know your peers. I would never choose a different school if I had to do it all over again."
Sophomore,4,Professors and faculty were very supportive of online classes. The lectures were very thorough and lots of effort was put into them.
Sophomore,4,I really appreciated Trinity's smaller campus and class sizes. It creates a  very close-knit community between professors and students.
Sophomore,4,There is a sense of community. They do lack in diversity but are eager to fix the issue by offering opportunities for minority students. The campus is close to Chicago where Trinity has many connections.
Junior,4,"I like that it’s kind of a small community, and how we come together to support different events like sports, dance, gospel choir, etc."
Junior,4,Things started to run more smoothly after a while and I finished off on a really good note which means that they did a great job of changing things around to help benefit us.
Freshman,4,Being a freshman Trinity has been one of my best decisions. The community is welcoming and wants to get you involved in many ways. Friendships are genuine and easy to develop. The faculty and staff are very supportive of cheering on their students to succeed. The whole Trinity community comes together to be there for each other no matter what and treats distance as no obstacle even when it's nonnegotiable such as the pandemic of 2020.
Freshman,4,I think that it is a very nice campus. It is small enough to easily find your way around and be acquainted with many people and become close with professors. Trinity is filled with many smiling faces and helpful voices. This community is definitely very safe and welcoming.
Freshman,4,"I love this school. Only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it can get a little boring sometimes on the weekends and the food is not the best food I have every had (typical cafe food, not bad, but not amazing). The academics are amazing, the staff is so awesome and helpful, and the campus is beautiful and safe."
Junior,4,"They have a great adult program to continue with school. the admiration is always on point, they are always calling and making sure that we have everything we need."
Junior,4,"Trinity Christian college is a very inclusive place, where students develop relationships with professors and other students. It has something interesting to do every weekend, be it a movie, a play, or something else. The culture is different from anywhere else I've been."
Sophomore,4,I really like the professors! I love how in some classes professors pray before they start teaching; I really respect that.
Senior,4,Trinity Christian College has offered me the support that I need to become a great educator in the future. It also has allowed to make connections to my relationship with God on campus and off campus. It's truly been a blessing to come to school here.
Junior,4,"One thing that I would like to see change is the campus food. Some days, especially on visit days, food is great. Some days, there is nothing that's appetizing."
Sophomore,4,Truly depends on each person and their personal experiences. What you get out of it is reflected by the effort you put forth.
Junior,4,"Ever since my Freshman year, I have found this college to be a 'home away from home'. Located in Palos Heights, it a nice quiet location for those who desire to be away from the bustling and noise from the city. I have found a sense of peace and enjoyment by its location alone! The staff and professors are helpful and offer students both good advice as well as certain student resources that can be utilized at anytime. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this a 5-star rating is that the food quality. It is not terrible, rather it is acceptable but there is room for improvement. That aside, should anyone wish to start off their college studies on campus, I would recommend this college for them."
Freshman,4,I love going to Trinity. Everyone is so friendly and is willing to get to know you. The professors want you to succeed and will help in many ways. There are so many resources for help. Its a really good college. I love it!
Sophomore,4,"Everyone of the Professors here are really helpful, as well as being one with Christ. They're always coming up with interesting events, and the numerous amounts of clubs to participate in."
College Freshman,4,Drugs and alcohol are not very prevalent and peers encourage each other to find good clean fun.
College Freshman,4,"Our sport teams are not the best but they are still good. They may not win all the time, but we cheer them on, and have lots of fun at both of intramural and varsity sports."
College Freshman,4,"I have loved Trinity, and the community of Trinity. It is very unique in that everyone is very caring about each other. The teachers care for the students and about there well being. I love the community life and the activities that are around the campus. Trinity is unique in that we are the Trolls."
College Sophomore,4,I wish that there was more of a campus life.
College Junior,4,I love living on campus the housing is uptodate with allfeatures. One building even has apartment style living with a full kitchen
College Junior,4,"I like going here and hope to use my new-found knowledge for my job after school.

I like the Troll mascot and the community has always been the selling point of this school for me.

I have made many life-long friends and love my teachers."
College Junior,4,"The women's soccer program is one of the best on campus. Junior varsity programs are not really seen as important, unfortunately."
College Freshman,4,The support is great. The web site always features our games wether we win or loose.
College Freshman,4,I am a student athlete. Soccer is my sport and I love my team mates and my coach. School is pretty ok to. I like the small campus
College Junior,4,"The education is quality, and it's about as diverse of a school as it's going to get. Still a lot of Dutch people, though, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
College Freshman,4,This school was perfect for my major.
College Freshman,4,Trinity is right by Chicago and it is surrounded by several towns that have a lot of things to do.
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Trinity. I feel like there's a wide variety of majors, but some were taken away due to budget cuts."
College Sophomore,4,"Our team spirit is great. Everyone is familiar with when teams are playing and a lot of trolls try to cheer their players on. While not everyone goes, the news of how the games go spreads quickly with a weekly email sent to all students. Therefore, every student is in the loop."
College Sophomore,4,"Basically, as long as you obey the rules that are given, the security guards are one of the friendliest people you'll ever meet for some of them are your classmates. However, if those rules aren't upheld then you have another story. I would look for a review of someone who has a car and deals with parking on this one for I don't have a car."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally love it. The campus is well laid out and the professors are all enjoyable. The one thing that is unique about the program is that it is a Liberal Arts college. Therefore, our Gen. Ed. requirements include courses from all disciplines, not just the ones that you need for your major. This allows for your education to be well rounded."
College Sophomore,4,"For admission, my advice is talking about other schools that you've either applied to or have been accepted to. If you've been accepted elsewhere, you'll get accepted there too. The process isn't out of the ordinary. If anything, it's filling out the application, providing a transcript and that's it. If you're auditioning for Concert choir or Honor's Ensemble, Do your audition in person unless the director tells you specifically it needs to be recorded. It allows for the Director to put a name to your face and get to know you better."
College Sophomore,4,"The main thing that sets Trinity apart from other colleges, other than its mascot, is the strong sense of community. Here, not only are we friends, we're family. Of course, having a Troll as our mascot instead of an Eagle also sets us apart. He contributes to the Troll Bridge legend on Campus. Overall, we have a great respect for each other and our faculty cares about each student individually."
College Sophomore,4,"I always feel safe on campus. The guards are seen, but they are friendly. They enforce but they also are nice to talk with as you walk by."
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school. It is in a relatively safe neighborhood and there is plenty to do. While there is a lot of activity on campus, there is also a lot that can be done off campus including going into Downtown Chicago via the nearby train station."
College Junior,4,The mass of possible majors here is very convenient. Professors do their best to work out your schedule to fit you and your interests. 
College Junior,4,The academic experience you get here is really good. The professors care about you and your grades and will do anything to help you. They work with you to find an internship and/job.
College Junior,4,"There are three types of people on this campus. 1) Student Athletes  2) Artistic students 3) average students. You can usually tell by the apparel that the student is wearing. 
The ratio of girls to guys here is 3 to 1 respectively.
As a typical small liberal arts college everyone seems to get engaged or married either junior or senior year"
College Freshman,4,Not the best but also not the worst. 
College Freshman,4,It's a very cheerful environment to be around. Everyone encourages each other with everything they do whether we need help with something or need to get to a certain place by a time. 
College Freshman,4,"There has not been a moment on campus where I have felt unsafe. The campus is small, but there is always security driving around, and there are places all around campus where you can reach the security in case of emergencies. The people here are very friendly, and normally everyone is welcoming by leaving their doors open, and there has not been a problem with theft."
College Senior,4,"There isn't much to do around Trinity, but it is in a great area and it is very close to Chicago."
College Senior,4,There are enough restaurants close enough to Trinity that students have options. However there aren't really options within walking distance for students without cars.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great place, small, quiet, people are cool, but in terms of meals its quite limited."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of open field on campus so regardless of the weather the campus always looks beautiful.
College Sophomore,4,There is always student activities on campus.  The weekends are always full of fun things to do on and off of campus.
College Sophomore,4,The students are all very caring and deeply devoted into their faith.  They make you feel as if they're family and have known you for a life time.
College Freshman,4,"I had to go through an audition to be enrolled in the concert choir, but besides that I had no complications getting into my field. Since I was accepted into Trinity, I was accepted into any course they offered."
College Freshman,4,"The full time professors at Trinity offer a more fulfilling and interesting course than the part time professors do, in my opinion. They have dedicated their entire schedule towards educating students, therefore prove to have more passion about their topic than coming to teach for an hour a day. The courses at Trinity are excellently planned and carried out. Registration is confusing to new students who are not entirely persuaded towards taking up college education but for those who know exactly what they want, registration is a simple process in gaining a degree. The teachers at Trinity give out quite a large workload as far as homework goes, and the work can be overbearing at times."
College Freshman,4,"There are a variety of restaurants nearby to Trinity. None of these are in close proximity to the school as far as walking goes, being at least a mile away. But the restaurants nearby school range from McDonalds to Applebees to the local steakhouse. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, but if a student wants to go to a restaurant they will need a ride in a vehicle unless he/she is willing to walk a few miles."
College Sophomore,4,"Currently I am not in the Nursing Program but the outlook is quite good because of the positive feedback I keep on hearing from the other students. However, I have applied to the Nursing Program and just waiting for a response. With all the fundamental concepts that Trinity has to offer will aid me in the work force, essenitaly, I want to learn to be a compassionate nurse that really cares for her patients. Initially, I want to be a person who loves going to work because they want to, not because they need to. The steps I will take to achieve this dream are to study and learn all the concepts of nursing, take my time and really try my best, keep myself on my toes and pay attention at all times, also listen to my mentors for any pointers or advice they have to offer. I honestly dont have any concerns, right now I am a phlebotomist and I know with the right set of skills and tools I can achieve my dream. In the near future I would like to graduate with a nursing degree and further pursue it in the anesthesiology branch of nursing"
College Freshman,4,"It is just like any other college. A place where you find your best friends for life. Everyone is different and friendly so it's not hard to fit in. You will find many people with the same interests, and it won't be to hard to really click here."
College Freshman,4,"One of my favorite characteristics about Trinity is its location! It is located in the suburbs of Chicago, about 40 minutes away from the big city. The resident halls and campus have a homey feel, but with a quick ride on the metra or cta the world is at the students' fingertips. I also enjoy Trinity's cross cultural programs. I look forward to possibly spending an interim in another country and working toward an internship in downtown Chicago."
College Freshman,4,The computers at Trinity Christian College are generally very accessible and reliable. When midterms and finals roll around the computers in the library get a little crowded. The network is usually very stable and accessible to the campus computers and student laptops. I would recommend students to have their own laptops because the Trinity's Wifi reaches over all campus.
College Freshman,4,"Academics at Trinity are great.  The school can be challenging, but the overwhelming support of caring professors and peers makes it easier!"
College Freshman,4,"The security does a great job and safety is never an issue. Also, safety and security is always enforced with the security's phone number everywhere and buttons all over campus that signal for help."
College Freshman,4,"The connectedness among the students is one I have never experienced in a scholarly environment. Even the relationships with the professors is something I did not expect but am very grateful for, especially with how this could impact my future."
College Freshman,4,"The Trinity environment is somewhat old-fashioned, but the activities they offer, like dances and just hanging out at the cafe or in dorms,  make student life fun. Also, it is noticeable that Trinity is making an effort to modernize the campus."
Niche User,2,"The campus is beautiful, small and cozy, the food is delicious, and there are various sports, clubs, and degrees to choose from. However, if you are a minority this may not be the school for you. It is predominantly white so if you are a shy or introverted minority you will be overshadowed and left out. And in my experience, if you receive a scholarship from them your chances of financial aid eligibity decrease. A friend of mine with average grades ended up paying 400 a month to go while I (straight A student) would have had to pay 700 a month. I went to the Freshman experience event and stayed a little while on campus before transferring. The environment for me was too unwelcoming. Please be considerate of your ethnicity and personal culture before going here!!!!"
College Freshman,2,"I don't like that they only have one place abroad, and not that many majors. I also do not like how teachers see that I am the only Black student and class and that no one wants to work with me but doesn't say anything. They do not understand how uncomfortable that is for me and how much I have wanted to transfer to a more diverse school."
College Freshman,2,Not many people attend games
College Freshman,2,"There is good clean fun, but on campus not much alcohol parties on campus."
College Junior,2,Our specific wifi can be a little slow sometimes but its typically no too bad that you cant get things done.
College Junior,2,We have public transportation but from what Ive heard you have to call it and set up times. And sometimes where you need to go is out of there jurisdiction. Its easier to just find a friends car or bike.
College Sophomore,2,"Transportation at Trinity is ok, you can call for a taxi or bus.  You can also ask people for rides if you need to. If there is a big event at Trinity or you are volunteering to do something Trinity has buses and vans for that."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not live on campus, but I have heard it is not that bad.  The rooms are huge, but I heard some dorms are nicer because of the age of the buildings.  The dorms are very close to the classrooms and library.  All dorms have their own shower, the cost is not bad."
College Sophomore,2,When the school's team is playing usually the people playing the sport and their friends are dressed up.  As a whole most of the college doesn't dress in team colors.
College Freshman,2,Lots of rules.  You'll be ticketed if you don't know them.  Not enough places to park.
College Freshman,2,"At Trinity Christian College there is limited transportation. There is a call-a-ride Pace bus that only cost one dollar per destination, but it only services the Palos Heights area. This can be pretty frustrating since there is a Walmart 15 minutes away but it is in Crestwood and they won't go there. Buses are not very close. You have to have a ride to the bus stop and they don't run very late. Having a car on campus is your best option here at Trinity. Either you have a car on campus, catch a ride with a friend who has a car, or call a taxi."
College Sophomore,2,"You need a car in order to get here from the city. Even when using the suburban transportation, you still need to walk at least a mile."
College Student,2,"Get There Early or Walk Far – The parking a Trinity can trouble at times. Student have designated parking lots that they can stay in overnight. These are the Chapel lot, Cafe lot, and the Gym lot. All of them are the farthest away from the dorms. The seniors get a designated parking lot in the front of the school, and everyone is to fend for themselves after that. My friends and I have countless time failed to get a spot in either the Chapel or the Cafe lot and was forced go to the gym lot, which is the farthest from everything. Parking at Trinity is on a get there or walk really far basis."
College Sophomore,2,"Good Luck – Trinity is exactly like a junior college unless you are in the teaching or nursing program (if you get accepted into nursing). you will transfer out at the end of your first semester if not your second, FAFSA says 37% transfer out and only two people I know transferred in, and are leaving soon. Trinity tries to hard to include minorities (gave all the minorities who applied for an RA job, there were only four out of 30 new applicants, the three got in). finding a job on campus is pretty easy, visiting hours are horrible, everyone there is white CRC but very nice and every one in your class will know our name by the end of the first month. i loved the people and the teachers but academically Trinity doesn't have much. trinity has special invites for minorities trying to get them to go to college, they sleep in our dorms and steal our stuff and are very disrespectful, I gave a tour and the entire time a teacher was swearing at the kids."
College Sophomore,2,"professors on campus are really friendly and for the most part understanding. in class you will see that you teachers love what they are doing, the downfall is that christian reform beliefs are pounded into you and everything that is taught there. all core classes are very vague and the teachers are not allowed to say their opinion even if the are not christian reformed, even in the upper levels."
College Junior,2,"Trinity is mostly a Dutch School, but there are several different cultures found on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Variety of Off Campus Items – There is a limited variety of food choices off-campus.  If students wish to have more options, they must drive 5-10 minutes-which makes a huge difference when you have a heavy class load.  More options would be great!"
College Sophomore,2,"The parking on campus is alright, as long as you get to campus early. If you are later in the day, you may have to park very far from the classroom buildings. In addition they have a great deal of staff parking which is closer, but off limits to students. They need to have some parking closer to the dorms for students."
College Junior,2,"Computers are really necessary for the students, especially for those who do not own or can afford computers. We have computers in our dorm rooms but barely any of them work. I do not understand why the school cannot take care of something that important to students. They spend so much money on improving signs around campus when those signs are not even necessary to change. They even just decided to pay students to be representatives this year without asking the whole student body. Our tuition will increase unnecessarily without our consent. However, for changing the computers and providing better hours for the computer lab, they spend no money on that to improve it. It is completely unfair to the students who are not financially stable."
College Freshman,2,"Trinity Dining Services – I guess it's decent for a small college. There are two venues with limited hours. The second venue is open a lot, but only accepts meal swipes for a two-hour time slot at dinner. The cafeteria is mainly open an hour at a time. There are a few choices, but it's limited. Access to nutritional information is hard to get. If you want food after 11, you're limited to vending machines or snack bars in dorm lobbies that are open until 1 am. The cafeteria doesn't have any lite salad dressings or lite mayo and typically has only two entree choices, plus a deli bar, salad bar, a few side options, cereal, bagels, and desserts. All but one meal plan is designed that you use or lose your meals each week, no refunds or roll overs. Most meals are an hour-slot long, so you if have work or something you've just wasted that money. The block meal plan rolls over meals from week to week, but no refunds at the end of the year and its very hard if not impossible to come close to eating 225 meals in 15 weeks when only 18 meals a week are served. My recomendation is to get the 8 meal plan, and put extra flex dollars on your ID card at a 10% bonus. This can be used to purchase any food items anytime the BBC is open, about 15 hours most days. They roll over at the semester, but not the year. However, these are much easier to use up. This system minimizes the money you waste, and covers most of your meals. The meal plan charges a rate of nearly $12 per meal, and for this rate I can buy some food at the grocery store rather than buy meals that I'll never eat."
Senior,1,"I transferred to trinity in the fall of 2017 for volleyball. Their athletic programs are a joke and are treated like second class citizens. The academics are nothing special. And worst of all, I was choked by my own roommate and nothing was done to punish him. He still goes to that school today. Think twice before you send your son or daughter here."
Sophomore,1,Predominately white rich kids who are very cliquey. It is hard to make friends because most students already have their clique. If you are a commuter it is even worse.
College Freshman,1,"There has been progress on campus but this campus still is Predominately White. This past April and Asian Student was told she did not look like her name by a security guard and told racial stereotypes. People are always on Yik Yak saying racist things about Black students saying, ""they're too loud,"" and ""black lives don't matter,"". Last year girls wrote to me saying that when I talk about Black women it offends them. No one wants to work with me in class or they look at me as if I am beneath them and my professors see it yet they don't say anything. I have had multiple encounters with racist security officers. No one really wants to talk to you. When we have meetings about diversity not that many people show up. I can say that more and more people are showing up and things are reaching a better point and it takes time, but I do not think my experience as a minority will ever be what I want it to be. It might be better for the future minorities but I don't see any drastic changes for me. Also, a girl who is white that does hang out with Black people was called ""ghetto"" because she is always with us."
College Freshman,1,They treat us like 12 yr olds
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is not always a breeze. If you get there around eight am then you will be able to get a spot but if you get there past ten, it will be very difficult since there is limited parking. The cost of parking permits are way too expensive considering that if you purchase one, you are not guaranteed a parking spot. If you do not purchase a parking permit, then you are at risk for recieving a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,"visiting hours 5-12 week, monday=gay day, 3-1 on weekends. good luck getting away with parking, drinking, partying, playing music loud, having lots of fun, or trying to do anything in the gym. no flexibility anywhere. you can get away with these things people do it all the time, but its hard and strict."
College Sophomore,1,start one – you get a greek group for fyf but everyone hates fyf. it would be pretty sweet to start one.
College Sophomore,1,"unless you know someone who lives off campus with an apartment, the softball girls, or the track house you wont have much of a party, you better have some really good friends and be really quiet if you want to drink on campus. there is a 50-50 you will get cought. everyone goes bowling thursdays, thats about it socially."
College Sophomore,1,"dutch women – after talking with some international students they said ""it is like the dutch women go there to distract the men and party and get married."" there were a few that i know that totally fit that demographic and they are really nice wonderful people. with 40% of Trinity being from Chicago Christian high the amount of really nice attractive women you can count on one hand. everyone else is nice but unattractive and total air heads who you cant have a real conversation with. if you like talking about how much sleep you get and how much classes suck then these are the girls for you."
College Sophomore,1,"Good Luck Trying to Get Help – in our dorm in Tibstra, the eathernet cables weren't even connected. yes they had the outlet and the plug but we unscrewed it to see what the problem was and there were no wires going to anything. don't bother putting in work orders, you have to find a janitor and ask him personally."
College Sophomore,1,Not Popular – It's a strict school so there aren't any drinking or peer pressure to do drugs.
College Sophomore,1,Lots of White Students – Most people here are white. There isn't that much a diversity mostly white.
Recent Alumnus,1," Hell No, There no Diversity  here. Mostly Guys and Girls with Blonde hair and blue eyes. Don't believe what you hear from friends or Admission Couselor , there no diversity. Barely any Black, Asian, International student. If you aren't White , you are not going to fit in. You have to find your own group friends. Trust me, it the Truth. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"Off Caumpus Dining – It Healthy , taste better,  if you know where to go. Way better then eating on campus."
College Junior,1,"Gym Sucks. We have a place to work out but it's too small. The equipments are old and we barely get any time to work out. The times the gym/work out room are not flexible and not enough for the students. There are so many students and the gym/work out room is too small to fit all those who want to work out. Sometimes I just can't work out because it's too crowded or when I can, it's closed."
College Freshman,1,"Trinity basically doesn't have Greek Life. There are a couple of clubs with Greek sounding names, but don't operate like traditional fraternities, they are co ed, anyone can join, no rushing, and no housing provided.
There is a floor in Alumni called Koninia(Greek for fellowship), where they strive to be a community. Anyone who asks can live there, and anyone is welcome to attend their activities. 
There has been talk about offering Greek Life, but there are a few major obstacles. Trinity is a very small college, making this difficult. The college doesn't want to promote or condone rushing, hazing, drinking, etc. The college isn't really in favor of Greek housing. Personally, I don't foresee Trinity having Greek life in the next few years. So although Trinity is an awesome college and I love it; don't come here if you really want to be Greek."
College Freshman,1,"I really don't know a ton about this; Trinity requires you to either live with your parents or in the dorms until you're 22 or senior. There are apartments a mile away from campus that are convenient. You do basically need a car to get to campus though. There's a bus stop very close by that can get you into Chicago. There are both single and double apartments. They're owned by the college, so you can use your financial aid or loans to pay for it, and utilities are included. There are also RA's and planned activities, but not to the same extent as the dorms. 
The campus is situated in a neighborhood of middle class to upper class houses. There are some homeowners that will rent out their basements to students at very reasonable prices. You can check student listings to find other housing options and roommates.
But the majority of people live in the dorms, or with their parents, some in the college owned apartments, few seek other options."

Alum,5,"I was a student at Jefferson College of Health Sciences for 4 years, receiving my Associate of Applied Sciences Degree with a focus in Occupational Therapy. I have been a COTA/L for 10+ years and I am so happy with my decision to pursue a degree from Jefferson. The instructors very very knowledgeable, they offered the one-on-one assistance that we individually needed, along with assistance for group study. I felt comfortable with my instructors and felt at ease in my classes, with detailed instruction and opportunities to excel along the way. My career is one that I am very happy with and I still keep in contact with my instructors as I now take students from this College and they send their students to the facility I am employed with to progress their student's knowledge."
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my experience. The professors have been really helpful.  You can really tell they just want every student to succeed in whatever they are doing.  I have struggled myself with understanding things but they professors have been very helpful with helping me understand.  There are also plenty of other options for help if you need it.  They have students there you can go to for tutoring if needed.  Overall my experience at Jefferson has been very good.

Senior,5,"Jefferson College of Health Sciences is a great private college to attend. The faculty and staff are very pleasant, and being a smaller institute, can accommodate every student and provide one-on-one instruction with ease. They also offer amazing opportunities to get valuable clinical experience at the nearby hospitals."
Sophomore,5,"The college campus and class sizes are small, which is nice to get to know your professor and fellow students. The academics are rigorous, but if you put forth the effort you will be fine."
Junior,5,"My experience at JCHS has been great!  The Respiratory Therapy program is outstanding.  It provides not only excellent academic instruction but provides opportunities to experience practical clinical opportunities in the hospital.
The faculty and administration is very supportive.  The College wants you to succeed and exceed and they do everything they can to ensure that happens."
Niche User,5,Jefferson Science Of Health Sciences is a great institution to visit! Everyone is close-knit and helpful. The instructors are there to help you every step of the way to make sure you pass. The campus living is great at the Patrick Henry Hotel also-(Very nice).
Junior,5,It was great experience and a lot of different variety of major and minor. It was nervous at first going to new college but the kind peoples at Jefferson College of Health Science may me very welcome and become  more interested in the medical field then before.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy that it's a small, private college. The class room size makes it much easier to learn and the professors are always eager to help. It's in a safe location and actively involved in the community. Being located in a hospital provides a number of learning benefits and provides us the opportunity to apply our knowledge."

Junior,5,JCHS helps their students achieve and work towards meeting goals. There is a close-knit community and the college is in a great area.
College Junior,5,If you graduate from Jefferson you are basically guaranteed a job at a Carilion facility before the end of your last semester.
College Junior,5,"If you are looking for a college that will guarantee a job before graduation this is the place. Since it is owned by Carilion Hospitals, who owns many medical buildings in the area, Jefferson is basically a training ground for their future employees. Your clinicals are in Carilion facilities so you will be able to work in what will most likely be your future job environment."

Freshman,4,"It's a quiet and focused setting, but very easy to find others with similar interests because they're all looking to be in the medical feild."
Freshman,4,"Jefferson College has a great faculty! Most of the professors are available if you need to seek additional help with a class. There are a variety of resources available to help us as students get through classes; for example, we have a learning and writing center which helps students review their paper and give input on their writing, or help with the use of APA format. Students are very personable and the student to teacher ratio is marvelous. I love small classes whereas at different colleges the student to teacher ration is for say 1:400."
Freshman,4,Jefferson college is very student based. Their goal is to help you succeed unlike how high school teachers make college seem to be. The professor do no make test purposely to fail you but instead they purposely aim their questions to help you achieve better thinking skills. I love it here.
Freshman,4,"Jefferson College of Health Sciences has a very small, tight-knit community. Some people may not like this factor, but I feel as if the professors are able to provide more attention to individual students because of it. The professors work diligently to ensure the success of each student. I feel that I will be more than prepared to enter my field upon graduating."
College Junior,4,"Most of the Health Sciences courses are online only, but that doesn't take away from the education. Typically it's one or two assignments a week and two major projects per semester. Sometimes a class requires set times and dates to do class ""Skype calls"" of sorts using a program many students have trouble with through the blackboard site. They should seriously just use Skype instead of their current program."
College Junior,4,100% pass rate in the Surg Tech program. Uses mock labs on campus with hands on learning. Health Sciences programs as well as Surg Tech features professors that are experts in their fields.
College Junior,4,"Main focus is nursing, but other programs are better."
College Junior,4,"Transferring classes was extremely easy. Class convenience is okay. Junior year is a set schedule and then senior year the days of the week switch, but remain constant throughout the year."
College Junior,4,Class sizes are very small which makes the teacher to student ratio very appropriate. You actually get to know your professors and they get to know you.
College Junior,4,"The program is very hard, but that is due to the material. However, one instructor is incredibly difficult with grading and assignments that they require."
College Junior,4,Teachers are very knowledgeable. Staff at the school are very eager to assist in any way!
College Junior,4,It'll help me get a job
College Freshman,4,When I first started at Jefferson I was able to transfer both my English 111 and 112 from the community college at my home town. Other students have done the same and advise doing so due to the clinical aspect of the different programs. I have been able to schedule my classes around my clinical days very easily and have had guidance from my academic advisor. I strongly recommend talking with an academic advisor frequently to help the process of classes and grades go smoothly.
College Freshman,4,"Jefferson is a college for individuals who are looking at becoming medical professionals. Most of the classes that a student will take will depend on their major. Their are also a few classes that are general education classes such as freshman seminar, anatomy and physiology, and English that most students will have together."
College Freshman,4,I am currently in the Emergency Services program at Jefferson. It is a mostly hands on program which challenges the students skills and knowledge in emergency medicine.
College Freshman,4,Jefferson College of Health Sciences is a school that is designed to put it's students in the medical field right after graduation. The teachers help and work with the students to the best of their ability and they teach and help the students strive to achieve their goals. They also have a good work study system and a great staff that are always willing to help. Jefferson is a great college for individuals who are looking to enter the medical field.
College Senior,4,"It is the best nursing program in the Roanoke Valley. When you graduate for here you feel like you a prepared to be a great nurse, but also know that you still have a lot to learn."
College Senior,4,"Has a great library. I go there a lot to study in peace and quite. Sometimes with a friend, sometimes just by myself."
College Senior,4,They push you hard and in return you walk out as a great nurse.
College Senior,4,"I would go there again. They push you hard and demand a lot. If your nurse had your life in his/her hand, would you want the best or a so-so? I think at Jefferson, I will be the best nurse!"
College Senior,4,They have jobs lined up for me after I graduate as a B.S.N. I am currently working on a floor in the hospital that I hope will be my full time job after I graduate.
College Senior,4,many different types of people
College Senior,4,all my community college credits transferred except 1
College Sophomore,4,A very career oriented school which is exactly what I am looking for!
College Sophomore,4,"While I haven't had any direct experience with this, I have heard great things about post grad services from former students."
College Sophomore,4,The staff has been very helpful with my many questions about attending the university from financial aid to class registration it has been a great experience so far.
College Senior,4,Masters and Doctoral programs available in my field.
College Senior,4,"If you are interested in Health Science specific majors, JCHS is great. You are in an environment where students are studying around the same rigor of courses and interprofessional collaboration is common."
College Senior,4,"The main reason I chose this school was because I heard so much about it and I was already taking online classes.  I was getting to the point of wanting to have in class professor time.  So I transferred to this school where they took all my credits except a couple classes.  I haven't had a problem since I have been their with any classes.  I had a problem with financial aid, but they were very nice and worked my problem out with me.  I have mostly online classes again,  but, my drawback is having to drive an hour to get to school for classes so I do work study to make friends and get help with other classes when needed."
College Junior,4,They have been very helpful so far.  They stay in touch to get everything that need.
College Junior,4,I have had alot of job opportunities while in school. Being able to learn hands on with what program I am enrolled in.
College Junior,4,"The school's facilities aren't bad. We are able to do all of our students right in the hospital which gives you amazing experience. Also, having the student center to go to during class breaks."
College Junior,4,The schools resources are great. I can use the wireless with my own computer with no problem.
College Junior,4,"My school has been very helpful and quick with getting back to me, when I have important questions that needed to answered. They all seem very educated on the career field that students are getting in to and learning."
College Sophomore,4,"Job prospects are extremely high. Personally I have not graduated as of yet. However, based on other anecdotal evidence, the reviews for the alumni network were not very good."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of online courses are great, others not so much.  Some of them are very worthless.  Even the worthless ones are pretty easy though.  You can look up stuff for quizzes and tests and get good grades.  Things are due at a distace so there is a lot of time to get the assignment done."
College Sophomore,4,I love being there with all the people who are in love with the health field and want to do that with their life.  Most of the people there are very friendly and love to help out others with school work.
College Sophomore,4,"They are very good at giving scholarships to students, especially if the student has good grades."
College Junior,4,Student body is very helpful. My first day of school was hard but there were various students that helped me find my way.
College Freshman,4,"The school has the learning and writing center, which provides help with writing papers and learning APA format. They also provide a computer lab that stays open all the time. In the computer labs, you can print off anything you want as long as you provide the paper, they provide the ink. Their network is also very fast."
College Senior,2,There were no mention of internal scholarships that were offered at the school. It was all done with government loans.
College Freshman,2,I feel as though the school is very expensive. I have no other schools to compare it with so I am not sure. I think they need to reconsider how much students need to pay becuase I work full time and I am still scraping up change at the beginning of every month to pay my school bill.
College Freshman,2,"The tuition is way to expensive. I do not think it is worth the price. I have never spoke with the financial aid office because I recently found out who my financial aid counselor is. My only tip is to actually hand the office your financial aid stuff in person. A lot of my stuff got lost. Also, apply for every scholarship you can."
College Freshman,2,"Since Jefferson is a private college, you really do not get the actual college experience. They do have different sports clubs, but there is no actual team that plays other colleges. The good thing about the location of Jefferson is that it is near downtown Roanoke, and there are a bunch of places to go downtown."
College Freshman,2,"The college has very little diversity to it, its mostly white students that come from middle to higher income families. Do get me wrong there are other ethnicies but not very many."
Niche User,1,"The school really really sucks and it’s nothing at all like a four year public or private liberal arts college.  I really don’t know anyone who has ever been to this school, who graduated, or ever got a job immediately.  The whole staff, instructors, administrators, etc. were very very rude to me which is why I left. I transferred back to a four year liberal arts college and earned my associates and bachelor’s degree from this college. I’m proud of my accomplishments and I never should’ve considered going to this school in the first place.  Jefferson College of Hell and Violence is what it should be called."
Niche User,1,Not at all a good school and the school really sucks. Classes are very very small and I only do well in a big class of at least 80 students or more.
College Junior,1,"Summer Classes Not Offered – Many large universities offer a variety of summer classes to students that may want (or need) to get ahead to ease the workload in the fall or spring semesters. Though several general education classes are offered, my school does not allow us the option of taking summer classes in my field of study."

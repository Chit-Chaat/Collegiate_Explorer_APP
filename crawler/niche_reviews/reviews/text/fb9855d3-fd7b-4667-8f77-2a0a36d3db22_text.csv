The professors were very involved in learning, quick to help, and easy to reach in case of confusion. 

As far as the courses go - each are well taught and thoroughly planned. The use of Blackboard, as a space for digital learning, makes assignments easy to organize, complete and submit. The use of Proctorio for tests is very convenient also."

Sophomore,5,I play on the men's lacrosse team at the college. Student life is fun and the party scene is fun when you hang out with the teams that tend to win unlike the school's football team.

Freshman,5,I love everything about my upcoming college! All the people are so welcoming and the campus is beautiful!

Niche User,5,Limestone is a smaller campus in a very family oriented community.  It felt like home as soon as I walked on campus
Sophomore,5,"Limestone has a good athlete-professor relationship, professors are very understanding of athletes and if they need to miss a class and make-up whatever may be missed."

Sophomore,5,"My Experience at Limestone College has been great!
Academics and student life is awesome.
Really good school to attend."
Senior,5,"Limestone College is a private college and has history on its campus. I enjoy the atmosphere on campus. Going to Limestone College, you will feel that you are there to fulfill a purpose or goal. The professors are very helpful and wants their students to succeed. The only thing I probably would change is if Greek life were present. Other than that, I wouldn't change anything. I am a senior, majoring in Healthcare Administration, Bachelor's Degree."
Sophomore,5,"My college experience at limestone was very wonderful. The staff and students are all very friendly. everyone goes out there way to help you. The plus side is that on certain weekend we got to go to the movies , bowling alley, etc for free because they paid for all the students. I look forward to my last 3 years at limestone."
Junior,5,Limestone College has been wonderful for me.  I am a non-traditional student and am taking all my classes on-line.  The class instructions are easy to understand the the instructors are very helpful.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I have found all the staff to be extremely nice and very good at their individual jobs.  I would not make any changes at Limestone College.
Freshman,5,I will be a freshman football player for the Limestone Saints.  This is the place I belong.  I felt at home here as soon as I stepped on campus.
College Senior,5,I came to Limestone to play softball. The coaches are great and the returning players go the extra mile to help out freshman players. The fan and school support is overwhelming! The stands are usually packed with students and parents.
College Senior,5,I have just started my classes here at Limestone college and what I have seen so far is that this college is everything and more. This is why Limestone College was my first choice of colleges
College Junior,5,"I went to another school before limestone and hated it, here I have made great friends and joined a club plus my professors and the rest of the staff really care about us here."
College Sophomore,5,"My professors have been very accommodating and very helpful. They will email you back within a few others of you emailing them, as well as some will even give the students their cell number, just in case they did not understand something or had questions that needed answered right away. They have reasonable office hours and will set up times or allow you to walk in if you need extra help."
College Sophomore,5,"There are little to no sexual assaults at the school I am attending. If there are any, the campus does not know about it and that helps keep both of the peoples identity safe so no one on campus can judge them."
College Sophomore,5,I can come straight out of school being able to work as an Athletic Trainer as long as I pass my BOC. I plan to go on to graduate school for physical therapy after graduation
College Junior,5,I love the involvement and care my professors have in finding me the perfect place to intern.
College Junior,5,I have the same 4 professors for all my SW classes. I love the relationship I have with them.
College Junior,5,I do not live on campus so I can not talk about my experience with this.
College Junior,5,I love my professors and how close knit the students are
College Freshman,5,"Due to Limestone being a popular sports college, we have A LOT of foreign students. Foreign meaning out of country, not from America. They fit in easily. No one cares about your sexuality, it's college for crying out loud. We are all adults now, this is not high school. No one troubles you if you are highly religious or whatever the case may be. I do not see a lot of Asian/Vietnamese/Chinese people. They could just be so laid back that I do not notice. Otherwise, every race and color is present at Limestone and they are all equally accepted."
College Freshman,5,Classes are small and I enjoy that. Professors learn your face first and then your name. Professors try to involve students rather than just stand and lecture all class. Class time is used wisely. Professor office hours are encouraged to use to your advantage.
College Freshman,5,I love this school. It is extremely welcoming and everyone is so friendly. The environment is safe. There's always something to do for all students there.
College Junior,5,No better or worse than any other school
College Freshman,5,It is a nice small town and we can always go to the outlets to shop!
College Freshman,5,The school is all about the athletics!

College Freshman,5,I like the classes that are offered here!
College Freshman,5,I am really happy here!

College Senior,5,"I give limestone an A+ because they have plenty attractions. such as shopping outlets and family outings, and different restaurants. I feel safe at the school. Have different sport you can join and succeed in."
College Junior,5,they clean the  place everyday but not on the weekends
College Sophomore,5,"The workload is totally managable even with a full credit hour schedule. The professors are wonderful at the school most of our professors obtain a Doctoral Degree and if not its at least a Master's Degree, making them very wise in their feild. Limestone offers a math and writting Lab to help students who make need help revising their papers or need and extra hand to help them succeed at understanding the material more by breaking it down step by step."
College Sophomore,5,The education is great. I am a Criminal Justice Major at Limestone College and at this stage of my college career I am getting into my core classes and I have found the material to still be pretty managable yet challenging to help my knowledge grow. We have recently gotten additional science material added to the criminal Justice Lab where we set up crime scenes to make situations more realistic so we will be more familiar when we actually get in the work force.
College Student,5,very good food and a wide range of variety in chocies
College Student,5,the weather is fine right now and there hasnt been any problems with it.
College Sophomore,5,Great ! You don't have to worry about people being raciest. There is no clicks by race what so ever.
College Sophomore,5,Health and Safety – The Health and Safety at Limestone keeps you safe and wants you to feel better once you don't feel well.
College Sophomore,5,"Sunny Day – The weather for the most part is great, relatively sunny. But of course like everywhere there are rainy days, however here that can quickly become stormy weather. It snowed my freshman year to my surprise, i loved it best time ever."
College Sophomore,5,Johnny on the Spot – Security is relatively good however no one can be everywhere at once. True campus security is always walking around but this really pick up lately due to an incident i personally witnessed. Now things are pretty safe. The response time to warn students could be way better.
College Student,5,Social Atmosphere – The atmosphere at limestone is family-like. The instructors are readily available and willing to aid any student.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The academics at Limestone are great.  Wonderful, educated professors, a variety of classes and curriculum to choose from.
I love Limestone."
Recent Alumnus,5,Limestone are very strict with their policy they stick with their Policy. Whatever their guidelines for their school they make sure the student the policy guidelines and not break the rules as far for school.
College Freshman,5,"No Need for Cars! Yes, cars are always a joy to have, but Limestone's Campus is all very close together and within walking distance from anywhere you are coming from. All of my classes this year were a total of 5 minutes to get there. This came in handy when you wake up late, you are still able to get to class quickly!"
Sophomore,4,"The only time my classes were online was right after Covid hit. We shut down for the quarantine. The teachers did a great job communicating everything they wanted us to do. However, it takes way more discipline going online than in person."
Sophomore,4,"Location is what keeps my rating from being 5 stars. There is nothing in Gaffney, SC! However, you will get a great education because Limestone, itself, is a fine institution. There is a lot to offer in terms of majors, including 8 majors with an entry-level Masters program. Eighty percent of the day campus students are recruited athletes from all over the world. Working adults have the option for evening classes or online degrees. Other selling features are free tutoring and a global experience option that includes a free trip abroad."
Freshman,4,new to limestone but so far good hospitality and services. I am an upcoming freshman in college wrestling for limestone university.
Junior,4,"I have only been enrolled in Limestone College for a short time, but since I have been there, my experience has been wonderful. The faculty is extremely helpful. They provide all ways of contact and will respond within a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend Limestone College to anyone. I have never attended a school they show and prove they care about their students."
Junior,4,"Very good Academics, very good return on investment, very good Diversity. I have only just transferred from Piedmont technical college. I am looking forward to attending limestone in the fall late term."
Junior,4,Limestone College is a great college all the way around. It is a beautiful campus with lots to do and amazing professors. Professors are always ready to help you in any way. All of the offices at Limestone are easy to interact with and are willing to help in whatever way they can. There are lots of things to do around the campus as well as places to go eat off campus.
Alum,4,"A small, liberal arts college in a very small town. Overall, I really enjoyed my time there. The faculty fully supports the arts."
Niche User,4,I have not started Limestone but I have competed the application and received the acceptance letter. Someone from the college has been keeping in touch with me and I look forward to starting classes in the fall.
Freshman,4,That I felt Limestone was not at all a bad campus. I have really enjoyed being there and experiencing the college life.
Sophomore,4,Limestone offers online classes and that is great for working adults with families. The college is great. Only issue I have is the response time from my advisor.
Junior,4,My college experience has been very interesting at Limestone College. I feel that Limestone makes it convenient for students to take classes and work a full time job as well as give an opportunity for students to enjoy regular college life. The changes that need to occur are transparency is what is required from certain professors when it comes to certain work that has to be turned in and the instructions that are provided on how to do it in the online classes.
Junior,4,"Classes are generally taught well, and a wide variety of events are available. The food, at least on non-orientation days, could use some extra effort."
Alum,4,Athletics are huge here and everyone is understanding of the struggles and are very supportive of each other.
Sophomore,4,Limestone college offers a very diverse campus with students from alround the world. The professor are easy to talk to if you have question. There are free help offered to those who need it.
Alum,4,"At limestone extended classes, you can actually attend classes at night and get the feel of having an instructor in front of your face. The only thing I didn't like is the way they treated us extended campus student verses the main campus students. We were always looked at doffered because we chose to attend college at night verse at their main campus."
Freshman,4,"I love the small class sizes and beautiful architecture. All of the teachers I've had have been wonderful. The only complaint I have is the small amount of classes offered for some majors and the website is not the most user friendly at times but you can always call for help or just ask. Overall, I love Limestone College and have had a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"My freshman year at Limestone was amazing, I played baseball and met a lot of new life long friends. The only thing I would change is the amount of money to go there."
College Senior,4,"Limestone is a very old campus and I am in in old dorm that was updated in the 90's.

Considering this is my first college dorm I am happy"
College Freshman,4,"So far the experience has been good.  I've met some nice people.  My classes don't start until Wednesday, Aug. 24th, however I've already moved in my dorm, making new friends."
College Junior,4,Easy to apply just pay attention to if it is ECC or on campus
College Junior,4,Limestone is big on sports and has recently started a football team.
College Junior,4,"For the most part, Limestone is a great school. Like every college, there are going to be some foreign teachers and some stricter teachers."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of students who work on campus, the only problem is, most students do not know how to go about getting a job on campus. I stumbled across a note taking job due to a teacher asking if anyone wanted to make extra money just taking notes."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of support from the students at the school as well as the community although some of the sports teams are not the best.
College Sophomore,4,If you like small class sizes then we definitely have that. All of my professors I have had have been wonderful and I have developed relationships with most. All the classes I have been in are lecture style and once my GEN EDs are done I can focus on my major courses
College Sophomore,4,"I have never had a problem with feeling unsafe. however, I do wish there were more of the safety call stops around campus instead of the one. Campus security does a decent job of patrolling and escorting you to places if you need it"
College Sophomore,4,"For athletes Limestone has really great facilities, for regular students the gym they go to is small, dirty, and run down."
College Sophomore,4,The security on campus is really well. Students who feel threatened by it have a lot of people they can talk to. Administrators made it clear of who you can talk to if you have been sexually assaulted or know someone who has. Limestone makes it clear to what will happen to people who commit this offense.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics at limestone are great. Limestone ranks in the country in almost every sport except football. Football just started so I wouldn't be surprised if it's ranked in the near future. Limestone could do a better job on the sports facilities.
College Freshman,4,"Limestone could use a few more majors like mechanics or architecture but otherwise they offer good majors. Freshman year has been great with work load, nothing I can't handle. Just have to stay on top of dates. Most work can be done in class or if you just go to the library and focus for 30 mins to an hour you'll get you're work done. Study hall is my favorite place to study. Someone people enjoy the upper level of the library."
College Freshman,4,"No reports to death or crime ON CAMPUS. Public safety employees need to workout more, if they had to chase someone I don't think they could. Otherwise they keep us safe by roughing a few people up. They check dorms which I appreciate. Limestone being a dry campus they are big when they catch students with alcohol however they are fairly forgiving and understand. They just want students to be safe and also smart."
College Freshman,4,I plan to further my education after Limestone. I have heard of students being excepted into medical school with their Limestone degree. Limestone has the best athletic training degree due to the large variety of athletes on campus.
College Freshman,4,I live in Eunice this year and my room is a great size. My roommate and I keep our room clean and I tend to be the one to clean the bathroom. Suit mates respect shower times and keeping things clean so I have no complaints.
College Freshman,4,"Basically everyone plays a sport at Limestone. Limestone coaches seem to offer the best scholarships for most sports. D2 isn't half bad. Our sports do well, we don't disappoint in our conference. Everyone goes to game on campus just to support even if they don't know a player. Someone is always wearing a sport shirt to represent. Intramural get acknowledgement as well. It's easy to get involved."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the small campus. I feel safe. You make your own fun and it's hard to get in trouble in such a small town. Everyone is so nice including locals.
College Freshman,4,I love that fact that my school is basically because everyone here plays a sport.
College Sophomore,4,"Limestone college is full of athletes. Pretty much the whole campus is on a sports team. All of your classmates know the struggle of being a student athlete, everyone is in it together. Limestone always comes together as on giant team, know as the saints."
College Freshman,4,The parties are usually fun. There is a club a short distance from the campus
College Freshman,4,We have many discounts like fast foods.
College Freshman,4,Limestone College has great housing on campus. Coming in as a freshman I was worried about the dorms but aroun the second week I saw everyone being social and the halls and rooms were clean . This made me want to be even more social.
College Freshman,4,The party scene is great but there is not a party every night
College Freshman,4,The financial aid process was great just took some time
College Freshman,4,The dining on campus is very different on different days
College Freshman,4,The campus is amazing. Enough room and a very social able place
College Freshman,4,"Classes are small, tutoring is available and professors are helpful."
College Freshman,4,It's a Christian school; we are expected to do the right thing.
College Freshman,4,It was simple and the counselors were very helpful.
College Freshman,4,The instructors and coaches are supportive and encourage me. They discuss future jobs possibilities with me as a freshman.
College Freshman,4,Most students are athletes and we support each other.
College Freshman,4,Most students here are respectable and mannerable.
College Junior,4,"This is Gaffney, but great prices."
College Junior,4,"They have clean facilities, modern and kept up"
College Junior,4,The college has a great location and athletics and school spirit
College Junior,4,I haven't had any issues.
College Junior,4,"Sports are important, especially baseball."
College Junior,4,Not too bad for a Christian college.
College Junior,4,"This is a Christian college, so homosexual and all that is not widely accepted. Some students accept it, but not the best place to go to get acceptance with that."
College Junior,4,Gaffney is located to many convenient locations!
College Junior,4,Its very convenient and clean. Great campus/housing.
College Student,4,There are a lot of fast food chains close by which obviously have cheaper cost that would be average and expected.  Discounts aren't offered as much because these Restaurants I speak if aren't in walking distance persay. The college offers great food choices in my opinion. I choose to eat there most of the time.
Sophomore,2,"Advisors do not actually advise. You will rarely communicate with them. I tend to sign up for my own classes. Professors rarely communicate for the extended online program. They aren't organized and do not actually teach. NOW, LIMESTONE WANTS TO USE PROCTORIO TO RECORD STUDENTS WHILE TAKING EXAMS! They lost me after this terrible decision!"
College Junior,2,not a college sports person
College Sophomore,2,Do not really even know about any greek life around campus.  Two sororities I think!
College Sophomore,2,"Housing wasn't good at all. The only benefit was that it was close to class. The dorms were not well taken care of, I think."
College Student,2,"There are no shuttles that run on or through campus.  There isn't really any point to have a car, everything is within walking/biking distance; but it is nice having a car if you or friends want to go to Charlotte."
College Freshman,2,You're better off going off-campus to get some fast food.
College Freshman,2,There isn't really any places around that are worth going to.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing really around
College Senior,2,Limestone College needs more renovation because it seems to be outdated.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the people who attend Limestone are all about sports. You'll find more jocks than book smart students here. Instead of hitting the books, they'll hit the basketball court or spend their time playing tennis. The good thing is that most of the boys are very fit."
College Freshman,2,"I Like White People...Me Too – Limestone College, the name says it all. This is a small private college so we don't get that much diversity and it's also not very known. Furthermore, LC consist mostly of whites and blacks, and the rest are barely visible percentages. Unfortunately, I find the lack of diversity quite unsurprising, mainly because we're a small private school and the only students who enroll are white athletes who didn't make it to the school of their choice. Thus, choosing their desired sport over the quality of their education."
College Sophomore,2,"Needs More Academic, Less Athletics – As a sophomore living off-campus, I can honestly say I would be wasting almost $10,000 on dorms/food in the cafeteria. The on-campus cafeteria (there is only one for the main campus) sits about 300 people even though the 900+ day students mostly live on-campus.  The cafeteria food, at the beginning of the year, is good then slowly becomes worse and worse throughout the year until everyone living on-campus becomes sick of the food. Most decide to go eat at a fast-food restaurant instead or waste their money they could use for school supplies on food that could be prepared by the cafeteria but the school tries to cut back on costs for food while ""maintaining"" healthy standards. This simply makes no sense to me because both years I have attended Limestone College, the tuition has been increased for whatever reason.  Most reason are due to sport facilities or athletics, etc.  

The dorms are average and are overcrowded towards the beginning of the year.  The communication between students services and registration/business office is very poor.  Let me explain, I am being charged to live on campus even though I changed my address to suitable mileage for the status of a commuter but due to the lack of communication, student services said I didn't change my address and because they did not check their records correctly, I am being charged $1500 for somewhere I'm not even living.  I was banking on receiving my overage check to live off for the remainder of the semester but due the lack of communication, I, now, have to take out a loan to compensate."
College Sophomore,2,"No Greeks – There isn't any greek life at our school, well none that I know of.  If there is, it's not advertised."
Recent Alumnus,2,The campus was mostly made up of African-American students around the same age (mid-20's to late 30's).
College Sophomore,2,Limestone College is located in a small city. The only transportation are taxis unless you have your own vehicle. I hear taxis are expensive and and inconvenience. Due to living in a small city there is not much you can do to change transportation.
College Freshman,2,Student Center – Needs to be remodel. New pool tables and more televisions.
College Sophomore,1,We have only one fraternity and a fake sorority other than that our Greek life is no existent
College Junior,1,There has only been 1 reported case of sexual assault on campus in the past 4 years or so. That is absurd. Things obviously get pushed under the rug and ignored.
College Sophomore,1,"They made a rule that no one can move off campus, forcing even twenty one year olds to stay in a dorm, or move to the ""on campus apartments"" that are two miles away in a government housing area.  Terrible housing."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any Greeks.
College Freshman,1,The administration needs to actually take the time to make sure their resident assistant's are doing their jobs. I had an issue of visitation violations with my roommate they were never resolved.
College Freshman,1,The food instantly disagreed with your stomach shortly after you finish eating.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life.
College Student,1,"I don't think Limestone has any Greek Life, that or they aren't as prominent as they are at other schools."
College Freshman,1,"I had a work study boss that was constantly high on prescription medication for any and every health problem imaginable.  He was constantly talking negative about everyone and everything going on in the College.  One day I decided to beat him at his own game and said some things about myself that wasn't true so if he spread it, people would know it was false and he would lose credibility in the gossip circle.  Instead, he found out what I had done.  He started saying things that was really false about me, accused me of keying his car and tried to turn all of my friends against me by stopping them in halls and saying things that wasn't true.  I was advised by a professor that knew it was all false to talk to Dr. Reiger.  I did and nothing came of it.  I guess it isn't about what you do wrong but how well you kiss butt because he still has his job and he was not even reprimanded.  I do not suggest anyone spend that kind of money to be treated like they are less than dirt.  I want to go to a college that leads by example since that is what they teach us to do in the classrooms.   "
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at Limestone is not a big issiue. A parking pass is 20 dollars a semester. As long as you have a parking sticker, your car is fine. We have Public Saftey around the clock to make sure your car is safe wherever it is parked around the campus."
College Sophomore,1,Not That Great – There are three or four computer labs on the entire campus. Some are used exclusively during certain times of the day for athletes. The network reliability is not too good. It is always kicking us out of the Internet. The printers are usually open but several times I went in there they were jammed or out of paper. The good thing is that they are open really late.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have maxed out my lifetime limit of financial aid and I called the college's Financial Aid office and was told you can only qualify for a scholarship if your GPA is 3.75.  There needs to me more lead way in this area.  My GPA is 3.25, I think that is a decent GPA.  I am not saying they should lower the bar, but I am saying there should be more than one GPA criteria."
College Freshman,1,"High School Feeling – We have a traditional curriculum at Limestone and the classes range from 15-30 students. Anyway, the thing i hate the most is that teachers are required to take attendance. They will fail you for missing 20 percent of your classes; no questions asked. Additionally, if your late more than 3 times, they count it as an absence. It feels a lot like high school if you ask me."
College Freshman,1,Attendence Policy – I think that the attendence policy should be removed because we are in college and we are paying the money. Professors should not be allowed to fail us just because we do not come to class.

Freshman,5,"Within my first week at EWU, I feel incredibly welcomed by my peers as well as the staff. The courses and professors are both incredibly immersive and educational, and always keep me interested. I always feel compelled to go outside for walks every day just because of the environment I find myself in. An absolutely wonderful experience and I could not recommend any more."
Freshman,5,"The professors have done an incredible job with the online learning aspect, finding numerous ways to keep myself and my peers involved and productive."
Freshman,5,"I have been very impressed with eastern Washington university so far. They made the transition to online school as smooth as possible, and have continued to provide for their students during these difficult times. Some of the dorm buildings could definitely use a remodel, but if you pick the right building then living on campus is a great experience. I am very impressed by my professors and counselor so far. I am very happy I chose EWU to pursue my bachelors degree."
Freshman,5,"Im starting my freshman year online, The classes they have given me have been known to be challenging but that everyone seemed to like them. Im excited to start classes"
Freshman,5,"Eastern Washington University, in my opinion, is a great school. Perfect sized campus, great people, wide variety of majors and minors and the location experiences all 4 seasons."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Washington University is and always will be, an excellent college. The university is a community that treats every student of race, color and gender with respect. From my experience and observation, students support one another when the curriculum gets rough and the assignments starts to pile up.  Faculty and Staff ask students, in person, how they can make our college experience better, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. No matter the situation, EWU faculty will acclimate to new conditions and bring the best experience they our capable of providing. Ewu is rated one of the most safe colleges on campus. Security will escort students to dorms if they feel uncomfortable and in case of emergency, at a click of a button, police officers will be at your aid in less than 3 mins. Eastern is one of the most affordable college in Washington and most definitely Spokane."
Sophomore,5,"Online was great until the pandemic, in which several upper level science classes were placed online.  Overall they did a good job presenting the material and being available to students for tech support, academic support, and even counseling."
Graduate Student,5,"The classes are great, the professors will really prepare you for the future and whatever career path you have. You will experience guidance through everything."
Graduate Student,5,I love this school! I have done my undergraduate and now am enrolled in my graduate program. I think Eastern has done really well at preparing me for my career.
Graduate Student,5,Online courses were challenging and fun to complete. Professors and course work support was great! I can not wait to begin my masters program with them!
Junior,5,I have been a student here at EWU for the past two years. I have been able to pursue my career through many excellent courses that were delivered by great professors. There are many activities both on and off campus and provides many opportunities for student participation.
Graduate Student,5,What I like about EWU was the fact that I was able to pursue my degree that opened doors for me in the real world! Also I made a great people who will be a lifetime friends! What I would like to change is providing more resources available for students who are looking for internships.
Graduate Student,5,"The online classes at EWU were great, the professors were very involved with the students and always available to answer any questions! Also because Of the many discussion board that we had, it gave us a chance to get to know each other Between students and the professor. Online classes proved me more flexible schedule with my work and still able to do well in class. Amazing professors with great feedback."
Alum,5,"I obtained my bachelors of arts in psychology at EWU's satellite campus in Bellevue. The program offered here was fantastic! The staff at the time were so passionate about what they teach, they were attentive, and wanted to anything and everything to help me move forward into graduate school! Dr. Seiver believed in me and changed my life! I could not be more grateful for her! I would recommend this program to anyone."
Senior,5,"Excellent Faculty, Administration forgiving and very helpful, course material follows leading universities such as UW closely, resources available in abundance."
Freshman,5,"I find the school amazing, the resources and the staff. I wouldn't recommend it if you like being close to cities (nearest city is 30 minutes away), but the campus itself is wonderful!"
Niche User,5,"I love the diversity at Eastern,The majors and the overall environment at Cheney. Eastern has a affordable tuition and multiple scholarships they offer"
Freshman,5,Very welcoming  and friendly. Cheney is a small town but not too small and there is lots to do here. The campus is beautiful and classrooms are very nice.
Senior,5,It’s a good school. The education is very good  and the staff and professors are amazing. There many different things to do at Eastern especially with friends. Also Spokane is close by if you want to do others stuff. There is also transportation provided for you so sometimes you do not need to bring your car! Or pay for parking since it’s pretty expensive.
Freshman,5,Eastern has many activities for every person I would like to see a boys soccer team and more hockey for intermediate players
Freshman,5,I love how all the professors I’ve had take the time out of there to email me and ask if I have any questions about home work it makes me feel like they really care about my education.
Sophomore,5,Eastern Washington University was not my first choice school. When I attended my first year I never knew how much I would love my fellow eagles. I'm only doing my required classes right now but advisers are very helpful and teachers to help you get what you need to succeeded. I am in the Greek life at eastern and I couldn't be happier I found my sisters. Thank you Eastern Washington University for changing my side and now making me a eagle forever.  GO EAGS!!!
Graduate Student,5,Excellent 4-year college with a wide variety of course of study. I completed my Bachelors degree in Communications and will complete my Masters of Business Administration in 11 months through their accelerated online program. Tuition is low-cost!
Freshman,5,"I love how friendly everyone is. The moment that you walk into campus everyone is very welcoming,  I have ever felt left out or excluded from my campus."
Niche User,5,"Its a great school because of its environment, diversity, and academics. Eastern Washington is one the most diverse public schools in Washington State."
Alum,5,"I love EWU. I spent five years obtaining my first BA and have returned as a Post-Bacc to pursue a second degree. I have connected to majority of my professors, valuing their willingness to get to know me and interact, as well as their dedication to the learning of their students. The campus is continually improving. One of the only things I would like to see change is parking."
Freshman,5,"When I went for my orientation, the campus and all the staff members were very friendly and very inviting. all the questions I had were answered and I made a plan for what I will be studying during the one on one meeting. the campus is beautiful and very easy to navigate. I'm very excited to start school there!"
Alum,5,Great school. Great learning atmosphere. Top notch. A smaller university feel while still being near Washington's second largest city.
Sophomore,5,"I went to EWU for 2 years and absolutely loved the campus! It's located in the small town fo Cheney, WA, about 20 minutes outside Spokane. It was a tight knit community and I met amazing people. The town is older and the off campus housing is older with some new appartment complexes around."
Graduate Student,5,I had an amazing experience at EWU. The counselors are very helpful with making sure I have everything in order. They have a writing center that does an amazing job at helping with essays. They have a beautiful campus and very nice gym.
Sophomore,5,"Eastern has been fabulous to me. There professors are very nice & considerate.  The dorms weren't my favorite but, the rest of the campus is amazing. The pub is fantastic & has great food."
Freshman,5,Eastern Washington is a great community and a great place for your career and goals. Well I’m a undergrad right now I hope to see a positive change in Cheney and I am very excited to spend my education in eastern Washington for the next 4 years and beyond
Freshman,5,It is really good medium sized campus. The community may seem small but it is really big. People are nice to each other and there many things that are open to do in campus.
Freshman,5,"I very much enjoy Eastern; the campus is beautiful, people are incredibly friendly, and the staff try their very best to help you and seem to really care."
Senior,5,The location of being in a small town is great. The environment of Eastern is amazing and all of the people are very kind. The professors are very knowledgable and have a passion for what they do.
Junior,5,"Eastern Washington University is phenomenal. I love the professors. I love the diversity. I love the education. And above all that, it is close to my hometown so I can still be in contact with my parents and my little sister. It is going to be bittersweet when I graduate from Eastern Washington University. One side of me doesn't want to leave the positive college environment that Eastern Washington University has create. And on the other side of me can not wait for my degree in psychology to help people after college because I know I will excel in careers.  I am looking forward to the future thanks to Eastern Washington University."
Freshman,5,Eastern Washington University is a great school! Very nice and family friendly. Lots of activities to get all cultures of students involved.
Junior,5,I like Eastern Washington University's campus and how it is all super close together so it's easy to find your way around and most dorm buildings are right on campus so you don't have to walk very far!
Freshman,5,My personal experience here at eastern has been great I have meet new friends and I have gotten very familiarized with the city of Cheney. The school in general is very simple clean and pretty. Its a very safe educational environment where Its easier for me to learn.Its very safe because I always see the police around being aware of the students and keeping us safe. Something they could improve I would say is maybe have more food options and not have them all in one building instead spread them out throughout campus. Other than that I think I'm attending a great college and I don't regret coming here.
Niche User,5,They were always very helpful when I had concerns about my application and didn't get annoyed with me when I would email all the time and just tell them my concerns. They were very helpful.
Niche User,5,"Eastern Washington university is a great campus, I like it I would like to go into Exercise science. My brother goes there he just finished bachelors now going for masters. He wants to work with pro athletes which so will I hopefully the diversity is great, Academics great, The campus is great I would like to be an eagle also."
Junior,5,"I love what I get from my education at Eastern. The professors really care about our lives and education. There is a strong sense of community, that everyone takes care of each other here. 
I wish campus was a little bigger with more food options or activities to go to. Though they are building and improving rapidly. I really couldn't ask for much more. I love my university!!!"
Alum,5,I really enjoyed their online program and the were good at emailing and getting back to me.  They were willing to work with me on my ever changing desires for degrees and make sure I was getting in contact with the right people. Even after I graduated I was able to contact advisors and get help on things that I needed for my professional requirements.
Niche User,5,This college has a beautiful campus and all the people who are a part of it are all wonderful too! Very friendly atmosphere and energy!
Freshman,5,"This school has such a friendly vibe, the facilities are great, and the professors are extremely helpful. Eastern is a hidden gem in Washington which makes it even more special to the students that go here because we know that we go to the best school in Washington!"
Freshman,5,"I really liked the professors and how they really care about students. Other than that it was pretty fun, but can be very boring. The town of Cheney doesn't have much to do, but there are fun things to do on campus like ice skating, basketball and other athletic activities. The food wasn't very good, but it wasn't terrible. I really enjoyed the education, but I got stuck with a first year professor, and she was not good at teaching, and I couldn't end up passing my class because of that. Other than that my other professors were great and I really enjoyed their classes. There are plenty of parties and drunk people that walk by every night, and it isn't fun because sometimes I try and sleep but can't because drunk people are yelling right outside my window. It's been a great experience, especially compared to high school. This is a great University, and it's very cheap too!"
Graduate Student,5,This school has gone very green lately!! I loved my experience as an undergrad. Diversity could be better
Niche User,5,I've had many family members who has in rolled at EWU and they loved it. the only thing I would change is the food choice like adding more markets.
Sophomore,5,Eastern Washington has been an amazing experience so far. I always feel like there are new and exciting things happening around campus. Faculty and student are all very accommodating and make you feel right at home.
Alum,5,"Eastern Washington University was a fair priced school and very diverse. Although, it is a small town, I didn't fear for my life or felt as if there were bad neighborhoods or places to avoid. That being said, the places to eat or have tasty food isn't necessarily in Cheney, but Spokane isn't too far away and the bus system is wonderful!"
Sophomore,5,Great university!!! Incredible Honors program!!! Have loved my time here!!! The Honors Program professors are INCREDIBLE!!!! Very wise people!!
Junior,5,"I love Eastern!! If you want the best bang for your buck in education in the state of Washington, come to Eastern. This place is awesome. Everything is withing walking distance and the town buses have good routes if you want to take them. I personally have a car, but I needed it when my car broke down and it worked out."
Junior,5,it is a very pleasant lace to come study. the cost are significantly lower than other university's and it offers a lot of programs much students are interested in taking. this school is much recommended to those looking to further their educational careers.
Freshman,5,"eastern is such an amazing school, you get such a great atmosphere and vibes from everyone. the diversity and the different kinds of culture around is great, you feel like your at home everyone gets together with others and meet with one another. this is going to be your second home and second family.  I would tell everyone to come here they have such great academic, financial, and health support around the campus. always having different activities around if your trying to have a little fun, a stress relief, or just meeting new people. i have had some much help from tutors here and study groups around, helping me with improving my grades and seeing a big difference. especially when I'm leaving in the dorms, i get to my classes faster it's so much easier and you get to interact with different people with different backgrounds which is such a beautiful and great experience to have. so i would love for people to join the eastern family. :)"
Freshman,5,This campus has such a good environment. The professors and staff are very friendly and are always here to help with anything. there's so many resources around campus and theirs always so much to do here!
Junior,5,"This is the best school in the area, the campus is wonderful, I love my dorm and my neighbors. The air smells fresh, the professors are professional and most importantly, it feels like home to me."
Junior,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere of EWU because the professors truly care about their students well-being and they do all that they can to create a safe and welcoming environment for the students that attend Eastern Washington University.
Freshman,5,"Small, welcoming campus. Easy to navigate, nice staff. I am in the Visual Communications Design program and all of my professor so far have loved their jobs and are very helpful."
Senior,5,I have been at Eastern Washington University for 4 years. I have come across amazing professors who have gone above and beyond to provide great knowledge to the students they teach. One thing I would like to see a change on campus is the diversity. Often times racism is presented often and it can impact others academic skills.
Freshman,5,Eastern Washington university is a great school for those who don't like small schools but feel overwhelmed with big schools its the perfect size and the teachers put an effort to learn your name they really want the best for you and give you many opportunities to get the best grade possible. Eastern had a very beautiful campus and its one you won't get lost in.
Senior,4,The handling of how school will run online has actually been efficient when it comes to being struck by Covid.
Freshman,4,"I am currently taking online classes, and am impressed with how quickly they rolled out plans and curriculums for them. We are using zoom calls for the classes, so if you are used to regular online school where you don’t have very much interaction between you and your professors and classmates other than email, it can be a bit of a change. The zoom calls mean you still have to keep that time period free for class time, whereas traditional online school you can fit it around your schedule. There is a very helpful schedule planner that my counselor helped me through to find the best times for me. EWU also uses canvas for most classes, which is a benefit. Canvas is great for class participation and for keeping track of grades."
Senior,4,"A beautiful and diverse college. You will get the chance to meet many different cultures and backgrounds. Neighborhood is peaceful for the most part and emergency assistant are always on track. Can do a lot around the Cheney Area such as fishing, hiking, shopping, picnics, kayaking etc. Many things to do in Spokane as well."
Freshman,4,"Although there was a hybrid plan hatched for the fall quarter, the rest of the school year was to be conducted online. It was a struggle at first, but, the school assisted in many ways to the students, allowing little to no discomfort on the students behalf."
Freshman,4,"Diversity and connecting with the community is valued greatly at Eastern Washington University. The staff and higher ups are constantly thinking of ways on how to better serve the students and the community. At Eastern Washington University, anyone can receive an college degree without worrying too much about falling in too much student loan debt as many students graduate with little to no debt at all."
Sophomore,4,"during the COVID-19, I do not thinking anyone had enjoyed online schooling. It was tough during the last quarter when no one was allowed to go anywhere, or socialize. The staff had given the best experience they could offer though. The start of my spring quarter, during the quarantine was excellent. Teachers are more relaxed with students and schooling couldn't be any better at the comfort of your own home. Please note that this is from my experience during the COVID-19 quarantine and your online experience will be much better."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern was a great experience. They have great support for students such as tutors, counselors, group and networks to connect to."
Graduate Student,4,Eastern Washington University has been a great school to attend! They have done everything in their power to support me through achieving my educational goals and have been very attentive to my scholarly needs. I would not go anywhere else!
Sophomore,4,ewu is a great campus. It offers various options for activity and entertainment with clubs sports and more. Everything is close together and convenient and the academics are solid.
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school but in a small town so there is only so much to do for a social life in Cheney. Luckily it's only 20 minutes from Spokane which everyone always goes to. This school is really known for it's education department and Exercise science departments, like OT, PT and athletic training. The campus is the perfect size because it won't take you an hour to get across like other campuses. Only takes around 10-15 minutes depending on the day. The buildings are very nice and up to date. They have tons of intramural sports and club sports and always have events going on. The have movie nights/ themed nights at the PUB and can't forget about the hockey and football games. Everyone is really nice and not pressuring. Like if you were to go to a party, nobody will force you to drink or not drink and nobody really cares and Frats have parties almost every weekend. Also the campus is pretty in the middle politically so its not extremely liberal or conservative which is very nice."
Sophomore,4,"I had to take classes online because of Covid and it was a huge adjustment. I went from living on campus in the dorms to moving back home. Almost all of the expenses were refunded, as in I wasn't charged a fee like I normally would if I decided to move off campus. The classwork was pretty much the same, but it really depends on which teachers you had. I had some friends that got to skip their finals completely and some, like me, had to still take theirs. The majority of the time they were understanding and willing to provide extra credit, but it really depends. All of the classes are now built/structured to be taught online or in-persom depending on what the government allows."
Junior,4,While it was difficult to adjust to learning online professors did their best to accommodate to students and provide them with the best education they could given the current circumstances.
Freshman,4,"The dorms are very good, maybe changing the clubs, and the food is really good they have lots of options"
Freshman,4,Online they are very flexible and good with the scheduling and also making sure you are learning like you are in the classroom.
Alum,4,Blackboard was easy to maneuver in. I never needed any IT support but blackboard helped me get the basic understanding of online learning. It's been a few years since I graduated but I don't recall having issues getting in touch with financial aid or my instructors. I do remember that I could only take so many classes online and the rest had to be in person. I am not sure if that has changed or not.
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Eastern Washington University, you feel welcomed and at home. I love the events on a hot day, safety is really important at Eastern, I love how staff at Eastern are really nice and kind. The campus is really clean. I would love to see more diversity at Eastern and cultural clubs at Eastern."
Senior,4,"I'm just going to keep this short and sweet for all of you who want the truth and want it now.

Eastern Washington is an amazing school and anyone who comes here will certainly feel welcomed and at home, but I'll cut to the chase. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the fact there is room for improvement in little things like the parking situation. 

Other than that there's nothing bad I can say about EWU, if you're wanting a small town feel at a Division 1 University then look no further because Eastern Washington University is the school for you."
Senior,4,"I love the staff, I can tell my professors work hard for us to have a good education and they care about us. I love the school and I have built relationships with a lot of the people here, including the staff."
Junior,4,"I loved having a university that was still close for me to live at home and didn't cause a greater financial burden compared to that of other schools. Most of the professors are great they are understanding and want to help you learn and succeed. But on the other hand I have had tenure professors that should have been gone a long time ago, because their teaching ways were stuck in the past and not where the technology or experience of the newer generations were going. Overall would recommend EWU as a perfect college, close to home, not the biggest price on tuition and they have an amazing but super competitive Dental Hygiene Degree program,"
Junior,4,"I like Eastern Washington University because it is a small university. I enjoy the aspects within the building and how historic it is. Among st the future aspects, I enjoy how they conclude a lot of diversity sections, like for example having different events for various cultures."
Alum,4,"EWU was a great school.  The diversity could improve, as well as, having a multicultural center to not only assist but also bring to light the diversity that is one campus. Political Science program is dope."
Junior,4,"Eastern overall, is a pretty decent school. Obviously, there are always things to improve upon. The dorms on campus look like trash cans with windows and they come complete with two person rooms and fire alarms that go off for no reason at all in the middle of the night."
Niche User,4,"The campus is wonderful and welcoming, and the professors and staff are nice and always willing to help. I've been at Eastern for almost two years now and have enjoyed my entire time there as a student! The campus police can be seen around campus providing students with a safe environment to learn."
Freshman,4,Eastern Washington University is a great place to learn. They have many free resources for students to access and use.
Alum,4,I really enjoyed my time at EWU. The classes for my major were excellent. I really connected with a lot of my professors in my major which made the classes even better. The prerequisite classes could have been better however. It felt like they were just trying to push students through and they were a lot harder to enjoy.
Junior,4,"EWU is a great campus. In the fall, it is beautiful. Professors are extremely helpful and educated and there's so many great sources on campus to help you succeed."
Niche User,4,"Generally you will find classes with 30 or fewer students outside of common 100 level classes. This is a much better ration of instructors to students than you will find at larger universities. The campus and departments are growing and adding new degree option almost every year, so if you are looking at enrolling in a couple of years your options might be much larger than they appear right now."
Sophomore,4,Eastern Washington University is located in a very small town in Cheney. They have a really good student life there with many resources and opportunities for you.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Eastern Washington University has been amazing. I enjoy all of my classes and I feel like I am getting the best education I can receive. Everyone at Eastern is incredible and they all want to see you succeed. The librarians are so helpful and never turn down the opportunity to help you get the resources you need. I love living in the dormitories, you meet incredible people and get to enjoy what Eastern has to offer together. There are so many opportunities here at Eastern so don't turn don't what they have to offer."
Freshman,4,Great college! Super small and safe campus. Love all the hang out spots and places to eat. You are in the amazing small town of Cheney but you are also very close to the big city of Spokane if you ever want to go out and explore!
Sophomore,4,"EWU is a college with a city built around it, because of that a lot of the local businesses offer a student discount to EWU students."
Junior,4,Friendly atmosphere and classmates are always willing to help. Professors will gladly offer outside of class hours assistance to those that feel they need it.
Senior,4,"The quality of the education is extremely good for the cost of enrollment, overall a really good school. The main improvement would come in courses with more availability."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Washington University is an institution that embraces all walks of life. Here all areas of study can be learned in a classroom that has a perfect size, not too big and not too small. The people I have come in contact with are enthusiastic and helpful to those around them. I believe Eastern is a location that promotes higher education."
Sophomore,4,Eastern Washington University is a very inviting school to those who may not know anyone and are willing to be a part of making changes on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse, the atmosphere is amazing! There is many activities to do through  the  school for those who can’t afford to do any activities. As well as free food, merchandise, and meeting new friends."
Freshman,4,"What I liked about Eastern Washington University is the school spirit. Almost everyone in school would attend the football games wearing eastern swag. The students would participate in the chants and when we would score a touchdown we would say ""Eagles!"" and point to the direction of the touchdown. For my first year I did like the fact that we had to live in the dorms because not only did we not need furniture because it was already provided but it was a great way to meet new people, it's a safe environment, and you save money. One thing that I would like to change is parking. College is already expensive as it is with housing cost, tuition, books, and other fees, but having to pay for parking in a school parking lot is crazy. Not everyone can afford to pay $250 a quarter for parking in the school parking lots. It's hard to find free parking that is close to campus because free parking is about two blacks away and students with morning classes take it up."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I have enjoyed attending Eastern Washington University and would recommend those finishing high school to consider attending, as well. Campus is fairly exciting, there is a club or activity for whatever you could possibly be interested in and we got Panda Express so there ya go."
Junior,4,"I like the school, Its not too big but it is also not too small. It has a good amount of students and honestly if you seek help you will receive a lot."
Senior,4,It is a good small school! If someone is coming out of highschool from a very small community Ewu is a great option because you will still get the small town vibes and small class room size.
Freshman,4,The campus at is very pretty and full of trees and plants that make going to class a beautiful sight.
Junior,4,"They are able to give students individual or plus group access to tutors in most subjects! Also, most professors are willing to work with students for getting extra help/explanations if there is any confusion during lecture. But, the key is communication on the students behalf. EWU has renovated the PUB building which even has a panda express withing the building."
Freshman,4,The campus is very big and easy to get around . the work out facility and the football field is great. the food isn't too good it could be better I wish they had more variety. I wish the campus was more diverse that would be amazing.
Sophomore,4,The campus is centrally located in the city for easy accessibility and distance. There's a free parking lot that's not too far to walk from! The dorm are nice and the food on campus has a lot of offerings and variety. The counselors are easy to make an appointment with and the instructors are helpful.
Junior,4,"This is my first year here, but I am enjoying the atmosphere as well as the classes. My professors have been very knowledgeable about the topics that they have taught. Even in the snow the area is pretty amazing."
Freshman,4,I liked attending Eastern Washington University because the staff was always easy to get a hold of and ask questions to. I also like the mass diversity on the campus itself
Niche User,4,Eastern has a diverse area where colored people are not left out which I very much apricate because I am a Latina who looks for multicultural aspects. I also loved the scene that the school is in which is in Spokane and it has all the four seasons. One thing Eastern should change are the requirement of having to stay on campus the first year. I believe it is not fair to those who are not finically stable to live on campus due to the expenses of the college life.
Freshman,4,"Perfect size, not to big or to small. The teachers are all very helpful. The academic advisors are super helpful and do everything they can to help!"
Sophomore,4,"I have attened summer quarter three years in a row. Now I am going to begin attending full time this upcoming school year. Over all I have had a good expearence talking with admitions, advisors, and other staff members. The campus is just the right size for me and I couldn't expect more."
Senior,4,"Overall, EWU is a good school. The campus is very beautiful and there is plenty of grass to lounge in between classes. It's a multicultural school focused on increasing diversity. The professors are willing to make time to meet with students. However, there is a limit to how many students can attend a class due to limited seating. So be ready to sing up as soon as you can to get into a class. Otherwise, EWU is a great school."
Niche User,4,I visited Eastern Washington University in January 2018. It was a beautiful campus that was full of student life and there were many buildings that said there was diversity among the students. I was welcomed very kindly while visiting the school.
Niche User,4,All of the classes I have taken were great.  The only thing I would like to see change is the architecture; most of the buildings look as if they are from the 70's or 80's.
Alum,4,"Enjoyed my time at Eastern. I like that it is located in a small town, but students can always drive or take the bus 15 minutes to the much larger city of Spokane. The professors are great and are very personable with students. The campus is easy to navigate and students are nice and friendly."
Alum,4,"I'd like to see more curriculum emphasis on applying to internships and increasing the network between local and regional companies and the school within the science majors. I found this a bit lacking in the Biology Department, especially those seeking opportunities in the biotech sector. I felt very underprepared and underqualified for these positions upon graduation when competing against students who graduated from other state schools, like UW and Pacific Lutheran."
Junior,4,"Eastern Washington is a very safe university. A small town and a very close-knit community. There are a lot of things under construction at the moment, but it will only make for an even more beautiful school."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Washington University is an best choice for any student to attend too. They help out a lot with most students by making sure you’re on track for graduating and never to fall behind. They helped me seek strategies for studying that I never thought I could’ve came up with in high school. The resources provided to us is actually helpful and I see myself and others use it a lot to help through assignments and projects that are due. This is one dependent schools anyone should attend, the academics here are on top and every student here succeeds everytime. One thing I would want to change would having more students use to resources provided to us, because they actually do help and benefit me a lot. And If I was a high school student looking for somewhere to apply I would definitely suggest this school to help you get to where you want to go later in life."
Junior,4,"My experience at Eastern Washington University has been generally positive. The professors, both adjunct and tenured are passioned and knowledgeable. I also have found the campus lovely if not demure."
Graduate Student,4,"The environment is very diverse, which is what I love most about Eastern. They have a variety of cultural appropriate classes as well and have teachers who are educated or are from the same culture as they are teaching. The only thing I dislike is the snow because Eastern students and snow do not mix."
Freshman,4,"I believe that Eastern Washington University is a very welcoming and diverse community. I go through my days on campus smiling at all different types of people. 
One of the only things that I would change about EWU are some of the buildings on campus. I am aware that they have been remodeling many buildings on campus already, however, I have noticed a few that still need lots of work. 
Overall, I really enjoy my time on campus and would recommend it to many other students around the state, country,  and world."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Washington University is an excellent choice for a cheap but fantastic university experience.  The professors are dedicated to their students and helping them learn.  There is a multitude of different people from all over the country and internationally.  Ewu's campus is beautiful and pretty big, but not too big; you can get everywhere on campus within ten minutes which makes it easier when referring to making it class on time.  The dorms are not in the best shape. There are only two residential halls that are very nice the rest are old and worn out.   Eastern Washinton University is in the small town of Cheney Washington.  There isn't much in the city there isn't even a movie theater or a mall."
Sophomore,2,"I don't want to trash the school online but at the same time it is also my duty to make sure kids know what they are getting into.

The culture of the school is terrible. Anyone who has played competitive sports knows what I'm talking about. There might be some really talented teachers and gifted students but the vast majority take the path of least resistance.

This is not a school for winners, it's for those who just don't want to lose and that isn't good enough.

Starting from the very top there is no leadership and no direction. Students are used as political pawns by teachers to put pressure on higher ups.

Firing school president Mary Cullinan (June 2020) was a great decision but instead of immediately making changes to improve the school, the board stalled out. They had no plan.

I hope the school makes changes because it fills a need for affordable secondary education and it has promise but like every other promise EWU makes its students, it will probably fall short."
Niche User,2,"I am very unimpressed and I am extremely suprised that it is the top 1000 anything. This place is disappointing; a joke, as are some of the people. I am sure people are very much capable of succeeding here, however the students I have met either need a serious attitude change, or some mental health support. Safety here, too is poor. You get what you pay for here."
College Freshman,2,"I found that during my 2 years at whatcom community college, I would say my experience was frustrating.  I found that when I took time to meet with professes they were less than helpful in most cases.  I am excited about the next step in my education and have high hopes that the experience will be much better at Eastern Washington University.  I am excited about the community feeling I get there.  They seem put students first, and strive to accommodate their needs which is something I didn't feel that Whatcom Community College did."
College Junior,2,"I worked for the school newspaper, The Easterner. We had such bad budget cuts that I was being paid next to nothing for 3 days worth of work that I had to get done in one evening."
College Freshman,2,"I've heard that the sororities are very cliquey and snobby (depends on which one you join). I would never join one, since my personality would clash, and I would be considered a loser among them. They say that they accept everyone, but it's actually just a popularity contest. My friend used to be among them, but she left because she didn't feel included with them, she felt like they were just mean girls."
College Student,2,"Most people, who graduate from this school, get a job at this school.  Sad really!"
College Freshman,2,"I think that people on this campus including administrators, police officers, and people who work in the dorms have been extremely informative to the women on campus for safety measures. I do think that there needs to be more done about the sexual assault going on. I generally do not feel safe in most places because of experiences I had when I was little but I do carry pepper spray when walking around."
College Student,2,We have had multiple rapes and attempted rapes in the last year on and around campus.
College Freshman,2,The buildings haven't been updated since they were first built. Waste of money.
College Freshman,2,Really almost non existent here. There are like 4 sororities.
College Freshman,2,"Very small greek systems with no ""chapter houses"" that actually represent chapter houses."
College Freshman,2,"There is not enough options, and there is no late-night hours."
College Junior,2,To find a one bedroom under $500.00 is very difficult.
College Sophomore,2,"I was in a sorority and I was ostracized for reasons I never knew.  I had a terrible experience in the greek community and moved back home because of it.  If you don't drink, you're not welcome."
College Sophomore,2,"There were only a McDonalds, Subway, Zip's, and a Mexican restaurant in Cheney.  The nearest good restaurant was over 30 minutes away."
College Sophomore,2,"I hated Cheney, I had to get out of there.  It was the smallest town I have ever been in, and it was 30 minutes to the nearest small city."
College Junior,2,"Most places don't stay open very late, or don't deliver. Which sucks when you don't have a car."
College Junior,2,Most of Easterns parties are mostly  kickbacks. Not the stereotypical wild college parties.
Recent Alumnus,2,No discount for students and pretty pricy.
College Junior,2,I'm not a big party person but EWU does have a lot of house parties that many students choose to attend.
College Junior,2,The only time the night life is good is on first and last Thursday or a holiday. Otherwise you might as well go to Spokane.
College Sophomore,2,"Not enough parking for all the students and for free parking, you have to walk a long ways"
College Sophomore,2,"I hate walking from my car, across campus, in crappy weather!"
College Senior,2,"Winter is terrible, streets are not plowed, school sidewalks are not shoveled or de-iced."
College Junior,2,"Permits cost too much, parking people everywhere giving out tickets, meters all over city so you can't avoid paying or getting tickets and you have to walk from super far away if you don't want to pay. "
College Junior,2,It snows a ton! But April-October is really nice.
College Junior,2,I am a single mom we eat at home.
College Junior,2,It doesn't very seldom is campus closed because of weather
College Junior,2,I usually eat at home.
College Junior,2,The places around campus are great for availability but the price leaves something to be desired. We are students pay a lot of money to attend school here and the food is only okay for the same price as known names of ready made food.
College Sophomore,2,"I am a little disappointed in the amount of financial aid I received this past year. I am VERY thankful for all the help I get, however, my family and I still had financial struggles throughout my freshman year. Eastern is an awesome school and the thought of moving schools is a huge bummer so I have been working a lot to try and help out my family in this financial bind of mine. I do feel that I should've received more financial aid and that my family situation should've been considered more, however, I am truly appreciative that I even got financial aid. I know that money is such a huge issue for my family and this is why I have turned to countless scholarships and even considering getting another job. I know that college is expensive but I am in this for the long run and am willing to do what it takes just to graduate."
College Senior,2,"I applied multiple times throughout the time I have been at EWU and have yet to receive a scholarship from EWU, however financial aid is pretty easy to receive loan wise from the government."
Recent Alumnus,2,There are a lot of Caucasian  people but the school gets so many students from other countries that it's obvious that they're making bank off of their international tuition rates. I've never had a class that was solidly one race or another.
College Freshman,2,Drug scene is very low and although it is there and popular is not in the open at all. The cops are strict
College Freshman,2,Greek life is there for parties and that is about it. I don't hear of anything they do around the community or for the school and they don't dominate the social atmosphere of the school.
College Freshman,2,The nightlife is pretty disappointing especially if you are under 21 and there are no house parties. The over 21 crew seems to have plenty of options with the bars and good entertainment there. But for the most part there is never much going on around town.
College Senior,2,The weather is very cold most of the time except in the summer when we don't have class. The walkways are always wet and there are a lot of puddles around. The stairs outside are icey and the walkways always have snow during the winter.
College Freshman,2,"Quite a few options, none of them are high class, and the ones that advertise as such, the grove and eagle point, are a scam, and waste of money."
College Freshman,2,"Few fast food restaurants, and small cafes mostly. Nothing exciting."
College Sophomore,2,"The 'drug scene' at EWU is of course something that is not encouraged.  Laws are enforced, a few groups speak out against drug use at school, and it's a low-key 'scene' at the school.  There have been instances of where drugs and/or alcohol were involved in crimes, but I don't think those are representative of the lifestyle in general."
College Senior,2,Truck stop food. Average to high prices. Average food quality.
College Senior,2,Be persistent in getting the RIGHT answers. Don't depend on the employees knowing what they are talking about. Stay on top of this process or you will get lost in the paper pile.
College Senior,2,They are not really visible. So I would say not very active. Housing is limited.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I live in Medical Lake and the closest bus stop to my house is 3 miles away and it takes a 2 hour bus ride for me to get from that stop to the university (they take me downtown, then to Cheney which is in the opposite direction). If I drive, it's a 30 minute trip. They do have a lot of buses running in this area and part of your tuition fees involve a bus pass, so cost really isn't a factor. If you drive, though, you have to pay outrageous amounts for parking permits/meters or you can park 10 min away in the free lot. I've been parking up in the free lot this quarter, but the snow, ice, and having to cross 2 parking lots and a busy street just to get onto the main campus don't make it any easier. The hike back up to the lot isn't a piece of cake either. But on the bright side, the hike is some decent cardio."
College Sophomore,2,"There are many frats and sororities at Eastern who advertise themselves quite well. They are always setting up booths and searching for new members. However, I don't see them doing much otherwise. I would rather them be out in the community representing what they stand for."
College Junior,2,I find the people here are average. Mostly farm kids or kids from rural areas. You might see an attractive guy but he's probably gay. The attractive girls are usually from warmer climates like California and Arizona who make sure everyone knows how miserable they are in the snow.
College Junior,2,"It can get very cold and dumped with snow during the winter, and 110 during the summer."
College Sophomore,2,"Eastern is a diverse campus, but not as diverse as many schools on the east coast."
College Freshman,2,Getting into Eastern Washington University is not that hard they have an 82 percent acceptance rating. I am into my major program but I do not start doing major related classes until Spring of my sophomore year.The challenges you encounter at this school are you waste a lot of time before you get into your major with stupid General ED requirements like Computer Literacy and PUB classes so it takes longer to finish. The most important criteria for admission are your grades mostly but the GPA requirement is really low and they completely disregard test scores and let stupid people in.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman year I received my financial aid on time with no hassle.  Unfortunately, Sophomore and Junior year I didn't have such luck.  They would tell me I had all of the paperwork in, and then two weeks later would email me telling me I needed to turn something else in.  One quarter, I didn't receive my financial aid until a month before finals week.  It was extremely frustrating.  My advice is to keep checking up online to make sure all paperwork is in before the quarter starts."
College Senior,2,Cheney is an extremly small town. It will take you a total of maybe 15-20 mnutes to get around the entire town. There is not much activities to do. There is no real shopping areas you have to drive to Spokane to go to a mall which is a 25minutes drive.
College Senior,2,"I am a 7th year student. I met with my advisor about switching my major and she never mentioned that financial aid had a limit. When I switched back, the math dept. scheduled my major req'd classes during my educ req'd classes and extended my educ yet another year. Now I am having to pay out-of-pocket for my last year. Other than those issues, my financial aid was never an issue and was always delivered on time."
Recent Alumnus,2,I attend the Riverpoint campus. There is only one choice on campus for food. Their coffee is not that great and the food is expensive. The soups are ok price and are ok tasting.
College Junior,2,I attend the Riverpoint Capmus in Spokane and EWU does not offer any campus housing in Spokane.
College Junior,2,"While one can find something to do when the campus is putting on something, finding something to do in Cheney in general is incredibly hard to do. There is Spokane about 20 minutes out, but if you wanted to do something locally, then there is not a lot of luck. Thank God we have a Greek system to help entertain us!"
College Senior,2,Lacking in Residence Halls – I have seen more than my fair share of underage drinking and lots of pot smoking in the residence halls and nothing is done about it.
College Sophomore,2,"If your not careful you wil rack up quite a bit in parking costs. Take the bus! Its much cheaper, runs frequently and you don't have the extra stress of daily figuring out where to park and how to pay for it."
College Junior,2,"Limited and Expensive – The campus does offer parking lots but you need to pay for the permit to park in them. There are also many 10-hour parking meters along the outer-campus area but the meters are quite a distance from class buildings. Residential parking is free but spots fill up quickly, you'd have to get there an hour or more before 8 a.m.! If not, you have to walk quite a distance as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Good Until Winter – Winters can be bad, but thats how it is all over eastern washington."
College Sophomore,2,"It Is Cheney – The title says it all, Cheney is a small town outside of Spokane. It has little options and those that are here close early for college life, even the McDonals isn't open past 10:30."
Senior,1,"i have taken multiple courses online, and this review is in response to ewu’s transition to online courses during the COVID19 pandemic in particular. it has been awful in every way."
Senior,1,"The Education Department at Eastern Washington University is a mess. They have regularly changed deadlines and requirements mid-program, to the point that many of my peers have had their graduations pushed back by two quarters or more.

The Education Department at EWU has such a bad reputation that many schools in the area refuse to accept student teachers from Eastern regardless of student merit.

If you want to be a teacher, this is not the place to receive that education. Go somewhere else or wait until you are sure that things have improved."
College Student,1,"With the legalization of marijuana, it's easily accessible now!"
College Student,1,"I started school September 2015.  Judge for yourself:

A female student was raped in Morrison Hall on October 9, 2015.

Police investigating 7 sexual assault cases on October 27, 2015.

Student was arrested for shooting threats on November 23, 2015.

A student died in Brewster Hall on November 25, 2015.

EWU athlete shot another EWU student on the head on January 18, 2016.

I don't feel very safe in this campus!"
College Student,1,"This is the worst!  As a freshman, I'm mandated to live in the dorms ($750/month) and pay for their meal plan ($633/month).  See WAC 172-130!  It's law!

It's not worth it.  It's a rip off!  The dorms are old (70's style), outdated, very small, and not very clean.  The food is average at best."
College Student,1,I don't pay attention to them much!
College Student,1,"As a freshman, I am mandated to live in the dorms this year and required to pay for their ridiculous meal plans.  (See WAC172-130.  It's law! This is the first year they are enforcing this law.)  The dorms cost $750/month.  The meal plans cost $633/month. On top of that, Eastern has several mandatory expenses added on top of tuition and books:  STA, PUB, Obamacare, parking, laundry, activity fee, etc.  That's an added cost of $20,000/year that you didn't have last year.  Make sure to check out these hidden expenses before you commit.  Make sure to check out the dorms, too.  They are old, outdated, and very small.  No privacy.  No walls between you and your roommate.  If you can afford the extra $20,000/year, you might as well consider going to a better school with better accommodations.  Some out-of-state schools are cheaper than Eastern even as an out-of-state resident, ie. Boise State University.  Do your homework.  Shop around.  Save and graduate with no debt or minimal debt."
College Freshman,1,To join a sorority or fraternity it is very hard. the recruiters are very picky in who they choose (typically whites and fit people)
College Student,1,I missed the scholarship dead line and they didn't send me any info about it all so I had no idea there were even school scholrships
College Junior,1,"Small town, very little options for students. High prices, mostly bar or fast foods, and low health quality unless you want to eat a salad everyday."
College Junior,1,"Not much parking, very high prices to park close. Long distance walk from any free parking."
College Junior,1,I don't live on campus
College Sophomore,1,"I'm having a difficult time finding scholarships, and when I do, the essays are completely unrelated to my field of study and require extra research to complete.  Being a full time worker, as well as a full time student, doesn't leave me any free time to research a topic for a two page essay I have to complete to receive a scholarship.  And of the 10 scholarships I've applied for, I haven't received any kind of notification, let alone, acceptance.  I don't receive financial aid because my parents make too much money to qualify, but they don't make enough to pay for my school, so I'm paying out of my own pocket with working full time.  It's extremely frustrating."
College Junior,1,"Nothing to do, no movies, just a small bowling alley.

What people to do entertain themselves is poor bleach in washers and dryers in the dorms of people they don't like. Or turn off lights in the showers, or just be plain awful people."
College Junior,1,"It's my personal opinion that greek life is for people who never got over high school. Complete with cliques, dances, contests, royalty, etc, its high school revisited for people who have no self worth unless they are ""included"" in some stupid club."
College Junior,1,I walk to and from campus.
College Junior,1,I am shocked at the underage drinking allowed.
College Junior,1,you never can find parking once and a wile you will get that good spot but normally you have to get here early. 
College Sophomore,1,Nothing really I had no choice but to go here because it was cheap and in state.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you can find someone to talk to about them, go right ahead. They're picky and most students don't qualify for anything."
College Senior,1,There really isn't a Greek life on campus. If there is  it is not marketed very well because I don't even know how to apply.
College Sophomore,1,"I know from other people's palates that they enjoy the food, however every time I eat from them I always get sick from bad grease they use or something is too spicy or to watery."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The professors that I've had so far are very challenging. I've had a few like them before but never at the same time. You have to work your butt off just to get the general idea of the topic and MAYBE you'll pull a C. Money is a constant issue for all students, so between work and school, I haven't found anyone who gets a regular 8 hours of sleep. I had a hard time adjusting to the workload and no one here will help me. My professors are more concerned with their own projects and the administrative people don't have time to see you so please set up an appointment for next month when you've already abandoned all hope. Just make sure you're prepared to abandon your social life for months at a time for the sake of a decent GPA."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Maybe I'm not spending enough time in the frat houses, but the guys in my classes haven't been too appealing. Those that have the looks, lack the balls to verbalize any cognitive thought processes. Those that actually communicate openly are either married or socially awkward. The girls are a pretty rough mix. There are a lot that are attractive but quiet. You have to spend a lot of time getting them to open up but once you do, they're worth keeping around. Most of the students dress in ways that make me think they're still living with their great aunt Muriel. And then there are those who show up to class in their sweats. Granted, this is winter quarter and sweats are warmer than jeans."
College Freshman,1,Nightlife sucks in Cheney most parties get busted and the cops are everywhere. There are not that many fun parties and some houses charge 5 dollars to go in and drink.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible. The free spaces are few and far between, and to rent a space costs money. It is recommended to take the bus or a bike to school if you live close by."
College Student,1,Its really strict especially about underage drinking and drugs and such I guess it's a good thing so no one gets hurt but at the same time it is kinda of a downer
College Junior,1,"There are days when the buses can't even function and they don't cancel school.  There are many accidents and they don't cancel school because they're too busy about a test, when it can be reschedules.  They need to look out for the students safety.  Students get docked points in class by their teachers when they can't make it because of the snow.  What other choice do we have when we can't drive or take the bus."
College Sophomore,1,"Lots of People – Mostly white, but other races are there too and some are becoming more abundant"
College Sophomore,1,It's Bad – There are never many places to park..be sure and get there early if you intend to find somewhere free to park unless you want to park out behind the football field
College Junior,1,"There are designated parking lots which require permits, and the cheapest permits are $36, and most are over $60 or close to $100 per quarter! Because campus is so spread out, you are unlikely to have parking close to all of your classes, even with a permit - so some get multiple! Your other options are meter parking, which can be far away or have short time limits, or free parking which is extremely far from most classes, and you have to come very early to get a decent spot, and count in the time to walk to class from there as well. 

Conclusion: Permits are expensive, meters are inconvenient, free parking is far away. When you are already spending so much on tuition and travel, it is a low blow to have such a parking hassle, and it is my least favorite part of coming to school."
College Sophomore,1,"Personally, I've been to better parties when I was at home than I have at Eastern. If you've been to a high school party you've been to an EWU frat party. They're all the same; same people, drinks, music, and drama. Cheney is a drag. Don't get me wrong its fun, if you're totally smashed or haven't gone out for like two months."
College Junior,1,"Lack of Transporation – I commute 70 miles (round trip) to get to class and to my practicum placement.  As a single parent and person with a disability, the lack of transportation options has become a major issue and potential barrier for me in continuing my studies and accomplishing my goals."
College Junior,1,"I fell there is a need for convenient, safe, affordable housing options for students at the Yakima program (EWU, school of social work).   Most of us are non-traditional students with families and other obligations, some traveling long distances to get to class and practicum."
College Sophomore,1,i always have to park a mile away because they charge you to park closer
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no where to park on campus. If you find a spot you are lucky to say the least.
College Junior,1,Not Really Divesre – There is very little diversity at this school. I have always realized i'm a person of color that is very obvious however; coming her actually made me notice my color for the first time. I have never thought of any of my friends as a certain race but coming here made me realize their race.
College Sophomore,1,There is very little help available for anyone who isn't on the bottom of the financial barrel who just didn't get above a 3.5. I got a 3.495 GPA in high school and therefore didn't qualify for most of the academic scholarships. It was never a pleasant experience and I gave up trying to talk to the people in the financial aid office.
College Sophomore,1,"The buses are free with your Eagle Card which is AMAZING ! They just re-did bus routes so now they are a lot better. but since Cheney is so small there is only two buses, but one goes to Spokane which is the 2nd biggest city in Washington."
College Sophomore,1,"Night LIFE – If you like to sit around, drink, n chill then you'll love Eastern. But if you like to giggg and shake what ya momma gave you then DON'T come to Eastern. The parties are WEAK, they play the same songs over n over and not too many end up being good party songs. Also many of the parties get shut down from campus or cheney police."

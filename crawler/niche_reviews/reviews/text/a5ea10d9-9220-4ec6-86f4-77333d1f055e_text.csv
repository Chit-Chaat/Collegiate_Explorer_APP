Freshman,5,Newberry  college is a good school with great teachers and a supportive staff. There is a sense of peace when on campus.
Junior,5,"I took two online courses over the summer at Newberry College. They were three-week courses and had very heavy workloads. My professors had two different teaching methods, one held class sessions via zoom four days a week and my other professor held a single conference call per week. Though both methods were different I was still able to complete the coursework with the available resources given such as notes, videos, powerpoints and examples of documents and work due. Overall the courses were insightful and taught me to take responsibility of my education. I would recommend students take online courses at Newberry College as it helps to boost GPA as well as get people ahead of required courses."
Freshman,5,"Newberry College is an amazing school academically and athletically as well. As a student athlete this is a school that l would recommend for anyone. If that is to come for a sport or for a grain education. Newberry class sizes are small, making it a more relaxed environment to learn in. Your professor know you by your first name. Making you feel more comfortable going to you professor. You are a member of the Newberry College community. Making it feel like home be able to ask your professor anything.  The students on camps are very loving and caring for one another. As a first year student at Newberry I can’t see myself leaving this amazing institution. Just everything about the school is very heart warming and very enjoyable each day as a wolf. By being on a sports team I get to meet a ton of new people each and every day on camps. The staff at Newberry is phenomenal at what they do. If you have a problem they will guide you in the right direction."
Niche User,5,"Personally, I haven't yet attended the college. I plan to start attendance Summer 2020. However, with this college, everything has been so fast when it comes to enrolling and any questions you may have. The application process went smoothly and there wasn't any hard parts about it. Every admission counselor is super helpful and they really put the students first."
Freshman,5,I like how the professors teach and I met different people here. things here at newberry is a lot easier to get to because its a small campus. Academic wise is very good . one thing at newberry I can't don't really like is walking to one of my classes because its far. another thing is having eight o'clock classes and having to make it on time. you have to turn in your assignments on the wolf den.
Freshman,5,What I like about Newberry College is how small and diverse it is. The campus is very clean and friendly staff. It makes you feel at home. You will get all the help you need as long as you apply yourself.
Freshman,5,I like the intimacy of everyone on campus. The class size is very small and your professors know you by name. The institution is in a small town and it’s quiet and peaceful. I wouldn’t change anything about this college.
Junior,5,"really good college but kind of expensive. professors are very nice and easy to understand. campus are nice and small, will never get lost."
Junior,5,"I transferred to Newberry College during the fall of 2017 and now this is my second year being there and I'm currently a junior. Newberry College is a family oriented campus, yes the campus is small but you get that one on one interaction a student needs with his or her professor. The best part of it is as a student you are not just a number!"
Junior,5,I am a junior here at Newberry College. I transferred here this Summer. I would have to say that the education here and the amount of activities that they offer here almost every week is impressive. I was most impressed with the church. The pastor is very impressive in the way he preaches. He makes church fun.
Freshman,5,"I like the diversity and culture. The instructors and staff are great to work with. The security staff keeps the campus environment staff as well as make the students feel at home 

I would like to see a bigger football stadium"
College Freshman,5,Newberry is very family oriented and the professors care about the students and I feel I is genuine.
College Junior,5,We have really good greek life and its a sisterhood or brotherhood you will never forget.
College Junior,5,"Yes I understand that Newberry College is a small school however, is uniquely personalized for each student that decides to attend Newberry. With the smaller classes the professors make sure that each student is not only getting the material but comprehending the material. They are also very available most of the time if you have other questions out side of the classroom. Being an athlete at Newberry will not stop you towards earning your degree. Schedules are planed around games, practices and competitions; therefore your professors and on board with your schedule."
College Sophomore,5,"I myself joined Greek Life when I joined the Newberry College wolf pack. It was by far the best decision I have made, Greek life at Newberry helped me gain lifelong friends, help the community, and gain leadership skills."
College Sophomore,5,"Newberry College is my home away from home. I have grown, learned, and gained many things while attending Newberry College. There is no other school I would rather spend 4 years at!"
College Sophomore,5,"I am a Kappa Delta and I would have to say that joining this sorority and going through recruitment was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Our greek life is not as big as some of the bigger schools. We have three sororities and three fraternities. Each fraternity and sorority holds about 45 girls or boys. By being a Kappa Delta, I have made some of my best friends and roommates. I did not only gain fourty plus sisters, I gained a home away from home. I could come to these girls about anything and they would listen. Greek life is not about the parties or the sterotype, its about the brotherhood or sisterhood you have between each other. Each fraternity or sorority has a phanlathrophy. As a Kappa Delta, ours is Girl Scouts of America. We host girl scout evetns at the college and get to interact with the girl scouts and do activities with them. If I had could do it all over again, I would not change a thing about being a greek."
College Freshman,5,Almost the whole student body is athletes
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is awesome!!! Only the fraternity's have houses but that's not really an issue. Although, the Greek community sticks to itself for the most part."
College Freshman,5,The diversity is great! We have a student diversity week that promotes the campus diversity.
College Freshman,5,I love my school. Its a giant family with a small town feel. I would recommend it to any and everyone.
College Freshman,5,Easy and well run. No problems at all
College Sophomore,5,I am a Chemistry/ Biochemistry major it isn't easy buts its challenging and worth the time in effort that you put in. But the professors are willing to put in the work to help every student get through the hard wok and there are a lot of programs that interact with the major. 
College Sophomore,5,The athletics at the school is awesome and I am apart of the lacrosse team at my school and i love it.
College Sophomore,5,We are a very international friendly school with over 20 different countries represented here! I feel as though our school is very diverse and there is not a problem that follows that truth. Acceptance is high and favored here.
College Freshman,5,"the small class sizes and religious aspect of the school are very valuable, you make friends easily and quickly and you never want to go home because you are afraid you will miss out on the fun."
College Sophomore,5,Many awesome majors at Newberry college mine is Nursing
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is very important at Newberry college. One reason I thing Greek life is very important to have and be involved in is because you do community service with girls that you can consider to be your second sisters.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school because your classes are small and there are less destractions around unlike USC. I came to Newberry to get a college degree and work hard to recieve it. I also enjoy the college life but school is a very important thing to me that I want to suceed in.
College Freshman,5,"I am a freshman Graphic Design major and I have had a wonderful experience so far here at Newberry. Tania Sosiak is an exemplary, organized and prompt graphic design professor and she knows where to find internships if we would like them."
College Freshman,5,My senior year I will be a student teacher. They do not get paid but it takes a lot of time.
College Freshman,5,I love the communications department and all of the staff. There is great technology we get to use and practice on.
College Freshman,5,"Newberry's residence halls are awesome, yes some are better than others but they all make you feel like home."
College Freshman,5,Academics are very important at Newberry! The faculty and staff are willing to go out of their way to ensure our academic success!
College Freshman,5,"The facilities at Newberry College are very nice! They have plenty of places where you can study and hang out with friends, such as subway, the library, the quad, and the fountain. The Student Center is always wanting to make sure we are successful and are always offering tutoring sessions and writing assistants. There are plenty of fields and green spaces where you can enjoy the outdoors, the perfect place to study and hang out with friends!"
College Freshman,5,Communications is a great major! You start working towards your major classes immediately! There are so many great classes you can get in to that will help you pick the right field for you!
College Sophomore,5,The Financial Aid department at Newberry College is MAGNIFICENT! I had a lot of issues with my FAFSA and my Financial Aid counselor corrected those issues and in turn got me more money! I don't know what I would have done without their help!
College Senior,5,Varsity Athletes make up the majority of the student population here at Newberry College. Not only does the entire student body get involved in athletic events on campus but we have a great turn out from the community also. We have numerous sports that students can participate in and we just added women's field hockey to the list.
College Freshman,5,"Doesn't tolerate anything unacceptable. No alcohol, drug use, or shenanigans."
College Sophomore,5,They do a lot to keep students in check. School comes first to everyone here and thats how it should be
Freshman,4,My online experience with Newberry college has been amazing so far and the classes have been going nicely and interactive.
Junior,4,"Newberry has a very inclusive and friendly campus; the students there are super supportive of each other and help make the campus atmosphere what it is. The professors, office workers and campus staff are also very kind and helpful to the students. They make everyone feel welcome and like they are at a family members house; unlike other campuses where you might get homesick, I felt right at home. There are some changes that I would like to see on campus such as better parking for everyone, more interaction with the residents of Newberry and more opportunities for scholarships from the school."
Senior,4,"Due to COVID-19, all Newberry College classes were moved online. This transition was very challenging and took time for adjustment. Personally, I learn best in the classroom setting. While Newberry offers online classes, I prefer on campus learning. This particularly has to do with the Nursing department since classes are all on campus. Once the online transition took place, I used my Internet resources to access the virtual learning classroom. Professors kept in touch via email. All homework and class assignments were uploaded on the Newberry College Wolf Den account. To keep the classroom setting, many professors used Skype as a way to video chat students. This made learning more virtual and we as students were able to pretend that we were in the classroom setting. Online classes are very challenging and can be hard to keep up with. With eager and willing professors who engage with their students, I was able to excel in all my classes and continue to advance my education."
Senior,4,"Newberry College is a small college in the middle of a town called Newberry. This college has a warm, welcoming feeling where all students feel at home. This year will be my fourth year attending Newberry and I can say that it was one of my best decisions I could have made. Coming from a small town, Newberry had a welcoming feeling that made me feel like I belonged. This diverse college has offered me multiple opportunities to make me grow as a leader and as a student. There are many clubs and organizations provided to all students where anyone is welcomed to join. The staff is wonderful and always willing to make the most out of your time at Newberry College. You do not feel like a stranger, rather you feel like a part of a family. If it were not for Newberry College I would not be the student and person that I am today."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID-19 many of my classes were online. This was my first time having to take a college class online. I was very nervous and never scared about my new way of learning. My professor did an outstanding job with teaching online. They really made sure the transition was easy for the students and for themselves as well. Make sure the students were organized with the new assignments. Also, gave us enough time to complete our work. Making our lives easier as a student that’s going through a hard time. Also our teachers were very flexible with their schedules if we had any questions about warrant or any assignments."
Freshman,4,I love how the professors make sure you are on top of your assignments and make sure you’re doing everything you can to pass.
Freshman,4,"Newberry college is a great college to go to, especially if you aren’t looking to go to a big college or university. It’s pretty small compared to other colleges so it’s better because you can interact with professors and classmates better!"
Junior,4,This is my second year attending Newberry College and all I can say is good things. The Teachers and admin staff are always there to help with any questions or need you may have. Class sizes are small enough that you feel like you are getting one on one with your teachers. Looking forward to my next two years.
Senior,4,"My overall experience with Newberry College has been nothing less then a great one. I love the school so much, because of its diversity and the simple fact that there is a great amount of safety on the campus. I have met new friends here that will last a lifetime. One of the things i like most, is that the school holds required activities so that students do interact with each other and do participate in school events. The professors are known on a one to one basis, so it is really easy to connect with them and ask questions about lessons or upcoming assignments and things of that nature."
Junior,4,I enjoy Newberry. I like my classes and professors. I wish there was more to do but in a small town its difficult.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman softball player at Newberry College.  I have loved every minute of being here. One of the reasons I chose to make Newberry College my home for the next 4 years was because of the one on one interaction with professors. You aren't just a number here.
Sophomore,4,i liked the class size and the fact that tutors were always available and you could also meet with the teachers during or outside of the office hours.
Junior,4,Newberry College is such a wonderful campus full of faculty and staff dedicated to our learning. You’re always meeting new people and making new friends.
Junior,4,"Overall I have enjoyed my time here, but if I had to do it all over again I would not have attended the College. There are so many things the college needs to improve on, and make better for the students."
Sophomore,4,I really love Newberry College. It has a great history and the campus is really small so I feel safe at all times.  The only thing that I would change about the college is the dorm rooms.  They need updating and remodeled really bad.  The furniture is old and falling apart and some of the dorms have mold issues.
Freshman,4,"Newberry College really fosters a feeling and an environment of home and family. The administration here really goes out of their way to really get to know you and help you in any situation so that you never feel like just a number. If I could change one thing, it would be to have more modern buildings."
Sophomore,4,"Newberry College offers a multitude of scholarships, challenging courses, and professors that are easy to contact. It lacks in the housing and dining aspects, as most of the buildings on campus are extremely outdated and are in need of renovations. As a small school that lacks the funding it deserves, Newberry College exceeds the typical expectations. The professors and staff are always eager to assist their students and alumni."
College Freshman,4,Its been a great experience getting to know my room mate and adjusting to my new living situation. There are lots of fun things to do and the student body tries to provide engaging activities to do every week.
College Freshman,4,Greek life creates a sense of welcome and family for some. Its a part of life for many that is like an extension of family. I feel that at Newberry College  there is no separate view of Greeks and there is no special Greek housing on campus.
College Freshman,4,There is a great variety of athletics on campus. Being a small school the students come together along with the community to support all sports. The school is in the process of updating some of our facilities which will  help the enhancement  of our fan experience.
College Freshman,4,"Everyone seems really nice. Professors are helpful and the course work is very challenging. Definitely a place to expand socially, academically, and mentally."
College Freshman,4,The nursing program is very intensive but it well worth it in the end!
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the class sizes! That just really makes me happy!
College Freshman,4,I'm on an athletic team and I really enjoy the opportunity!
College Freshman,4,I'm overly excited about attending Newberry College! Enjoying my first year of college here!
College Junior,4,We're 2 mins from the City of Newberry Police Department & campus security is constantly riding around. I feel our campus should be ranked one of the safest campuses compared to others.
College Junior,4,Everything revolves around athletics! School spirit is at an all time high! Teams support each other during their off season. If you're an athlete you're privileged. Over 70% of the students there are athletes.
College Junior,4,I would choose this school again because it's small which means the professors know you by name and not just a number. It gives you the opportunity to get to know your professor and get that one on one help if needed.
College Senior,4,I think they do a pretty good job at keeping the students safe and secure.
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of the security is nice and active. Some are mean. I actually do feel safe
College Senior,4,So far my experience at Newberry College has been great if I could I would relive my freshman experience. I made lots of friends and got really close with my professors. I was shocked to see that professors were so friendly and actually cared about you as a student. The small classes honestly made it easier to concentrate and stay focused. Also i feel like Newberry is a family environment. My college experience has been amazing with different events that Newberry holds that makes the whole experience unforgettable. If I had it to do over again I would say yes to Newberry College over again.
College Sophomore,4,So far my experience has been really good.  There is a variety of courses offered and the class sizes are great.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe at Newberry.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Newberry because it is a small school and community where everybody knows each other and it's not at all overwhelming like a bigger school would be.  You feel like family at Newberry with your professors, your advisors and your teammates. ( I play soccer).  It also feels safe to be at Newberry, you never hear about bad things happening there like you do at bigger campuses.  I am looking forward to my next 3 years at Newberry!"
College Sophomore,4,"Newberry College does a great job at getting students, athletes of other sports, and professors involved in every sport on campus. The athletic Facilities are great and are used well."
College Sophomore,4,"we have had some problems on campus about crime, but I felt secure and safe on campus. they required us to have a walking buddy when walking at night and had hours that we had to be in the dorms, only for the short period of time in which the crime was going on. the security is very helpful and would do anything to protect this campus."
College Sophomore,4,I love the professors at this school. they are very dedicated and always offer help to students that need them. You can come to them whenever you need help and always give advice if you need help. They are strongly dedicated to their subject. The class sizes are mostly like high school classes. they are small but accommodating.  we have a wide variety of courses that are offered.
College Sophomore,4,"Newberry College Athletics is one of the most important activities on campus. Our football team is moderately good. They had somewhat of a rough season, but coming to a football game and seeing all of the fans that attend, you would think the team has gone undefeated. Newberry athletics has some of the most supportive fans. Cheerleading has won two national titles and going for another this year. Our baseball team and softball team has done pretty well this season and has a lot of support from fans. For school spirit, we host mid-night madness to start off the basketball season. This activity is like a pep rally, but at mid-night. The whole school comes out included professors and watch the basketball teams scrimmage. Its a great way to kick off basketball season and get in the school spirit. Athletic facilities are not the very best, but it fits our school well. We do not have what popluar D1 schools have, but we have facilities that we use and are adaptable. I would have to say that the athletics at Newberry provide a lot for the college."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience at Newberry College so far, even though it is only 15 minutes away from home. I came to Newberry for cheerleading (which we have won two national titles) and the nursing program. I have really enjoyed cheerleading, but unfortunately it will come to an end after this semester so that I can focus on school and my future career as a nurse. I have joined that Kappa Delta sorority in which I have made some of my best friends and roommates. I enjoy the service we do as a sorority for this school and promoting confidence to girls around the world. Newberry has given me so many great opportunities and some of the best memories that I will keep forever."
College Freshman,4,The older housing is alright but the newer facilities are great and more are to come!
College Freshman,4,"The small classes are good for one-on-one attention. If you email your teachers, the almost always email you back within a few hours or the day. The teachers are well educated and very helpful."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are very good. I like the way that they teach and care about their students. However, some professors are very bad at keeping the grades accurate."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of alumni on campus. They are always helping out and giving tips.
College Freshman,4,All of the greek life are very nice and responsible in their actions. They are welcoming to outside students.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere at my school! Even though it is small it's scenery is definitely a plus, and the teachers and students are very helpful when it comes to needing extra help or if you have a question or if you even just need someone to talk to. I love that the teachers are willing to help with work after hours and they will stay and help until you understand everything! My school is great; while it is small it makes up for that with its personality. The school always has something new going on and it is a very enjoyable environment!"
College Freshman,4,The school policies are very strict and definitely enforced. The academics and policies are very important.
College Freshman,4,"TKE has the best parties. Honestly the impact is very bad. Weed, lots of alcohol, and many other forms of drugs are present. But, overall they are fun to attend in terms of hanging out and dancing."
College Junior,4,There is not many internship opportunities that our school helps with. You are pretty much on your own when trying to figure out what classes to take and how to get them all in without staying here longer then normal. The biology program is a fairly good one. The teachers work with what they have to help give us all the information they can.
College Junior,4,"Some dorms are way better then others, and the cost for all the dorms are ridiculously expensive."
College Sophomore,4,"I love it, I always want to be a preschool teacher so I'm excited."
College Sophomore,4,I love to live on campus ! It's a great experience.
College Student,4,"There are two bars in town that are awesome, on Wednesdays Bar III has trivia night.  The other bar, Pour Richards, is always crowded on the weekends.  They are both a lot of fun, but have very different crowds, the greeks tend to go to Pour Richards and everyone else goes to Bar III."
College Freshman,4,Getting into your program is easy and the advisers make sure you take the right classes
College Freshman,4,The business professors are very knowledgeable and will go out of their way to help you in any way possible
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is great, 70% of students are athletes"
College Freshman,4,Pretty lenient as long as you are safe.
College Freshman,4,Small friendly town in the backwoods. Charming
College Freshman,4,"For a small school, the nightlife is great."
College Freshman,4,The academics are one of the best things about the school.
College Freshman,4,"Newberry is a great college.  The people, the events, and the school in general make it a wonderful experience."
Junior,2,Newberry College is a bad experience in itself. The redeeming factor is the people you meet due to the small class size and the fact that everyone is also suffering due to the low quality of life here.
College Senior,2,I hate the sororities here. There are no African American sororities.
College Senior,2,The only bad part about newberry is that it is small. the more expensive houses have a lot of room but the average ones are small and tight. The social atmosphere is fun and exciting to live near friends
College Sophomore,2,"The freshman dorms are in dire need of renovations.  They are very old and very tiny.  In the freshman dorms there is not even a sink in your room.  You have to go down the hall for everything, even to rinse out a cereal bowl, wash your face, etc.  The beds and the furniture are also very old.  Doesn't seem like the sophomore dorms are much better.  I realize that it is an older college and I love the history at Newberry but a little renovations could go a long way."
College Junior,2,They are not strict at all.
College Junior,2,We do not have many options off campus besides the typical fast food. McDonalds is really they only thing that stays open late. There is no where that offers healthy eating options.
College Junior,2,I myself am not aware of any programs or who to go to if there is a crime of sexual assault or anything like that. I would assume there is someone to talk to.
College Freshman,2,"I hate the roommate matching system because they really dont read what you want to have on your roommate application, and also the dorms have mold and they arent very clean. the showers break down alot, no soap in the bathroom, fines suck. And the social part is the best cause you meet so many friends"
College Junior,2,"A lot of students I know drink. It seems to be the only thing for them to do. I don't drink, personally, but a lot of other students do. And a lot of them admit to smoking marijuana. I don't do that either, but I have noticed some of my fellow classmates attending class with bloodshot eyes and others making comments, ""oh, he's high."""
College Junior,2,"The parking is not very convenient for commuter students. You can pay to have your own space, but on-campus students get first choice, so you may end up getting a space that is far from the buildings where you have classes."
College Freshman,2,The current athletics are wonderful but if they offered more sports it would be better.
College Sophomore,2,"There really is not a huge nightlife here. We do not have any bars in town since they closed down Blue moon last semester. We do have a few frats so one of them has a party on the weekends, especially during football season. Generally all of the Newberry students attend the frat parties since we do not have any other option here in town."
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately there is not a lot to do for the college aged group of students here in the city of Newberry. There are many fast food places, dollar stores and a walmart as the only source of grocery store. There are not shopping options nor is there a theater or bowling alley. To get any of those things you must drive at least 25 to 30 mins away. 
The locals do love the college students though and enjoy when school is in session.
Also this town is deemed the safest town in the state of South Carolina so its nice to know I am safe."
College Sophomore,2,There are only 2 options for dining on campus.  The car and subway.
College Sophomore,2,"The food is alright, I get sick of eating in the cafe all the time when I just eat the same thing. I pay for the meal plan, a lot of money for it too and I expect to get good food when I go there. Some of the food in the cafe is good tho on some days !!"
College Sophomore,2,There are some areas of strictness and others that are super lax. Alcohol in the dry dorms result in some serious consequences and drugs are not tolerated. My school is super serious about the honor code as well- it usually results in the removal of that student. An area that is pretty non existent are visitation hours. Anyone can come stay with you as long as they do not stay 3 consecutive nights. I think this rule is somewhat strange since we are a Lutheran affiliated school.
College Junior,2,"The Education Department overall is great. The faculty and staff stress the importance of getting out into the field early. As time consuming as the department is, faculty and staff do not make sure candidates graduate on time. Candidates are always slipping through the crack with core requirements and as a result graduate later than expected or not at all."
College Junior,2,"It is hard to live off campus, regardless of the year in school you are, because the college almost makes a dictatorship out of it, and makes it nearly impossible to live off campus. you have to write a letter petitioning living on campus and come up with a reason... and it's annoying. There are plenty of houses in the Newberry community that are for sale/rent and available to students, the school just works hard to prevent it."
College Junior,2,"I think the people of Newberry are nice overall, and food places are nice to the college kids with discounts and deals, but I think there there isn't very much in the community provided or catered to the college-clientele."
College Sophomore,2,"Though the programs are good, but the atmosphere is kinda dead. Everyone either sticks with their frat or sorority and cliques."
Alum,1,Very unhappy. Not much to do at all. Student body is not the best or kindest. Feels like a glorified community college
College Junior,1,"Needs better housing, insides need to be re-done"
Recent Alumnus,1,"They try to FORCE you to live on campus. In this way, the college treats the students like little children, which many are, actually."
Recent Alumnus,1,Loud and obnoxious. They spit in peoples' food
Recent Alumnus,1,I got ripped off by the athletic program while I was here.
Recent Alumnus,1,"While, many professors are great in the English department, most professors in other departments are bad. The food is bad. The college tries to force you to live on campus, and if you live on campus, they force you to buy a meal plan. Lots of loud dumb people. A lot of the employees are backstabbers and scammers."
College Freshman,1,"Anyone is allowed on campus and the café is open to the public. I was standing in line at the café when a grown man took a picture of my butt and sent it in a group chat.. After him being confronted by staff he took off running, we do not know what happened to him after this. It makes me feel very uncomfortable that he has a picture of my butt. Other incidents have happened on campus, including, muggings, theft, and illegal driving where I was almost hit by a car on a cross walk."
College Freshman,1,"Every hall is practically falling down, there is not enough parking, the floors are disgustingly dirty, the tile was white but is now yellow, the humidity is so bad inside the dorms that the walls get wet, the Wi-Fi never works, they charge all the students on the floor for one students mistake, the bathrooms are constantly covered in urine and vomit, one out of the six showers work enough so you don't get burned by scorching hot water, there is mold on the ceiling above all of the showers."
College Freshman,1,"The campus is too small for campus transportation but having a car is very convenient. If there are students are like me who don't own a car, it's hard to get around if your friends aren't willing to take you."
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing to do in Newberry.  The town was supposed to get a bowling alley and movie theater, but the plans fell through.  The closest mall and movie theater is 45 minutes away.  We call the Wal-Mart the mall, because that is the closest thing to entertainment."
College Junior,1,we have absolutely nothing for students to go to and from school and to downtown
College Junior,1,Greek Life is almost non existant because there are barely any sororities and fraternities. The parties are somewhat okay but they need to upgrade
College Freshman,1,There isnt many places to live around newberry. Off campus housing is very slim and ninexistent
College Freshman,1,Freshman Hall Is Bad – Very bad dorms.  Dorms are in very old buildings.  Brokaw Hall is a very bad living situation.  Must share bathrooms.  Bugs are everywhere.
College Freshman,1,"Stay away from the ""freshman"" dorm at all cost. The rooms are smaller then your average closet and the walls are as thin as paper. None of the washers/dryers hardly ever work and it is impossible to get any sleep before 2 am."
College Sophomore,1,"How Greek Students Are Viewed by Non-Greeks – My girlfriend is in a sorority and i give her hell about that stuff. I am not a hater but i really dislike the greek community because they are rich lil preppy kids who think they run the world. they think they are all popular and stuff but behind their backs everybody laughs at them. Well im kinda glad for some sororities though cause they help us to seperate the girls. And narrow down all the preppy rich girls in one group, retarded blondes in one group, and the real girls who are average, smart, sweet, and ""real"" in one group. and then the frats are all gay. We are only glad to have them because they throw great parties. And thats not even all of them..."
College Sophomore,1,"Fan Support – As an athlete all i can say is that when it comes to athletics, students at newberry are narrow minded. They only support football and basketball and no other sport. Its terrible as a soccer player to be at games and only see parents and the reserve team sitting and watching. it kills momentum when the visiting team has more supporters than the home team."
College Sophomore,1,"Athletic Facilities – Newberry College has great potential in athletics but the school does not provide substantial facilities for most sports. For example, i play soccer here at Newberry College and we are having to share our soccer field with the softball team. WE should have our own facility. Tennis players also have to deal with badly surfaced courts. The high school courts in this town are nicer than the college's which is pathetic."
College Sophomore,1,The only transportation available is taxi's or drive yourself.  Nothing else is available.
College Student,1,"Strictness Is Not Carried Out to It's Fullest Potential – Even though there are signs all over the place saying what could happen, the truth is that hardly anyone pays it any attention. People underage drink in the doorms all the time. People are always loud in the doorms even when it's way past quiet hours. However, if someone is parked in the wrong spot for too long they are quick to give them a ticket of put a boot on their car. The rules are carried out uneven here."

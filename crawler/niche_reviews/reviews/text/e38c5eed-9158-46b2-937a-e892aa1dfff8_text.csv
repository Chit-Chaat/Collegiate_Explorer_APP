Junior,5,"Bemidji state is awesome, I honestly can't say anything bad about it. It's in a bigger town but it has such a small town connected feeling to it. Bemidji feels like home."
Junior,5,I love the diversity of BSU and I love their extended learners program that they offer. I just wish the online programs were more accessible.
Sophomore,5,What I like about Bemidji State is that you feel really welcome by the other students and staff. there is a lot of fun activities and you meet really cool people and create friends that you can study with and just have someone to talk too if you need.
Junior,5,The professors are very friendly and you can tell that they enjoy teaching the subjects/classes that they teach. All of the professors that I have had so far have been amazing and you can tell that they want to us to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I haven't attended classes at BSU yet. I have had a wonderful experience working with the advisers. The staff from the records department, financial aid, CEL, and the advisers have all been extremely helpful sorting out the mess that was my application and financial aid approval process. They are efficient and know what to do to smooth out the bumps in the road."
Freshman,5,Absolutely stunning campus right on the lake! The people are amazing and the overall atmosphere is none like any other.
Alum,5,No other school can you park your car on the lake in the winter or study outside in the summer by the lake. The location of campus is serene. For a small town school the athletics are where some of the best started out.
Junior,5,"I love the environment on campus! Everyone is very welcoming and friendly. Also the professors and staff on campus really are looking out for you, making sure that you are able to get any help you may need."
Freshman,5,"I am basing this on my orientation and my first week of school. The three words I can think of is I Love it here. Very welcoming, organized, awesome atmosphere, the city is beautiful and I love the outdoors. 

That’s about all I can say since I’ve only been here for almost a week now! 
Go Beavers!"
Junior,5,Literally the best experiences so far. I love the view of the lake and being able to walk to my classes because I love on campus. The teachers are pretty great too!
Freshman,5,"As a BSU freshman, I have so far loved my experience here in Bemidji at the university. The professors are outstanding and are very helpful if you go to them for any sort of help. The campus itself is beautiful and easy to navigate. There are so many different events such as sporting events, speakers, and entertainment. The only thing I'd change about BSU is possibly adding even more events on weekends like different games. They could add a scavenger hunt or any other related game just to keep students less bored or even do it during the week. OTher than that I honestly don't know what I'd change about BSU."
Freshman,5,"Bemidji has a beautiful campus right on the lake with a ton of trees. There’s lots to do from hiking, kayaking, good food to eat, and lots of other activities downtown. Everyone is so friendly and helpful in making your time on campus successful. The professors are very thourough and everything is easy to access through E-Services and D2l. I love Bemidji State!"
Sophomore,5,Great classes and degrees offered at BSU.  I love the size of the campus and the proximity to everything.  It's been an overall positive experience so far.  I even belong to a few clubs.
Junior,5,"I have had an amazing experience at Bemidji State University. The college community it so close and you can see that the professors really care about you. They always seem to have events going on, and provide many ways for students to get to meet one another. The only thing I would change is some of the food. Otherwise it is an amazing school and an amazing campus."
Sophomore,5,I love that the University is right on the lake. It's a beautiful campus plus if you don't want to walk outside in the winter you can take the tunnels that they offer.
Senior,5,If you like the outdoors this is the place for you. The campus is beautiful and people are nice. The ratio of instructors to students is such that you feel that the instructors care about your performance in the class. The online options are also great.
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful. The staff and students overall are nice and really helpful. One of the greatest things are the tunnels that you can take during cold/rainy weather so you hardly have to go outside to get from class to class.
Freshman,5,"I love Bemidji State University. It has a beautiful Northern campus for those who love the outdoors or just like a lake view! It has a great atmosphere, everyone is very kind ,helpful and down to earth. The professors I’ve had so far a great and are very easy to work with and helpful!"
Freshman,5,I love the community. it makes you feel at home. I love the size of the campus its not to big nor to small. the lake is also one of the best parts. the thing I would like to see change is for the school to set up more events for people.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful and right on the lake. It is basically like my small town at home but with a lot more people around. There's a mall and tons of restaurants in the town. There is so much stuff you can do outside and at the lake. School isn't too bad, the professors are all really helpful. The dorms are super fun, they are small but it's cool because your friends are right next door. The food is pretty good. It can get repetitive but it's a buffet every time. There are a bunch of jobs on campus and intramural sports. The gym is pretty nice; we got new equipment this year! You can walk to all your classes and the tuition is one of the lowest in the state. Overall, I wouldn't have picked a different college."
Freshman,5,"I have just got accepted and just last Friday filled out my class schedule, I am SOOO EXCITED to become a beaver at BSU!! They help me with anything i have questins with and are always relilable."
Niche User,5,"My visit to Bemidji State University was amazing. As soon as I stepped on campus I was at home; the students and staff there are all so welcoming and friendly. If you want to go to a smaller college with one of the best environments, in my opinion, then you should take the time to look at Bemidji State."
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman at Bemidji State University this year and i have absolutely loved my time here so far. BSU is awesome because of its small class sizes and it's easy to feel like you know a lot of people wherever you go. They are really good about putting together programs to keep you entertained and to help your transition to college life be very smooth.
Junior,5,I love Bemidji State because of the scenery and the students as well as the professors are all helpful.
Freshman,5,"What I like about this school is that no matter where you are on the campus, you are always going to be connected to the outdoors. Either just by walking to class, spending time in a study lounge you will always notice the way the school connects with the outdoors. I also enjoy how much the professors want their students to succeed. They are always encouraging their students come to them if they need help or have any questions. You can always find something to major or minor in here and will make it their first priority to get you into the classes you need to succeed and to graduate on time. Overall the school has everything you could ever want to do or learn about and will make it easy for you to get the help you need when you need it. "
Alum,5,BSU is a great school. Classes are difficult but Professors try to make even boring information fun. The Campus is beautiful! It is great to sit lakeside working on homework.
College Freshman,5,I am still a student here and cannot wait to firther my education with bemidji state. The courses offered are designed to enable you to do a specific job path or career once out of college.
College Freshman,5,Currently on the track team and i find that the teammates are very welcoming and inviting to newest athletes. The athletic fscilities are being updated to meet the needs of the athletes who need to gain muscle for their sports.
College Sophomore,5,"Bemidji State is recognized for its superb baccalaureate, graduate, and online programs. They offer more than 60 undergraduate degrees, 14 graduate programs, and ample online/distant learning options."
College Sophomore,5,There is a wide range of diversity on campus and may be the highest diverse University up north.
College Sophomore,5,The drug scene is extremely frowned upon and consequences will be severe. Policy enforcement is swift. There is zero tolerance for usage and peer pressure.
College Sophomore,5,There is more to the nightlife at my school than just the parties and the bar/club scene. There are so many activities to do that your head spins. There is something for everyone in every department giving you a lot of opportunities to make new friends.
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is close to downtown bars that usually are crowded on the weekends. Bemidji has the 8th most liquor stores per capita, and the 10th most bars in the state."
College Sophomore,5,The faculty and students are extremely helpful and will answer any question you may have or point you in the right direction when you get lost. It is a pretty big campus after all.
College Sophomore,5,There is a wide range of diversity on campus. Probably the most diverse University up north.
College Sophomore,5,Using any drug and alcohol on campus is frowned up. There are consequences if not followed.
College Sophomore,5,Bemidji State provides a wide variety of internships to BSU students. Career Services is a full suite of internship resources and the Internship Database explores the full breadth of opportunities BSU offers.
College Sophomore,5,"Professors double as mentors and are qualified as well as experienced in the courses they teach. You will receive individualized attention and thoughtful guidance. They will ensure you learn the values of critical thinking, creative problem solving, clear communication and responsible citizenship."

College Sophomore,5,Outstanding programs in Business and Accounting
College Sophomore,5,3rd time receiver of the Sportsmanship Award
Recent Alumnus,5,campus is not huge at all. If something was to happen there are various emergency buttons around campus. Public safety is always on duty and it is very easy to get to them as well.
Recent Alumnus,5,first year residence buildings are not as bad as other colleges. After your first year housing options open up and the buildings are way better. higher classmate dorms are extremely nice for the price.
College Freshman,5,I don't feel unsafe on this campus at all. It's a very safe place to be.
College Freshman,5,The housing is great here on campus and I enjoyed my experience.
College Freshman,5,The athletes at this school are a huge part of the college.
College Freshman,5,I really enjoy this school. If you are a person who likes small towns than this is a place for you.
College Junior,5,This school puts so much effort into making you feel welcome and comfortable. There is always people available to help you when needed. Professors are generally nice and easy to talk to. The classes are a lot of fun too.
College Freshman,5,"After being st BSU for 3 months, my view of the school has not changed."
College Sophomore,5,Bemidji State University is best school I can imagine.
College Freshman,5,I love living off campus and being close enough to campus that I don't have to drive everyday.
College Junior,5,"I had trouble trying to figure out all the necessary paperwork I needed for my transfer, where I could get  it, and how I was gonna be able to get released, not to mention in time for classes. - But the staff at the college were VERY helpful & patient, taking time out of their schedule to walk you through anything!"
College Junior,5,Everything is very clean and I love being in each of the areas!
College Junior,5,Its very easy to find everything.
College Junior,5,It was wonderful and the staff member who helped me did a wonderful job!
College Junior,5,Everyone is very friendly and I am very excited to go to this college in the fall!
College Senior,5,Bemidji is the perfect college town. There are student discounts everywhere and there is a mix between both food chains and local hot spots with amazing food.
College Senior,5,I love the professors and they have definitely prepared me as I move onto graduate school in the fall. Absolutely no regrets on my decision to attend BSU.
College Senior,5,"I loved almost everything about BSU, the professors are awesome and they know you by name. Class sizes are small which makes it easy to build relationships. I could never regret the education I have received from BSU."
Junior,4,"Due to covid, lecture has been mainly online. The professors have mostly done a very good job in transferring learning to the online setting. It's just difficult for myself to participate in online learning due to personal reasons but BSU has done a very good job at rolling with the punches"
Niche User,4,"Great professors, has a few nice building and good food options. They also have an entire tunnel system underground so you can get to all your classes without ever having to go outside, which is great in the winter. However, some building is a bit outdated, the wellness center is far away from everything and it's not worth it to buy a parking pass, but it isn't ideal parking on the street either."
Freshman,4,There's tons of things to do and there's so many clubs or other activities you can join its really easy to make friends and occupy your time. The teachers are also pretty amazing.
Sophomore,4,"Bemidji State University is a nice campus. They recently rebuilt one of the buildings so it is brand new. There are underground tunnels so walking in winter is not a problem. The professors care about their students and Bemidji State offers many opportunities to get to know other students. There are events like Bingo, surveys, and other opportunities to win food and gift cards."
Sophomore,4,"It’s a great school with a great atmosphere , on beautiful lake Bemidji ! Love the professors and staff. Excited to be here ."
Junior,4,"It’s a good school and great location next to the lake, with nice professors and a variety of services available to help you succeed"
Sophomore,4,"Bemidji has a BEAUTIFUL campus during all seasons. There are a lot of activities to do around here too, indoors and outdoors. Although I wish I saw more diversity at the school."
Sophomore,4,It is an absolutely beautiful campus. Being right on the lake is amazing and there are many activities to do. It is a smaller university but anything is bigger then my hometown! Great programs and even better people.
Junior,4,"Bemidji State University is a beautiful campus located right next to lake Bemidji. If you enjoy being outdoors, Bemidji State is definitely the college for you. The college provides multiple classes and activities that allow you to enjoy the northern atmosphere."
Senior,4,I love that Bemidji State is small enough to be more then just a number with the teachers. It makes you feel more like a human and not a number!
Junior,4,"Bemidji is a great school that has a small town feel, but is a home away from home. Most of the professors I've had are always there to support and push me to be the best professional. I've also gotten to know and love the Bemidji community which has helped me grow into an adult."
Sophomore,4,"The staff and professors are highly educated and teach in a way that really accomodats it's student's.
Going to Bemidji state University really changed my life and I can't wait to be a BSU graduate."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman in college and so far the experience has been wonderful. Between the upperclassmen and the professors this school really wants you to succeed. It's a very welcoming and open campus for everyone. They are really big on student safety. Their motto is SOS- Save our Students, and are constantly giving out bracelets to push the issue further. I am very happy I decided to start my college journey here."
Sophomore,4,"Very cute smaller school in a rural community. Academics are pretty good, would love to see a wider variety of courses or one specific area that puts us on the map."
Sophomore,4,I really like Bemidji  State University. It's close to home so it was an easy choice but I do feel like I'm getting my money's worth with my education. The professors and staff have always been kind and helpful. It's a beautiful campus and the underground tunnels are a lifesaver in the winter. They have lots of activities during the year and overall it's a nice atmosphere.
Junior,4,Small scale university that has many opportunities and clubs to fit in with. Beautiful lake view with great professors who are easy to talk to and makes you feel like you are getting the education you deserve!
Alum,4,The campus is pretty easy to navigate but parking can be a headache. They sell more permits than spots available so most lots fill up. Street parking can be tough too and you can end up walking over 15 blocks to get to class in 20 below weather. The business school is nice and a lot of the teachers are really laid back and willing to help if you ever have questions.
Junior,4,"I love BSU. It was my number one choice for higher education. I love the smaller campus and the feel on campus. The teachers and students are such wonderful people. The campus is on the lake, so football games in the spring and summer months are fun and beautiful."
Alum,4,I liked the location of the campus as it is located on Lake Bemidji. I also liked that they offered many different majors and programs to choose from. I would like to see updates made to campus including classrooms and labs.
Freshman,4,"Bemidji State University is overall a pretty good university. In saying this however, it is way too overpriced for what you get. A lot of updates need to be made to the school in order for the cost to be accurate. The faculty does seem to care about students and one can appreciate that."
Sophomore,4,I like the professors and how they go out of their way to help the students( at least in the biology department). The diversity of people and activities is lacking and the student life( Greek life) is almost nonexistent. There is nothing that I have observed that unites the students together other than classes. Hopefully next year that changes.
Freshman,4,I joined the club rugby team which was a wonderful experience. There are all sorts of activities both on campus and in the local area to go see and do. Very outdoorsy. Lake Bemidji is available for fishing and outdoor recreation all year round. Lots of classes available in the math and science departments if that is what you are looking for.
Freshman,4,"Being a first year student at Bemidji State University has been very good. The student environment is very welcoming. The staff is great, and the overall set up of campus and classrooms is perfect. I love the Bemidji environment, and the home feeling. The only downfall for Bemidji State is the food. The dining center food is not good at all. Having a meal plan is a waste because you never want to go and use your meals, but other than the food I love Bemidji State University and would recommend it to others."
Freshman,4,"Things I love about BSU is the whole dynamic and feel of the campus, academic wings and dorm halls. All the academic wings are in one place, most of my classes have lined up between just two buildings which is great. The teachers are amazing and teach very well, whether is be a small 32 student class or lecture hall with 100 plus students. The dorms are nice, decent size rooms and pretty spacious. Its easy to make friends whether it be in classes or in the dorms or just around. Things that could change is the cleanliness of the bathrooms in the dorms, its hard when you share a bathroom with 23 girls and it only gets cleaned once a week. Another thing that would be nice is having more on campus stuff, at the beginning of the year there we dances and stuff going on. Not so much anymore as I am in second semester. BSU is a great school, its right on the lake, full of outdoorsy people."
Freshman,4,I really felt welcome and you are in such small classes and groups that if you have a problem you feel like you're able to go to your advisor or some authority figure and talk with them
Sophomore,4,"Great campus and location for those who enjoy the outdoors! Great experience so far, learned lots of things, made amazing friends, and love how close the campus is to the lake."
Freshman,4,I really love this school a lot!  wish they did more to lower their rape statistics. They have excellent teachers! They also make you feel very welcome on campus!
Recent Alumnus,4,"I haven't started at the University yet, but the community college I went to was profoundly influencing to me. I'd recommend going to a community college prior to a University, since it really sets the foundation in deciding what to do with your life. I feel like a grew up more than if I was to go straight to a University there."
College Freshman,4,There is possibility of internships and prosperities in any field youre going into here
College Freshman,4,"I have not yet seen any crime, safety violations, or anything out if the ordinary here"
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are the perfect size, depending on how many roommates. Sleeping on loft beds is great to save space but being closer to the ceiling gets a little warm sometimes. The social atmosphere is great, there are common rooms where students can go and relax and hang out"
College Freshman,4,"Being a lover of the outdoors, bemidji has been a wonderful experience because there are so many opportunities to be outside and connect with others who are into the same things as you. There are plenty of things that fit your forte here and the environment is so welcoming and everyone is wanted here. I would choose this school agaon because of my experiences and the way i can easily call it my second home"
College Freshman,4,"Generally safe and comfortable. Can be a bit scary after dark, as the campus and places around campus are poorly lit in a lt of places. Generally more comfortable on campus than the rest of the town."
College Freshman,4,"Small class sizes, so most professors know their students by name and are concerned with each individual. Most are reachable outside of class via email. Some teachers don't really care at all, while others care a lot. Choosing classes takes some research into the professor to be sure you are getting what you want out of the course."
College Freshman,4,"The school is great if you are looking for somewhere that ties in with the outdoors. Small, scenic campus that makes for short and enjoyable  travel times between classes, and lake views from almost every classroom window. Small class sizes, professors are hit or miss. Some professors are absolutely great and attentive to student needs, others don't teach subject matter effectively at all. Activities are mostly outdoor-centered or small indoor things like lunchtime karaoke or late night bingo."
College Freshman,4,"Good university. Quiet, a bit too conservative."
College Freshman,4,Overall good university. They've been cutting majors however and spending millions on stupid construction projects.
Recent Alumnus,4,Bemidji offers a lot of resources for jobs/internships and career help
Recent Alumnus,4,So far my professors have been very helpful. Since classes are not huge but not too small professors actually want to get to know you.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Big hockey school, both girls and boys also cant leave out that we are a 1st division hockey school. Football and basketballs games are fun! No matter what size our school is we try to support our teams."
College Freshman,4,"We have great athletics here at BSU that are supported by the students, staff, and community."
College Freshman,4,BSU has a lot of activities to get involved with and a lot of great people around campus to meet.
College Freshman,4,Bemidji is a great school to attend if you like the cold.
College Freshman,4,The staff and alumni are a huge part of this campus and they are all very helpful.
College Junior,4,I haven't really ever felt unsafe oncampus.
College Junior,4,I usually get into all the classes I want. The teachers are good and nice. Class sizes aren't bad at all.
College Freshman,4,There are many things offered but the largely favored classes fill up almost right away.
College Freshman,4,Our public safety officers seem to look more for giving tickets out and punishing rather than making sure students and people on campus are safe. My roommates mom came up to visit but arrived while she was still in class so decided to park in the back of the parking lot a take a nap(she didnt have a parking pass). As my roommate was walking out to her moms car she saw public safety writing a ticket. Instead of making sure this lady was okay or what she was doing they were just going to write her a ticket.
College Freshman,4,There are professors that really care about you and professors that are clearly there to teach the class and that's it.
College Freshman,4,The health & safety is great so far!
College Freshman,4,I overall like my experience at Bemidji State University!
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy all my classes & the teachers have been very helpful with my journey towards nursing.
College Junior,4,"Here at Bemidji State, I receive as much 1-on-1 time with my professors as I need. If there is any topic that I am struggling to understand, my professors are more than happy to meet with me and go over things personally. They are also extremely understanding regarding complications that may prevent attendance to their class."
College Junior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed earning my first degree here at BSU and will miss it when I move on to UND to finish my second degree in May. The students are awesome, the professors are helpful, the campus is gorgeous, and the fishing isn't too bad."
College Freshman,4,"Bemidji State University has a fantastic academic environment, and is very accommodating to students' needs. My professors are very helpful, and have met with me on multiple occasions to discuss my classes."
College Sophomore,4,"It's got everything I need, in one convenient location."
College Freshman,4,My favorite park is looking out at lake Bemidji all day. It's a great view and I'm enjoy all the activities I get to do around my college.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at College has been absolutely great. When people describe their college years they match up almost exactly to how my experience at college is going so far. I have met so many people being at college and learned so many things about myself and what I actually want instead of someone choosing for me. I love it.
College Freshman,4,"I like the options for food in Lakeside.

I am not a fan of Wally's it gets really old after the first couple of months, but they do a great breakfast."
College Freshman,4,They are strict for the better interest of us.
College Freshman,2,"Thin walls, loud neighbors. Tamarack gets great views, but the building itself is old and dreary. Kitchens and bathrooms are small and sketchy. Hot water doesn't always work during the winter months. Most of campus is connected via the tunnel system, but Tamarack and most of the other dorms are not, except for the upperclassmen dorms Linden and Birch. Dorm events are rare and boring, with very little turn out and little reason to participate."
College Freshman,2,The housing buildings are poor and it is now required to live on campus the full first year.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not a big deal at all at my school, I have met one person a part of it."
College Sophomore,2,"safety on campus is ok, we have a lot of students working for public safety"
College Sophomore,2,"I lived on campus for part of a semester, and I didn't really care for it, but it was expensive for me, but that is in comparison to me liking at home 30 min away. I just didn't make sense to stay on campus. while I did live in the dorms, it was ok not the greatest facilities and I really didn't the people on my floor. they were loud and didn't seem to care about their academic."
College Junior,2,I applied the past 4 years and have only received one scholarship.  You mainly have to have a 3.5 gpa for higher to get one.
College Senior,2,"We used to have a ""free ride"" pass for our local bus service, but due to budget cuts we now get a discounted pass."
College Senior,2,"Parking is awful on campus, there are two large permitted lots, but other then that good luck finding a spot!"
College Senior,2,We have two frats and one sorority.
College Sophomore,2,"100$ per year for on campus parking, off campus you can end up having to park up to 8 blocks away, snow removal is not very good and can cover up the painted yellow curbs or bend the no parking signs.  If you are even a HAIR into the no parking area you will get a ticket."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not live immediately off-campus, I decided to live further away and drive.  My friends who live off campus are constantly getting parking tickets because there is not enough parking and the streets side for parking changes every day (understandable in the winter for snow removal) but a pain during the summer.  Many houses for rent are abused by college students, never repaired by landlords, and rented out again for huge rent prices.  I would not live off campus near the campus."
College Junior,2,The night life is not great. The bars are trashy and do not have much an exciting night.
College Junior,2,"The weather is not that great here in northern Minnesota. The winters are cold, snowy, and no matter the time of the year windy."
College Freshman,2,Parties are not very large and not really popular. Night life consists of Applebee's Neighborhood Bar and Grill.
College Junior,2,It is always cold walking to my classes.
College Senior,2,"Bessies and Trolls, the whole lot of them. A few good lookers mixed throughout, but the rumor mills that are rampant in Midwest life make those few out to be nymphomaniacs/psycho/damaged goods."
College Senior,2,"The STEM studies are continuing to decline at this school, but it is growing its focus on Business and Education majors. Definitely not a research institution, despite claims otherwise. I really don't think they should have the accreditation to issue half the Master's degrees they do."
College Senior,2,"Most everything is located within a couple of miles from the campus, so walking is easy. Bemidji is a small town."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few taxi companies around Bemidji and there's a city bus line. Not really sure about the cost for taxis, but the bus line costs between $1 and $1.50/ride, and a semester pass for students is $20. The only problems is that there's not really a set schedule for the bus, there may be only one bus, so you may end up waiting for half an hour for more."
College Freshman,2,"Being in northern Minnesota, you can expect cold and snow for most of the academic year. The freshman dorms are about a half mile away from the academic buildings, so it gets cold and slippery if you walk to class, but we do have underground tunnels that were made especially for the winters. If you live off campus, there's always the chance that you could get your car buried by the plows after a heavy snow"
Niche User,1,"It doesn’t matter if you’re coming in as a Sophomore, Junior, or Senior – if you’re  a transfer student, you are now being treated as being less than freshman. You’ve been in college, you know how things work, and yet your undeniable worth is now being degraded as being that of a newbie who doesn’t know the first thing about what’s going on in college."
College Freshman,1,I have no interest in the greek life at bemidji
College Freshman,1,Almost nonexistent. Most students don't even know there is Greek life on campus. Only seen during club recruitment days.
College Junior,1,Most of the houses are junky and have horrible landlords that overcharge.
College Sophomore,1,There is a Bemidji Bus that you can call to add you to the route.  Costly.  Taxis are costly.
College Sophomore,1,"Either your friends, yourself, taxi, biking, or walking."
College Senior,1,"Parking by the academic halls is very, VERY limited in lots.  Most parking is on the street and there is street calendar parking in place which is strictly enforced.  My husband received MULTIPLE tickets while in college an even had a boot placed on his jeep."
College Junior,1,"The school gives little financial aid. $500 for Dean's List and a little more for a perfect 4.0GPA. However to qualify for any other aid from the school, you must jump through blazing hoops and talk to nearly the entire admin staff to get in line."

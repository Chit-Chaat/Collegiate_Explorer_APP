Sophomore,5,"I have been attended A&M for only a year now and I love everything about the campus. I thought I was going to be homesick, because I am so far away from. However, being active on campus and being surrounded by a group of amazing peers has helped keep that to a minimum."
Sophomore,5,I liked the environment. The events are very fun and the other students are very nice. The faculty and staff were very clear for instructions and work we had to do so the class would ace the class.
Senior,5,"Alabama A&M, “The Hill” is a wonderful institution, where not only you learn from excellent professor but you find yourself, you find your friends and you reach your goals. A&M can have better housing & WiFi this has been an issue for years, but we still love “The Hill!”."
Junior,5,"I really have enjoyed the participation of the online professors! They were very helpful and prompt when needed. The Participation of other departments were prompt as well. I appreciate the immediate responses to this unknown epidemic and thanks for keeping us as safe as possible by being on top of what was going on! Also the knowledge of letting us know which direction to go and who to talk to dealing with refunds,housing,essentials and everything else. Go Bulldogs."
Junior,5,"So far my experience on the Alabama A&M Campus has been great! I love the environment, faculty & staff, and my fellow school mates. I couldn’t have chosen a better school. I am happily an A&M bulldog and proud to be able to say “GO BULLDOGS!” as well."
Junior,5,The online class experience was tough at first but I adjusted to it very quickly. That says a lot especially since I am a STEM major and we are required to take all of our classes physically in class. My teachers were very calm and understanding during this adjustment and worked with us students with trying to figure out the online class world.

Niche User,5,"The experience at Alabama A & M was absolutely wonderful. From the time I stepped foot into the campus tour until I left I felt at home, safe and comfortable. The campus was old but they are in the process of renovating everything, and some buildings are already renovated. The historic background was also another plus during the tour. The campus also has a spot where the founder and his wife are buried, and they still have the historic places where he was washed then sold into slavery. That was the major highlight of the tour. All f the staff and tour guides also were very nice and respectful and they were happy that we were there. They were proud that young kids were taking initiative to come to a campus tour on a Saturday morning.  All in all the tour was excellent and everyone and everything made me feel welcomed, even the students."
Freshman,5,It's a great HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). I plan to go there in the Fall 2020.

Sophomore,5,"I fought my mother tooth and nail about attending AAMU.  I wanted to go to Florida A&M so bad. One big problem, FAMU did not waive out of state fees to freshman.  AAMU did.  So I was kind of force to attend.  Long story short, that was the best decision my mother ever made.  I love  this school.  I wasn't even thinking about how far FAMU is away from St. Louis or all the things AAMU offered. I was just thinking about beaches and sunshine.  

AAMU has really shocked me in their academic offerings.  I have changed my major a few times and academic adviser has been very patience with me.   I haven't had any financial aid issues, as of yet and I'm looking forward to my last two years.  Their food is pretty good and I love staying in the new residence dorm.  It's really nice.  My only complaint is how the Cafe's are."
Sophomore,5,Im a single parent and the class schedules let me go to school and work at night. The teachers take the time to actually get to know you. I feel like we have a good relationship

Almost every student is involved with a variety of activities and moving around to gain better connections to help them during their tenure here at Alabama A&M. Academics provide a challenge that help push students to become smarter and more alert with their school work.
Freshman,5,"Alabama A&M is an amazing to attend. It's plenty of activity to do. A lot of chances to meat new people on campus. The bathrooms are kept very clean in the traditional dorms.

Graduate Student,5,My experience has been good at this HBCU. I did undergrad here and now I’m in graduates school for social work. I have learned so much here and met a lot of diversity. The program I’m in is very popular and it’s intriguing I’m so many ways.
Sophomore,5,"In choosing a college I accept its imperative to inquire about the network at the city level as well as the network inside your chose field of study. Additionally nature of training; does my instructor really show me or educates at me. With Alabama A&M I had a solid network of educators who tried to teach me, tutor me, inspire me and prepared me to turn into a skillful social laborer today. The organization issues have improved in a few however in the event that it was flawless and simple I wouldnt be as readied for the turns and turns of grown-up life."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Alabama A&M was pretty good. It was somewhat of how I experienced my first year of college would be. It took a lot of getting used to, the people are cool.. sort of! It is very expensive though, especially for the food to taste the way it does."
Graduate Student,5,great school for young African Americans   I am new to Alabama but this school helps me feel at home and welcome in not only  the community  but also in the class room. the food is some of the best food I've eaten that is both healthy and tasty. In the class room I feel like I've learned more this past year then in my four years of undergrad.
Freshman,5,"This was my first choice for school, I loved my experiences so far other than the housing application process I would rather it be on paper than online. other than that I really love this school and love to play in the marching maroon and white band."
Junior,5,Alabama A&M University is a wonderful school. At this university you have an opportunity to have a 1:20 student ratio. I love that the most about the school. The professors really care about you.
Freshman,5,Alabama Agricultural and Mechenical University is an awesome HBCU that cares about their students future's start here and go anywhere.
Freshman,5,"I like the diversity and the strong connections amongst the students and staff at Alabama A&M University. The experience on campus is beautiful and all around welcoming. The only thing I would change is the length of classes. Some classes are almost an hour and a half long, but the professors don't teach for that extended period of time. Other than that Alabama A&M University is an excellent school."
Freshman,5,The campus has a lot of history behind it. Alabama A&M offers a diverse culture with a lot of ways to connect with different people. The academics are stellar and could not be better. Everybody's work ethic is second to none because they all want to succeed once they graduate college. The student life is a great way to bring connection and relationships among the students all over the campus.
Sophomore,5,"My first year of college was amazing. It wasn’t what I expected it to be. I’m honestly so glad that I chose A&M... this is the right school for me. However, what i wish could change is the cafe food. It would be great if we had a better variety to choose from."
Sophomore,5,"Alabama A&M University is great institution. The professors are good, the campus is beautiful, the school spirit is amazing! The campus is diverse and all future students would love this university!"

Niche User,5,I love how they're improving the campus. It is a large and beautiful campus. Even though it is an HBCU the buildings still look nice as if they are pressure washed. There are buses that run during the day for students to get to their classes if they don't want to walk. A bus comes on Fridays to take students to the mall.
Niche User,5,"Im looking forward to starting in the fall of 2019. Speaking with my admissions counselor I was told about the campus, classes and professors."
Junior,5,From the atmosphere of the people you meet to the activities that are being planned for more people to get involved. I’m so glad I chose my HBCU to be AAMU. I love the classes I’m in because the teachers are determined that we get that A and have a high GPA. I can’t take the wheather out here some days but everything is great with the dorm experience and meeting new friends. I’ve made a great choice and not long before I graduate and I can’t wait to say that I graduated from Alabama A&M University.
Junior,5,"After transferring from two universities, I have found my dream college Alabama A&M. However, I can personally say this school has open doors for a lot of opportunities. I applied for numerous internships from previous school, with that being said once I transfer to Alabama A&M. Furthermore, I applied for three internships and received three interview within a month with three top 500 fortune companies. Also, I was offered an internship. I got involved with some of the school clubs and instantly connected with my fellow classmates. This school has helped me in all aspects, I can say that career service department are the best advocates. I would like to see more infrastructure being built as far as student living, gymnasium, and athletics.  However, more money needs to be funded into HBCU's schools..."
Sophomore,5,What I would tell others about A&M is the teachers really care about their students education and future. At least for my previous semester. My advice is work hard in the classes and the teachers would at least pass you with a descent grade.
Junior,5,Alabama a&m was my dream school to attend and i absolutely love it. I love my HBCU and their dedication towards helping me succeed is great i'm glad i chose to go there.
Freshman,5,"Alabama A&M University is a great school , the professors are very hands on especially during office hours . The parties are RAD!! . and the security is top flight"
Niche User,5,My experience is that I like Alabama A&m university is the academic for my major .the school is safe for me to go to school . The dorm are great . The professor can teach me what I need to know about my major and can help me succeed.
Senior,5,This is the best university in the land. The faculty and staff give students every opportunity to excel in all areas. The campus has a welcoming atmosphere and is a place that you can call home.
Freshman,5,i loved it ! everybody treats each other like family. The parties on the campus are really fun. its just warming its just like your home away from home. southern food is just amazing. its a well-rounded school.
Freshman,5,"The campus is simply beautiful. Everyone on campus is very friendly. This school is in fact a HBCU, a lot of school spirit, a lot of great vibes. Overall a great school very affordable."
Freshman,5,"So far my first year has been a great experience, as far as the teachers, students, and the activities A&M has put together for us. If you are an incoming student they will make you feel very welcomed and you will be well taken care of especially due to safety. The dormitory areas could be a little more intact but they are still good for living."
Junior,5,"My Experience Here Was Really Good. I Made Friends Really Easy And They helped make the transition smoother. The teachers I’ve had has been great, And very Understanding at times. Campus life is exciting. I’m really Glad I Came To This School."

Sophomore,5,My experience at Alabama A&M has been wonderful so far the teachers are fair and are very helping. The scenery is beautiful and the people are very nice. I wouldn’t change anything about Alabama A&M I like it just the way it is.
Alum,4,"It was wonderful seeing so many students who looked like me coming from various backgrounds to work towards moving up in life. Campus was lively, and one could usually find several activities to partake in. There's also a plethora of organizations to join that can fit your interests. One thing that I would like to see improved is the quality of dorm life. While A&M has worked to build a new dorm, some of the older dorms are in need of major improvements."
Alum,4,"I did not take any courses online so I can't speak from personal experience. However, from what I have heard from fellow students who have taken online courses the experience went fairly well. A key factor is to keep an open dialogue with your professor about your class work. While some teachers are more responsive, most are very understanding. It can be an adjustment if you never had an online class but open communication can ease the learning curve."
Sophomore,4,"Right now I am taking online courses due to COVID-19. The online learning has been a challenge, but we are all getting through this one day at a time. The one thing that I have learned during this online learning experience is time management. I did not realize how much I need to improve on my time management until now."
Sophomore,4,I did take online classes for half of Spring 2020. The teachers were very clear and made sure we could hear and understand. The teachers asked the class if we had any questions to make sure we were not lost.
Alum,4,"Taking classes online were petty good. I personally prefer online classes, due to the convince of completing assignments on my own time other than beating the clock trying to find a parking spot, walking to class and, trying to finding a decent seat to sit. During my time as a student the professors were just getting the hang of transitioning to blackboard teaching. I'm pretty sure they are top notch compared to my freshman year in 2012. Some teachers were better than others, but the main thing you have to do is communicate with the professor so, they will have a better understanding on what the students needs from them to succeed in their class."
Alum,4,"Socializing is the best part of Alabama A&M University. It is a HBCU where diversity is key. And failure is not an option. No matter what hurdles you are  faced with while attending Alabama A&M University, you will break through stronger as a student and as an individual. You'll think back saying ""wow, it was tough but it made me who I am today and I am grateful."""
Alum,4,"Great HBCU experience, cheap tuition price, and good professors! During my time at Alabama A&M my professors were extremely helpful and diligent. The only issue I had was a lack of professionalism from from some of the staff."
Alum,4,My online class experience was very efficient and easy to use. I never had issues with using Blackboard but I would suggest getting the Blackboard app.
Junior,4,So far my experience has been pretty good. I think we need to continue to improve on housing and food.
Freshman,4,"Alabama A&M is an outstanding University. It has it's pros and cons whether it's the dorms to college campus life. Overall I believe the student body is the best because, we are highly motivated in what we do here in Normal, Alabama."
Freshman,4,"The main reason I enjoy Alabama A&M is because of how diverse the campus is, all the opportunities and help they provide the students such as many career fairs that happen on campus, help with financial aid, the many activities they provide for the students as well. I also appreciate the professors as they take their jobs serious and will provide the help you need."
Freshman,4,My overall experience has been very good thus far. The teachers are very engaging and truly care for their students. I am thankful to have formed a bond with all of my teachers.
Sophomore,4,I would just like to get better help from advisors  and financial aid.They give me the run around every semester I have problems each semester.
Sophomore,4,I love the culture and the campus environment! The professors are great. They really care about the students and are always willing to help with problems us students may have.
Sophomore,4,"When i first came to Alabama A&M University, i was sure what to expect. Once i got used to being on a college campus on my own it was very exciting, especially other people following their dreams."
Freshman,4,My experience at Alabama A&M is going great. I met wonderful and welcoming people there. Everyone has school spirit and pride in the school. So much resources to help students academically and much more and I enjoy the school
Freshman,4,"The school feels like family. Since there isn’t a lot of things to do that are close to the campus, you form bonds with your classmates."
Sophomore,4,"I became a student at AAMU January 2018. Before attending this college I was unsure about life. Upon being a student here I've had a huge turn around.I know what I want in life and I've grown significantly.Like many colleges there are some problems such as:Poor cafeteria food, dorms aren't all that great and staff could be a little nicer.On the other hand I wouldn't trade my school for anything. I've had some fantastic professors who took the time to teach until I understood.The students and the staff are all connected like one big family. We are willing to help in the time of need for our fellow bulldogs. I've met incredible people here and in away iv'e met myself.I'm finding myself more and more as the years go by in my time at A&M.Great things about my college is the incredible therapy that's offered A&M cares about are mental and physical health, not just academics.If I could type everything good about my university I wouldn't stop typing.I take pride in being an AAMU Bulldog."
Freshman,4,"The students at AAMU will honestly be some of the best people you meet. Everyone comes from all over the world but at AAMU we are like a family. This family is very complicated but they will support you to the fullest. I did have a couple problems with some of the staff that wokd there but when you meet those who love their job, which you will, they will do anything in their power to much sure you succeed. This school is big on helping you to succeed on your own and find yourself while doing so. I made the best decision when I chose to attend this amazing HBCU."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman to the university, and my time spent there has been one to remember. Upon arrival, the university organized different events and parties for the freshman to attend to get a feel for the school. I thoroughly enjoyed myself at these events. The food is pretty good; I cannot complain. Even though we are located on a hill, the university provides transportation for students who have a difficult time walking. The amenities the universities provide for their students are amazing, as well. There is a game room for students to hang out in after class. The wellness center has a swimming pool, bowling, an indoor gym and track, and much more. The knowledge learned in lectures is helpful and informative to students. So far, I am having a great time at Alabama A&M University."
Freshman,4,It’s a great school with a lot of event and activities to get the student invokes and the teacher are helpful if you apply your self.
Freshman,4,"Alabama A&M University has a great social work program which is the main reason I choose to attend this specific college. The university could have higher standards. For example, I would advise more security around the campus , freedom within the dorms, and more caring professors.  Some professors acknowledge that students need help but refuses to help. However there are also great professors rooting for you in the end. Honestly college is what you make of it. It definitely requires determination and consistency. Connecting with others also plays a big role in your outcome of your college experience. That's how you meet some of your best friends, soulmate, or even job offers by expanding your horizon. So far it has been a rocky rode for me but as long as I stay committed and keep my gpa above average everything will fall into place."
Freshman,4,"During the few months that I have been at Alabama A&M University, I haven't had many problems at all. All of my professors are genuinely open to help ensure we grasp every concept we learn, housing is not bad (there could be a few fixes), the food is good and my overall experience on campus is good."
Niche User,4,"It was just so peaceful to be there. Every person that I met was so nice the students, the workers, and the alumni."
Senior,4,"I love Alabama A&M University! I transferred here in 2016 and have been very pleased with my experience overall. My first year at this school, I noticed the many positive differences A&M had compared to my previous university. One thing that I noticed right away about this university is how caring the staff was. Professors and faculty at Alabama A&M are dedicated to the students and want nothing but success for us. They will go above and beyond to help their students achieve he best grades and opportunities possible. The campus life is very engaging as well. There is always an event to go to at Alabama A&M, and students are sure to show their school spirit at all times. Also, the campus itself is gorgeous. In fact, it wins an annual beautification award for its well groomed landscape. Students here are very friendly, no matter who you are you WILL find your people her. Attending Alabama A&M University was the best decision I have ever made. I love my HBCU!"
Freshman,4,My experience at Alabama A&M so far has been very nice. The student to professor ratio is not bad at all. I have really been enjoying my time here at Alabama A&M. The professors are very helpful and give it to you straight. I would recommend any high school senior to keep Alabama A&M on their college choice list.
Junior,4,"Alabama A&M university was my first choices because of its history and its culture. I have had an overall great experience I have met alot of people from different areas and they have broaden my horizons of life. I have had many great memories and times so far at the university the dorms, cafe, sports, just getting to know new people. I have come to realize a  lot about myself personally sense I have been at the university."
Senior,4,"Overall Alabama A&M University is a good college choice. It’s very diverse and a good choice for anyone looking to attend college. We do have a few problems that could be fixed like dorms, and housing. They’re working on fixing up the campus right now now! We have various restaurants to chose from off campus, and a select few on campus. Which could use a little upgrade. Party life on the hill is great.. I’m sure you’ve heard. A&M comes with a lot of great experiences!"
Senior,4,"It is one of the ""Top STEM HBCUs"" for a reason! I have had the pleasure of meeting some pretty great professors and peers along the way. Some professors here really take the time to help you in weak areas and assist you in succeeding! I have joined many prestigious organizations on campus that has provided me many benefits such as traveling and scholarships. The campus is improving and it gives off a calm setting! I have enjoyed my time as a bulldog!"
Freshman,4,Alabama A&M is a great school with great staff. They current staff at A&M are very helpful. The study body is also very helpful when it comes to making A&M a great experience.
Sophomore,4,"The great thing about Alabama A&M University is that its an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). The professors and students all work together as one family, no matter your race. I'm an electrical engineer major, learning alongside renowned intelligent engineers educators that want nothing but success for the students and me."
Sophomore,4,I like the diversity and the safe environment. I think they need to fix the roads and also fix the dorms.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Alabama A&M is how I exactly wanted it to be. Fun, hard-work,  experimenting, active, beneficial, flexible and what is can you think of when it comes to your first year of college. I like how my college is like a home. It's a welcoming atmosphere and everybody around treats you like their own. The only change I would love to see is that we have more activities for our students. It's more of a sitting in your room with your friends than going to the next activity they have around the campus after all, I love my HBCU"
Senior,4,"The spirit of family is real and alive at Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical University. Rich in African American history and culture, AAMU is the perfect university for someone who’s looking for the college experience, but not the task of tackling a HUGE campus."
Junior,4,It is an overall good experience.  You make friends quickly and feel as if you are with family.  Small class sizes allow you to connect with your instructors much more than you would at other schools.
Sophomore,4,Alabama A&M is a great school academically. Professors not only teach during their class time but also takes time out of their office hours to make sure each individual understands.
Freshman,4,I love it here at Alabama A&M university the teachers try their best to work with students. The school has service projects monthly.
Niche User,4,"It is a very amazing school. It truly gives off that HBCU vibe. The hill there is also an actual hill, very steep."
Freshman,4,"Alabama A&M is treating me good so far. I’m a guy and I’m in a dorm with community bathrooms, me and my roommate are basically always looking at each other."
Freshman,4,A&M is a real good school some of the teachers real care about the students success. They urge you to great if you fall behind they push you. I love the Financial aid staff are amazing. The lady who works the cafe store in the library is wonderful. During fall wake up Wednesday’s be jumping am glad I attended A&M. The few problems I had a teacher I had fall 2018 she just talked and I feel like I was not really learn nun. Some teachers on there test have stuff they don’t go over. Half of the bathrooms are nasty not tissue no paper towels just nasty like they don’t do they job.
Sophomore,4,"Alabama A&M University is a safe,educational,friendly, and fun environment first years for me was hard but the teacher were helpful to make sure students understand what they are teaching"
Freshman,4,"It’s a good school, only problem I have is that the lunchroom close to early. Other then that it’s a great college."
Sophomore,4,I'm proud to say this is my HBCU. I have made some unbreakable  friendships with other students and professors. Something  I would like to see changed is a better variety in the food served in the cafe.
Junior,4,"This school definitely opened me up as a person. This school made me want to do more things get out more and make more friends. I’m an introvert so I didn’t really talk to people or anything. Once you really get in you major you start making tons of friends because you have most of the same classes together. I also joined an organization. Being apart of clubs and orgs can open you up a lot and is a great way to meet new friends, and their are tons of clubs to join in campus. We have a variety of food in the cafeteria and it isn’t the same thing everyday. We also have a subway and a convient store. We also are starting to be more diverse, when I first started there was mostly black people which I expected becuase were an hbcu, but as I went on we have more international student and just other student of different races and ethnicities. I don’t really pay attention to the sports by our student no matter how we play will always go and support."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending Alabama A&M University, and I am experiencing great obstacles. I will continue to work hard to achieve success. Professors are very helpful and wants every student to be successful. The cafeteria has a lot of options such as pizza, burger/hotdogs, desserts, and daily meals for the students. We also have Subway and Chic Fil-A. I would recommend this college to anyone because it is great!"
Junior,4,At Alabama A&M University you can soar just as high as you'd like.   You can get a great experience with lots of diversity.  You can be all you would like to be at Alabama A&M.  An experience of a lifetime.
Junior,4,"I love my HBCU overall but like any university they have some loose ends,  there response time is never on point, and a lacks a bit of mentorship for the students meaning you really have to use your voice and speak up to get where you want to be because no one will come and tell you, the people are friendly and professors are all for the most part understanding and willing to help."
Junior,4,"This is school is all that i dreamed of and more. Some might say differently but this was my number one choice of school and I’ve been satisfied with my choice ever since my first day of freshman year. I am currently a Junior Computer Science Major. Not saying this University is perfect because all schools have problems. I love the campus, atmosphere, friendliness, most of all the academic programs. This would be a great choice if you are leaning towards an Technology field, but plenty more programs are offered. I love it and i pretty sure others would also."
Sophomore,4,"Alabama A&M University is a great school. Has an excellent engineering program along with others. The school itself could be a little better such as renovating the dorms. They are starting to but they started off building a new residence hall. It's beautiful. Although the staff in the offices that are supposed to help you could be better, they eventually get the job done for you. It's really all about what you make of your college experience. I didn't visit the school before I went, and I turned out loving it just during the welcome week/ first week. You meet lots of new people from a lot of different places. I had a canadian roommate, cool right. Its all about your experience so I suggest living your best life, and enjoy it. Go to class and you'll be just fine."
Sophomore,4,One thing that I loved about Alabama A&M is how they make everyone feel like family. Oh and I also love the big christmas tree they put up after thanksgiving break.
Junior,4,"What I like about Alabama A &M is that it's like a second home. Students come from all over, some farther than others and meet new people on campus and within there department that become there second family. That's how it was for me because I didn't know anyone there. I was out of my element 2 hours away from home. Band is my second family. We practice, perform, and have fun together. It's awesome!"
Senior,4,The atmosphere and academics are amazing! The instructors are patient and very knowledgeable. They know their material.
Junior,4,"I like that Alabama A&M is an HBCU. Campus life is pretty good, people are friendly and would help you if you need help. I like the students, different personalities mix and match but, there are some things that I would like to be changed and that would be campus food, different foods need to be served in the cafe. Also, there needs to be an expansion or an additional cafeteria added to the campus. Their needs to be more exciting campus activities on campus that will get students out to meet new and different people and to just enjoy the college experience."
Freshman,4,"from my sister she says Alabama A&M is an great school. she concludes that they really stand for their motto, "" Start here , go everywhere. For the most part I think I'm going to like this college. She says that the professors really want their students to succeed. At least the ones she previously had."
Junior,4,"Alabama A&M overall is a good school. The academics are great and so are the professors. Just like any other school some professors are better than others . The atmosphere of the school is great. The only real flaw is how disorganized they are with everything and the living conditions aren’t the best . Especially for the prices . For one semester you could pay up to 2,000 to 6,000 dollars for housing . The students at the school are very loving and kindhearted people . Everyone is always friendly and helpful. Which is something one would need if they are just starting out . Also for it to be a HBCU it very diverse when it comes to the students and faculty. Although there have been some bad experiences, this school is awesome."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed the experience that I have had at Alabama A&M so far. As far as academics go I am int he Honors Program. Being in this organization has allowed me to be in smaller classroom setting, and even more one on one time with my professors even though regular students also get one one time. We are also a school that is continuously getting bigger so a lot of renovations, and new dorm buildings are being modified and built up. Our dorms are coed for upperclassman only. Incoming freshman are separated. Night life on ""the hill"" is also fun. Not only are there always activities being held on campus, but there are many opportunities off campus. One being exploring the museum and park in downtown Huntsville."
Junior,4,"Alabama A&M University prepares you for life. Not by just throwing you to the wolves, but by guiding you being your conscious. They're not just going to hand feed you. They want you to be able to find things out for yourself and not rely on your back support all the time."
Junior,4,My overall experience at Alabama A&M University has been everything I thought an HBCU was going to be. I learned you have to make the best of where you are. Being at Alabama A&M I have learned so much about myself and also what I want to do with my life. Alabama A&M is the school where you can there and go anywhere and I believe that is a true statement.
Junior,4,"Alabama A&M University is the best HBCU in Alabama! The environment and cultur surround the school makes you feel welcome and appreciated. The only thing I would change would be to hire admin who take the time to help, instead to giving you the runaround."
Sophomore,4,"At Alabama A&M University I have experienced an amazing HBCU lifestyle. I am currently enrolled in my school for a 4 year B.S. degree. Throughout my first 2 years, I have gotten help by the teachers, tutors, and writing center. The only thing i would change is better career fairs with internships, for students like me."
Freshman,2,Alabama A and M is a great university for Agricultural majors.  They do not have many career options and have a limited amount of good teachers.  Once you enter everything seems perfect but it changes as time moves on.
Junior,2,"So far my experience at Alabama A&M University hasn't been all that great. Some things that I would like to see change would be the time dinner is served and when it ends. It starts at 4pm and ends at 6pm. I like to see that change to 4pm and ends at 8pm. Some students still have class at 6pm. They would not be able to be at dinner during that time. Also another thing I would like to see change would be food location on the weekends. On campus there are two cafeterias. One at the boys dorm and one at the girls dorm. Each are open during breakfast and lunch, but only the girls dorm is open for dinner. That should not be the case. That means that the boys have to go all the way across campus to get dinner on the weekends. That is a very far walk. If they serve breakfast and lunch they should also serve dinner as well. Last thing I have a problem with is the internet. IT IS VERY SLOW!  I would like to see that change. Those are my problems/experiences with Alabama A&M University."
Senior,2,I like that the school has a lot of new changes like the dorms and the wellness center but I do not like the way the school faculty and staff works. If you don't know anyone who can help then it's like you are on your own. If you to ask and keep asking to get help and answers. No information is given if it isn't asked and not everyone knows the right questions to ask so it can be frustrating especially around the start of a new semester when it comes to financial aid and getting registered.
Niche User,2,The university is not very hbcu like. The people who work there are not very friendly and the student services are poor for the price of tuition to be so high.
College Sophomore,2,I did not like my dorm from last year it had bugs. The students do not have any school spirit. The school is unorganized.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are small. The janitor did not clean as well as she is paid to.There was a bad case of ladybugs throughout the dorm.
College Sophomore,2,The football team is not as good as they should be. The cheerleaders are not as good as they should be. The girls and basketball team is okay.
College Sophomore,2,The buildings are very outdated.
College Sophomore,2,Really About 75 Percent of Students Do Drugs On Campus or Sale Them
College Sophomore,2,Too Many Rules & Too Much To Fix.
College Student,2,To get into a D9 organization I feel as if you need to know someone to get in otherwise you won't make the improcessing phase.
College Freshman,2,During times at night theirs no one even guarding the front gate to let people in. Anyone could drive on campus and my life could be put at risk and in danger.
College Freshman,2,Dorms are poorly made and most are closed down or torn down . All the money going towards the school could be better suited for cleaning up some of the filthy dorms or making new ones.
College Freshman,2,With all the hidden hazing and bad things happening under everyone influence i don't see why anyone would want to be a Greek that bad.
College Student,2,they don't take it serious
College Freshman,2,"For the most part students attend the sporting events but when it comes to being an avid fan there are very few, maybe none. Even though, we do support the teams when it is very needed such as rivalry games and playoff berth games."
College Sophomore,2,"Nearly everyone on campus smokes, drinks, or has done one or the other. Hopkins is called the Trap house LOL."
College Sophomore,2,"If your planning to stay on campus, the best dorms are West for girls and Foster for boys (but both are costly). Both dorms are suite-style  and they come with bathrooms, common area, kitchenette, and have computer labs downstairs along with the cafe. The other dorms such as Terry and Morris are  ""traditional"" meaning public bathrooms, no elevators, and are MUCH older. Also, some of the dorms on campus look abandoned and are no longer in use."
College Sophomore,2,"AAMU's athletic gym needs MAJOR remodeling. It looks very old and worn, and compared to other campuses, were behind the times.  However, A&M just built a public gymnasium (Health and Wellness Center) that is very nice and up to date; it has an on campus clinic attached to it as well and is very nice (and free for students as it's included in your tuition)."
College Freshman,2,The dormitories are in poor shape and need some remodeling; they are not worth the money that is being paid for them.
College Junior,2,"*A&M always looking a way to empty your pockets. They trick you by coming to SOAR and assign rooms to stay in that looks clean and spacious. But the dorms you are most likely going to stay in are up the hills and they don't let you take a tour of the bad buildings.

Cons:

# community shower/toilet  only 3 work out of 5 and you are sharing with the whole floor

# limited parking for off-campus students and little to none with on-campus students *if parked in the area tow or ticket which if stupid that you get a ticket for being on parked on campus and you're an active student

# tuition increase almost every year

# roads on campus are ruined with pot holes

# financial aid line will take at least an hour and half to be seen

Pros:

# classes are close and easy

# good people"
College Sophomore,2,Fast food. Fast food everywhere! With no money to get them!
College Freshman,2,"Overall the campus life and schooling is mediocre. The only thing that is of decency is the education. That is the only reason I am here . There are great instructors/professors at the university. The academic advisors are terrible,they are extremely rude and of no help. I couldn't afford to attend . More credible university so i am making the best of Alabama A&M University."
College Student,2,Huntsville has plenty of dining options. A lot of them just don't do student discounts.
College Student,2,You get the same meals. A lot of times if no one really eats the lunch they will reuse the meat for dinner. Then you get sick.
College Student,2,"Campus housing is ridiculous , I have stayed on campus for a 9 months and I have been in the hospital 3 times due to illness because of the unsanitary facilities. There are a lot of empty dorms on campus they just won't clean them out . They chose to overcrowd the buildings."
College Freshman,2,I do not like the cleanliness of the halls and bathrooms in the traditional dorms. There aren't any study rooms anywhere in the dorm and our lounge is a mess.
College Junior,2,The only Greek life you see is when they go to class or in front of cafeterias promoting the latest party.
College Junior,2,"Majority of the time they serve the same foods day in and day out. The worst time to eat is at 12, I call that rush hour. Everyone coming from their 11:00 decides to eat after class. it gets so congested in there, from the ridiculously long lines to the people constantly cutting in front of people you'd be lucky to get a plate within 15min. If people have class at 1 they might not even eat lunch because it takes the full hour just to get 2 plates. That's just at the Knight cafeteria.The food at Foster is better but the cafeteria is so small, if you don't make it in there by 11:30 you might have to eat standing up. Dinner at Foster is only open from 4-6 and dinner at Knight is only open from 4:30-7. So if you don't eat enough in the cafeteria or have a ride to a restaurant all you can do is wait till breakfast the next day. Luckily at the end of the year you can get a refund from all the times you never went to the cafeteria."
College Junior,2,"The dorms here are old and the school isn't renovating them anytime soon. Foster Complex and Knight Complex (West) used to be co-ed dorms a while back but took that away because either ""too many girls were getting pregnant"" or they had a vote on keeping it co-ed or not and majority of the students voted for them to not be co-ed. Foster and Knight are the ""fancy"" dorms for this campus. Foster Complex (the male dorm) is older, the cafeteria and rooms are smaller than Knight (the female dorm. The bathrooms are so small it's amazing how anyone can use them. Rooms in Knight Complex are bigger, the showers are bigger, walk-in bathrooms and has the main cafeteria. It also has a computer lab and barbershop/salon. Even though Knight is bigger Foster and Knight are the same price.

There's only 2 male dorms for upperclassmen (Foster and Hopkins) and 2 female dorms for upperclassmen (Knight and Palmer Hall)."
College Freshman,2,"Everybody is friendly, but at time people bump heads."
College Freshman,2,"I live in terry hall and Its hard living with 36 other girls on your hall sharing 8 stalls and 8 showers. The school does a horrible job changing the shower curtains, mopping the floor and keep the soap dispensers full. Overnight there are dorm activities a lot of us get together and do but sometimes thats boring. The security is horrible. Literally anyone could walk in the dorm because the back dorm is never locked. At night the ""watchmen RA"" is usually sleep at the front desk and there is not security around so anybody could walk in. The best dorm is Knight for the girls all the others aren't safe."
College Freshman,2,"its so hard to get someone over the phone or in a email, and when you go into the office the don't give you enough information to fix your problem"
College Senior,2,"Our school spirit could be so much better. Students here act like they don't want to participate in anything, but then complain about there's nothing to do. To top it off they give no feed back on how to make it better."
College Senior,2,Coming from up north I guess I was expecting southern cooking in the café. That's not what I got. The best food they serve is hot wings. A&M food is not good at all.
College Freshman,2,"I don't live on campus but the times I have visited, the people who lived in those forms were pretty cool. When it comes to their amenities it's very simple; there are none. They don't have stoves, can't have microwaves, the gym is ALL the way ACROSS campus."
College Freshman,2,For me coming from the big city of Detroit is very boring for me and can get lonely at times.
College Junior,2,You run into a lot of bad attitudes when dining off campus. I stop going to the places near campus because you are guaranteed to get your order back wrong and receive an attitude when you ask them to fix it.
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have social life because of the certain hours of visitation
College Sophomore,2,The campus is so strict especially on parking with out a permit they hand out tickets like it's money
College Sophomore,2,"The sports are pretty good , but the school spirit SUCKS ... We do have a pep squad but that's the most spirit there is ... People come to the games to be seen"
College Sophomore,2,"The guys and girls a fairly entertaining. A lot of people are free spirited so they have their own sense of fashion, interest, social life, and relationships."
College Sophomore,2,The food is so nasty. It's very repetitive every week.
College Sophomore,2,"Its hard to get transportation because there's no public transportation for a low price in the whole city. A student would have to spend  ten dollars or more to get around. However, transportation on campus is good."
College Junior,2,If it snows even a little school gets canceled and the tornado season is horrible about storms.
College Freshman,2,It is mainly just chicken and pizza as an option. Cost is average for students with monthly income
College Sophomore,2,"When I was living on campus, the food was okay. Now that I live off campus, friends of mine will tell me that the meals have changed. I heard that the cafeteria are serving the same meals each day in Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner."
College Sophomore,2,Some the students wreak a scent of drugs and alcohol.
College Freshman,2,The only perk about transportation is the BTS bus transit that take you to class. If you do not have a vehicle it is basically like EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.
College Freshman,2,one minute is cold and sunny then its hot and rainy then its windy and rainy the weather can never make up its mind and if you're walking up the hill to call and you don't have an umbrella and it starts raining and you just missed the bus but it was sunny when you left the room..well you're just outta luck  
College Junior,2,My scholarship was cut tremendously
College Sophomore,2,At this campus you are allowed to smoke freely on campus without the police doing anything. People smoke marijuana all the time in the dorms and outside the dorms.  
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus can be a hassle because you are rooming with someone who can be disruptive or disturbing. The amenities are located on the main floor and the social atmosphere is somewhat loud.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the time it rains, then it will be freezing for long periods of time."
College Freshman,2,The academics offered is a lot of variety. The registration process is very hectic. The advisers are rarely there or very busy. 
College Freshman,2,The nightlife is how you make it. If you want to have fun you have to put in the effort all by yourself. If you don't want to have fun then you won't have fun. 
College Senior,2,It seems like you have to always wait in a 2 hour line or longer and most times they can not get everything cleared on the first time you go in to make sure that your grants and loans are there.
College Senior,2,"The football team has not been a huge success over the past years, therefore there isn't a lot of team spirit like high school games."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The greek life appears superficial. I am not greek and it is hard for me to understand why I should be if I am not seeking any friendship. Some volunteer, some party, some are just eye-candy. Most of the greeks have a ""High and Mighty"" attitude, however it does depend on the fraternity/sorority. Most non-greeks aspire to be greek. If it suits your fancy, I suppose."
College Senior,2,There really isn't anywhere to eat besides the cafeteria. You must go off campus to eat.
Senior,1,Discrimination  if you are not African American. Financial aid depends completely on who you knows in the administrations. Poor customer service and awful treatment.
Senior,1,Grading based on videos and faculties are always not available for extra timing. Blackboard is rarely used.
Sophomore,1,"I got up bright and early to select the room I wanted when the housing application opened up. The next day, they COMPLETELY RESET all of the selections without warning, and so I ended up with left overs."
Niche User,1,"This institution is great as far as student life but as a parent or independent student , it is awful. AAMU's administrative offices ( Financial aid, Business and Student accounts) has shown nothing but poor customer service along with showing students constant disrespect. This institution has had multiple complaints filed against them when it comes to student funds and balances. Also, good luck trying to get in contact with a financial aid adviser ... or anyone that isn't Admissions Office."
College Sophomore,1,Do not get me started on housing.
Recent Alumnus,1,It's horrible you are never safe on campus
College Freshman,1,"The athletic department is currently under investigation by the NCAA for falsifying grades for student athletes. All sports will be serving a one year postseason ban, although it's not like they were going to make the postseason anyway."
College Junior,1,Not worth the money I'm paying.
College Sophomore,1,"The visitation issue is the worst thing I've ever witnessed. Visitation is promised at the beginning of the year, but it taken away at the most random times and almost at the discretion of the desk staff. The administration are very lenient about attending their office hours, and the kitchen staff are not very efficient."
College Freshman,1,WE EAT THE SAME THINGS EVERYDAY. ON THE WEEKENDS WE EAT SUPER EARLY AND ONLY TWICE A DAY.
College Freshman,1,There's nothing to do out here as far as parties.
College Freshman,1,It could be alot better....the showers and toilets are very bad scared to brush your teeth and shower in there. Thank God for shower shoes...lol
College Junior,1,"Like most schools, the only sports that people pay attention to are the sports that bring money to the school, mainly football and basketball. It's hard to tell if people go to games to actually show school spirit or just to hang with friends. Alumni show more spirit than the students. Nobody has faith in the football team. The only reason people go to football games is to see the halftime show, the stands be empty once the third quarter starts. Honestly, the football an basketball team here aren't even our best teams but those are the only two teams that get talked. People here don't even know that we have a bowling team but they won the championship last year and the school hasn't made an announcement about that or anything."
College Freshman,1,We have one near by restaurant.
College Freshman,1,Huntsville is a small town and if you don't have a car then you pretty much stuck on campus. The only excitement on campus are the sports but sometimes those can be boring. Walmart is a pretty far distance and there aren't many there is one wing place thats walking distance. If you attend this school with out a car your gonna be pretty much a dorm body.
College Freshman,1,"My financial aid experience is the worse. I'm still going through it when you call no one is there to answer the phone , like ever. When you speak with some one they tell you that you have a balance and you have to pay it but the money is not money you just pull out of your pocket. Some of the People who work in financial aid are mean."
College Freshman,1,everything is far unless you have a car
College Freshman,1,"the school is very strict, treat us like kids sometimes"
College Freshman,1,It's all the same  chicken joints all around town from Bojangles to Chick-Fil-A.
College Sophomore,1,Campus food sucks so bad !!! It's good the first month but it' gets old after awhile breakfast is always good though
College Sophomore,1,I have not received 1 scholarship!
College Freshman,1,The hours available are horrible. There is this crazy rule that if you eat after a certain time then you are not allowed to eat the next meal. The food is very repetitive. You are most likely to eat chicken four days out the week. There is no other use for the meal plan.
College Freshman,1,Many students do not attend some sport events because of the low winning status of the sport. The more the sport lose the less people attend the event.
College Freshman,1,The weather is very up and down. You can go to sleep with clear skies and wake up with snow. It's very unpredictable. 
College Senior,1,"The buildings on campus, except two or three, are all old, unkempt, and drab. Missing ceilings, bad classrooms, scarce resources, and bathrooms that are always out of toilet paper and soap or paper towels."
College Senior,1,"The school is predominantly African American with no programs in place to diversify the campus. The administration is extremely lazy, which makes signing up/registering complete chaos. Many advisors at other colleges often tell you not to attend A&M because of problems well known in the area."
College Senior,1,"The only campus provided transportation outside of campus, is a bus ride once on Saturdays to the mall."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly, the campus is way too small for it to have transportation. walking from Foster all the way to the Wellness Center or Elmore gym doesn't even take an hour. it barely takes half an hour. but a lot of people on the campus are too lazy to walk. you spend more time waiting for a bus than actually walking to your destination. i don't think many people notice that. the worst time to try and ride the bus is during lunchtime. ALL of the buses be packed until around 2:00. another bad time to ride the bus is when it's raining. if you decide to come to Alabama A&M you'll see why. when it's raining EVERYBODY tries to ride the bus. the buses be filled up to the point that all the seats will be taken and the ones who couldn't get a seat will be taking up the space in the ailes. so just imagine trying to get off the bus with a bunch in the aisle. the only times i ride the bus is if it's empty or barely full. some times that transit system is a waste of money, then there are those few times that it'll come in handy."
College Sophomore,1,"the facilities here are poor. the best facilities on campus is the wellness center, the business building, and of course the agricultural and engineering buildings. there are A LOT of closed dorms and other buildings on the campus. because the campus is a historical landmark they can't tear down  those closed buildings. the Academic Enhancement Center (Student-Athlete building) is combined with the ROTC building. both of those buildings look old. broken windows, and they use some of the rooms for storage."
College Sophomore,1,"my expectations are probably too high from watching Stomp The Yard and other step shows. but from what i've seen the greek life could be WAY better. you don't really see them around campus. there aren't a lot of step shows, the most greek activity they do is host and promote parties. on some Wednesday's nights i think, the AKA's would drive around the campus screaming out their cars, but other than that there isn't enough greek life on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police are a little too strict, they are forgetting that we are young adults as well not children anymore."
College Freshman,1,"what facilities? I haven't seen a school with so many closed down buildings in my life. the worst part about it is that they can't tear the buildings downs because the school is a national landmark. I came in as a freshman last year. they JUST BUILT a health and wellness center last year. my teacher told me the only reason we have a health and wellness center is cause Auburn paid for it. u can play video games in the game room, u can pay to go bowling, u can play basketball, volleyball, racquetball, workout in the weight room or work on ur cardio upstairs. they have a student center but when I walk past it they're barely any students in there. the library is ok after you tolerate the smell. the quad is where ppl hang out at mostly during the 1st semester(mainly freshman), probably so they can get to know each other to see who their friends will be for the year. idk, I couldn't take it at the quad cause so many ppl there drink and get high. not my scene. they have an academic enhancement center for athletes but its small and it's connected to the ROTC building. they just built a ""park"" (all they really did was build a walkway with benches around the pond, it doesn't look finished.) there's also talk of Auburn trying to buy this school. if they do, then this school will get a MAJOR upgrade"
College Freshman,1,"Huntsville is a far out city in my opinion. The few times I have been off campus, there really isn't many apartments around campus. Normal Hills is an on campus apartment area for upperclassman. The only down side of the apartments is that they are EXPENSIVE! Try asking the housing complex for any addition apartments off campus."
College Sophomore,1,There are several bars/clubs that are a good distance from campus. I don't attend any of those festivities.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall serves the same thing every week. There are always chicken sandwiches, pizza, and hamburgers.We only have two dining halls when we also need a food court for when you on the go or after the caf closes."
College Freshman,1,"before i started college, i was always told that freshman had the crappiest dorms, upperclassmen had the best dorms and that there were fraternity and sorority houses. when i came here there was none of this, except for the part about crappy dorms. upperclassmen are in the same dorms as freshman. When you come to S.O.A.R. they play you by making upcoming freshman stay the night in the high class female dorm, then when you see what your dorm actually looks you get kind of upset, well i did. Compared to my friends dorms who go to other colleges, my dorm isn't worth what i have to pay. if you don't live in the high class dorms or at Normal Hills(Campus apartments) your college experience can be kind of irritating. the cafeteria closes at 7, my RA said that we're lucky to even have a microwave on the first floor. we can't bring microwaves or refridgerators because if we do ""the power will go out because the building is so old"". there are A LOT of empty dorms. There's 6 dorms for guys (Foster, Stephens, Morris, Hopkins, Walker Wood, and Grayson), but only 4 of them are open (Foster, Stephens, Morris, and Hopkins). There's 7 dorms for girls (Knight, Thomas, Hurt, Terry, Palmer, Thigpen, and Buchannan), but only 3 of them are open (Knight, Terry and Palmer). Thomas Hall is open but they're not using it as a dorm, they're using it as the place to teach ORI 101(Survival Skills), tutor, and to talk to your advisor."
College Freshman,1,"So many people at this school use drugs and drink alcohol but no one is abusing them, well as far as I know. We have campus police everywhere but the security of drugs and alcohol on campus isn't strict whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,"i rated the dining an F because they give out the same stuff EVERYDAY. There's not much variety at all, unless around holidays. AAMU has two dining halls, and they're both in the most expensive dorms for guys and girls. the dining hall in the girls dorm is the biggest one. they always run out of chicken for chicken sandwiches, and the lines are always long."
College Freshman,1,"They have a transit system called Shuttle Bus. it stops running at 6 p.m. and doesn't run on weekends. it's best that you have a car, because if you don't, there's not much you can do"
College Freshman,1,"Sports at Alabama A&M University could be better than it is now. The workout facility is pint-sized. All the sports share that one gym, except for the football team. Sometimes there be two sports teams in there at once,and when that happens the gym becomes so congested that getting a good workout in becomes difficult. Intramural sports aren't that popular, and when they have games the school does a poor job at promoting them."
College Freshman,1,There is a diversity but not a huge one most students at Alabama A&M are African American.
College Freshman,1,"To me, the financial aid office needs to be more organized. For example, they lost the verification worksheet that I literally handed to them. Then they denied the Parent Plus Loan that they told me to apply for."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking at this school is horrible. There are maybe 2 or 3 parking lots that fill up immediately. You park your vehicle and then have to catch a bus all over campus. If you park anywhere other then the couple of designated parking lots YOU WILL GET TOWED. You can ask any alumni they will tell you that you are not a bulldog until your vehicle gets towed. Worst parking I have encountered at any university so far and I have been to several.
College Junior,1,"Greek Life on campus is very low. They only care about themselves, everyone knows their business and they make people not even want to be apart of their organization."
College Sophomore,1,Alot of Black Students – their are alot of African Americans at Alabama a&m and their percentage of white people are very small in the school and the whole student body is black but then again this is a hbcu
College Sophomore,1,there are alot of cars getting towed because of parking mishaps and people in faculty spaces.
College Junior,1,The parking situation is insane. The spaces are limited and there is usually a ten minute window between classes. Sometimes you may have to circle the parking lot for 15 minutes to find a space and then you're late for class. Some professors won't let you in after 10 minutes. The campus police will ticket you up to at least $160 for improper parking and if they don't ticket you then your car will be towed. It's ridiculous because there aren't enough spaces to accomodate all of the students that have parking decals.
College Junior,1,"parking at my school is terrible!! there are not enough parking spaces anyway so they tow peoples cars constantly, but there is no where to park."
College Freshman,1,They are always smoking and they sometimes be fun but be careful. They mase people in the club sometimes. All I can say is that A&M is not the place to be.
College Senior,1,"Long Lines for What? The financial process is a major headache. The lines are so long to talk to a person that you can literally leave and come back hours later and they still have not called your name. Sometimes the things a person needs, like signing/turning in a document, could be performed online or in a more efficient manner rather than waiting in line for hours for a conversation of less than 5 minutes. The process should be done strictly on the computer."
College Junior,1,"Long Lines,and terrible attitudes. Fortunately, I was able to bypass some of those bear traps because of early preparation."
College Junior,1,Only been to campust once to meet with advisor and was not good.
College Junior,1,"In Alabama, the weather is pretty unpredictable. It can be raining and very hot and sunny all at the same time. Its hard to get tornado season as well. In my area we have plenty of evacuations on tornado watch."
College Sophomore,1,Bulldog Cars – Parking is a little limited on campus. There is usually no where to park without getting towed.
College Sophomore,1,Huntsville Place – This the only off-campus housing that uses your school financial aid to pay for it. The only problem is--is that Alabama A&M doesn't help you apply for it or try to encourage yo to move off-campus.
College Senior,1,"Housing at Alabama A&M University is one of the major complaints among students. The presence of bugs, robberies during school breaks, and cost of living in the dorms are main reasons that students move off campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Almost Everybody Smokes and Drinks – At the school, people are chilling smokin on any day of the week and drinking on the weekends. U will definately hear a good number of pass-out stories floating around after a big game/party weekend. the police are starting to crack down on it a bit more, but they're not really effective"
College Sophomore,1,"Restrooms for the guest and students in the dorm arent up to code. Plumbing is old and needs to be redone,the heating and cooling system never works. Living on campus is unsafe their are numerous of rapes on campus and stealing."
College Freshman,1,On Campus Eating Sites – I have this a D because there are no eating sites within walking distances for students without cars to go to. It would give.the.students variety also places for them to go to when the cafe areas are closed.
College Freshman,1,"Closed Campus – Having a closed campus can be headache, especially for those commuting. We don't always have parking and the police are quick to give a ticket if we're not parked in commuter parking spaces. Those that live on campus often take the commuters parking spaces"

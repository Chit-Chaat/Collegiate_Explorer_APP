Senior,5,Overall the campus is very animal friendly. Teachers are always so helpful. There is always fundraising and a lot of charity work that happens their. It is a good spirited school and I always feel like i can give back. There is always things to do and sign up for. Our games are always so much fun to watch. Go Lions!
Senior,5,"Online classes our the best. Particularly, for me, they are always so flexible. The online teachers, I find to be so helpful ad understanding. They always answer my emails in a timely manner."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love GCU! I am a commuter, and my majors are Elementary Education and Psychology. I am enrolled in both honors programs offered at GCU: the scholars program and psychology honors. The professors are extremely attentive and very concerned with student academic success."
Sophomore,5,My experience with Georgian Court University has been great. I like that most of my classes are small (around 25 students or less). It makes it easier to communicate with the professor.
Junior,5,Georgian court is very well known for their nursing and education program.  They are affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health and nursing students are pretty much guaranteed a job with them once they graduate.  It is a great program.
Junior,5,My experience at Georgian Court has been amazing. The campus is absolutely beautiful and it’s always felt like home to me. My professors have been great to work with and all of my classmates have become such great friends of mine. Georgian Court has plenty of opportunities for every major they offer.
Junior,5,"I love it here at GCU regardless of its location. There is such a large sense of community. The faculty, staff, and administration really are invested in you and your experience here and how it will help you in the future. #whygcu"
Senior,5,When I visited Georgian Court I fell in love with the college and atmosphere. It feels like a home away from home! I know several people who are currently enrolled in this college and I have only positive things.
Sophomore,5,"The staff is very friendly, always helping out. The community is is friendly and open. Always has events or sports going on."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Georgian Court, and the professors are dedicated and committed to educating the students through a wide variety of courses!"
Sophomore,5,"I love it here at GCU! While it isn't such a big party school there are tons of clubs you can join to make your time here interesting. Professors really care about your development. Since we have small class sizes they can tell if you're having a bad day or if something is a little off with you. If you need to dorm and get offered a spot in the honors program take it! Honors dorms are some of the newest on campus-they're huge and you share a bathroom with only one other person. We bring comedians&hypnotists to campus and have fun events like dip n dots, pool parties, build a bear, and roller skating. The food isn't that bad, at least there is a lot of variety and ice cream every day in Raymond. I changed my major and that was a really easy process. Since it's a small school, if you join clubs it's very easy to make friends, since club meetings are not full of a large number of people. Also, if you come here, we're big on bake sales so carry lots of $1s with you on your way to class!"
Sophomore,5,"I feel that Georgian Court is one of the finest local Universities in my area. There is a diverse student body, groups and clubs for everyone, and has one of the best nursing programs that I found."
Junior,5,"So far in my transition to Georgian Court University, I have found that I absolutely love it. I am currently a nursing student there and I am super excited about the university. I feel as if I have endless possibilities and I am happy to be on campus everyday.  The place is beautiful and the staff is amazing to work with. They are always around to help in anyway, which is very much appreciated."
Freshman,5,I love this school so much! The campus itself is beautiful and it seems like such a close-knit community. There is a reason why this was my top choice and why I'm going here next fall.
Alum,5,"Small, personalized environment that allows students to grow and flourish. It is a place where you will never be a number. The athletic department is growing more and more each year and is an ideal university for those who want to pursue teaching, psychology, or Exercise Science"
Sophomore,5,I personally like the atmosphere at Georgian court unversitiy. Everyone is friendly and the professors are really understanding and helpful. I would like for there to be a more variety or food choices on campus.  The cafe and the dining hall have good foods but theu can definitely improve on adding more choices to campus.
Junior,5,"I enjoy Georgian Court because the class size is very small, the teachers are knowledgeable and personal, and I feel like I am receiving a great education."
College Freshman,5,"Safety is very exaggerated here, every corner you turn there's a security officer staring into your eyes. No one can get on campus unless you sign in or have an idea, so the health of your safety is not a threat. Everyone is safe here."
College Sophomore,5,"Have never had an issue with safety on my campus. I have been here a year and never got a text or email indicating an assault, robbery or anything along the lines of that."
College Junior,5,I did my undergraduate and graduate studies at GCU. The professors are engaging and helpful. The class sizes are small. The campus is nice. The only negative I have is the area it is located in.
College Junior,5,It's a great school and everyone is very helpful in the application process.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors are wonderful. My social work professors are always willing to help me and they are always available. The staff in the Dean of Students office is also very helpful. The campus is beautiful. Overall, it is a great school to attend."
College Sophomore,5,"Security is a high priority. There are always available to help and are easily accessible. Security vehicles patrol campus 24 hours a day. If something suspicious happens, there are there at a moment's notice. Having such an efficient task force to make Georgian Court safe and easy to live in makes me feel comfortable."
College Sophomore,5,"The amount of aid left me with less than $6,000 to pay on my own, which was easier to work with on my part. Also, the scholarships I earned from Georgian Court were a larger amount than expected, showing me they really take care of their students financially."
College Junior,5,"GCU is a melting pot.  Lots of different cultures, backgrounds, languages, sexual orientations."
College Junior,5,I love my program of Clinical Laboratory Sciences.  I really feel like I'm the only one in the program at my school.  I've only met one other person in the program but she was minoring/concentrating in something else so her progress chart was different from mine.  There's a lot of work to be done in a fast amount of time.
College Junior,5,"There is only one entrance to Georgian Court and it is secured by security guards.  There are multiple campus police cars that roam around campus and make sure everything is good.  The campus crime rate is probably zero.  I'm a commuter, but GCU is in a secluded and safe area.  I feel very safe when I am on GCU's campus."
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about georgian court university but the food could be much better and housing. One of the halls isn't redone so it looks terrible.
College Junior,5,There was not a lot of difficulty getting into the Clinical Lab Science program.  Everything was pretty straight forward and my academic advisor was the best help and guidance.
College Freshman,5,great majors. everything is important. no-normal app process
College Freshman,5,a lot of diversity around
College Freshman,5,They provide computers and have a privaet wifi
College Junior,5,It's a great program. I can't imagine it better.
College Freshman,5,i feel safe on campus
College Freshman,5,they are very strict which is a good thing
College Freshman,5,the athletics equipment is in a good position and it is easy to work with 
College Freshman,5,Campus security best in new jersey
College Freshman,5,laptops that everyone recieves are good 
College Sophomore,5,"The Nursing Program at Georgian Court is very unique. While most schools do not get their student nurses in the hospital until junior or senior year, my school starts us out our sophomore year. The more hands on learning, the better. I chose GCU because the nursing program was the best one I had found in my college searches."
College Junior,5,There are computer labs in every building and in the dorms. Every computer lab has brand new computers and there is wireless access throughout the campus.
College Senior,5,"my major being Psychology at GCU is awesome! The teachers and faculty that are tied to the psychology department are extremely helpful and they know what they are talking about. the classes are well thought out, and organized. they are also fun and the professors really make the class hands on and they inform you as to their area of expertise as well as the class they are teaching. there is pretty great communication between students and teachers. they help you to find great internships and service learning opportunities in your area as well as in the schools area and they are filled with knowledge and they really are great at helping you with questions, worries about jobs and everything in between! It is one of the best schools i could recommend for someone who is thinking about being a psychology major in the New jersey area! :)"
College Junior,5,"The Education program, department, and the Professors of such are absolutely phenomenal. Before attending GCU, I heard from people left and right about how great their Education Program is and I am yet to be let down. It has been everything I hope for and more. My thankfulness extends from one professor to the next and they continue to impress me with how willing, able and helpful they are in preparing us for the world of Education and Teaching."
College Freshman,5,"The computer labs are always available at Georgian Court University. Sometimes they may be crowded , but besides that you always find a spot the wait is never long. A lot of students have their own labtops. Having your own labtop and printer is really good. The Wifi is really strong here and it works great."
College Freshman,5,"The process of getting into the Social Work program was easy.  There was no application process. I just enrolled in sociology. My major was declared before I got to school , I have always wanted to become a Social Worker."
College Freshman,5,"Going into the Social Work field Ive always had doubts because everytime I would tell someone my major there would be something negative being said. When I came to Georgian Court and started my classes I knew that I was going to stick with Social Work.  All of the classes were great and small. Sociology was very interesting. If I could do it all over again I most certainly would. My career goals are to work at a DYFS office dealing with the youth. I dont have any concerns about finding a job , I know Im going to be successful at finding one."
College Junior,5,"I love my classes at GCU. The topics are interesting, the teachers are very helpful and definitely know what they're teaching, and the class sizes are small and not intimidating."
College Junior,5,"The weather is not a problem. The only problem this year was Hurricane Sandy, but all the other years of attending have not been a problem with the weather."
College Junior,5,"I chose Georgian Court because it is said to have the best teaching program in New Jersey. They make you double major so I am  also majoring in English as well. The classes are interesting, the professors are excellent and the workload is decent. Class discussion is encouraged in every class and makes the class more interesting if you engage."
College Junior,5,The dining food options are excellent. There are a lot of places to eat around the school as well if looking for something different. The variety of food is good also.
College Senior,5,"It's pleasant to dorm on campus. There is no fighting, no parties, no alcohol or drug use, and no loud profanity. It's never a loud and disturbing environment. It's a very quiet and calm place to study, socialize and sleep. Everyone keeps to themselves and there is no crime or arguments. Everyone is very friendly, caring, social and compassionate."
College Senior,5,"There is no visible drug or alcohol usage on campus. There is no discussion of drug or alcohol usage and there is no peer pressure. We have under the influence posters and signs to keep students aware of possible dangers if they are to drive under the influence. For my nursing program, we had to take a drug test which is an excellent policy."
College Freshman,5,"The facilities in Georgain court are great. They are always there for us, and making sure we are doing everythign we need to do."
College Freshman,5,"My athletics in my school are great, they all practice really hard, and are close to one other. They make sure there are healty, ane given there 100% in there team."
College Freshman,5,Sports at Georgian Court are very interesting. I support all sports and attend as much activities when I can.
College Senior,5,Beautiful Campus – The campus here at GCU is filled with both history and beauty. Everywhere you walk there is a piece of history around you. The campus is absolutely beautiful especially in the spring and early fall. It's nice to just walk around and take in all the statues and gardens all over campus.
College Senior,5,"Teachers Want You to Succeed. The teachers at GCU are always willing to help you out. They have office hours so you can stop in and get extra help, but often times the teachers are willing to go beyond their office hours to lend a hand. They WANT you to do well and love hearing how you are doing even after you take their class. Many of my old teachers still say hi in the hallways and ask me how my classes are going."
College Sophomore,5,"At GCU, your not just a student with a number. your a person.   The professors are always w3illing to help with a myriad of subjects whether it is what they teach or not.  I wanted an all female college and have the best there is. There are only two directors for my major, Social Work, and my minor Hoistic Health.  When I was in an extremely bad accident they couldn't have been more helpful and understanding.  I am the mother of an autistic chid and they understand that.  i got my ged , went to cc for my aa then transferrred in. i wish i would have started there.  if i didn't have a home , i would live there.  The scenery is magnificent and so are the other employees.  You can always find help and what you need whether it is just a shoulder to vent on, or academic."
College Sophomore,5,"Willing to Help – no matter how busy the teachers are, they take the time out to help you, not only with academic life but personal.  they take the time to discuss options with you and explain them coherently."
College Sophomore,5,"Second Home – There are only two presiding teachers for social work major which makes it a lot easier and the process is outlined well.  
Both of these professors go above and beyond thier job scope.  It's well worth the money, we learn values not just academics"
College Sophomore,5,"Our Values – we honor , integrity, justice4, and compassion.  The teachers are wonderful and tireless"
Junior,4,Classes that are intended to be online are very good and ensure that the student learns the materials. Professors are always available and very prompt when it comes to grading.
Sophomore,4,Georgian Court University is a wonderful campus. It encompasses experienced professors who are ready to educate. The opportunities to thrive on campus are numerous. The various events serve to educate the students in thriving in the professional world. The amount of campus resources definitely are helpful in assisting students.
Freshman,4,"It's solid overall. The smaller campus and lower population allows for 1 on 1 help that it would be hard to get otherwise. Also, the campus is covered in nature. The air feels clean, and there's never been any danger on campus, if you don't count the deer walking around at night."
Sophomore,4,"Georgian Court University is a small college, but also a very accepting one. I have never felt more at home then when  attending GCU. The campus is small, but absolutely gorgeous. The smaller classrooms makes for more attentive professors. The student culture and campus community culture is very accepting and accommodating. Campus programs and activities means everyone can participate in whatever they want. It may not be a school with a great name, but Georgian Court is an amazing University."
Alum,4,"Small class sizes, caring teachers a small cozy campus and a strong mission statement make this school a great choice. Its location is quite random but it's a beautiful campus."
Junior,4,I really like all the professors I have had since I have been attending Georgian Court. What I would like to see change is more communication between departments such as financial aid and registrars office.  I feel that things would run more smoothly when trying to access student information.
Sophomore,4,I personally really love this school. But I understand why some people don't. I'm lucky enough to be a student athlete which really changes my experience a bit but I hope this helps.
Freshman,4,Georgian court university is a good school the professors have a-lot of time for you to help you become successful in college and overall it has a beautiful campus and i believe its an excellent institution to get your education from.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Georgian Court University because of how small the school is. Everyone has a great friendly relationship with each other. 

I am a huge fan of the education system as well, because each Professor takes the time to connect with their students, which creates a great relationship between the student and professor."
Freshman,4,GCU has many opportunities for success. They have a wide variety of majors and minors so anyone can find something right for them. They also have a lot of clubs so people can get involved and meet new people.
Senior,4,"Love the small class sizes, the professors remember you and know you by name. School of education is amazing, highly recommend GCU to education majors and anyone who wants to commute to school. Would not suggest living there."
Graduate Student,4,Georgian Court is a small campus with a friendly environment. Since I started the Counseling Program I have had nothing but a great experience in my classes and on campus. My professors are very thorough and nice. I am overall enjoying my time at this University.
Junior,4,I am still currently attending this school but I am not on the Lakewood campus. Georgian court University holds classes at Cumberland County College and that is where I am taking classes on campus.
Niche User,4,I love my life here at GCU. I like how diverse it is and how everyone knows everyone. I love the location of the school and how it's 15 minutes away from New Jerseys Shore. You never run out of all activities or events to attend every day.
Niche User,4,Georgian court university is a very nice and spacious place. There is a heard of deer on campus even. It has very nice and up to date athletic facilities. The money you spend to go here is a good use of money.
Freshman,4,"Georgian Court University is an overall great school. I am currently a nursing student and so far my first semster here has been very enjoyable. My proffessors are very well spoken and only want me to succeed. It may not be the perfect school but it sure is gonna get me to where I need to be, happy to be a lion!"
Niche User,4,"Georgian Court University's overall feel is relaxing, light, and one with a welcoming atmosphere. The focus on education has a strong emphasis on those who want to pursue their career goals, whether it is sciences or history. Not to mention, the architecture, layout, and overall rundown of the area with its memorable sights just feels good overall. The only thing that should be changed is the dorms; it seemed to be too crammed and kind of small, but certainly is not something that would harm the experience. Otherwise, Georgian Court University is a solid choice for those who may or may not be sure of their career choice or as to where they may want to attend."
Senior,4,"Small classes but extremely high anxiety levels on campus.
You need to schedule your classes on your own. Some classes are offered only 1 semester per year so it'll mess up your sequence if you don't know what you're doing."
Freshman,4,GCU is a very small campus. Even tho it is small i liked how the teachers were able to give you 1v1 attention in classes if you are confused. I played soccer at Georgian Court University and the teachers were fantastic dealing with me when i had a game and had to miss practice. All the teachers and staff there are very nice and respectful. I would 100% recommend GCU to students. I believe it is a university on the rise to better and greater things.
Senior,4,"Georgian Court University is a very small, private Catholic college located in Lakewood. Although the surrounding area of the campus is not so great, the campus is beautiful. On campus you can find a beautiful fountain, many statues, and old historic buildings with fascinating architecture. Class sizes are relatively small, consisting of about 30 students. There are activities for students to participate in, there are a lot of clubs that students can join, and there is a student lounge that is nice to spend time in. I like Georgian Court because with the small classes, you are able to establish a relationship with an instructor where they know what to expect from you, and they can tell you are truly making an effort in their class. With larger universities, it is common for the instructor to know maybe one or two student which would not be beneficial to me."
Sophomore,4,In my opinion I really love this school. The professors really care where you are trying to get your self in life. They try very hard to keep you up with your work and if you fall behind they will talk to you and try to get you back on track. Also the campus is simply beautiful . Id highly recommend to visit it. 
College Junior,4,"I have only started my Masters, however I have taken classes on the graduate level before here for certification and have been pleased with the school."
College Junior,4,I like it small class sizes.  Students are friendly.
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the education aspect of the school. If anything will keep me here, it will be the education program. The courses are easy to pass because the teachers use Blackboard which lets the students know when everything is due, when there will be test, and so on. The class sizes are small which allows the professors to get to know you."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't heard anything about drugs or alcohol use on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"GCU has a lot of connections in the neighboring towns which is great. Since the school is smaller than bigger universities, it is easier to get more one on one time with career services personnel."
College Sophomore,4,I wish i could change a few things like campus activities. They do have a lot but there is not much of a turnout or promotion for them. I would like a better variety of class options also because I feel as though there aren't much to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,"I love GCU. It is quaint, lively and colorful. The teachers are passionate and sympathetic and work hard to give you a great education. The class size is small and the campus is beautiful!"
College Sophomore,4,Conflicts between students are very rare. Campus is extremely low key and safe.
College Sophomore,4,The value of a degree is pretty good. Georgian Court is ranked in the top 25 schools in the country in the category of best bang for your buck.
College Junior,4,Georgian Court University has tight security before anyone can enter and or leave campus premises. Cameras are also installed around every building and even the security building at the entrance. In order for anyone to come on campus a resident will have to notify the security on duty of the person first name and last name so that they can enter when repeated from the person coming on campus.
College Junior,4,"Living on campus at Georgian Court University has been an experience when it comes to meeting new people. For instance, living with a roommate is like living with a relative because you both share the same space and see each other everyday. This gives people the opportunity to get out of his/her comfort zone and interact with others, even when it comes to discovering dislikes and likes about people. Most importantly it gives each individual the role of being independent, level of maturity, and growth showing how life can be when living on your own with the exceptional of having a roommate and to know everyone are not as friendly as they may seem."
College Senior,4,Most of the professors I have had are also working in the real world and the stories that they provide during lectures are great great examples as far as experience and understanding the different lessons.
College Senior,4,Most of the classes are very informative and fun.
College Senior,4,The staff really work with you to help you get what you needed as far as jobs and/or internships.
College Senior,4,They are very involved in the school and make everyone feel welcomed to come and join in the celebrations.
College Sophomore,4,"Georgian Court is an academic school and is slowly making sports a strong focus on campus. Our main sports are lacrosse, basketball, and volleyball. These sports are mainly for girls as Georgian Court went co-ed last year, so a few men's teams exist. The public fitness center has state-of-the-art equipment and has everything you need to get a good workout. The gymnasium is kept clean and houses most sporting events. While the athletic department does not look as important, it is still essential to Georgian Court as a college."
College Sophomore,4,"The current residence hall I live in for what I need is suitable. My room has just enough space to hold the essentials I need to live there. The bathrooms are fine except for used paper towels on the floor. I do not appreciate the fact that I need to pay money to do my laundry when the cost to live on campus is a little under $6,000 so laundry should be included with the room and board. There is always an RA on duty to help who is easily accessible. Life as a resident at Georgian Court for me is great."
College Sophomore,4,always people on campus to help look for internships
College Junior,4,"There's a lot to choose from in Lakewood, NJ. From any type of Latino food, to Jewish cuisine, to Chick-Fil-A and McDonald's.  There's a lot to choose from at great prices especially since they have college discounts."
College Sophomore,4,"Biology is a great program , very interesting and even though i am not sure what i will do with my degree yet hopefully further classes will help me determine  which biology job opportunities i should look into."
College Sophomore,4,"food is great , school has a fast food/ sandwich place as well as dining hall with lots of selections and daily specials"
College Sophomore,4,"need to have parking pass to park or get into the university otherwise possibly get towed, lots of speed bumps most are too high for low profile cars making scratching to lower bumper a problem. Otherwise all resources such as library , cafeteria and  computer lab conveniently located easy to leave campus between class breaks and come back."
College Sophomore,4,"The parking right by the university is horrible, narrow streets and main highway near by however highway gives access to thousands of stores all within near by locations however it would be a long distance walk so transportation is needed. many restaurants and mall all within a 30 minute drive or less."
College Sophomore,4,No current problems seen personally everyone is treated fairly and not Favorited.
College Sophomore,4,"Biology advisory is amazing and willing to go above and beyond for her students lots of chemistry courses even though the major is biology and some classes overlap each other with the labs or other classes. Work load is fair, curriculum is set up very well, not sure about job opportunities or internships."
College Sophomore,4,"very limited classes offered, a lot of night classes, inconvenient for off campus students who live far, teachers however are amazing and caring, love the small class atmosphere and curriculum is fair. Work load can be a bit overwhelming however not often is it unmanageable."
College Sophomore,4,It is a beautiful campus with stunning scenery and landscaping.
College Freshman,4,I love the nursing program. lots of extra aid and study and resources available on hand and given to you
College Freshman,4,it is great and usually not glitchy
College Freshman,4,weather is not a concern- beach is close
College Sophomore,4,For a tiny school I am impressed.
College Freshman,4,"Despite the fact that there are some unlit pathways, for the most part I feel safe because there is always a security on duty. "
College Freshman,4,I do not own a car on campus but from what I have heard from peers everything seems to be absolutely fine with parking. 
College Junior,4,"Parking isn't bad, but price is."
College Junior,4,"They're strict, but it's a good thing."
College Junior,4,I don't think I could get a better experience.
College Junior,4,We have a wide range of majors. Workload isn't bad.
College Freshman,4,Separate parking for commuter and resident students. Resident parking is expensive but having a car is a necessity. There is nothing within walking distance. 
College Freshman,4,The dining hall is all you can eat. there is also a campus cafe. No food options on campus after midnight.
Alum,2,"I loved the passion of each of my professors and the small class size. However I hated the career services, and counseling departments. I did not have the “college experience” and living on campus was far too expensive. In general tuition is insane and the only return investment I feel I received was the knowledge I gained. After graduation I was no further along in my career, quite the contrary."
College Freshman,2,"I am personally an athlete and the involvement, fan support, and school spirit lack in our school. The facilities are average which is nice but I definitely think our school can upgrade a bit. Our campus is a big commuter school which means a lot of the students on campus are athletes but we don't support each other unless we're on the same team because there's a lot of cliques. The experience in being an athlete isn't the best and I definitely would have went somewhere else if I could do it over."
College Sophomore,2,Overall building quality is pretty poor. Buildings are old and dilapidated in some areas. Bathrooms are very poorly treated and up keep is also poor. I find myself cleaning up after my peers far to often.
College Sophomore,2,Georgian Court is a little behind the times. Used to be an all girls school and also a very old school in general. Dorms are below standard. Students are not treated as adults but like kids.
College Sophomore,2,"The some bathrooms have been sealed off and broken for more than a year, still didn't fix them."
College Freshman,2,its unclear and can be decieving
College Freshman,2,"Most students leave for the weekend, There are events on campus. "
College Freshman,2,the area is surrounded by a Jewish community and the parking is not too good around the school. sometimes hard to find a spot 
College Senior,2,"There are not that many guys on campus. It just became co-ed so fall 2013 is the first time many guys will be admitted. Many of the girls here are lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (not that that's a bad thing). This was not an issue for me because I began school in a committed relationship and was not looking for any other relationships."
College Junior,2,"The bust station is about 9 blocks away from the GCU campus; I knwo from teammates that this has created some issues and I have personally picked them up and taken them to it because the walk is just ridiculous and dangerous. The traffic and area surrounding GCU is not the safest, so the inconvenience of the bus station creates issues. However, the bus times run almost always at times that work for people's schedules. I know GCU also offers van rides certain days of the week to local stores and groceries."
College Junior,2,"The campus is very strict, and since we are going co-ed, the rules about sexual relations, like having sex in your room is forbidden."
College Sophomore,2,Limit Schedule – classes are hard to get. School is very small and classes are not offered every semester. Work load is average.  Facilities are good.
College Junior,2,Needs Help – Even the upperclassman dorms is plagued with mold and faulty systems that cause the fire alarms to always go off. The other two dorms need to be rebuilt.
College Sophomore,2,Very Strict – Georgian Court University is very strict.  Mostly because it is an all girls school.
College Freshman,2,"We Don't Have It!! Being that we are a all girl cathloic campus we do not have a greek life, instead we have some thing called WILD. WILD stands for Women In Leadership Development, it was started about 9 years ago. I am now a proud member and all the girls that are part of it are like sister!! I am looking forward to my future in WILD!"
College Freshman,2,Not Here – No one drinks on Campus .  Most parties are school run and can be very fun.
College Junior,2,"Very Strict – Attendance is important and most teachers keep track. you can only miss a class three times (unexcused).  The dorms are very strict. No guests after 12am on weekdays and 1am on weekends. only girls can sleepover and you need a signed form from both your roommate and RA. all guests must sign into the dorm building and you must call security ahead to let them on campus. The campus is mostly dry. put it this way, the nuns live on campus."
College Junior,2,Lakewood Campus – lakewood is known as the jewish town. most of the people that live there are hasidic jews.  there is not much to do here only on campus. pretty boring
Niche User,1,"I was an athlete at GCU and when I originally visited it seemed like a very nice place and the academics were supposed to be very good for my major. When I got there as a freshmen though, everything was completely different and the school was awful. The campus is in the worst town where no one knows how to drive and there is nothing to do. The academics were easier than my high school AP classes and the professors did not treat you like an adult but like a child. The one gen ed course I had to take was a joke. They will also press you to go to mass and practice Catholicism especially if you are an athlete because you have a team mass every month. The athletic facilities are decent but the gym is so small that you can barely fit a team in there. Since there’s nothing to do off campus or on campus everyone just partied every night. It is not worth the money."
Senior,1,"I am a senior at this school, I transferred here in Fall of 2015. I really thought this place was going to provide an excellent education and a rigorous one where I would have academic growth. Unfortunately, my wishes and predictions proved to be very very wrong. This place is way overpriced for the education you get. The classes are not challenging enough at all, and you have to take mindless and useless gen ed classes that have nothing to do with your major, and the class times are unacceptable as well. This place is a joke, and please, whatever you do, don't let these clowns here fool you about how great this place is. They will lie to get you to come and be trapped at this so-called ""university,"" which I don't think it is at all. Its old, outdated, rundown, in a depressing area, and not worth what you pay. I can't stand this place and can't wait to be done this upcoming Fall. Half the students here, as far as I'm concerned have no business being in a college."
Freshman,1,"Academics and professors at the school are pretty good for some majors, but the social aspect and dorms are torture. It's probably a great school for commuters, but if you have to dorm, don't come here. The dorms are disgusting and barely cleaned, there's mold, the food is awful, and there's never any activities or clubs. It's not worth all of the money students pay. I'm transferring at the end of the year, because I couldn't imagine spending another three years at the school."
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek Life whatsoever.
College Sophomore,1,nothing to do off campus
College Sophomore,1,"There is none, I wish there was though."
College Junior,1,Lakewood is not a good area to live in.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life.
College Senior,1,There are no Greeks establishments except for the clubs. No Sorority or Fraternities.
College Freshman,1,There are no boys at the school to next year but as of the girls you have most that stay to themselves and other that like to start drama. They school really isn't that fun there not much for the students to do. I think there should be a little more fun. The food they give us in the dinner hall is very nasty. The dorms bathroom sometimes are very dirty the hardly clean them for us.
College Sophomore,1,"The town is  filled with people who don't know the rules af the road, not only driving but walking as well. there is always someone walking in the street in front of you."
College Sophomore,1,THE TEAMS AT OUR SCHOOL IS OK. EVERY TEAM EXCEPT FOR THE BASKETBALL TEAM IS REALLY GOOD. THE BASKETBALL TEAM SUCKS.
College Freshman,1,"NOT GOOD – THE TRANSPORTATION AT GEORGIAN COURT UNIVERSITY NEED TO UPGRADE. INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE BUS, THEY NEED MORE BUSES FOR THE STUDENTS. BECAUSE IF THE VAN IS FULL THEN THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T GO AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. ALSO THE HOURS SHOULD BE LONGER."
College Freshman,1,In Lakewood NJ there isn't much to do for students who live on campus
College Freshman,1,"The facilities aren't in the best shape. There was recently built the ""wellness"" center where the gym and weight room is located. A lot of the buildings here are old but the library is very nice and somewhat big. the campus is very quiet."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much Around – There is not much housing anywhere close to campus where students could live.  There are not really any apartment complexes in the immediate area.  Also, some neighborhoods near the school are not neighborhoods where students would want to live.  Students are much, much better off just living in the on campus housing."
College Freshman,1,Financial aid service at my school is okay. But the process takes entirely too long and not much aid is awarded.
College Freshman,1,"This school doesn't have a nightlife. In fact, you don't even want to go off campus because of drug shootings and bad driving. You're not allowed to have boys past 12 on the weekdays, so that kills the fun, too."
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't any dining off campus, if there is it's all kosher foods and far to get to"

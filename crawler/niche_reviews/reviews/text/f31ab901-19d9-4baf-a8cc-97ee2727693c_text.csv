Freshman,5,I have not taken any classes online except for one day. Everything I experienced was great and I've heard that online students get all the help they need.
Freshman,5,"Appalachian Bible College is a solid, Christian school. It is a great place to get grounded in the Word of God. The staff and faculty are really amazing and helpful. It is a small school, so everyone can get to know you personally. There is a great family feel because their motto is. . .because life is for service."
Junior,5,"Appalachian Bible College is a campus that upholds a solid education experience while submerging the student body in ministries throughout the town and on campus, as a means to grow each individual personally and spiritually."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending Appalachian Bible College! The students and staff love getting to know new people and their current students! When I first went to Preview at ABC, the students and staff welcomed me in the moment I stepped foot on campus! The people there do not only care about how one is doing, but they also care about your spiritual walk with God. The ABC Campus tries to get everyone involved in different fundraisers and events! One of the fundraisers ABC had was having dinner at one of the staff's house. The staff really care about the students and they want to get to know them better. The staff, each year, are paired with different students to become their prayer partners. Appalachian Bible College equips their students to work in the ministry. Even though some students do not go into full time ministry, the classes prepares the students in any field."
Freshman,5,Appalachian Bible College is an amazing college! I would suggest it to anyone who was looking for a Bible college with a family feel to it.
Sophomore,5,"I love that this school does not have a campus church, but instead encourages their students to be involved in the community of the Beckley area."
Junior,5,I love going to ABC. The atmosphere is wonderful. The students encourage one another to be in God's Word everyday. There are many nice things to go see around  Beckley. The staff is very nice and encouraging. It's a good place to get to know God's Word better to be able to serve others when we graduate.
Freshman,5,Professors are very educated. They are able to teach in a way that makes learning fun and keeps you interested.
Senior,5,It is an amazing school that offers beautiful scenery and a lot of student and teacher interaction. I would love to see more students go there in the next few years.
College Sophomore,5,"There is no smoking, drinking, or drug use allowed or used at Appalachian Bible college."
College Sophomore,5,"We do not have problems with sexual assault, but if there were a case of it I know the students and faculty would do everything they could to help the victim and to bring the rapist to justice. 

Our school does a great job of reminding us of safety measures and of alerting us to possible risks in the area.

We do not have a problem with campus crime either.

Dorms are locked at curfew and there are night time security guards that do a great job."
College Freshman,5,"I feel completely safe and secure. I don't feel as if anything of mine would ever be stolen or that I could be physically harmed in any way. Even though the surrounding community is rather dangerous, campus feels completely safe."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone gets very excited to cheer on the teams. Being a part of an athletic team there, it is great to see everyone come out for the games. Intermurals are main topics of conversation around campus. Everyone wants to be involved in them. I think the athletic programs create a friendly and growing atmosphere on campus."
College Sophomore,5,I'm not sure. Internships are available after your junior year.
College Sophomore,5,The work load is normal for any college situation. Some classes have more work depending on the nature of the class. I thoroughly enjoy learning at ABC.
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy with my program. There are multiple options to get involved. Teachers are great! Advisers are very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone has a fair chance to get into programs. Tryouts are usually conducted. Grades must be maintained.
College Sophomore,5,"My School is very strict in most areas including dress, movies, music, and much more"
College Freshman,5,"The campus is really too small to demand extensive transportation services. There are buses to school events off campus, and a great percentage of students have cars to get into town otherwise."
College Freshman,5,"We havent had anything that was drug related on campus that had to do with the students. There have been a few incidents that have happened with outside people and being on our campus with drugs and alcohol, but other than that our campus is clean."
Freshman,4,"It is a very good college.  The faculty and staff are very friendly, helpful, and personal.  The only thing that will stand in a person's way is the cost."
College Sophomore,4,"We have students from around the world with varying economic backgrounds. 

Most people agree politically and religiously, but there is acceptance all around.

Sexual orientation is herterosexual or you probably won't be attending ABC for long"
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the students plan to become pastors, missionaries, summer camp workers, or school teachers. These people will have a pretty easy time following their plans from the degrees offered. 

I want to open a community center for foster teens. I am getting a counseling minor along with my two BAs that will either prepare me to go straight into this or allow me to get a masters related to my field of work."
College Sophomore,4,"The course quality is better than average, and the professors do their best to help us learn the material in a way that will stick with us for life.

Classes are mostly lecture style with questions freely asked throughout. 

Class size can vary from 4-50."
College Sophomore,4,"The academic studies are hard, but it means the students are gaining a good education.

The teachers are fair, but helpful. If you are having health problems a lot of teachers will work with you and extend dates for you. They genuinely care when you have a problem and want to help you through it. If you don't understand things the teachers will meet with you to help you understand.

The other students have a heart for God and for service. In one year I found some of the best friends I have had my whole life.

There are plenty of opportunities for work or fun.

My favorite experiences were with fellow students studying the Bible, praying, playing games, and hanging out. 

I would absolutely pick this school again and recommend it."
College Freshman,4,The work load was light for me this previous semester. The atmosphere is great. The faculty are encouraging and helpful. The fellow students are fun and easy to get along with.
College Freshman,4,The professors care very much about your education. They are not all extreme quality in their profession but they take time out of their schedule to help you. The classes all have a main focal point that they follow well. Because it is a Bible school the focus on Scripture is vital.
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities for on campus jobs. The chairmen of the majors do their best to find opportunities for students to have internships. There are many missions based internships.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy living on campus. The social atmosphere is great and there is an option for quality and price. The nicer dorm building is very fancy but a little more expensive. I prefer the cheaper building, which doesn't have as many luxuries but suits me fine. The RAs are all helpful and enforcing. I haven't had a problem yet with people being obnoxious, waiting for a shower or finding the space inconvenient."
College Freshman,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at school so far. I have become involved in many various activities, but I am excited to see that it does not conflict with my grades and studied. Making so many friends, and traveling with the volleyball team and choir have been the highlights so far. I found the work load to be fairly easy and a high GPA very attainable. Overall, college has been great so far!"
College Junior,4,Appalachian Bible College has been a huge blessing in my life so far. I have grown so much in so many ways while attending here! The atmosphere of the faculty and students here is so welcoming and friendly! I have learned many valuable life lessons since attending here from freshman year up until my current day junior year!
College Sophomore,4,Parking is free. If your car isn't in the proper place at night then usually you will receive a fine.
College Sophomore,4,"Options to choose from. includes salad bar, dessert bar, hot bar, and more. not as big as other schools but very appropriate for their size."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorm life is great and the rooms are really spacious and practical to live in each room has a sink in it, but there are community bathrooms down the hall."
College Sophomore,4,"Facilities are Great, buildings are a little spread out, athletic centers are exceptional everything was functional and up to date!"
College Sophomore,4,The social life is great! Almost everyone is very friendly and everyone is always finding fun activities to do with friends.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors are very intelligent and knowledgeable. The freshman year classes were mostly a breeze if you studied.
College Freshman,4,"School spirit  was beautifully strong at ABC. We held large cheering parades that marched across campus to the soccer field at every game, drumming on buckets, riding in the backs of trucks, and painting ourselves blue the whole way. The warriors mascot never missed a game. The sports available were basketball, soccer, and women's volleyball. We have a beautiful gym with just enough seating for the school and visitors, and a wide soccer field in central campus."
College Freshman,4,We have alot of different people and ethnics on the campus. We have people from Israel and India. They are treated with the same respect as everyone else.
College Freshman,4,"Well just recently we had a giant snow storm and it greatly affected the community around us, but as a campus it didn't really affect much. We had some classes canceled due to the professors not being able to get out of their houses but other wise we had class. When it gets warmer, everyone likes to hang out together."
College Sophomore,2,Not many options. Only open at certain times. No late night opens available.
College Sophomore,2,The facilities are comfortable and practical but not impressive.
College Sophomore,2,"The girls' dorm is comfortable, with concrete-block walls and and tile floors."
College Senior,2,"ABC offers a very limited number of  programs. If you are going to attend this school then it has to fit just right with what you want, because there are not very many options otherwise. I will say, however, that the programs they do have are very in depth and well covered. Well taught and they will not leave you lacking very much when you go out to get a career."
College Sophomore,1,"Very strict. Couples can't hold hands or show affection, can't be on internet after midnight, can't go off campus after curfew, etc."
College Freshman,1,"Generally everyone is mid-class, white American from a Baptist background."
College Freshman,1,"Finanical Aid – Because my parents make too much, we can't get any help. It's still a struggle to pay for school though"

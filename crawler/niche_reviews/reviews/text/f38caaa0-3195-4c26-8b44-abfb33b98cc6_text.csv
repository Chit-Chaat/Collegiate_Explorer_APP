Senior,5,The shift to online learning was fairly seamless considering many professors had never taught online classes. My education has become more accessible.
Junior,5,"My experience at the University of Oregon has been great, I have met a lot of great people, the professors are kind and understanding, and the atmosphere at the university and Eugene/Springfield is unique."
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful. I have never had a negative experience with a professor! You definitely find your group and feel at home no matter what your interests are. There are many places to study and get support. The location of the campus is so perfect and next to anything you might need!
Sophomore,5,My spring term of 2020 as well as fall term of 2020 have been online. UO professors make the transition to remote learning as comfortable and stress free as they can!
Junior,5,"While it's definitely harder to maintain focus and motivation when classes are online, the teachers do a really great job keeping everything low-pressure and communicating with their students about the online process.  I especially enjoy having a mix of synchronous and asynchronous class time.  You can have a bit more leeway with how and when you do assignments but you don't miss out on the valuable face to face discussions."
Freshman,5,"good campus, large but environmentally friendly, eco-conscious, and easy to walk around and get place to place"
Senior,5,"The University of Oregon has been excellent for those pursuing higher education. The location in Eugene, Oregon is central to the city of Eugene. Student housing is available on campus as well as apartments and other rentals in the surrounding areas of Eugene. These living opportunities allow current and potential students the opportunity to easily access the campus grounds as well as the surrounding businesses of Eugene.

By being in such proximity to the city of Eugene, students have excellent opportunities to engage in student life. There are various restaurants, night life, and beautiful parks for students to enjoy. Hiking trails also abound the surrounding nature areas of Eugene such as Spencer's, Skinner's, and Pisgah which offer beautiful views of Eugene."
Senior,5,"My online learning experience has been excellent and smooth. Professors are extremely supportive of their students with virtual office hours set weekly and available by appointment. The coursework is engaging and provides students with a healthy challenge. Although some students may worry about a lack of interaction with other students, all online classes have provided various ways for students to interact and engage in positive relationships. 

The ease of learning through the University's online learning programs will cause any students to excel in their studies and academic career. The lessons are structured weekly to provide the student with familiarity and confidence."
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience has been nothing but positive. The professors have integrated their teaching methods through an online avenue flawlessly.
Sophomore,5,The University of Oregon is a place for everyone. It has an inclusive environment that encourages everyone t thrive and grow. I would recommend this institution to anyone who is looking for good staff and a welcoming place.
Sophomore,5,"The professors with which I have interacted have all been incredibly passionate about their fields of study, which has made my education that much more enjoyable. There are plenty of communities with which one can get involved, and every opportunity made available by the university is easily accessible. The beautiful and spacious campus is just a cherry on top of an excellent educational experience."
Sophomore,5,"Though we were all plunged unwillingly into online classes for the unprecedented Spring 2020 term, my experience with the university remained positive, as professors were able to successfully transition their classes online with help from the university. My classes took full advantage of online-based resources to make the learning experience as streamlined and connected as possible."
Sophomore,5,"I love that there are more (combined) out of state and international students than Oregonians. The geographic diversity is a huge plus because you will make friends from all over. You get the benefit of different cultures and perspectives, then you have cool places to visit. Most of the students that join Greek life are out of state, they’re looking for an immediate second family. But you absolutely will make friends either way because of all the organized activities for students, the clubs, rec teams and more. Everyone does their own thing and supports each other. There’s no pressure to be social or party at all."
Sophomore,5,UO has rigorous academics with thoughtful curriculum. The online experience did not compromise anything for me.
Junior,5,Online was fine. Even my music classes continued. The students were able to get anything they needed.
Junior,5,"I only considered universities with good music programs. I’m a business major but wanted to continue my 10 years of  musicianship. University of Oregon was the easy choice for me, offering both a rigorous college of business and a talented school of music. I highly recommend joining the marching band if you love sports, you travel with the teams and get the best seats in the house. It’s something you will always remember and you will be so proud to be a Duck."
Junior,5,I only did online one term due to campus closing for Covid. It was fine and the professors were creative about bringing us the next best experience to in person instruction.
Junior,5,The U of O is great for pre-med. The new Knight Science campus has to be seen to be believed. The research opportunities are exceptional for undergrads. The professors are the best bar none.
Sophomore,5,"The UO has great academics, a beautiful campus, amazing athletics, great teachers, and friendly students."
Junior,5,"The University of Oregon is very diverse and many clubs to engage students of color. The campus has a welcoming feeling and is very pretty. There are many resources for assistance for career planning, graduation planning, major search and many other needs. The advisors are very accessible and helpful. One thing I really like about the University is that for every department there are advisors, even for other departments besides majors. I have been at the University of Oregon for two years so far and my experience has been great."
Freshman,5,"Absolutely love it here, everyone is so helpful and I feel like I am set up for success! The campus is absolutely gorgeous, especially during the Fall!"
Sophomore,5,"Great culture and a beautiful campus. The professors are kind and intelligent, and the students feel like family right away."
Sophomore,5,I've taken a few classes online to take care of my grandparents during Covid-19 and they've been very enjoyable and informative.
Freshman,5,"To be honest, I am an incoming freshman and I do not have any experience in the college education. I gave a good rating in order to prevent any negative impact if I were to give one star. However, I have lived in Eugene, Oregon for all my life, and spent my early childhood living in the neighborhood around the campus, so I am very familiar with general campus life and school culture. I hope you will still allow me to be a candidate for this scholarship."

I hope you will still allow me to be a candidate for this scholarship."
Junior,5,Great campus with even better professors and people. The atmosphere of the campus makes going to class everyday enjoyable.
Junior,5,While attending the University of Oregon I did not take any online courses because I prefer to learn in person.
Sophomore,5,"Our professors had less than a week during spring break to completely change their teaching methods and accept a dramatic reduction in pay. I was beyond impressed with the courses I took and their ability to adapt to online learning. WGS 221, SOC 204, and ART 115 were the most enjoyable classes I have taken yet, and the professors have a plethora of knowledge to share."
Sophomore,5,"The UO experience is better than anything I could have ever imagined. I went to private school all my life and felt sort of entrapped in catholic teaching. After touring, I knew this place was the most open and energetic university out there. There is a pride in the community that I have never seen anywhere else. I trust you will find your people here."
Freshman,5,University of Oregon made me feel welcomed and home the minute I was on campus. Making friends wasn’t hard as I found my place that I love to be. The resources are amazing and the campus is absolutely beautiful compared to other places I’ve seen. When someone is checking out colleges I always recommend UO as they have made a name for themselves through academics and sports. I’ve been incredibly pleased with my university experience so far!
Alum,5,"The University of Oregon is a great college with many opportunities for every type of student. From incredible sporting events such as football games and Olympic trials to plays and even a museum on campus, there‘a a way to make your experience here unique and fun. Their human physiology program is incredible and all the professors within it are super personable, intelligent, and willing to help you get to where you want to be. This school made me well prepared for the career of my choice."
Freshman,5,I would love to see no change the school is amazing! I have not been there but from review the school seems pretty amazing i am attending this year and cant wait to see the advancements others have talked about and how technologically advanced the school is.
Freshman,5,"The University of Oregon is a great school with ample funding, highly qualified staff, a great student body, and many clubs and extracurriculars to choose from. It is located in a small yet lovely town with lots of outdoor activities, beautiful hikes, and good dining spots to choose from. Students tend to feel supported by their mentors and peers. One drawback is that a majority of the funding goes toward athletics and STEM, so the great little humanities and arts programs are often left without sufficient funding. Expect a robust party scene, with loud nights on campus when the weather gets nicer. The best way to take advantage of the UO's resources is by getting involved, so put yourself out there!"
Freshman,5,"Coming from a place like South Dakota, Oregon was a huge change. What captivated me the most was the laid-back, easygoing attitudes of West Coast natives. Compared to South Dakotans, they were more accepting, easy to approach, and just overall enjoyable people. In addition, the campus is beautiful and lively with flora and wildlife--most notably, ducks! However, the price tag, along with the self-interested, acquisitive behavior displayed by much the administration tarnishes the great image of the UO."
Alum,5,The UO campus is beautiful and you are surrounded by a friendly community which focuses strongly on embracing all cultures. The professors are also very helpful and knowledgeable on their content.
Sophomore,5,I love the University of Oregon. It is the best place for me to get my education and I have a great time here. But the diversity here is not good. It is hard for me to find people that are like me. The university really tries to push the idea that we're diverse but it is not a diverse place.
Alum,5,The people at Oregon are amazing. They're laid back but also very involved in local environmental issues and more within the community.
Niche User,5,"I really enjoyed visiting the school of music. I met Professor Hal Grossman a couple of years ago, and he asked me to study violin with him in college. University of Oregon feels like a great fit."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school, beautiful campus with good balance between education, school spirit, and extra curriculars!"
Niche User,5,"the experience was great! I had gotten a tour of the college and it was big and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The open views of the trees when you're walking from class to class is extravagant. The food that was served to us for lunch was even better. We had spaghetti, although one didn't have any meat and one did; vegan safe."
Freshman,5,"The University of Oregon is a huge place, with nice people and cozy spaces. You can feel at home anywhere you go!"
Freshman,5,"University of Oregon is an amazing school and has such amazing people. The whole campus just has an open environment and it feels very judgement free. I really felt like I could be myself at that school even if that didn't fit societies standards of normal. While it has such a freeing environment it also has amazing professors and superb classes. The knowledge that I've gained just through my first year was mind blowing. Most of the negative things that you expect college to be (pretentious, intimidating, exhausting) is not what University of Oregon is. They are almost quite the opposite and I believe whole heatedly that this school was meant for me!"
Niche User,5,"This is the University of 21st century, a nice institution to learn.
I came to know University of Oregon through Internet and I got impressed and admired to study there but am from a humble family. I wish God sees me through I will surely fly to USA for my undergraduate degree"
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in high school who has been accepted to University of Oregon. I have toured it once, and spoke to administration. Everything about it is perfect for me"
Senior,5,"The University of Oregon is a great place to go for your undergraduate education. There are so many opportunities to get involved in areas that you are interested, the possibilities are endless!"
Senior,5,"It is a great school with many different majors. It is a liberal arts school, meaning there are more art and design related majors than science. It is a well known school across the world and you get to meet other students from all over. I have had nothing but good experiences here."
Freshman,5,"In my first year at UO, I have had an excellent experience. Great  academics as well as social life outside the classroom."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school! All the people who work on campus are sweet and helpful. The professors also really want you to learn, and care that you do well."
Niche User,5,Great admissions process and lovely orientation. They seem to truly value each and every student. Can’t wait to go there!
Freshman,5,"My favorite part about the University of Oregon is the campus. The Earl Memorial Union is a fantastic central hub for all the university students, whether its for the pursuit of knowledge, or just recreational activities. The Lillis Business Complex is where I see myself spending the next 4 years, learning about business."
Freshman,5,There is so many opportunities offered as well as many people that are dedicated to making sure you are on track to your goal. All of the professors and advisors I have had really want their students to succeed. It is easy to meet new people and get involved with the school's activities.
Senior,5,"I love my experience at the University of Oregon. The professors really care about you and your quality of learning. If you reach out to them, they will do whatever they can to help you, so don't feel intimidated by their level of expertise. Additionally, the campus itself has a lot of really great resources for many things, such as mental health and more."
Senior,5,"The University of Oregon is a great place to study with lots of diverse classes offered. It would be perfect if the local area wasn't so dodgy. The campus is gorgeous but once you step off, there are robberies, shots fired, and homeless people chasing you with sticks."
Niche User,5,when i visited it was nice. The  people are very friendly and the food is great. All the dorms are pretty decent sized and the community space is great. All teachers and professors are very chill and are always there if you need help.  The athletic is pretty great especially the football team. The gym and pool are also very good and recommend people to visit. All students are very friendly and love to engage with each other.
Freshman,5,"The University of Oregon, or UO for short, is located in Eugene, a town that bills itself on its strengths in the arts and outdoor activities. Students interested in the arts have a similarly vast array of events to choose from at UO and the surrounding community, from the Oregon Bach Festival to the Cinema Pacific Film Festival."
Freshman,5,"The University of Oregon is a modern innovative school that offers many opportunities for individuals to study what they want to pursue in life. With the wholesome loving community, we know as Eugene University of Oregon is the heart of the city."
Niche User,5,"The University of Oregon is a very welcoming place. As soon as you walk on campus you feel as though it doesn't matter where you came from. The staff are polite and answer all your questions, the students seem happy and determined, and the overall atmosphere makes you feel comfortable. The school is also very modern and does its best to continually update technology-wise. Its social media page is well kept, it has state of the art facilities, and the website is well-equipped to make things easier for everyone. It is overall an amazing place to take the adventure that is college."
Niche User,5,I love the changes and many additions they made to their university especially with the addition of their new locker room that screams Oregon ducks. The sporty green and yellow locker room brings a ready to go attitude which brings in a winning tradition for many years to come.
Freshman,5,"I will be starting as a freshman, looking forward to all UO has to offer. I plan on joining a sorority to meet new people.  I am getting my degree in elementary education.  I'm looking forward to being a third grade teacher."
Graduate Student,5,"As a new incoming student I haven't had much experience with the university yet, but I'm excited to be a part of environmentally innovative studios."
Senior,4,They offer an excellent education for people who try to get the most out of their learning in college. Tuition could definitely be less. They need someone to reassess spendings in the university so money gets better distributed to departments that need it.
Junior,4,"The University of Oregon is an adaptive institution dedicated to the success of its students. When applying for admission, I had people there to help me through email, and when I began my classes, most of my professors were quick to reply. 
   Suggested improvements would be to have one platform for online learning rather than some classes having different learning platforms. Further, it is very important for the professors to be fully updated on the platforms tools so the delivery of ideas can run smoothly. This was one obstacle that was evident during the Winter term of 2020 as the school switched to mainly online classes due to COVID-19"
Junior,4,The professors are very understanding of the hard times we are facing at the moment and are trying their hardest to provide the a great education to their students.
Junior,4,"I love the University of Oregon.  Everyone is extremely welcoming and friendly and there are always events on campus where you can meet new people and try new things.  The only issue I have is that a lot of faculty and other staff take a long time to respond to emails, etc. which can be stressful."
Senior,4,"UO is a great school, especially if you are planning on pursuing a degree in business. If you are willing to try new things and take advantage of all the opportunities that are given to you, you will be able to not only excel but also find the perfect job upon graduation. There are many opportunities to get involved in just about anything. The facilities are always improving and the community is helpful and inclusive."
Senior,4,"UO has been very attentive to the community, and communicates updates about how they are currently functioning / future plans every day. For me personally remote learning has been much more convenient, but it depends on your style of learning. We have to remember that the Universities are adjusting to this pandemic, just as we are and with the safety of thousands to consider. I think UO has done an excellent job."
Sophomore,4,"I've liked the classes that I've had to take online. Professors have done a good job adapting to online learning since the COVID-19 pandemic, and while at times it's been overwhelming, overall it has been a positive experience."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed the environment and the school's connection to Eugene. Every sporting event is fun and lively. So far I've liked all my professors, and the classes are extremely educational and insightful. I've personally had a difficult time connecting to other students, even within the Honors College where the classroom environments are supposed to be more personal. But other than this I've enjoyed my experience."
Sophomore,4,"I have a difficult time learning from my classes being all online. The UO makes sure students have all resources they need to learn, and are open to suggestions from students."
Junior,4,The University of Oregon is a great 4-year university. I have plenty options of classes to take and the professors are great.
Junior,4,"I have taken two online courses so far, and the courses I have taken are very well organized and the professors are very engaged in their material and also when assistance is needed, it isn't hard to get a hold of them. Unfortunately this year in 2020, we all experienced a pandemic, which affected the world. Education was impacted in many forms. All classes were needed to go online and the professors were faced to an unexpected drastic change. Fortunately, they did their best to serve the best quality education, and certainly they did. From my part the classes were very well organized and productive."
Senior,4,I just did online learning this Spring and it is perfect. The school know how to handle the online learning in this situation.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful but the rain is a little much (true Oregonians will understand)! Lecture rooms are definitely outdated and cramped, except for a choice few buildings. Staff is wonderful and so are university advisors!"
Sophomore,4,"I'm taking a full online course load due to the pandemic. Some professors are better at uploading notes and being flexible with due dates, but that is to be expected. Good news is that all my professors check their emails regularly and usually respond within a day. Most classes have manageable course work."
Freshman,4,"The remote learning was a challenge as some classes and departments were better prepared than others. Most of my professors were lenient and very understanding, but there are some that have unrealistic expectations for this term and it was difficult to want to go those classes as they set such a high bar that at the moment was too high."
Alum,4,"Fantastic! In addition to making many friends, I learned more than I ever thought I would. The facilities very much reward hard work with good results, constantly encouraging you to try your hardest. The attention to diversity and inclusiveness is always a plus."
Alum,4,"UO is an amazing school with a sense of community like no other. However, it is very poorly managed and its administration routinely screws over the students and faculty. Admin does not care about the university at all, they only care about lining their own pocketbooks. Other than that, it is truly a magical place–so magical that the dorm food is actually GOOD. The students here are intelligent, eccentric, and hilarious. Everyone is proud to be a duck, at you will hear people on campus yelling ""SCO DUCKS"" at all hours of the day and night."
Freshman,4,"This was my first year at the UO and overall I had a great experience. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and as a freshman, everyone is really in the same boat so it was not hard to make friends. The faculty and admin are very helpful and they are always willing to figure something out if needed for you."
Niche User,4,"The school offers many opportunities and is flexible to each student.

University of Oregon has been accommodating for my family, but with the recent COVID-19 outbreak, it has put extra fees on online courses and made it harder to get a lower quality education. The tuition remains the same and support is not being given to students."
Junior,4,I love the nature that surrounds the school. The way they interlock the school with natural beauty without too many building and non-natural things are great.
Freshman,4,"The University of Oregon is located in a college town that supports the school endlessly. The schools makes sure that every student is safe and able to express themselves however they want. Although the campus is not too diverse the school still tries to include students of all races in activities, etc. With professors who are teaching subjects that they are truly passionate about do whatever they can to assists their students in their success and willingness to succeed."
Senior,4,"The architecture program is robust, it has developed me to be a well-trained and prepared professional. Campus is lovely, and I appreciate the sense of community. My teachers and courses have been mostly great."
Freshman,4,It is an environment that is genuinely like no other. It is a world all it’s own that is breathtaking in any weather as well as welcoming and inclusive
Senior,4,"I  really liked the University of Oregon. I am finishing my degree there currently. I have received a lot of financial assistance being a resident from Oregon. I went through the reporting process for sexual misconduct, and I thought the way the administration handled it was amazing. I felt supported. The instructors and students here are very liberal. I would have liked the school to be a little less free-spirited and more serious. The instructors in my major (Family and Human Services) were very knowledgable and helpful throughout my 4 years."
Freshman,4,The campus is really beautiful and there are always activities and organizations to find. The academics are great and dorm life is super fun. There is a big lack in diversity on campus though.
Niche User,4,"I am currently not enrolled in UO as of right now; but I have visited multiple times. That being said, the environment is very friendly, the campus is gorgeous, and the professors are very interesting."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the University of Oregon, because while I have lived in Eugene all my life, the UO is my home away from home. At the University of Oregon, I'm able to expand my horizons and discover new skills or hobbies I never expected to find interesting. I've joined countless clubs, from water polo to geology and I've even become a member of a sorority. I've always struggled to make friends but at the UO the classrooms and diverse opportunities have given me the opportunitty to step out of my comfort zone."
Niche User,4,I work at a science camp at the U of O in the summer and I have had nothing but good experiences from the friendly campus to the accessible bikes you can rent to sporting events. The University of Oregon is clean and has many new beautifully renovated buildings and old rustic buildings as well. Overall it is a well-rounded campus and college that I recommend.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the friendly environment! I love the feeling of a bigger school and knowing that there are many people on campus that I can potentially meet and network with for the future. The opportunities at this school are amazing! Everyone including the TA's and Professor's care for you academic excellence and are willing to help! I love the school spirit and the hype that everyone possess on game days! The students all around you are focused and ready to learn new things! The support whether it is academically or mentally really helps the individual student to thrive and do their best!!!
Senior,4,"Oregon made me step out of my comfort zone with its large campus but every class I took taught me something new and useful. Once I made it to my program of choice I was confident in my choice of Oregon. The campus is beautiful, academic advising was extremely helpful and the financial aide office was a life saver for me."
Freshman,4,"All around, the University of Oregon has been an amazing experience. I was an incoming freshman this past fall. The people and classes are amazing. Though one thing I would change is that it be mandatory that GE's must go to the classes as well. Many times they did not know how to help the students, because they didn't known how to explain it to us."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman, and so far UO is amazing. The professors have been very friendly and helpful, and care about your education. Dorms and student life have also been very nice"
Freshman,4,"The University of Oregon is very helpful regarding any assistance you my need in  any subject that may be difficult. It also has a great student life, so getting to know people is easier since the people who attend are usually very open and kind. I enjoy the dorm space and the living environment as well since I feel safe on campus, and the athletics are a really great way to get involved in school spirit along with the clubs that are offered. Overall, I really have enjoyed my experience at the University of Oregon and would highly recommend it to others interested."
Senior,4,"The campus is special and is very unique! I am very happy with my choice of the U of O! The advisors helped me find what my true passions are and they are helping me prepare for life after college. The only down side is that during winter it does rain but spring and fall are incredibly beautiful. When the sun is out, everyone is out doing something! All of the sport events are like no other, from basketball to football, every event is one to remember."
Sophomore,4,"University of Oregon gives lots of opportunities to their students to try new experiences academically and recreationally. The school is located in Eugene, Oregon which incorporates not only the ""college town"" lifestyle, but the unique and diverse city-life of its own - known for their hippies, hipsters, and crowned ""Track Town USA"". The business school is renowned for its excellence in producing graduates who will go on to successful careers afterwards. The STEM program at the university is expanding rapidly as well, with innovative research programs. Athletics at University of Oregon is not overshadowed by the academics either; the football team is prominent in the college football standings and are members of the Pac-12. Recreation available around Eugene, Oregon is not lacking. Only short drives away from beautiful waterfall hikes, the Pacific coast, snowy mountains, the rolling deserts, and larger cities like Portland, Oregon as well."
Sophomore,4,The University of Oregon is a great place for your undergraduate studies and provides a great education to prepare you for life after college. It offers a variety of majors and minors to choose from and has many passionate professors to help you get where you want to go. The athletics are outstanding and help bring all the students together to provide a strong community within the university. I am looking forward the years I have left here and cant wait to see where this university takes me!
Alum,4,"The University of Oregon is a large, public research university that provides numerous opportunities for students to engage in activities for leisure and to further one's career interests. As a large university, it struggles to keep class sizes small and provide enough sections of classes for all interested students to attend. That being said, UO does have a small community feel in which students can create the community they are looking for."
Alum,4,The U of O had a great sense of community. I especially enjoyed being a part of the College of Design. Architecture was rigorous but I gained exceptional experience and made incredible relationships with friends and professors.
Alum,4,"Had a great experience at UO. I really enjoyed the variety and large amount of student organizations. I would like to see more diversity in the faculty, professors, and administers."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Oregon is a great school with many resources to help you succeed. The Emu and Science Library are great places to study for exams and to do homework. The campus is an arboretum and is beautiful during the fall season. Everyone here is very friendly and welcoming. The campus dorm food is alright, Fire and Spice in Hamilton is the best place to eat. The university is updating the dorms to make them more modern and nicer since many of the dorms are very old."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are pretty good, the students are pretty nice, the food is better than expected. Overall, a pretty good experience. Don't come here if you hate the rain or cold."
Freshman,4,Overall a very good atmosphere. Professors are engaging and lively; you can really tell they care. The food could be healthier and better. Social activities are very entertaining and a nice break from school while still in school.
Junior,4,"The University of Oregon is in general a great school. There are many activities to participate in on campus, and many free services and support. In particular, they have a great student recreation center complete with a large pool and hot tub. Of course, another great part about the University is the Ducks. Because of our famous football team, this school has loads of spirit! Go Ducks!"
Junior,4,The University of Oregon is a great school to attend for college. Lots of student organization and  clubs to join and get involved in at school. Fast pace when it comes to education based on the fact each semester is 10 weeks long. Overall love my experience here at U of O and has a great atmosphere.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Oregon is great for students who are looking to become speech therapists, study psychology, business, law, etc. However, choosing a dorm can be very confusing and once you make your dorm decision, it can be very difficult to get out of it. Of course, the athletics and the student gym, or the rec, are excellent."
Sophomore,4,"University of Oregon is a beautiful green campus with both classic and modern architecture. Just walking around with all the friendly students and enjoying the random performing groups is the quintessential college experience. UO has an excellent chemistry program and there are big expansion plans. The professors are bright, engaging and available. There's many different events going on to engage and interact with the students."
Senior,4,"The campus is pretty amazing and is like its own community. Having a Starbucks, Panda Express, Chipotle, etc... is nice but makes you wonder if that's where your tuition is really being dumped into because it's not exactly necessary to have. Over the past two years, I have experienced some great professors and have no complaints. The Global Education Office is a special part of the university and more students should look into studying abroad. The Exchanges are a great way to experience another cultre while still etting an education. Also, the tuition rates for Exchanges are reasonable."
Freshman,4,"The University of Oregon has a very welcoming atmosphere: from the town around it, to the campus itself. It is a place were almost everyone is excepted. The campus is flat, which makes it possible for anyone to get around. The academic programs are some of the best, but this is coming from someone that went to a high school in a rural North Carolina town, where some people didn't even know who the president was. You feel safe on the campus, and if you get bored there, the town of Eugene has much to offer."
Alum,4,"It's a beautiful campus with a broad spectrum of academic specialties. It is heavily funded by Nike and constantly updated in accordance to their donations. Overall, my academic experience was a positive one, most professors are highly qualified and knowledgable, as well as administrators. Compared to other places I've attended, they offer a lot of help in clarifying and navigating programs, financial aid, etc."
Freshman,4,"Overall the University of Oregon is amazing. The school does a great job with offering various school activities prior and during the school year, giving you multiple opportunities to meet new people. The professors teach well, are very understanding, and have a sense of humor. Not to mention the food at UO is very good. There are plenty of dining halls and food options, even including vegan or vegetarian ones too. All together, the community and school as a whole is a great atmosphere."
Junior,4,"The University of Oregon is a great place to be. It has many amenities and tools that help students succeed. The campus is absolutely beautiful, and has many modern classrooms that are nice and efficient.  The only thing I wish I could change about the UO, is the diversity. There is not much diversity at this school."
Sophomore,4,So far so good. I don't drive but I know 100% that there should be more parking available on campus. Also tuition is too expensive.
Niche User,4,Very athlete centered. The campus is spread apart but everything surrounding it is amazing. Tons of hotels and places to eat. Really good Indian restaurant next to the stadium.
Senior,4,Very good sports program and the Business program is also very good. Lots of potential of future internships
Junior,4,"At the University of Oregon, there is a good balance between studying and having a healthy social life. There are so many different club, sororities, fraternities, and sports that it is easy to find people who share your similar interests."
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere of this college is amazing. Most people are very accepting and kind. All the students and staff here are happy to be at the University of Oregon and you can tell. Almost every professor I've had has been helpful and knowledgeable. The campus is beautiful with all the trees. Eugene is a small town and most things are close enough to walk to. Even with all the rain, it is beautiful and quaint all year round."
Freshman,4,"The University of Oregon is a very good school in my opinion. If you love rainy days this is the school for you. Most professors are awesome, and really help you understand subjects that you are confused on if you seek them for office hours. Tutoring for math and writing is provided and the tutors are excellent."
Alum,4,"I largely had a wonderful experience at Oregon, specifically at the school of music and dance. I was a music major there, graduating in 2013. The entire campus is very beautiful. The school of music has excellent professors and one of the best college choirs I have ever heard. It is easy and exciting to get swept up in the sport life at U of O. Living is affordable!"
Freshman,4,University of Oregon is very dedicated to making sure students are having the best experience and provide so many resources for school and out of school activities.
Senior,4,I have really enjoyed the University.  The nightlife is wild here so make sure to have a buddy.  The instructors are usually kind and helpful!
Senior,2,"If I can choose again, I wouldn’t pick University of Oregon. The reasons are:
1. As an international student, I witnes that most people here are racist, even when I am in dorm
2. The academic is good but for more than 35,000 (the tuition will increase again soonly) a year for out-of-state, this is not a good investment
3. I am not a party person so this bothers me a lot because the party are mostly everywhere and it is unnecessarily loud
4. The school only focus on sport and left everything out, this means that students does not get much back for that much money spent.
5. Safety is not the best here. Around where I live, there are at least once crime report a day. 

However,
The great things are:
1. Good dorm food 
2. There are some nice and helpful professors"
Junior,2,"The communication needed a lot of work - there were plenty of times where deadlines weren't communicated so the whole class didn't turn something in. The professors ended up just giving up on marking-down any late work. So, you can slack the whole trimester and then just turn in a whole bunch of work at the end and still get an A, apparently? I don't think that's right..."
Freshman,2,"I wouldn’t recommend this school unless you’re looking to go more for the experience vs. the academic aspect of it. This school and its admin care far too much about athletics and so little about education, trying to find any information about anything is a challenge, the professors don’t really do much, as the graduate educators take on all of the grading tasks, class sizes are way too big to get anything valuable out of them (my smallest class is 200), the school doesn’t put their money into anything actually valuable, and this school is way too expensive for its worth. I was offered two scholarships and I’m still paying nearly $60K out of state. The school does a great job putting on a facade to the general public, making it seem like the place to be. In reality, this school doesn’t care about you unless you’re a rich, white athlete majoring in business."
Junior,2,"The University of Oregon is a decent school and offers many areas of study, with several talented and professional teachers, but it also suffered from lackluster required classes, overcrowded classrooms and inappropriate, frivolous spending which has resulted in regular tuition increases for students. The campus supports and engages racial, sexual and ethnic diversity exceptionally, but it fails to uphold diversity of opinion."
Alum,2,"I personally disliked my time at this university and even graduated early for that purpose. I found that the administration was sorely lacking, often leaving students to navigate complex administrative issues on their own. Additionally, the favoritism displayed in favor of student athletes was highly discouraging and disappointing."
Alum,2,"I believe that if you are reading this, u will not choose U of O. The amount of uncomfortable situations I was put on were terrible"
Freshman,2,"If you're into football and a never ending party scene, this is a good fit for you. If you love walking to class in the rain every morning, this is a good fit for you. If you hate sleep and love drunk girls yelling outside your window, this is a good fit for you. If you're a quiet nerd who actually wants to learn, look into another school."
Sophomore,2,"Just don't go here. I made the decision to save money and they gave me a great scholarship, and I've regretted every day I've spent here. The weather and rain is literally soul-sucking, the people are miserable and vapid and the few gems that I've found are few and far between. The frats are predatory and a safety hazard. The professors at least are all wonderful, but not worth the true misery and huge effects on my mental health that this place has cost me. The counseling here means well but is severely understaffed, people have been on the waitlist for many terms waiting to get treatment for mental health."
College Junior,2,Eh not about it. Too clique-y and demanding. I'd rather focus on real friends and school.
College Junior,2,not interested in greek life or the attitudes it perpetuates through its students.
College Sophomore,2,"Not all of greek life is bad. It's not mostly sororities. But fraternities are some of the worst ones, because they are known to simply party all the time. They are constantly throwing parties where they only let girls in who they think are cute, and not many guys unless they are in the frat or they are in a group of girls. The rape percentage is always high at frats which is what I mostly don't like about greek life."
College Junior,2,I think that someone would have to be pretty dumb to get caught.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many of the dorms lack in spaciousness (Earl, Bean, Carson, Hamilton, etc.). There is a variety of dorm food to choose from.  LLC and Global Scholar dorms are new, spacious, and livable.  Living on campus elsewhere can be costly.  There is not much food to choose from besides 13th street, unless you have a car and are able to drive."
College Freshman,2,"I have seen on the news that young women being raped by football players, I am somewhat concerned about that on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not really familiar with Greek Life overall, but at UO they all just assume that they're such a big deal when they're really not."
College Sophomore,2,The greek life gives this school a bad name.
College Freshman,2,"It is very diverse and accepting of those in the LGBTQ community. However I find that many Chrisians and Catholics are not as accepted, understood, or welcomed by some of the campus community."
College Freshman,2,"I'm actually considering transferring. I really like attending a school where everyone is enouraged to accept and respect one another for who they are. However, I've experienced many instances of discrimination towards myself on grounds of my religion. It's difficult to feel as though I can't be who I truly am or express myself openly and honestly without judgment amongst my friends and classes. I fell like the majority of the student body is liberal to the point where they are close-minded of other's views."
College Freshman,2,"I am not a fan of Greek Life at all, but if it's your thing the UO definitely has it. Generally, I'd say that unless you're in a fraternity or sorority, you are probably generally annoyed by all things Greek."
College Sophomore,2,"A girl got robbed last month on campus and they weren't able to apprehend the suspect. That does not seem very safe to me. There is sexual assault at games and concerts where drinking is involved. There are campus watchmen and facilities to help prevent these things from happening, but they are still going on. There is a lot of work to do before U of O will be considered a safe campus."
College Senior,2,I was in it...mean atmosphere...just moved to Miami and wow surprisingly people are more accepting and nicer here than at U of O around greek life!
College Freshman,2,"I lived in Bean and had an unpleasant experience. The room was so small, the rooms were barely insulated, the hall was dirty, and I felt like I had no freedom."
College Sophomore,2,Not good. Can be a dangerous place. Many sexual assaults already this school year.
College Freshman,2,"I honestly don't know much about Greek Life. I only hear about them regarding their parties. Fraternities only allow a handful of guys to enter, but let many females in, which causes some annoyance because it limits potential socialization. Additionally, there's a frat house notorious for its sexual assault charges acquired by its members."
College Sophomore,2,There's still a rate of sexual assault on campus!
College Freshman,2,I don't think I got any financial aid because I never heard from them.
College Sophomore,2,I prefer local and organic food...wish they had more options for local progress via the campus
College Sophomore,2,Many course instructors are young with very little experience teaching.  Some professors are excellent while others are worse than teachers that I've had in community college and in high school.
College Sophomore,2,Don't expect to get any finnancial aid that is substancial.
College Freshman,2,Its really hard to find scholarships an they are very particular and have a lot of requirements
College Junior,2,More needs to be done to protect victims of sexual assault
College Sophomore,2,"The heart of Eugene is the University of Oregon. With out the school, Eugene is a very dull city. A majority of events in the city revolve around college football and basketball."
College Junior,2,Coming from a middle class family is a joke here. I do not qualify for any aid but my parents do not make close to enough to help much even though my father graduated from this school. They will absolutely help low income students but you are on your own if you come from the middle.
College Sophomore,2,very few good parties. most nights involve a lot of walking only to find no parties
College Sophomore,2,It's a joke. their parties are dry and tiny but there are not many other options so you must be a greek if you want to party.
College Junior,2,it's bad in the sense that it can be too lenient especially in terms of student athletes
College Junior,2,"The parties on campus and close to campus are great, the bars and nightclubs are NOT exciting."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The U of O is not very diverse... but for that matter, neither is Eugene."
Recent Alumnus,2,Never had works study or internship... seem to be hard to find.
College Senior,2,"Unless you are willing to live quite a ways off campus it really isn't worth your time or money. To live in a house or apartment within 10 blocks of campus every direction (except for north because that is where all the homeless and crime are) it will cost around 1,000 a month alone for either a crappy run down one bedroom, or a new apartment that has several rooms and you will HAVE to have room mates. There is no help through the school as they run their own rental business as well. You will need to expect to have to fight for a crappy house or apartment because they get snatched up fast, are ridiculously over priced, and are managed by rental companies that will find any reason to rip you off. There are only a few rental companies in Eugene you can trust, and even then they will still rip you off when they have an opportunity. One bonus is that when you get farther from campus the neighborhoods are nice, quiet, and a little bit better with prices (however housing costs in Eugene are ridiculously overpriced for what they are anyway)."
College Sophomore,2,"I am not sure about this. My friends told me that building a good relationship with professors is really important to get  financial aid at our school. Plus, we will be busy when we help with Professors' work or events."
College Senior,2,"Sadly, the core majors suffer from the same problems that most major universities suffer from: too big of classes, too expensive books, and poorly planned curriculum.  However, those teachers who realize this does not lead to proper learning or future leaders, have fought against their departments and created better courses, book options, such making all the readings available for free on Blackboard, and have moved away from monotone lectures and towards interactive lectures or even discussions.  Smaller class sizes would greater aid them in their goals."
College Junior,2,"Some of the UO fraternities are some of the most trashy, disrespectful places I've ever passed. Delta Tau Delta in particular has had a history of attempted assault and is notorious for leaving trash in the parking lot of the church next door and throwing loud parties during evening worship hours."
College Senior,2,it is so expensive it's not practical
College Sophomore,2,The weather is never predictable but when it is nice everyone is out and enjoying life and when it is not nice people find other things to do indoors to avoid the massive amounts of rain.
College Sophomore,2,"I would simply like to say that there is not nearly as much diversity on this campus as there could be. Not to say that there is not any diversity because there is, but it is hard for a student of any color to walk onto this campus not knowing anyone and not see anyone that looks like them or anyone that they resemble in the least bit. there are groups that exist to help incorporate students of color not only into the university but also into the community, but finding these groups is hard sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,The amount of work that you put in as a science major of any sort will undoubtedly be significantly more than that of any of your friends.
College Sophomore,2,I think that the way in which certain  programs are set up is rigged for the average students which makes it a little difficult if you do not work that way and some people fall behind. If I could do it over I have no idea what I would do my goals are set and they always have been.
College Sophomore,2,"I know that they are here, but it seems like an extreme amount more crimes have occurred than have been solved as of lately."
College Sophomore,2,I don't really know anything about the Greek life or participate in their events.
College Senior,2,"A lot of freshmen are attracted to greek life because they open their doors in the first few months of the year. For these kids, it's a good way to get alcohol, and meet people. They are also pursuing how movies have shown them that college is, ie wild parties, naked women, animal house stuff. A lot of them end up joining because it guarantees you around 30 friends off the bat. I was recruited by a frat, but they seemed super arrogant and sleezy. They also have no trust for anyone who isn't in the greek system."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unpaid, overworked, and very little support in obtaining one."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The rain in Oregon and the PNW as whole is bad, but people learn to embrace it and it always gives you something to talk about which is convenient :)"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have nothing good to say about my original major (music). I wound up switching programs due to the snobby, harassing faculty."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Financial aid will tell you that your freshman scholarships are easily renewable - DON'T BELIEVE THEM. They tend to take your funding away after the first year to give to other prospective students, and then you are stuck with loans and student debt."
Recent Alumnus,2,"At the U of O, you have the freedom to be a white, upper middle class vegan hippie. Otherwise, you are out of luck."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the courses are giant lectures. You don't learn much and often times they just read off their slides or take information directly from the book. I almost never go to class I just read the textbooks, its like I'm teaching myself."
College Sophomore,2,"For Biology you have to decide right away, by that I mean your freshman year. You need to start your chemistry sequence so that you can do your biology sequence the next year. Why they set it up that way I have no idea. Plenty of other colleges let you take Biology before Chemistry but not UofO"
College Sophomore,2,I'm currently deciding between Biology and Pre-Law. I may not have a choice however due to the fact that I am a sophomore and no one told me that Biology requires a Chem and Bio sequence it maybe to late for me to pick up that major.
College Freshman,2,I dont like the party scene
Alum,1,"Most anti-Veteran college that I have attended.  No balanced education here. 
 Great sports college."
Sophomore,1,"No diversity and mostly impersonal professors. Many covered up attacks on women and minorities. Basically, if you're not white and in a sorority/frat, forget about a social life."
College Sophomore,1,"I unfortunately did not receive any financial aid for this past school year, which is tough because my parents are paying for out of state tuition along with housing, food, books, etc."
College Freshman,1,Never told what scholarships are available and when.
College Sophomore,1,Sororities don't care about you if you are a freshman
College Senior,1,"Sexual assault on campus has long been this hidden issue that has recently come to light with the cover-up by the university and our police of a rape report that involved three of our basketball players, an older cover-up of a rape report that involved a football player, and the cover-ups of multiple other rape and sexual assault reports by the UOPD (they chose to omit multiple reports from their records)."
College Senior,1,"This school is NOT diverse (but I still love it, because those of us who are in the minority support each other)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Classes are a joke, and good luck trying to deal with the registration process."
College Sophomore,1,Strict. Police only target partying campus kids and their landlords. All while they continue to drive around in their new sports cars.
College Sophomore,1,"I did not receive any financial aid, except for loans.... WHERE IS EVEN THE PELL GRANT?"
Recent Alumnus,1,Pretty much no one parks on campus. And good luck trying to find street parking anywhere near campus...
College Sophomore,1,At orientation they actually tell you not to bring a car.  parking is terrible
College Freshman,1,being an average white girl with a well off family doesn't help with getting much financial aid
Recent Alumnus,1,The reporting process for crime here is bewildering. Sketchy things happen all the time.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The music students and faculty are catty, and there are few opportunities to perform. If don't want to destroy your love for music forever, save your money and go somewhere else."
College Junior,1,"Applying for financial aid is terrible. It's so much work for not much reward. My family makes enough money for financial aid to think that I don't need money. However, my parents don't pay for my college; they want to retire and according to financial aid, they can use their retirement money to pay for my college. This leaves me stuck finding scholarships and loans. It is a completely ridiculous process. It is absolutely terrible."
College Freshman,1,I hate it. Looks bad. Luckily I'm in the honors hall.
College Sophomore,1,"Not diverse at all. Sea of white kids, mostly from the Western US (OR, WA, CA, ID, UT, AZ, etc). Sort of a liberal school, but a lot of the Southern California kids tend to be more conservative, from what I've seen. I would say that UO is on the slightly more liberal side of moderate. "
College Freshman,1,"I do not have a car, but from what I can tell there are too many cars and not enough spots."
College Freshman,1,Poor parking. Do not bring a car w/o a plan. 
College Sophomore,1,"In state students seem to have a better time with financial aid, but out of state students really struggle with getting adequate financial aid or any for that matter.  With tuition increasing again this year, it has become a very common complaint of students both in and out of state.  The school needs to step it up!"
College Freshman,1,Parking is a hassle! All my friends with cars have to move theirs constantly to make sure they're following the rules.
College Sophomore,1,Sucks! It's expensive and not enough of it.
College Freshman,1,parking is a nightmare. very few open parking places on top of which you have to pay for them. parking permits are outrageous.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus isn't the best. The University wants to discourage cars and encourage a more sustainable option such as public transportation, biking, or walking. The permit costs aren't as terrible as they tell the freshman at orientation, but getting a spot can be a nightmare. The parking lot options aren't numerous and if you don't have an early class you could end up without a spot close to campus at all."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no free parking, even for visitors.  Meter parking can cost over $20 a day (if you are there all day).  Permits are over $500 a term, and they give out more permits than there are spaces (meaning you could pay $500 plus a term and still not find a single spot on campus).  It's a real problem, but one that is not likely to be resolved.  Most students bike, walk, or bus to and from school. Part of life at college."
College Junior,1,"The parking permits are extraordinarily expensive. The school also sells more parking passes than they have parking spots. There are pay to park stations and meters, but really...as a college student, even a few bucks can be hard to come by. I strongly recommend getting a bike and living close to campus. I bike 3 miles to school every day to save that extra money/"
College Sophomore,1,nothing off campus but fastfood. unless you have a car and are willing to drive places
College Senior,1,"The financial aid at all the schools that I applied to was terrible. In complete honesty, our country's financial arrangements for college are totally corrupt. I will be in debt for years after college and because scholarships are hard to achieve and my parents cannot afford to help me out, I have accepted that outcome. Due to good grades, Oregon did award me a scholarship, but it is small in comparison to the cost of out-of-state tuition. My problems are more so related to FAFSA, however because Oregon receives large sums of money for its athletic achievements, I think that it is their duty to allow more money to help out its students."
College Senior,1,"So horrible, don't even bring your car. You either have to pay meters everyday or buy really expensive passes that don't even guarantee you a spot!"
College Freshman,1,"Summer is awesome.  But during the winter you don't see the sun for months on end.  People say they love the rain but once they get here and see it rain day after day to no avail, it gets old really fast."
College Sophomore,1,"Not near enough parking.  A parking pass is usually referred to as a ""hunting pass"" because most of the time you spend time hunting for a parking spot."
College Freshman,1,I do  live off campus and as a freshman it is really hard to get into the campus life. I wish there was more done to help pull off campus freshman to feel part of the UofO. Its honestly made me hate it there and I know so many students who feel the same. We're from Eugene and spending that much money on dorms doesn't feel necessary since we can still live at home with our parents. It sucks and I hate it. Even the off campus newsletter is worthless. I feel like im still in high school.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are only about 200 parking spots on campus that you can pay $375/year for and fight to find them or you can pay a meter.  Other than that there are public buses but those are crowded.
College Freshman,1,"I get barely any. I am from out of state, they do not focus on me as much because of that. The dorm fees don't make it any easier to attend either."
College Junior,1,Barely any parking. Parking permits are so expensive.
College Senior,1,It's always raining and cloudy.  Students that have lived in very sunny places their whole life often experience seasonal depression here.
College Senior,1,horrible. unless you ride a motorcycle. even bicycle parking is tough after 9am
College Junior,1,"I gave it an F because students need to pay to park near campus when we already pay a lot of money to attend the university. We should not be made to pay for parking, maybe in specific areas we should but there should be places for free parking. And UO campus is a crowded place so it's hard to find any parking in the first place."
College Freshman,1,"There is very limited parking, so if you are trying to park and get somewhere on time, I would allot yourself an extra half hour."
College Junior,1,"Don't Do It – Parking is very expensive but unnecessary. Its easy to walk to classes and Eugene has good alternative transportation. Parking passes from the university are insanely expensive, but there's meters and other ways to find parking."
College Sophomore,1,"Only 16% Diverse – The UO definitely needs a face-lift when it comes to diversity. The student population is almost completely white. The next largest group of people are Asian, which is not an issue. It would be great to have more diversity in a cultural aspect. Although, I have only had two or three incidents of racism, the campus as a whole is very respectful, open and kind to diverse people."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Worth the Money – Parking at the university of Oregon is awful. The cost of it is outrageous and you can never find a spot to park. When I was a freshman, I parked my car at the sacred heart hospital and it was not expensive and I always could find a spot."
College Junior,1,"Old and Poor Quality – Off campus housing is horrid. If you want something affordable, expect poor quality. If you want good quality expect to pay too much."
College Sophomore,1,"Lots of It – The one thing about University of Oregon being located in Eugene is that it is extremely common to run into drugs. A lot of people do them and they are everywhere. People don't try to pressure you into doing them, but it causes some problems in certain areas around campus because it makes them a bit crazy. I have found that meth is very common, although weed is the most common of all."
College Senior,1,Parking? What parking. That is few and far between on this campus. You park on the outskirts and finding a spot can be difficult.
College Freshman,1,"I receive little to no financial aid. The only thing I do receive is a 5,000 dollar loan a year. Considering the fact that I pay out of state tuition that does not even put a dent in the cost of tuition."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not a Lot to Choose from – If it's dating that you are looking for, I would suggest a different school."
College Freshman,1,"what else? The campus is beautiful, sports are great, have met some really cool people, and some really not so cool people( however that is at any college), but what this school extremely lacks is the Fun and Crazy college experience. Greek is dry and weak, house parties are extremely weak ending way to early and just not the typical crazy college parties that you will find at schools like UCSB,Chico State,or San Diego State. The weather does make you depressed and feel claustrophobic. Eugene is a pretty small dull town, with some surprisingly good concerts however, they do have good venues! Campus strictness is getting a little overboard however I have never felt unsafe on campus ever. Its not a bad school, however if you are looking for a really crazy,memorable college experience, I would not recommend Oregon."
College Freshman,1,"gloomy, cold and not fun. makes you depressed"
College Freshman,1,"University of Oregon's nightlife sucks, there small and everything is over by 12 or 1. You will not get your Insane college experience at Oregon, that I think a lot of people constantly complain about. Concerts, and occasional big parties can be fun, but for the most part its a struggler to find a really raging typical college party."
College Sophomore,1,The Dorms – Our dorms have been rated some of the worst in the nation but we are renovating and built 2 new ones that are absolutely beautiful. With time I have faith that we will upgrade but until then it's pretty much like sharing a prison cell with a stranger. Shared showers in most dorms and florescent lights. Only freshman live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,The parking situation at my school is extremely limited and competitive.
College Sophomore,1,The drug scene is very high in marijuana and alcohol. A lot of students do these drugs a lot.
College Junior,1,"Small Town – The bar scene in Eugene is okay.  The club scene is horrible.  It seems like there are only three clubs in Eugene that play music that you can really dance to.  Out of those three, two of them are so small that everyone is packed too close to dance.  If you're underage, there's really nothing for you to do unless you can find some house parties.  I don't really like the house parties that I've been to thus far.  All anyone wanted to do was drink and get high.  There are cabs that you can call for transportation and the buses run until 10:45 pm."
College Sophomore,1,"College Town – I come from a large city, so Eugene is still very difficult for me to get used to. There are two malls, but only one mall has chain stores. There is really not much to do except for attend school and party for the students. But all the locals are very supportive of the school and its sports teams especially."
College Senior,1,No Sun – Just gray and rain the whole academic year.  It's really awful weather.  Summer doesn't start till July. 
College Sophomore,1,"Rain, Rain, Rain – I give Oregon's weather a D because it RAINS all the time. It's so gloomy and wet everyday that you become so accustomed to it and when there's a sunny day, you go crazy. The sun is such a rare sight in Eugene, which is a negative aspect of going to UO."
College Freshman,1,"You Will Always Be Late for Class – I know so many people who have parking passes that cost $400 a term, which is ridiculous. There is not enough parking but luckily we have LTD and many people live close to campus that they walk or ride their bike."
College Freshman,1,"School Strictness – The UO has had some ups and downs with their policies. The first couple weeks of this school year, there was a ""riot"" in the middle of the street and campus security threw uncalled for tear gas at students. The students weren't doing anything wrong, they were just all hanging out in the middle of the street yelling ""O"" for Oregon."

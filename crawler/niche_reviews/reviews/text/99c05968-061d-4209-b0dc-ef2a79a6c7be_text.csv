Sophomore,5,"It's a smaller school with many amazing professors. Class sizes are kept rather small which means that you aren't just a number to the professors. And since it's a smaller campus it also feels rather safe. The help that professors give is great, they are always available and willing to take the extra time to make sure you understand the class or the assignments. Sometimes during the winter, there isn't much to do in the town but the campus programs always try to make sure there is something for the students to do together. The campus staff also do an amazing job at keeping the school maintained. Even if it just snowed and there's lots of ice, they are right on it making sure that everyone's safe when they are running to class. Overall, Caz College is a great place to commute to."
Sophomore,5,"I honestly love my campus, it’s right out of a small town picture book. The lake is down the road if you want to be by water, the houses are gorgeous if you want to take a walk in the morning and ogle the house designs, and my favorite are the nature trails to hike on if you’re feeling adventurous. Since it’s a small college you really get to know your community, I made great friends once I got out of my shell and everyone is very understanding. I love how I was able to try new things and find clubs that I really know that I belong to."
Sophomore,5,"I love Cazenovia College. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. When I first started, I was extremely homesick but now I never go home unless I really have to. When it comes to professors and athletics, It's literally amazing. Although being a student athlete is really hard, I have grown so much within volleyball and lacrosse, while also growing academically because of my coaches and professors."
Alum,5,"Individualized support for my success!  Loved the small school experience and community.  The Village is also welcoming, and has unique shops.  Not far from a nice size city for shopping needs.  Overall perfect choice for me!"
Sophomore,5,What I liked about Cazenovia College was the comfort that I felt and the safety. The professors all connect with the students in an academically state matter. It is small but it sure makes you feel like you’re at home.
Niche User,5,"A beautiful school set in a beautiful lakeside town.
It's very safe and although it's not a ""party school"" there are a lot of clubs and activities."
Freshman,5,"Its a small School.   The classrooms size is small, which means one on one contact with the professors .  Lots of activities and sports on campus for everyone.   The campus is small not far to walk to class."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is small, and very accepting. Professors care about their students both in and out of the classroom. The environment is generally very positive which promotes successful learning."
Niche User,5,"I haven't yet started my college years there yet, but i plan to in the fall of 2018, but when i went for my campus tour, I loved every minute of it. The faculty, the students I passed on campus, the teachers, everyone was just so nice and welcoming! I felt as if i were at home!"
Senior,5,"I fell in love with Caz the minute I set foot on campus. There's just something about this place that makes you feel like you're making a significant change and I know I wouldn't have grown nearly as much as I have at Caz had I gone anywhere else. You get out of Caz what you put into it, and the more you participate the more you get from your experience. Almost everyone I know on campus is involved somehow, as an RA, student government officer, CABbie, tour guide, student athlete, club e-board member, honor society member... It's so easy to find your place here and there's always someone to go to if you feel like you're struggling. At Caz you have a tribe of people behind you, and even people you don't know will reach out to help you find your place."
College Junior,5,I had an internship my sophomore year and was very lucky to be able to do that. Some of my friends have not even discussed internships at their schools yet. I feel as though this school has me on the right path to be very successful when I finish
College Senior,5,"I have never taken a class that I absolutely hated, even required courses. There have been some that I went into with a very pessimistic attitude, but the professors have never failed at changing my mind and helping me to enjoy the experiences that each course provided. I also have been very fortunate to have only two primary professors who teach within the Psychology Program so I have developed extremely good relationships with these professors and they have been a great help to me. I think the Psychology Program is one of the most tight knit at Cazenovia College but I also know that many of the other Programs are close like this as well."
College Senior,5,I have never heard of a sexual assault occurring on our campus. As part of our orientation all of the incoming Freshman students go through a sexual assault awareness seminar and I have taken a sexual assault training offered through our administration. I have also participated in sexual assault awareness activities at my school and the Human Services Club always has an awareness month where they provide information on sexual assault.
College Senior,5,"I love Cazenovia College. I have had a great experience here and I would not change my school choice for the world. As soon as I had my first meeting with my adviser, to create my freshman schedule, she pulled me under her wing as a work study and research assistant. I have stayed there ever since and I appreciate her as a mentor so very much. My adviser was not the only professor that I have had a great working relationship with either, I have never hated a professor. Even for classes that were required and held less of my interest than others, the professors were great and made my experiences reflective of that."
College Freshman,5,"I have never felt unsafe on the campus. There is a system in place where there are blue lights all over campus in case of an emergency, where we can hit a button and contact campus security immediately. it is a small campus so if someone was ever in trouble and was yelling or screaming in distress, it would be heard. The administration works very hard to educate and prevent crime from happening to ensure our safety and comfort."
College Freshman,5,"The alumni network is extremely active in supporting and continuing the success of the college. In fact, many of the alum come back and work at the college. The employers and employees are very selective which of course benefits the students success. Student service centers play a very active role in our growth, acclimation, and success here. They are available almost all of the time and are very flexible in whatever a student needs. Ultimately, the college is driven by success, so everywhere you look, professors, students, classrooms, courses, service centers, etc. are all driven success and the fact that the people here want each other to be successful."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are extremely invested in your personal success. They want to see you grow and develop and ultimately succeed. The courses are very in depth and demand that students really get involved and invested in the work. The classes and professors are demanding, but in the end it is rewarding because you have grown and developed both as a student and as an individual."
College Freshman,5,"The process of getting into the dorm room of your choice is very easy and the ladies in residence life are very flexible about doing whatever they can to help you out. The dorm rooms are very plain which in my opinion is great because it really gives you the atmosphere to make it your own. Some dorm halls are nicer than others, but none of them are awful. Farber Hall, the all girls dorm, is probably the nicest of all the dorm halls though. The social atmosphere is close and comfortable, and the amenities are in close proximity. The lake in town is beautiful and one of the best things about Cazenovia, and I know that many others would agree with me as well. The community residents live right around the outside of the campus and are a very active part of the college setting. They walk around campus, usually with their dogs, and are very friendly. The cost is a little expensive, but worth it."
College Freshman,5,"Cazenovia College athletics essentially brings students together. School spirit is overwhelmingly strong here, in the best way. Almost every student is involved in athletics. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a student not wearing something that supports Cazenovia College or one of their athletic programs on any given day."
College Freshman,5,"Cazenovia College offers students with so many opportunities. Professors are extremely invested in their students and are a huge part of their success. It is an extremely small campus with a small, friendly atmosphere which makes it easy to have many connections and relationships across campus with both teachers and other students which are ultimately key to one's success here. It is a liberal arts school, so students are very open and free to express themselves in whatever way they wish to, and overall people are very accepting of each other. Cazenovia college encourages and embraces individuality and for to find themselves and express it freely."
Niche User,4,"i took a break fall semester 2020 bc of covid but transition spring semester 2020 to online was rough. so many of my teachers were understanding and im so greatful for them. shoutout to livermore, dinero, ezra, roxy! definetly recommend classes w them. i heard some profs are tough this semester but have heard others arent as hard this semester."
Sophomore,4,"So far I like Cazenovia College, it's a safe space it's small, quiet and a good place to grow. I just completed my freshman year and I'm anxious to return! The activities we get to indulge in are great. Everything from carnivals, movie trips, and even karaoke nights. Cazenovia has a lot of potential and good professors, I look forward to graduating."
Sophomore,4,"Cazenovia College is the perfect college for you, if you love a small and homey atmosphere! At Cazenovia College you are more than just a number! Professors work closely with students to ensure their succession. No one wants to see you fail here! Cazenovia is all about building community and creating a safe and diverse place for students to strive for excellence."
Senior,4,Small class sizes fit my learning style perfectly. Professors actually care about you and push you to succeed both in and out of the classroom. Dining Hall is lacking but you learn to live with it.
Senior,4,Cazenovia College offers a variety of courses that help to create a well developed education. The professors are dedicated to teaching and look to help students in their education.
Junior,4,"Cazenovia is an amazing college, after spending almost 4 years on campus, you end up with your likes and dislikes, it all just depends on you. I have enjoyed every minute of my time at Caz.  Do I sometimes wish there was more variety in the dining hall of course, but who wouldn't after 2-3 years of the same food."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty and administrative really care about the students at Cazenovia.   Everyone is invested in the future of the student and they truly want to see they succeed.  The community is small but very safe and if you crave more to do, Caz is only a few minutes away from Syracuse."
Junior,4,Overall Cazenovia College is a college where you get the most education for your money. The classes are small like they were in high school so you can talk to teachers and ask questions. Not to mention the staff knows your name after a few months instead of a large university that don't know who you are out of 10000 students. This school can also put you on the path for a great future.
Junior,4,I liked how the school was on the smaller side so pretty much you knew everyone. The community surrounding the school was close-knit. I enjoyed the way that the professors interact with the students and the fact that you could meet with them whenever you needed to and they would help you.
College Junior,4,"I really enjoyed my ""Terrorism"" class and the professor. I did not like having to take a mandatory European art history class.  My mother dragged me thru several European museums two years ago."
College Junior,4,I'm from a small farming community and I feel safe on the small campus of Caz
College Junior,4,I have been on Cazenovia Womens Swim and Dive Team for two years and we have won the NEAC conference championship two years in a row!
College Junior,4,"Since I came from a small school, I prefer the small campus of Cazenovia. I love my swim team and my coaches."
College Sophomore,4,It's pretty good except financial aid dept.  they left out some important information causing a balance when there should not have been.
College Junior,4,"The educational aspect of this school is amazing. The small classes are awesome and you get individual help from professors whenever you need it. Very easy to communicate and talk to professors. The campus is not modernized what-so-ever, very old feeling to it. Also not very handicap accessible"
College Junior,4,"Very informative on this information, through all years of schooling at Cazenovia."
College Junior,4,"The woman in charge of residential life is very accommodating and makes sure you are comfortable. If you aren't, she will do as much as she can to help you out with your living situation."
College Junior,4,"There isn't much hype about the school sporting events. Certain cliques attend them, but not usually a lot of people."
College Junior,4,"Very small school that is comfortable, but if you don't fit in with a clique then you don't fit in at all."
College Senior,4,"A degree from this school is very highly valued. Career services is very helpful when it comes to setting up interviews and providing information on job opportunities. Internships are required in many majors, however not in mine, although they are always highly recommended. I have scheduled my classes in such a way where I have been far too busy for an internship so far, however I will seek one out in my final year."
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is fine at my school. I have never had a disgusting room with structural issues or anything. I have toured every building wherein rooms are offered and I have chosen to stay in the same residence hall for the entire duration of my college career. However, this is a personal preference and I wouldn't mind living in other areas on campus."
College Junior,4,The small class size is the best aspect of this school.
College Junior,4,Graduating with a management degree along with a specialization in equine business management is an important tool to bring into the job field.
College Junior,4,"Cazenovia has the typical small town, safe atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"I feel that there is a very low crime rate on our campus. Nothing bad really ever happens here. However, I do not feel completely comfortable walking alone across campus at night."
College Freshman,4,"Cazenovia College is a highly accredited school, making a degree from the school very desirable."
College Freshman,4,"Farber Hall is the best residential housing in my opinion. It is quiet, clean, and we all get along."
College Freshman,4,Degrees from this school are looked at highly and they do provide good internship opportunities.
Recent Alumnus,4,Interior Design professors really care about their students success. It is a tough course but worth it. Classes are all very small and each student has a personal relationship with their professors no matter the major.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Career services is available to students and alumni and they are always posting job opportunities. Professors often request that career services also come to a class and go over resume and cover letter format. 

Alumni are always emailing professors letting them know of jobs in the field."
Recent Alumnus,4,I always feel safe walking alone on campus at any time. The school takes sexual assault very seriously and makes people feel comfortable about coming forward if something happens.
College Freshman,4,"Considering the town is so small, I generally feel safe even at night, and there are Campus Security in Hubbard and around campus periodically. There are also those blue lights that you pull when you are threatened throughout campus, although if you're not looking for them you may miss them."
College Freshman,4,The courses are adequate with the major and minors you intend on working in. The professors are strongly dedicated to all of the students along with what they teach.
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network come as lectures about their current careers and prospecting career exploration and success, e-mails go out to all the students or certain students who actually are interested and starting a certain career in that subject can attend those lectures."
College Freshman,4,"There is a decent amount of pros then there all cons with CAZ dealing with housing. Majority of the house is considered on campus even when you think it's not, so keeping your scholarships work well. As freshman you may have the lowest lottery number, but where you are placed is decent, and the Res life is helpful when you want to change roommates and buildings. The dorms are nice, and so are the suites. Your lottery number becomes better through the years, and once you get to know people, you wouldn't want to room with all of them."
College Freshman,4,"Cazenovia College if a very uniformed college. For being a small private school, you get pretty much your money's worth with the activities and events that CAB (Campus Activities Board) and other clubs provide. The professors themselves care about your education and your personal goals in your decided or undecided majors of education. The adverse help you find out what your path should be and also guide you in the right path too. Everyone listens to you also and opinions are strongly encouraged to help improve everything."
College Freshman,4,This college has different programs that help you adjust to living here and a change of environment. The people are really nice and welcoming. The college is also in town so you can walk to wherever to get what you need for the most part.
College Sophomore,4,Attending was the greatest decision I made in my entire life! While here I felt like it was a second home and that is because of the lovely and friendly environment.
College Freshman,4,the teachers really interact with you and want you to succeed
College Senior,4,"Small town, I always feel safe at night, even by myself"
College Junior,4,"Love it, so much more freedom."
College Senior,4,it is a good place
College Junior,4,"I personally love the weather - the summer ends pretty quickly here, but fall is beautiful and if you don't mind snow, the winter is beautiful as well.  It gets extremely cold here, but when spring hits it warms up pretty fast"
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is pretty typical - it depends where you live.  Farber Hall (all women) is typically very clean and pleasant, Shove Hall is where most of the parties and things happen but the rooms are gloomy, Hubbard is sketchy, Park and Watts are alright, and VC is clean and quiet."
College Junior,4,"Campus security is always on duty, it just depends who you get on the other end of the line when you call - some of them are friendlier than others."
College Freshman,4,One semester down and I've never felt unsafe 
College Sophomore,4,"Cazenovia is a good sized town and have a lot of shops and gas stations that are within a walking distance.  It also has its own lake which is also within walking distance from the school, and is a very beautiful to go walking and/or take photographs.  There are always announcments of some sort of sports game going on to which the students, and the locals who are very welcoming, can go to support their school."
College Sophomore,4,"I gave the transpertation at Cazenovia College an ""A"" because my school has vans that they use just about every weekend to bring students who live in the city to either a train or bus station (if they have no other transpertation home).  They also arrange to pick the same students up from the bus or train stations to bring them back to the school.  If one college student, though, needs a ride to somewhere such as an airport; I know for a fact that there have been employees that have driven the students themselves."
College Sophomore,4,"The drug scene isn't bad, but you are who you hang with.  I don't really see it with the people I hang out with.  More drinking going on then drugs."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic center is fairly new and it's very nice.  They have all kinds of sports and activities, you will not be bored.  Making the volleyball team as a freshman was great, I made new friends by being on the team.  Got to travel to our cities.  Campus activities where always happening.  There was something to do all the time."
College Sophomore,4,"I choose Cazenovia because of my major, small class sizes, location and for volleyball.  I'll be in my second year come August and looking forward to returning.  Have made a lot of new friends.  Teachers are very helpful.  The weathers a ruff but when it warns up its beatiful."
College Freshman,4,"The art majors like studio art, interior design and fashion design programs are phenomenal. The professors are great and they teach material that we will actually need to know in our fields. As for the other majors, communications doesn't really learn much or have homework. Criminal justice is mostly taking notes and getting tested on the material, and I am not familiar with any science or English majors."
College Freshman,4,"So far, cazenovia college's scholarships have been great. Even before applying for financial aid, I was given a $20,000 scholarship simply for doing well in high school. Then, I applied for work study and other small scholarships here and there provided by the college. Overall, there are many opportunities for scholarships, students just need to take time to apply to their best effort."
College Freshman,4,"For me, I like the small town feel . However, if you are looking for a college in a big city or with a lot places to go on the weekend this is not a college for you. Here you have to make your own entertainment."
College Freshman,4,there are some things you can away with but not many things.
College Freshman,4,I dont know anyone who partakes in anything like this but i have heard about people who do
College Freshman,4,Caz gives you many great selections towards majors and prepares each student for the real world. The teaches make there schedules according to the students schedule and the students get to make their own schedule.
College Freshman,4,It is a small community so there is not much crime that I have heard of. I feel pretty safe here. They are also working on adding more lights outside for at night which I believe will help.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of different personalities at Caz, you can always find someone that you have something in common with. However there are also a lot of partiers."
College Freshman,4,The computers are always available due to the fact that there are a lot of labs that are open to all students. as well as 2 labs in the library
Freshman,2,"This school is not for you if you enjoy having a social life. There is absolutely NOTHING to do on the weekends. The food is seriously terrible to the point where I stopped going to the dining hall. The only good things were the types of classes they offered for my major. I am a freshman and I was lucky enough to transfer after just one semester at Caz. If you want a real college experience, you will not find it here."
College Junior,2,Overpriced and students are required to live on campus for most of their time at the school. Very rarely are exceptions made. One more way to profit off of students. Morale would be higher if this were different.
College Freshman,2,"Cazenovia College is expensive for reasons that none of the students know why. The food is awful, professors aren't the greatest, dorms are awful, and etc. Most upperclassman will tell the freshman to ""Get out while you can!"" as they wished they did early on."
College Freshman,2,"there is a lot of drinking, smoking, and sex so i don't go"
College Freshman,2,"it's fine, but its just not enough for me as a student"
College Senior,2,"Not a lot of options, crappy food, only one dining hall, limited hours"
College Senior,2,you cant live off campus until senior year
College Senior,2,It is hard to find a place close to the dorms
College Junior,2,"There is nothing to do here.  People have to drive 45 minutes to the nearest club or go into Syracuse.  Parties happen a lot in the dorms, but only if you know those people and honestly they aren't the kind of people you generally would want to associate with..."
College Sophomore,2, I don't use it.
College Sophomore,2,"It is a great thing that Cazenovia College allows there students to be able to have their own cars and park the cars on campus property.  Finding spaces to park in can be difficult, but not impossible.  The biggest problem is the cost of the parking permits which I believe are around $175 for an entire year.  To some this may not be a big deal, but to some who find it hard to get by financially on a daily basis like myself it's difficult to pay off."
College Senior,2,"Availability Is Tough – This is a small town, with not much student housing; the college withholds scholarships if a student moves off campus, and the local police harass the college students who are off campus.  Not very alluring."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much of a Selection – Being that it's a very small campus and town overall, off-campus housing is limited. I know of the village commons which can be a little pricey. But one advantage is being able to live off campus yet getting to class can still take 5 minutes. Unfortunately, I know Cazenovia police can be a pain."
College Freshman,2,There is about a 12% diversity rate. There is a club for the minorities on campus
College Junior,2,"What Night Life? There really is no night life at the school.  There are not many things to do on campus for the students, especially at night or weekends.  There is no bus or transportation system to come and go to the city near by so it is difficult to have a good time with friends during weekends."
College Freshman,2,"Nowhere to Go, Unless You Want to Spend Money – A student gets dining dollars with their meal plan, however, they can only use it at one Thai food restaurant off-campus. The restaurant is delicious, but that's the only place. You can't even use your dining dollars on the local subway or pizza restaurant. And believe me, after eating the dining hall food, you'll want to go somewhere off-campus. Too bad your spending your own money and there's limited options."
College Freshman,2,"Can Be Stereotypical – The ratio is 7 girls to 1 guy. The average class has about 1-2 guys in it, unless it's gen ed possibly. Many (but not all) guys here live up to the tool bag/party stereotype, possible because there's not much to do in the little town. Girls are everywhere, and drama is very much about, unless you just avoid it."
College Freshman,2,"Deceiving Ratio – there is a 70:30 girl guy ratio on campus, but most of the girls are ugly, fat, or annoying"
College Freshman,2,The college's equestrian center is a state of the art facility and is kept in wonderful condition. Any other facility on campus is extremely weak. Especially the science program. They should not even claim to posses one.
College Junior,2,"At Caz everyone wants to party (dorm/suit/apt parties) and do party but it is a huge drag because the townspeople in Caz hate the college,therefor calling the cops on everything. The best part is since there is nothing better for the cops to do in Caz they basically try following students on weekends to see where the parties are. As far as the bar situation there are 2, only 2 and they are both half restaurants...."
Senior,1,"Teachers do not know how to use online tools, classes are often full and you can't get them. They make you pay FULL TUITON for online class and they are even worse than the ones in person. horrible."
Senior,1,"Please do not go to this school, food is inedible, very few decent teachers, horrible living conditions, no refunds for COVID-19 last semester, will charge you for every single thing you do. Will take every single dollar you have, and if you can't pay they will kick you out with no issue.RA's are so bored they try to get everyone in trouble and call police often over small things. AVOID THIS SCHOOL AT ALL COSTS"
College Freshman,1,"There should be Greek life around, it would make college more fun"
College Freshman,1,nothing is done about people drinking in the dorms and same with the smoking
College Freshman,1,"Miserable and lonely. no type of social life with the students around me, they are all stuck up"
College Freshman,1,I need to get out of here before it drives me insane. its too small i need more
College Freshman,1,"everything is too far away minus subways, you have to walk all the way across the bridge to the dunkin donuts, and so far away for Tops and mcdonalds"
College Freshman,1,I feel outcasted here at the college. its very grouped and clique-y like highschool. i need to see more things and see more people
College Freshman,1,i hate it here and its so boring and miserable. its too small to do anything
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life
College Freshman,1,This school is so expensive. Everything is a price.
College Junior,1,"Unless you have zero academic scholarships, off campus housing is not an option."
College Sophomore,1,Monday / thursday we have late night that has things like chicken tenders and hot wings they aren't open fridays and saturdays
College Freshman,1,"There Are No Buses :). You can sign up for the Caz van that allows 11 people to go to target plaza on Wednesdays or the mall on Sundays.  Considering the fact that there are over 1000 kids, it's pretty inconvenient."
College Freshman,1,"Not a Lot – Not many people live off campus. This mostly has to do with the fact that a lot of students have scholarships that prevent them from living off campus. There is also a shortage of off campus housing. If you're lucky enough to find it, it's pretty expensive."
College Junior,1,"There Is None – Almost no diversity whatsoever here, just take a look around the caf when you are there, and noone sits together. The tables are segrated"
College Freshman,1,Cazenovia may be the most poor excuse for a college yet. The classes are far too easy. The student body lacks any diveresty or motivation to be in college period. The facilities are outrageously week. Every student I have met at Cazenovia is transferring. Very few students are satisfied there.
College Junior,1,"Nothing to Eat – Are you craving a burger at 6pm? Do you want something from your favorite fast food place/franchise? Well If you do, you my friend are out of luck. The village of Cazenovia does not allow any franchises to enter, except for one Subway (took 4 years to get approved)and a Dunkin Donuts (located in a gas station). My favorite though is how the local diner CLOSES at 3 pm..... um what?. Needless to say unless you have a car in Caz and can drive to the nearby towns you arent eating anything decent past 3pm."
College Freshman,1,"This school has no greek life, which really stinks!"
College Freshman,1,"Everyone is in a certain clique. It is a lot like high school, but once you become friends with someone, it becomes easier, but with the different majors, there are many snobby, rich people. Of the guys that are there, most are not totally attractive."

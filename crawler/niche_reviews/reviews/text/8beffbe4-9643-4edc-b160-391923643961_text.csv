Sophomore,5,"I love how easy they have made everything for me.  There were no problems with my transfers, my classes getting stated up or any of the number of people that were willing to help.  Online classes are made easy and the professors are wonderful."
Freshman,5,Absolutely love the college atmosphere. Have an amazing wrestling coaching staff who support and encourage each and every wrestler. Helps us boost our confidence and self esteem. Encourages us to to do our best not only in there wrestling room but in class and in life.
Sophomore,5,The staff and teachers are truly interested in wanting you too be successful. The on-line school is fast paced and challenging.  If you want a great education then this is the place for you.
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student, returning to college after a 20 plus year break.  The advisors are extremely encouraging and are quick to answer any questions.  The enrollment process was easily accomplished with the aid of the enrollment advisor.  As an older returning student, I was skeptical about taking classes online;however,  the journey is amazing and extremely rewarding.   No matter your age or abilities this is an excellent way to attend classes."
Senior,5,Enrolling into Central Christian College is one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. The staff is friendly and helpful at all times. I have learned so much information to help propel me to the next level in my career as a businesswoman. Learning how to apply my Christian values to everyday situations is a plus for me. All the classes do not focus on the Bible but I really do enjoy the classes that tie in those aspects.
Sophomore,5,Every professor and student success advisor has been nothing but helpful. I have had a few struggles with personal events in my life and each person I have reached out or has reached out to me has been extremely nice and understanding.
Senior,5,"My experience at Central Christian College online courses, have been the best experience anyone could ever think of. The course fit my needs of availability, time consumption, and reliable staff. The professor's superb in giving understanding to course materials, vocabulary, and feedback to help each student succeed. I really enjoy how Biblical teaching is infused with the college courses, it really helps one to see how God is in everything from science, math, social, psychology, and the arts. I would recommend this college to anyone no matter their age, ethnicity, or background. Central Christian College of Kansas is a blessing from God. I know it was God that placed me here. For reasons out my control I could not get in another online college that I will keep nameless. But, I must say Student Success went above and beyond to get me in and CCC of Kansas has met the call and it is paying off for everyone. May God continue to bless CCC of Kansas staff, student and alumni."
Senior,5,"My experience with Central Christian College of Kansas has been awesome. The professors and the staff have been with me through my journey, and I love the way they teach using God and the Bible."
Alum,5,"I loved Central Christian College of Kansas. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and I'm moving on to graduate school. The instructors are amazing and work with you directly, even though it's an online school. I never felt like I was flying solo with all of the support and resources CCCK made available. When deciding on schools, it is important for me to keep Christ in the center of every part of my life and obtaining a higher education that excluded Him, was not an option. CCCK brings faith and education together for student looking further their education. I would HIGHLY recommend CCCK for anyone looking for an excellent Christian College!"
College Freshman,5,Feel very safe on campus
College Junior,5,It is a great school and I don't want to leave
College Sophomore,5,The people are really great and are willing to work with you to get you the financial need you need. They keep you updated about what is going on and don't let you get lost in the hustle.
College Senior,5,My financial aid process was very simple. The financial aid department was there to assist me throughout the entire process.
Recent Alumnus,5,The adult eduation program in one of the best I have seen in the state of Kansas.  It offers a lot of programs I haven't experience since I have attended colleges all over.  There are many activities for students to attend and enjoy and very christian based.
Recent Alumnus,5,I will have no problem finding an intership this year.
Recent Alumnus,5,I would definitely be enrolled again at CCC.  My career goals are to open an assisted living home to help the elderly population and be self employed.
Recent Alumnus,5,We have an excellent business program for the adult education center.  The major events in my program is essential in learning at CCC.
Recent Alumnus,5,We have excellent facilities at CCC.  They provide a great learning atmosphere and education.
Recent Alumnus,5,I did not have any problems with getting into CCC.
College Junior,5,"For me, getting into the field of my choice was easy!  There were no criteria other than submitting my previous transcripts from previous colleges and high school."
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. The professors are caring, seeing you as an individual and not as another number or student. The staff is constantly looking out for you. Being a Christian school, they extend grace to students that don't know Christ and allow them to meet Him on their own terms. 
There is room for growth, in the size of the school and the majors it offers. But, in light of everything, I wouldn't ever choose another college."
Freshman,4,"My experience here at Central Christian College, was tough at first because I reside in Florida. I missed my mother tremendously and wanted to head back home. I began to eventually get comfortable and make a lot of friends. I compete on the track team and that was a wonderful experience, but I love the students here they were kind and wonderful. The professors were able to work with you and aid you on anything that you had trouble with. My Coach was an amazing coach as well. I would like for admission to change because they did treat some individuals unfairly. I would like for the college to eventually grow and bring more individuals to christ."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at Central Christian College has been very NEW. There's a lot of things I have to adapt to and actually buy into because of course my background is quite different from the environment. I like the fact that everyone makes you feel at home, doesn't matter the skin color. The environment itself is very uplifting with lots of sensere people. I am a student-athlete here at Central and that kind of brings me a lot of popularity here, especially as a NEW freshman. The only thing I would change about the college is the dorms, haha.. my room in specific is very tiny BUT comfortable. I'd also feel more comfortable in my room if there was a window, I think safety wise it'll be smart to have a window in all rooms just in case of quick emergencies with all exits blocked.. other than that, my experience so far has been wonderful and I plan on things escalating positively as the year progresses."
College Sophomore,4,We are a very small college in a very small town. Not much goes on involving crime. I feel very safe at my campus.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Central has been an eye opening experience. It has opened my eyes to diversity, culture, community, and adaptation. I believe that the most unique thing about our college is the sense of community that we have. Majority of students on campus are athletes so everyone is constantly supporting one another in sports and academics. The staff is also a big part of the community. I think it is extremely unique that the professors not only know us by name but also genuinely care about us. Our President and his wife are constantly around campus and always supporting campus events. How many college students can say that they even KNOW their President of their college,much less have a relationship with them and get invited over to their house for dinner."
College Freshman,4,Everything looks good so far
College Freshman,4,"Great coaches, friendly, and great at what they do."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy the freedom of online school and their help and guidance and the student success team is wonderful when you need them. I really enjoy that it's a christian school and the discussions and classroom are very helpful and interesting. I've been attending CCC for a year now and I'm enjoying the classes I've been involved with.
College Senior,4,This has been a wonderful experience. I am confident with the knowledge and skills that I have gained.
College Senior,4,"I have had a great experience. If there were any problems, they were handled in a timely manner. I have gained knowledge and skills that will prepare me for the work force or own my own business."
College Freshman,4,always things to do. everyone knows each other.
College Junior,4,"Central Is a Great Place to Attend – The professors and faculty really care about the students and make a point to check on you. Academic tutoring is readily available, student study groups are there,  and a student center is in the works. Professors expect students to participate in class and enjoy dialoging with students. 
  We have the same accreditation as bigger schools and one of the best Worship arts majors in the area."
College Junior,4,Minstry Progarm Is Strong and Well Done – Excellent for a small school -- high expectations and challenging curriculum but the professors are very helpful and make sure you understand everything in order to minister faithfully after graduation. Professors are fun and really care about the students no matter which major you are in.
College Junior,4,"None Available – We live on a very small campus in a small town ... you can walk, ride a bike or drive your car everywhere"
College Sophomore,4,"Central Is Pretty Diverse – While Central is small, I've been surprised by how diverse it is. We have students from Japan, Mexico, Columia, Canada, Africa."
College Sophomore,4,"Great for Some – McPherson is small, there's not a lot of shopping and things of the like, but it's very close to big cities where there is. There are plenty of things to do if you look for them though."
College Senior,4,No Drugs or Alcohol – The school enforces a covenant that students sign saying they wont do drugs drink or have sex while attending this school
College Sophomore,4,"This Is a Christian School – We have to sign a covenant when we enroll to is school. we are no allowed to drink, smoke or do drugs. Some people break the rules but the majority sticks to the covenant."
College Sophomore,4,"Permits are $15 dollars a semester, tickets are normally $10, a car is not really needed, you can even get all over town by walking."
College Sophomore,4,"Normally Plenty Available – computer lab has a good amount of computers the only downside is that they do have classes in there too, so when they are having class you'll have to wait.  There are aleast 6 in the library and there is normally only a wait when registering for classes and finals time."
Freshman,2,It’s a very boring place yet if you have good friends it won’t be as bad. Also having open dorms isn’t bad but it sucks when you want to hang out with friends of the opposite sex.
College Junior,2,"The internet here is always so slow that it is almost pointless to do anything. I do not know what other schools have to pay for printing, however at this school we have to pay five cents per page. The computers in the library are sometime full, however I do not see that a lot. "
College Junior,2,"The athletics at this school are not where they should be. I do understand that it is a small school, however it seems like here it is okay for teams to lose. We do have a couple teams on the campus that do good, however most of them do not. Not many people come to the sporting events besides basketball and that is not really that big either. I wish that sports here would be more of a priority then what they are. "
College Senior,2,The dining hall serves a lot of the same stuff every other week and it gets old fast when you know what could be for lunch or for dinner every day and night
College Freshman,2,"The food makes my stomache quesy, I avoid the meat whenever possible.  There are not a lot of opptions"
Freshman,1,"I am an international student and won an scholarship to play soccer at Central Chirstian College of Kansas so I transferred myself to this College. I had been told that, as an athlete, I would recieve an appropriate diet and training. The food was awful, everyday that same stuff. Regarding the school, I really did not learn anything in the semester I spent there. There were 30/300 international students."
College Junior,1,At Central we are not allowed to go to places like that because it is against the covenant. 
College Junior,1,"The students at Central are not allowed to live off campus unless they are married, are 23 and have permission from the school, or live with a mother or father. "
College Junior,1,"""CHRISTIAN SCHOOL&quot – Nightlife, partying and the bar scene isn't really our cup of tea. That is not what we consider ""fun"" or a good time."

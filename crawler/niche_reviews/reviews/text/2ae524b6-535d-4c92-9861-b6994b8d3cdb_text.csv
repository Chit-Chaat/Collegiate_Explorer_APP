Sophomore,5,"So far my experience at Olympic College has been great. Almost all of the staff is friendly and helpful with anything you need. All of my previous professors have been very informative and made class fun. On cold days some staff members would even set up a table with free and fresh hotchocolate in the middle of campus. There's friendly security that is easy to find and will walk you to your car or class if you ask them to. The student recouce centers (financial aid office, councelors, career center, etc.) are very helpful and will even walk you to other offices if they cannot help. All  off the professors that I have met, regardless if I had them or not, have also been very helpful and friendly. I have walked into a random classroom about 4 times asking for directions and the professor was always happy to help. Before I could even try sports or other extra cirriculars COVID took over, but there were always signs and pamphlets everywhere for many oppertunities that I'd love to try."
Sophomore,5,"Although online classes were new to me, there were not new to the professors. This made the transition from in-person courses to online very easy. The only recommendation from taking online courses at Olympic College would to not take any lab credits online, doing the lab on a computer or at your own home is not the right experience for anyone."
Junior,5,It went pretty well for being my first class online due to covid. The teacher was very good at getting back to students in an efficient manner.
Junior,5,Great School! Very interactive and involved campus life. Always having events with free food to bring students together. As well as having a huge exchange student program. The tutoring available is so helpful with long hours.
Freshman,5,"I ended up taking far more online classes than I ever planed to with Covid-19 forcing all of my in-person classes to be online. The IT department worked very hard to make it as painless as possible for everyone. Even with all the hiccups of things abruptly changing over, the Professors were very understanding and offered a great deal of leeway as everyone adjusted while getting on with classes as best as they could."
Freshman,5,"I have found the environment at OC welcoming and all of the faculty have been very helpful. The main campus is a nice place to be even when you aren't in class. There are a lot of extra curricular activities to get involved with if you so desire, or you can just hang out in the Bremer center to play Mario kart with a random group of other students."
Sophomore,5,I've only had a good experience with online classes. Professors put a lot of effort to teaching their classes
Sophomore,5,"I only met great people there. Everybody is nice, professors want you to succeed. It was excellent 2 years and a great start to my college career!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love learning here. The teachers are amazing at communicating with students and not only being outstanding with helping with school work and schedules, but with truly being there for the students. My teachers always, without hesitation, got me back on track whenever I was slipping away with assignments or attendance, and help me with all of my questions. It is such a safe learning area for students of all ages and all walks of life."
Sophomore,5,"Olympic College is a great community college fostering  higher level education. Olympic College is ever growing to be better than it was before, from staff to student organizations to events and classes offered. I have had nothing but good experiences, understanding, and new perspectives from Olympic College. Nothing is perfect though and what I believe Olympic College can still work on is their course scheduling. For instance, going through the Chemistry or Biology course and having to miss a semester will set you back a complete year as the classes go in sequential order and don't overlap the next semester."
Freshman,5,the staff is really friendly especially the financial aid and the admissions office. I like that they require you to take a test to determine where you stand academically before being admitted. I like the military office and how helpful they are when you are trying to find scholarships and information. almost everyone is friendly
Sophomore,5,"Olympic College offers a wide variety of classes for a community college, and faculty are welcoming and helpful"
Freshman,5,"It is an amazing school with so many opportunities and experiences that you can enjoy while attending this college, it's also very affordable and cheaper then most colleges and you'll still learn with professionals for the career you want."
Sophomore,5,"I don't care what everyone says, I Love OC. For a community college, they offer many certification programs, a huge variety of classes, and many degree options. The campus is brand new and well maintained. The library is GREAT. Parking is a disaster but that's as can be expected. The area offers a wide range of students all with differing career paths and goals- I think it provides the perfect college experience. As well, teachers are flexible and friendly. I recommend it. And the nursing program is highly credited and competitive."
Niche User,5,"The Ceramics teacher, Marie Weichman, is AMAZING. She is very understanding and a great professor! Her teaching strategies and due dates were very applicable to the college course."
Niche User,5,"I havent started yet but my freinds & family all say its great, one of the best colleges to apply to for freshmen."
Freshman,5,The professors deeply care and always want to help their students.The students are eager and put a great emphasis on their education.
Alum,5,I loved attending Olympic College. Most of the professors were great. The campus was beautiful and the atmosphere was very welcoming as a new student. I was happy to receive my Associates Degree from here!
Niche User,5,What i enjoy the most about Olympic College is the open campus and atmosphere the community has there. Staff are always helpful when I've gone by with questions in the past. The Bremerton campus is at a great location with lots of housing opportunities around.
Freshman,5,"Olympic college is located in 3 different cities in Washington state. The Bremerton campus is the main and largest campus. It offers the widest range of classes. I don't know much about the Shelton campus but the Poulsbo campus is pretty small and usually only offers the basic classes. I would like to see a wider range of classes at the Poulsbo campus. A lot of the classes are done with Canvas which is a very useful online way to be in touch with your professors, have access to assignments, and turn in homework."
Sophomore,5,"To go to a 2 year school and get the same education you expect from a 4 year school is hard to come by. However, Olympic college does it perfectly. For a fraction of the cost I will be receiving my associates degree and be going to a 4 year institution knowing I am more then equip to succeed. ."
Sophomore,5,Teachers are incredibly helpful. It's amazing and freeing to be here. Great Place to start your college journey.
Niche User,5,Olympic College is a great college. Good people and great classes. Definitely a good place to go. I don't think there is anything I would change.
Sophomore,5,I love the teachers there! They are so caring and want to see you succeed. The classes are fairly easy if you're going down the business road or just a regular AA. Big selection of classes and a bunch of extension programs too.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy this school very much- the educators seem so passionate about sharing their knowledge of their fields of study.
Sophomore,5,"Fantastic school with great professors, advisors, and opportunities. As a running start student, I met with many of my advisors and professors to make sure I was on track, and they did everything they could to help me. As my local community college, it has great opportunities to learn, volunteer, and enjoy the community."
Niche User,5,It is a nice campus and everything is close and convenient. The classes are good and the professors are nice.
Freshman,5,"It's very welcoming and informative. A lot of mixed race, you will never feel outnumbered. At Olympic College I feel at home."
Graduate Student,5,"Amazing school. Dedicated to excellence. Professors work hard and actually care about your education. Class sizes are good, usually get in if you are waitlisted."
Sophomore,5,A friendly and overall terrific place for academics. Olympic has a diverse crowd of people from all walks of life and offers many resources for furthering education.
Sophomore,5,"I am former military (US Marine veteran) and I really enjoy Olympic College. Being that it is located so close to Naval Base Bremerton, the Naval Hospital, Bangor Naval Base, and Keyport, the school has a large population of military, both active duty and veteran. The school is very friendly to military and has many flexible options to work around your schedule. Olympic College has a fantastic veterans center that provides guidance, food, assistance, and a warm and friendly place for veterans to feel comfortable while attending."
Freshman,5,"I am a non-traditional student returning to school for Nursing. I am finishing the prerequisites for the nursing program and have had a great experience with the school thus far. The professors have been excellent, the class sizes are small, and the price for school is exceptional. I have found the Nursing school department to be very helpful in guiding me on how I can achieve my goals and there are many tutoring services available for students."
Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and the teaching staff is fantastic. Good at their job and eager to help and assist with any needs. You can tell that this school takes pride in it's environment and it's student body. 10/10
Senior,5,"Olympic College has changed my life. I am currently in my senior year at Olympic College and I have excelled through through their visual arts program. I have won first place in five art competitions, received an award for outstanding visual arts, been interviewed by two school magazines, acted as an artist in a short film produced by the school, and been connected with a local performance theatre as window muralist. The school has done an amazing job promoting art and employing professors who are passionate about what they teach. Instead of suggesting what students could do with their talent, teachers actually find opportunities and encourage their students to try them. I have developed so much just from the guidance of my art professors. Not only are the teachers excellent, but the college recently opened a new art building to further promote their art program with the most advanced art supplies and technology."
Sophomore,5,Olympic college is a fantastic learning environment. I have felt welcome in this environment because of the equal opportunity policy that guides the college. The instructors especially in the nursing department are very committed to student success. I recommend.
Sophomore,5,"The professors are amazing, and advising takes your life goals seriously. The financial aid advisors take there time with you, give easily understabdable and detailed explanations."
Freshman,5,"Olympic College is a community college that is really geared toward student success. They offer online, and in person classes many available during the day or evening or even on weekends.  In addition to the many classes they offer they also have free tutoring available for math, biology, physics, chemistry, English and writing. The financial aid department will help you every step of the way to ensure you're getting as much help with your tuition as possible.  They also offer free seminars monthly on how to study more effectively and how to manage the stresses of college."
Freshman,5,"It is a pleasant, encouraging place to learn. The environment and student body at Olympic College helps to foster the highest level of education."
Freshman,5,Great advisers. Helpful staff. Welding program is top notch. Campus has lots of resources and college also offers great online services to aide you in successfully completing classes & graduating.
Freshman,5,Has a variety of classes to choose from. The financial aid is helpful for those who need help financially. They have open office for anyone who doesn't know where to start and they even buy used books if needed. They also have rooms open for people who need help in certain classes and the school stays open late at night and early in the morning. they even have help on the weekends.
College Junior,5,I love having the option for an online class. I took english during one summer quarter and I loved the flexibility that it provided me with. The webpage is easy to navigate and professors were easy to get in touch with.
College Junior,5,At the career center the Staff are just absolutely excellent and I love how helpful they are.
College Junior,5,"Career services are fantastic at this school. If youre a student looking for a job they have regular job fairs, employment workshops, resume help and many other options. As a current student worker at this school, I fully endorse their career services office as a success for students."
Recent Alumnus,5,Every course I have taken i have benefited from and the teachers are fantastic
College Freshman,5,They have been great along with the teachers.
College Freshman,5,"So many different options for classes. There's so many different times and days. There's even online, and three differen campuses."
College Freshman,5,So far I have had wonderful teachers. Every single one of them have been helpful with questions and didn't just brush them off like they weren't important. They are very personable and learn each students name and face.
College Freshman,5,"There are seriously so many options for class times and class days. Even online. And Olympic College has three different campuses for peoples' convenience. I love going here. I just register for whichever classes fit in my schedule, and the registering system wont even allow you to accidentally register for two classes that overlap."
College Freshman,5,Many wonderful professors who know their students
College Senior,5,Very flexible class times. There are a lot of classes offered any time I am able to take them.
College Senior,5,"I have only had trouble with one professor in the 5 quarters I have been here and that was only because his teaching methods and my learning methods did not match up. Amazing courses, variety of courses, class styles, and decent class sizes."
College Senior,5,I have not personally been aware of any job/internship prospects or employers recruiting on campus. I have received mass emails from the Alumni network which are nice to see. I have not visited our career center yet. But all of the other services have been phenomenal.
College Senior,5,Currently I am in progress of getting my general associates degree and prerequisites to a couple of Dental Hygiene programs. Everything is going very well and I've had amazing support via the advising counsellors.
College Senior,5,"Ever since the first day here I have loved being at OC. There is a plethora of highly qualified professors and an amazing advising staff. They have a strong and convenient Veteran/Military support service that has helped me through a lot of confusing times. I highly reccomend this school for those pursing engineering degrees, nursing degrees, or just a general associates degree in general."
College Student,5,"I am not transferring, but I have had friends that have. They informed me that it was pretty easy"
College Student,5,"The online classes are very easy for most, but they also can be tough"
College Student,5,The career center is top notch. They help you to find a job quickly
College Student,5,"The classes are just the right size, and everything is amazing."
College Student,5,There are alot of job offers even before you graduate.
College Student,5,"The program that I am studying, is wonderful. It offers everything I need for when I start my job career"
Sophomore,4,"My frist quarter was completly on campus and my second quarter was completly online from home so I have about equal experience between in person and online. The adjustment into all online classes was hard for me but all 4 professors that I had were very patient and understanding throughout the quarter. Some teachers were easier to get ahold of than others but they all responded withing 2 days of my emails and although there was some misunderstanding, there was a lot of patience and communication to fix that. All of my professors kept a steady, and not rushed, pace throughout the class and often checked in with me and updated me on my progress. However, the student resource centers are harder to reach. Understandably, since they are working from home, but this has created some personal issues since noone answers calls(even though it is recomended) or responds to emails for weeks. I believe it is the same great school that I loved last winter but everything online could be smoother."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone dreads the 8 am daily classes right? Nope, not at Olympic College did I dread those classes, but fear not only in September. Why? Because the walk to class from your car, when the air is crisp, the sun had just risen so the warmth hitting your faces wakes you up a little more, the smell of fresh-brewed coffee in the hallways. Why would anyone despise those classes when THIS is what you get to experience at Olympic College. Then once you arrive to your 25 student class, and get to hear the daily joke from your math professor, what could get better? I quite honestly have no negative things to say about Olympic College!"
Alum,4,"Olympic College is an excellent community college with clean campuses and opportunities for everyone. The fact that it has three campuses--Poulsbo, Shelton, and Bremerton--make it even better."
Niche User,4,"Olympic College is a very nice college and has great professors who are very helpful. The only downfall of Olympic College is that area that it was placed it very difficult to reach, busy and a little run down."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the campus location and ease of access to buildings and resources but would like to see more involvement with students. More options for scholarships and financial aid.
Freshman,4,Olympic College has a lot of resources to help students out with whatever they need. I think that the campus is very nice and well kept. The professors that I have had were very good and helpful for all my problems.
Sophomore,4,They are very good at helping students pick out classes to efficiently finish their degrees and hold a lot of different fun activities for students to participate in.
Freshman,4,"Very accommodating for wherever you’re at, and it’s easy to get the classes you want. It’s a good community college with a nice running start option and direct transfer program to several universities. There is also a wide variety of technical training."
Niche User,4,"Great school! I attended multiple classes while in my senior year of high school and all of my professors were wonderful! The school provides free study groups and multiple free resources for families with financial needs. 
Another perk is definitely the puppies! every time mid-terms or finals come around, the college brings puppies in for puppy therapy and you can cuddle them to calm down! it's the best!"
Sophomore,4,There are very few classes on the Shelton Campus. The CDP program can only be completed on-site at the Bremerton campus and online classes.
Freshman,4,"The academic curriculum was very good quality. The education I have received there has been extremely valuable and I will carry the skills I have developed with me throughout the rest of my college life. The staff is very helpful, understanding, and qualified for their role. This college is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to better their education."
Freshman,4,"The people who work/attend this college are the most helpful and supportive people you’ll get in your college life. When talking to people about college and professors I have always heard people say ""professors don’t care how you are doing and professors are only there to teach and collect their check"". The professors I had in my first quarter were the opposite. My professor in my English 91 class was encouraging and helpful. Any time I was struggling she would come to me and help us one on one and ask if we needed help all the time. I also have to say that my Abnormal Psychology professor for being a very understanding individual. When finals and deadlines were coming up, I was really struggling to finish the work I haven't done and currently had to get done in all of my classes. I emailed him what was going on and he gave me an extension on the work in his class. Without him and that extension I probably wouldn't have passed his class and attending next quarter."
Freshman,4,I like that this college offers my degree which I have found is not very common and that I can be on an athletic team while getting my degree while being away from my hometown.
Sophomore,4,I have loved my experience at OC so far! I enjoy that we have free parking and that we have access to recreational activities such as the gym.
Freshman,4,My first year seems to be going well. everyone is helpful and it seems like everyone is knowledgable of resources to help you from A-Z.
Freshman,4,"As a Running Start student, I find that Olympic College has been incredibly welcoming and diverse. I think more outreach programs to high schools would be beneficial to incoming students."
Sophomore,4,"I love Olympic College! It is such a friendly atmosphere. The students are so independent, but quick to help you if you need it. Being so young and in Running Start, naturally I would feel underpowered and undervalued by staff and peers. However, I feel quite the opposite. My professors and peers view me just as good as they view any other student. It might sound strange, but I feel like I blend in with the diversity of the college. I don't feel like an outsider. There are so many different religions, ethnicities, values, backgrounds, and ages of people that make me feel like I belong. Everyday I drive 35 minutes to and about an hour ack from Olympic College (OC), but the diversity and course content make the driving worth it. While the course content is challenging, it is not impossible and I have so many resources to keep me going. I have only had two not-so-fun professors, but the students made up for them."
Sophomore,4,I like most of the professors which I have had. Those which I have not enjoyed I found it easy to complain to someone. They are pretty good about getting information out to students.
Sophomore,4,"My past two years at Olympic College has felt successful, as it was a good local college in a more rural area, that allowed me to complete my first two years while I still remained at home with my family, which did help me not just financially, but mentally as well. The campus is a decent size and with the renovations of new buildings and classrooms, makes it for an overall nice looking school. The class sizes are small, and socializing with others is possible if you put yourself out there and try to be involved. For a first ""grown up"" school, Olympic College is a good place."
Freshman,4,I enjoy going there and feel that it offers great classes and programs. I've had a few classes I didn't particularly like due to either the professor or the subject matter. Over all it's a good school that I recommend to friends who can't attend a 4 year university.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at Olympic college and ive had nothing but a good experience so far! Staff is very helpful, and they make you feel right at home."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Olympic College is absolutely astonishing. I am able to take courses here instead of a university to save lots of money. I would like to see new teachers and more helpful tutors.
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere for this community college is fairly antisocial, students come in to take classes and thats it. But it does have quite a bit of diversity, which includes a number of international students and a wide range of ages compared to other colleges, likely because of the high percentage of military/shipyard workers that attend it. Despite it being a community college there are a lot of very passionate and talented teachers. That makes up for all the other shortcomings, I've had better educators here than anywhere else. Another plus: the campus is beautiful! and is close to evergreen park and downtown bremerton where you can ferry over to Seattle."
Freshman,4,"I like the feel of the small campus where I see the same students and faculty all the time. I love the water fountains in the new building, but every other building has warm and weird tasting water. I would like to see better advising with more advisers knowing the specifics of certain programs. I would like to see campus cleaned up more besides the main areas."
Sophomore,4,"Very good college overall. If you eat on campus, the Monte Cristo sandwiches are the best with some fries. Professors at OC are actually invested in your wellbeing and success as a student, and for the most part are very fair graders. There isn’t really a party scene at OC, but the campus is very safe and there’s lots of good places to study. The student government is very active and spirited, and our basketball and volleyball teams are pretty good."
Sophomore,4,"The academic advising office was very helpful every time I came in or emailed them with a question. I haven’t had a bad professor yet, and overall everyone seems friendly and willing to help."
Niche User,4,Olympic College is a great community college that can help prepare you for the life of real college. It offers a variety of classes and has three different campuses. Olympic College is cheap and affordable and many top colleges in Washington accept the credits you can earn there. It is a great way to earn college credits to transfer over to other colleges. One of the best programs they have is their Running Start program which allows junior and senior students to take college classes on their campus and earn an associates degrees while still in high school.
Sophomore,4,I love the teachers and how they teach and treat the students. I would like to see the parking lot expand and possibly see a parking garage because it's very difficult to park unless you have a 8 am class other than that it's a game of chance of finding a parking spot.
Sophomore,4,I love Olympic College. They have been so supportive and helpful. They have so many programs and people available to help for just about any situation and their people are so knowledgable. Without their amazing staff and programs I would never have been able to attend college.
Sophomore,4,"The college does an amazing job of providing resources to better aid you to reach your intended goals. They college does an amazing job at providing tutors, check offs for your degree, and helps you overall succeed. I would like to see the equal distribution of those resources improve as most are not available as often at the other campuses."
Sophomore,4,Olympic College has a lot to offer and there are a many opportunities available to succeed and make the most if your experience. the teachers really challenge you to think in a different way and strive for Excellency. the campus is fairly safe and has security guards patrolling campus from 7 to 5 pm. overall the facility is perfectly functional and open for students to allow them to succeed in school.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Olympic College was phenomenal. I attended classes on campus, as well as, online. Either way, instructors were helpful and understanding. I've never dealt with miscommunication. The instructors at Olympic College are well prepared for every lesson. Students have access to many resources to improve any homework or projects. 

Time for classes is flexible. Students can go to school and work full-time. There are classes in the morning, afternoon, and evening. 
My experience, I work at a middle school, I would attend evening classes. I'm grateful Olympic College. 

There are many options to get involved in the community at Olympic College. There are clubs to join; it's a great way to meet students from all over the country. There are also students from different countries. Students transferring from a different country, also have opportunities to learn and meet new people."
Junior,4,"Olympic college has a wide range of programs that translate into local area jobs. It's a practical college, where you aren't paying for prestige along with your degree. 
Location is convenient, campus and buildings are well maintained. The faculty here is very diverse. The educators strive to make sure you are successful, instead of the lack of concern at some other schools. 
The campus resources are limitless. You can find any help you need there if you are struggling with a course. 
Overall, Olympic college will give you a quality education without the high price tag of other colleges and universities."
Sophomore,4,Olympic College is a wonderfully diverse place to learn. Internet classes could be monitored better by professors and emails answered. Parking is terrible. The overall atmosphere is safe and clean.
Junior,4,"Great programs, great classes and great professors in a tight and close community. Excellent for busy adults who work or have children."
Graduate Student,4,"Most professors are good. There are a few ""dry"" professors. Don't ever take statistics online, and be prepared for lots of essays!"
Sophomore,4,I like the diversity of Olympic College and there are decent professors. The campus is inviting and there are a lot of clubs to join. It's overpopulated.
Sophomore,4,"Over the past two years I have spent my time on both the Poulsbo and Bremerton and online campuses of Olympic College. I was able to successfully complete an associate in arts and then transfer to a four year university. The advisors, professors and faculty do a good job of providing assistance to the students and making the overall experience one that prepares them for the future. The Bremerton campus has many more class options and a busier environment. The Poulsbo campus is quieter however, its professors and classes are still just as helpful as they are on the main campus. One drawback for the Poulsbo campus is the lack of security on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I've had a great experience with Olympic College. The teachers I've had are very understanding and friendly. The Staff Members are always there to assist you with answering about whichever kind of questions you could possibly have, and the support team I've managed to have is a great team as well."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and I feel that the school provides plenty of resources to help students with anything they need. I also feel that the academics are very good quality, the math department is very strict about placement so that students are in the class they should be in, not the ones they want to be in. I love the small classes and everyone has been very nice and helpful so far."
Junior,4,"OC is a nice affordable community college. It allows Running Start students to earn credit while still in high school. I've not been super involved in any extra-curricular activities here, but from the academics I've received it seems pretty decent. Some professors and classes are much better than others and well worth your time, though occasionally you come across a professor or two who just doesn't care. You get what you pay for. Overall it's good quality education."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I had to choose the campus farther from my home, but it allowed for a flexible schedule."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors are very motivated, campus is easy to find."
Recent Alumnus,4,This school has been warm and welcoming and is a great environment for people looking to go back to school after a break - very non-threatening.
Sophomore,4,"Olympic College has been a fantastic place for me to prepare for nursing school. The location is very convenient to where I live,  and there are classes offered with students like me, a working single mom, in mind. There is a real sense of caring from the professors, about students as individuals."
College Junior,4,I'm not sure as I have not yet graduated myself
College Junior,4,"I have taken a variety of different classes at olympic college. When I was first starting out I did not know what I wanted to be. So I took a variety of classes including computer, nutrition, education, nursing, etc. Love the class sizes. Most professors are friendly and easy to get a long with."
College Junior,4,The nursing program is highly competitive to get into. There are on average over 150 applicants and only 68 get a spot in the program. There will be many doors open to me after graduating from this program
College Junior,4,I will begin the Associate degree nursing program in the fall. I'm excited for this new chapter
College Junior,4,It's a small campus with great professors. Good place to start your education
College Junior,4,"Everything was really easy to use, each professor had their own way they wanted things turned in, which made things a little more difficult but two clicks of a mouse isn't a big deal at all."
College Junior,4,I'm really excited to get to a university after getting my AA!
College Junior,4,I'll be able to take my degree and go to a 4 year university with the club participation and grades that I need to get into a good school
College Junior,4,I work full time and have a full time course load right now. I definitely love that when I ask questions my professors get back to me quickly!
College Junior,4,It has been very convenient going to college as its only a 22 minute drive away for me. Though they should be more lenient to absences as long as the student is doing all the work to the best of their abilities.
College Junior,4,they have excellent career services at this school. Very helpful staff/faculty who are very friendly.
College Junior,4,"People who graduate from the OC nursing program have no trouble finding jobs, and are often hired on at the clinical sites. The school has a good reputation."
College Junior,4,"The nursing program at my school is rigorous, but rewarding. The teachers encourage critical thinking, and push students to achieve their best. They are always there to answer questions or give advice."
College Junior,4,"I chose this school because it is convenient, and very close to home home and work. I chose community college specifically to save money on tuition, and to have more flexible class offerings. OC has very helpful instructors, and most all of them are very driven to help students succeed."
College Junior,4,"Some classes felt incredibly unorganized and others had a lot of structure. I enjoy the variety, truthfully. I'm glad I started with Running Start because some of the classes I attended I feel like I would not have chosen to pay for because of the lack of structure. It's mostly getting by but it can also be enjoyable, mostly depending on the professor."
Junior,2,Staff are nice but very lazy. I have been trying to get in contact with multiple staff members to accommodate my needs and none of them follow through. I got lucky and picked the worst and least understanding professors. COVID-19 has given many of the faculty an excuse to be lazy and it really shows. Im disappointed and sad that I'm wasting my money on college that could have easily been a better experience if I had more help.
Junior,2,Internet platforms that were used are ok but sometimes very confusing and most of the time we are left to figure it out on our own. It can be difficult to talk to professors through canvas alone and a lot of them are lazy with responding.
College Senior,2,Most students only obtain their AA from OC and transfer elsewhere to finish their bachelor's. There are not many career opportunities following graduation.
Recent Alumnus,2,transferring credits was a huge pain. my papers were lost by the Olympic college advisers and i was not given all of the information i need to properly transfer credits.
College Sophomore,2,I have only taken 2 online classes and will not be doing this again. I did not like this. It was hard to communicate with the professor and I am not good at teaching material to myself. I need things taught to me and like to know my fellow students so I can have study groups. The online website for the classes was awful.
College Sophomore,2,"As a working student, the tutoring center and lack of teacher understand irritated me the most. I could never get into the tutoring center because it was only open during average work hours. And on the occasion i took off work for it, I was tutored by a student who knew no more than I did, meaning it was a waste of time. Many teachers were strict on when you could ask for help, only allowing an hour before class (When many people are working) or only by appointment (If something came up, there was nothing you could do.)"
College Sophomore,2,"You can only get an AA or AS, or a few other things from here. You can't do much with that. For the price it's a good start if you plan to go forward in your education, but if you think attending here and getting your AA is going to get you a great job, you're mistake."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no specific major here, it's either a science track for your AS, or arts for AA. There is no real guidance from councilors for which classes you should take for your specific future career/major, they just tell you to take a class that meets you AA requirement."
College Senior,2,"From what I've heard, it is very annoying to go through the financial aid process. Tuition, in my opinion, is too high for a community college."
College Senior,2,It is a community college so I really cannot expect much more than mediocre.
College Senior,2,"The gym is in poor condition, and the basketball courts are always occupied by classes or the team (should have not advertised open gym in this case), the library at their Poulsbo campus is non-existent, and at their main campus it is a decent size for a community college. The student center is very small, and always loud, not many quiet places other than library."
Recent Alumnus,2,Financial aid aways hassles me
Recent Alumnus,2,Strictly for classes not really career oriented.
College Student,2,I say bore do to the fact that i never had a chance.
College Sophomore,2,"I personally haven't met too many people at the school that I've been too fond of. Most people keep to themselves and aren't really willing to meet other people. I've tried to make friends but most people are standoffish. Also a lot of the younger students seem careless when it comes to the classroom. If you don't want to be here, don't go. It's as easy as that."
College Sophomore,2,"Every time I have tried to get help, people have been rude and refer me to someone else who refers me back to the person I originally went to."
College Sophomore,2,For the degree I'm going for there is no career service support. I am going for my early childhood education.
College Senior,2,"The only class I took was I would say good, but I will not it anymore. It is very different than the traditional class in the sense that, In a traditional class I have someone remind me of the deadlines of assignment etc.. However, with my online class I thought I will have time to do it later and never did because of my procrastination."
College Junior,2,"There are a bunch of times that simply did not work with my schedule, and most quarters Chemistry is only available in the evening, which I am not available for."
College Sophomore,2,"I find it hard to find classes I need, Every teacher acts like it is your only class so they give you a huge workload then wonder why 90% of the class falls behind. Several classes only have one teacher, no variety."
College Sophomore,2,The campus is pretty thrown together. its hard to find what you are looking for.
College Sophomore,2,I have not heard anything about any of these programs
College Sophomore,2,Its really high for a community college and is going up.
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid is a pain and the various offices (e.g. admissions, aid, cashier) don't seem to know anything about each other. There's a lot of ""go down to registration and ask them maybe..."" very frustrating, especially since I have a family and life and can't spend hours in line. Be proactive here, for certain."
College Sophomore,2,Not all teachers use the standard online web page for their courses. Some use their own and it really make for a fragmented and user-unfriendly experience.
College Sophomore,2,"Computer related courses are few. Due to this being a smaller college computer classes are few, some are not taught at certain times of the year making it more time consuming to proceed in your course of study."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid at the college is alright, but access to the office is pretty limiting with short hours and only being open four days per week. Two out of the three desk workers there are very impersonal and seem not to care about a persons circumstances."
College Sophomore,2,"I had a very difficult time getting certain credits approved. I had to hunt down previous teachers and they had to email the school what the course entailed. Also, I had to get a syllabi for each course. Although the courses did get approved, it was a very difficult process."
College Sophomore,2,"Webpage is totally overloaded with tabs and links, very confusing and changing often."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid options are few for me, having a Bachelor's degree already.
I am also not eligible for work study, though I could use on-campus work, not having a car."
College Sophomore,2,"I wish there were more programs, and the standards weren't so ridiculously hard."
College Sophomore,2,"it's overwhelming when you have to work, and be a mom."
College Freshman,2,There are not many services to talk about
College Freshman,2,There is not anything really anything that shines about the school besides the competitive nursing program than seem to be a set up for failure
College Freshman,2,The resources are not really advertized. Have to dig to figure out anything
College Freshman,2,Can almost never get a wifi signal. Labs are available during hours most people work
College Junior,2,"When I visited the career center I was explained the process, handed pamphlets and then sent on my way, I still felt very much on my own in the job market."
College Junior,2,"Its a long process i believe needs improvement i had to keep going back to keep filling out the same paperwork because ""something happened to it"""
College Junior,2,it took a bit more planning than i think it should have but got done
College Senior,2,The wait time to speak with a financial aid person is very long but the service people are very helpful.
Sophomore,1,Parking is awful. The administration doesn't care about you. The classes and professors are good but everything else is incredibly disappointing.
College Sophomore,1,"They are no help. They either tell you to 'look in a book' or just 'call the school you're transferring too"". They have no interest in what you do once you are done at Olympic."
College Junior,1,I have never seen or heard of anyone in my classes being offered anything like this. I know some professors say that other colleges in our next step will offer it but not here.
College Senior,1,The post-grad services are non-existent and there really is not any alumni network.
College Senior,1,"It is a horrible selection for classes, and the software and programs are not user-friendly."
College Senior,1,There is no classes tailored to any non-science degrees.
College Student,1,"I feel that i have been cheated out of a 1st and 2nd chance ....

Not given a chance to fix my mistakes denied my hardship."
College Sophomore,1,Alot of the required classes only have one maybe two time periods when you can come in.
College Freshman,1,horrible flexibility I went from working 30 hours to 10 once classes started
College Senior,1,"Although my grade is quite low, Olympic has great online courses! they're very organized with high communication. unfortunately for my preference of learning i need to be face-to-face in a classroom so the online courses weren't for me. But I've heard great reviews from many other students."
College Freshman,1,No One Knows! No one seems to know anything at this school!  You are sent from one office to another.  The website is rather unhelpful.  You have to dig around to find what you need.

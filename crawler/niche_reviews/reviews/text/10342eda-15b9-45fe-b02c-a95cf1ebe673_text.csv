Graduate Student,5,My experience at San Jose State University was an amazing experience. My program ensured that we were all involved within our community. The academics aspect was also very organized.
Graduate Student,5,"I did not take any online courses, but my experience with the professors was an ongoing learning experience."
Freshman,5,Great school! Students are really nice and the staff help you a lot by offering the variety of resources the school has.
Freshman,5,Great school! Students are really nice and the staff help you a lot by offering the variety of resources the school has.
Sophomore,5,"I had the best experience. I was a freshman last year and while Iiving on campus, I would definitely say it was the best time of my life. I lived in the dorms, so I met so many other students. I would recommend living in the dorms if you can (once the pandemic is over). The food was alright. I did not join a sorority, but I made friends, so I was able to go to some frat parties. Either way there was still parties that were not greek. At night however, I would definitely recommend walking with a friend because there are bums sometimes in DT. I would definitely recommend going to a taco truck that is nearby. It is not the spartan taco truck. They have good deals and good popusas. Regarding academics, I would say it was easy for me to get the clases that I needed. I only heard problems when people wouldnt pay their tuition on time before the semester started.(classes got dropped) My professors were great professors, you could tell they liked doing their job. Counselors were good too."
Sophomore,5,My online experience during this pandemic has been good so far. I have been able to get the classes I need. My teachers try to think of their students and most are lenient while others stick to their rules. I would prefer to be in person because the dynamic is different.
Senior,5,"I believe this school is just perfect for an individual who wants to feel belonged. San Jose State University is one the most diverse colleges I have ever visited or even heard of. When visiting the campus of SJSU, one can easily recognize that it is the home of countless individuals of various backgrounds. This allows almost any individual on campus feel welcomed as they meet other individuals of similar race, culture, and other background. In addition, this school is huge on getting everyone's voices heard, whether this be in the classroom or not. I also believe that having such a diverse population, San Jose State University is a college that supports each and every individual and hopes that our differences can be seen positively."
Senior,5,"I had a wonderful online learning experience with San Jose State University, especially during this time of COVID-19. Despite all the hard changes we all had to go through, I believe all my professors did a great job using various computer applications in this online setting to engage the entire class and enhance the way each of us learns."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes vary whether they are synchronous or asynchronous. Some of the online classes meet over Zoom at a certain time, and others do not. The asynchronous classes require you to learn at your own time."
Alum,5,"Loved how diverse it was! I also loved the campus, specifically the palm trees. My instructors were mostly great, and the people were friendly here. I enjoyed living on campus as well. Being in Silicon Valley was also a plus, studying business!"
Junior,5,"I've had great experiences with SJSU  thus far. The faculty is super nice and helpful and there are so many different resources as far as financial assistance, extracurricular programs, academic and personal counseling. It's also such an inclusive school, I've felt welcomed by all."
Junior,5,Due to COVID courses are now online and so far it's been a great experience. The availability is flexible and surprisingly not stressful. I like that I don't have to wake up extra early nor be out super late in a class but instead I can take it on my own time during the day. I haven't felt stressed out at all.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. Coming from a very small high school, this school is a great size for me. It's big enough for me to meet a lot of people, but small enough so I don't feel overwhelmed."
Senior,5,"San Jose State University is a campus rich in diversity among both students and faculty. The campus is beautiful and offers modern technology i.e. 3D printers, Mac laptop rental vending machine, mobile food ordering, etc..."
Junior,5,Even though the classes are big the professors respond to emails. The help for undocumented students its really amazing.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this school. Once I got accepted I immediately said yes; the campus is just stunning; a lot of green open space, the resources are also great."
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity of the University, this includes the students, the staff and the various classes that are available. The diversity makes me feel comfortable as I don't feel like an outsider knowing everyone comes from a different place and everyone will be accepted. The staff are always happy to help with any issues that you may encounter."
Sophomore,5,"For something that was completely new to not only us the students but also the teachers, I feel like everyone did their part in order to facilitate the online process."
Junior,5,The campus has been trying to accommodate students by both training professors on the online learning environment and making hybrid classes available.
Alum,5,I loved using canvas because it gave me a great chance to finish my degree at a good pace. During my time at SJSU I worked 2 jobs and it was very benificiary for my situtation.
Senior,5,Overall good. Some profs take time to adapt. Zoom bombers happened but the IT dept came up with solutions quickly.
Freshman,5,The overall atmosphere is just as you expect college to be. You see the difference in lifestyles but they don't let it interfere with social interaction
Sophomore,5,Professors who run online classes do an excellent job communicating with students and keeping the learning and working process simple. Students are able to work at their own pace while being able to engage and stay involved with their classmates as well.
Freshman,5,SJSU was always my dream and now I am living it. The university experience at SJSU is not only limited to education and faculty but also we get to know different cultures as student from all over the world come at SJSU to pursue their dreams. It is popular among international students therefore in just one university you can make friends from all over the world this greatly improve the social skills and gives confidence.
Freshman,5,"Yes, my classes are online for Fall 2020 semester and previous semester too I have had few classes online. The experience was good. The faculty gave their best to students. In this unpredictable pandemic they are trying their best to provide students with quality educations. The virtual labs that I attended last semester proved that SJSU can handle any type situation very well and also keeping in account the education quality."
Alum,5,"I took a couple online classes here. I remember taking an anatomy class, and for our exams we had to use our webcam on our computers or laptops and use a program to share the screen with our professors. This was to ensure no one was cheating."
Alum,5,"The school used great technology and I had a great experience while taking classes online.  Ironically, my online professors were more available to me than my in person classes."
Niche User,5,"When on a college visit to San Jose University, I could immediately tell this was this college for me. The other students and employees are so nice; the school has amazing diversity. The campus is beautiful, they even have a statue of the historical African- American track team at the olympics."

Freshman,5,a very friendly environment. close to home which was a plus for me. lots of opportunities for growth.
Freshman,5,at first I was skeptical about online classes. professors made the process go smoothly. even though getting help in person is obviously not able to happen help is still given and is useful.
Junior,5,"I had two online classes and two in-person classes before distance learning began. For my in-person history course my prof recorded his lectures like normal and posted them online for us to view. Additionally, he used a lockdown browser when we had our tests. My in-person stress management course cancelled our last two exams and final paper, and instead replaced it with a mini research paper and a reflection paper. My other two online classes also included reflection type assignments at the end of the semester. It wasn't too much of a change for me, but it was nice to have some load off my back, and I was definitely less stressed at the end of the semester."
Freshman,5,What I like about San Jose State University is the diversity of students and the ability of the campus and administrators on making everyone feel included.
Junior,5,Experiences at San Jose State have been one of the best I've ever had. San Jose State has made my learning experience incredible as I've learned so many things throughout the years. San Jose State can be a great school to meet new friends and people that will help you find connections in your future career.
Sophomore,5,"I took the end of my freshman semester online, it was not very difficult for me to maintain a passing grade because, before this situation, my grade in that class was very good."
Freshman,5,"I said I would never apply to San Jose State because I wanted to get out of my hometown of San Jose. After being there for a year now, I cannot imagine being anywhere else. I have made so many new friends through summer orientation, living in the dorms, and all my classes. You can tell that administration truly cares about the well being of all of the students on campus, for I have had great professors thus far. I understand that because the school is located in downtown, which has a reputation of not being the safest, people may shy away from this school. However, the campus ensures that all students and faculty are safe. There is a police department right on campus as well as blue lights located at many spots around campus if you feel like you are in danger. You can even call for an escort if you feel unsafe, and to get into dorms you must have your key card and there are people are the front desk who check your ID to make sure you live there. High recommend this university!"
Alum,5,"Professors were very well organized and kept us up with assignments. Many of the professors have taught online classes for years, making the process smooth for students. There was not one online class I took that I did not enjoy. They were just as engaging as in-person classes."
Senior,5,Amazing school super supportive staff and deans! They take their time to hear you out! Advisors are extremely helpful!
Junior,5,It's a good school with dedicated professors.  It's a very diverse campus. Everyone is friendly and you get a tatse of eveyr culture from the campus. Depending on your college it takes one to push their own boundaries in order to suceed in their department.
Freshman,5,"It is very diverse and the people on campus make you feel very welcoming. The campus is very nice and has a lot of different things to do on campus. SJSU is a great college for those looking to major in engineering or business. Campus is ideal location wise, the staff are very professional, and the campus is large. Diversity is scarce but there are tons of activities and groups prompting a diverse campus. They offer many assistance programs and resources for freshmen, like book loaning programs. I hope you consider SJSU when looking at schools. It's the best decision I have ever made."
Freshman,5,I am so happy that I attend San Jose State. One of the very best schools. The wide variety of academics and sports is amazing. The clubs and extracurricular activities are also great. We have such a diverse school.
Freshman,5,Such a diverse and interactive school. They always go above. and. beyond. to make students feel welcomed and will stop at nothing to put the needs of our students first.
Freshman,5,"San Jose state University has brought me so many new opportunities to advance in my career. Everyone is always willing to help you in any way possible. The professors there are amazing, they genuinely care about their students."
Freshman,5,San Jose has a great environment and the vibe is different right when you step on campus. I found San Jose to be a good space and place to advance my knowledge. It has great people and many people who want you to succeed.
Niche User,5,"San Jose State is a university with exceptional student life and provides a large amount of support for incoming students. One of the reasons I chose sjsu was diversity, which is a token value of sjsu. There are people from all walks of life who attend the university, enriching the experience."
Niche User,5,"Something that I liked about SJSU is that the professors are great and offer quality education for an affordable price. SJSU is one of the best universities in California and among the CSU system. Although this is true, I would like to see the lecture halls decrease in size. This can help with student and professor interaction. Other than that, I think SJSU is an amazing school with amazing professors and staff that help make students successful."
Junior,5,I like that San Jose State University has so much to study and that most alumni have a chance to work at big high tech companies.
Freshman,5,"Very diverse, all cultures found here. Classes aren't too big. Good overrall. Very good location in the Silicon Valley. Not too far from lots of cities including Santa Cruz and San Fransisco."
Niche User,5,"SJSU feels very welcoming and the campus looks nice and clean. The campus is easy to navigate. Everyone on campus is very friendly towards one another, including me."
Senior,5,"The campus is really big, and has many walk ways on your way to class. When i went there for th SAT's and Act's. it is also near my location, which is downtown sj."
Niche User,5,"The campus is very modern which compelled me to apply. During my tour, I found that SJSU had a very supportive environment. SJSU is all about social justice and being a part of that would be exceptional."
Alum,5,"As a recent grad, SJSU can offer a full college experience filled with involvement and excitement. Its up to you to take advantage of what it has to offer. I came from SoCal and was able to feel right at home thanks to friends and mentors I met here. Its a good school once you learn to navigate through academics, work, and involvement. Wouldnt want to have it any other way, GO SPARTANS."
Niche User,5,"Within California, San Jose State University is considered an average quality university at a good price. It is in a very well located and I like that they combine education of average quality, it results in a good value for money compared to other colleges and universities in California."
Junior,5,"San Jose State University is a wonderful school, they do so much for us students and are very inclusive. They do lots of school activities and it's nice for a college to do that because all of my friend's universities don't do that. The students are awesome, and the professors are also good. The only feedback I would give is to maybe get more advisors in for each major, It could take up to three weeks just to set up an appointment and drop-in hours aren't beneficial for students who work or have classes during that time, and sometimes it urgent and we need help but we can't get it at the time we need."
Junior,5,"I have just recently transferred to San Jose State and I love it so much. This campus is smaller than other college campuses that I have been too, but I am not complaining about that in any way. The professors are understanding and very helpful when it comes to assignments. The parking is a bit of a hassle since I do not live in the area, I have to wake up every day at 4:30 AM to get to school by 7 AM to make it to my 8 AM. I wish that there was a better way to improve the parking so that students who commute like me do not have to get up so early in order to get a parking spot. The library is a different story, sometimes you cannot find a table to do your work because there are so many students. I wish that it wasn't a public library and that only SJSU students were allowed in there. Although, I am glad that I chose to transfer to this University because I have made many new friends and everyone is so friendly towards one another."
Niche User,5,"San Jose State is very welcoming and right when you step on campus, you can feel a different vibe around you"
Freshman,5,"It's a beautiful campus with a diverse population of students. It offers a wide variety of majors and minors, and is a good price for tuition."
Junior,5,"This school is very well diverse, this school also had many big improvements that they do each year like opening up a food pantry for the students who struggle to buy their own food outside."
Freshman,5,I took my SAT and ACT in this campus. It was somewhat large and it was next to the city (Downtown) which is really amazing because its like a small San Francisco and New York. Staff and Students their were very nice and welcoming. I believe it was a club day or welcoming day because students had banners and booths representing their clubs and alumni.
Junior,5,"I just started my first semester at San Jose State and it has been an eye-opening experience to the hands-on learning that CSUs are known for. It has helped me grow into a better student, and has taught me the importance of going to class and going to your teachers office hours as much as you can throughout the semester. Although their career center can be improved in the amount of opportunities they have and it can be said that they need more support for students finding jobs, but overall it has been a rewarding experience and I can't wait to finish my education here at SJSU!"
Junior,4,"San Jose State University is in the heart of the Silicon Valley and it provides an abundance of academic options. It is mainly a commuter school so parking can be difficult at times. There is a large student population so classes are often filled before you get the chance to enroll which is one downside. Although, the school staff and administration care about their students and try their best to make us succeed."
Freshman,4,Decent social student life. Campus is nice and safe but the area around it is very sketchy. This is not a party school whatsoever.
Freshman,4,Not interactive at all and many professors have trouble managing online classes. There is student involvement that occurs over zoom to try to engage with students.
Sophomore,4,"This is currently my second year at SJSU. In my freshman year, I lived on campus, and I thought my dorms were nice given the price. The community of people on my floor was welcoming and open to people from all walks of life. One of my favorite things about the campus is that everything is so close together. This made going from one class to another very easy. So, unless you sleep in, it's pretty hard to be late to class when living on campus. My teachers treated students respectfully and I never encountered any unwanted action from any of San Jose State's staff."
Sophomore,4,"So far my online learning experience has been a little tough. I feel like it can be difficult for some students to retain information from classes that they are taking online. Although there is this downside, I feel like the teaching staff at San Jose State University are trying their best to provide their students with the best education they can, given the circumstances. All of my classes have scheduled lectures except for one. Although we do not me online, I feel like I am still learning a lot from the class."
Senior,4,It's a great school for science and engineering. It has a vast alumni base where you can network and move laterally in the workplace with the backing of alumni's endorsement.
Senior,4,They have adapted to the online learning more than some of the UC's so that's very reassuring. I think that they are getting more and more efficient as COVID is still around and are taking the greatest precautions to care for the students.
Niche User,4,"The campus has a very welcoming environment, and there are students from a variety of backgrounds that you can meet."
Freshman,4,"It is pretty good. They guided the new students pretty well, however, I wish they had given a list of things to do before the first day of school. I honestly was panicking as I found our I had to do some writing before school. As for the classes, the teachers are all very friendly."
Freshman,4,So far so good during COVID. I do hope that the teachers check their emails a little bit more just because it is hard to be unable to talk to teachers face to face or get the full experience. One of my professors was a little slow with her emails.
Sophomore,4,"I like the diversity at this college, which is great because you meet people from different backgrounds and learn more about other cultures."
Freshman,4,"I  enjoy the speedy customer service using their ""live chat"" options for every department. This facilitates the waiting process. Instead of waiting hours or days for an email response, I can ask all my questions at one speaking to a live representative. Due to the global pandemic, I believe San Jose State can do better for its students by allowing for an increase in the number of installment payments for tuition fees. I struggled a lot to get help from the Bursar's office and unfortunately they didi not allow me to increase the number of installment payments. This is a huge financial burden since classes are so expensive and if we do not pay our tuition fees  on time, we will be dropped from our courses. San Jose State can do better by being responsible and supportive of the students who committed to attend SJSU as their school of choice to fulfill their academic goals."
Freshman,4,I am taking my classes  online. My professors have prerecorded lectures and uploaded quizzes for every lecture to keep us engaged. Seminar is live and it allows for questions and discussions regarding lecture. I am very pleased with my online curriculum. I enjoy watching prerecorded lectures because I can pause them at my leisure to take notes and rewind the video to watch it again. The live seminar through Zoom is engaging and allows for a thorough discussion of the lecture and required reading. I am very pleased with the level of education I am receiving.
Senior,4,"Classes online at SJSU are very straight forward. For those classes that are essential with hands-on learning experience, there are simulators with websites/resources that fulfill those experiences. If you follow the class's curriculum you are sure to pass without missing anything."
Senior,4,"San Jose State University has a beautiful campus with lots of important history. Teachers are great at hands-on learning, there is a very diverse and inclusive community, and there is great support for those struggling regarding any aspect in life. The only thing I would recommend is to have a straight-forward academic plan (for all 4 years) because advisors sometimes don't do much of a good job. If you don't investigate yourself, you might end-up falling a little behind. But other than that SJSU is a great school!"
Alum,4,"Online classes went smoothly. Easy to follow along with, and fairly user-friendly. I would recommend."
Junior,4,My professors have been very understanding and even find ways to make things easier for their students.
Junior,4,"Prior to distanced learning, I had only taken one online class before. Every class I am taking right now is online and I would say they run similarly to the one I had taken previously. SJSU has done a good job of transitioning from in-person to completely online considering they only had a few months to do so. Everyone is adjusting to these major changes so I appreciate how understanding my professors have been."
Junior,4,I just started my third year at SJSU and would say I've had an overall good experience because of how unique the school is. SJSU is one of the most diverse campuses out of all other CSUs. I have personally seen a lot of diversity between both students and professors. This has to be one of my favorite things about SJSU because diversity in students means diversity in studies. I don't know about other students but seeing faces that look similar to mine helps me feel like I belong and gives me a sense of comfort. I cannot speak for all but every professor I had teach me while at SJSU has been very genuine and helpful. Transitioning from high school to college is never easy but SJSU helps you feel at home!
Sophomore,4,"Different professors use different online mediums to teach and incorporate curriculum. Since the pandemic though, most professors have adapted the classes well."
Senior,4,Most professors are savvy with technology since the campus is located in the heart of Silicon Valley.
Senior,4,"It was  a hard transition, but the school executed it well. Not all teachers were tech say and made it difficult. Also there should be some type of aid for students and internet bills because now that everything is online not everyone has good internet, or internet at all."
Senior,4,Good student involvement and clean campus. School offers a lot of good clubs and communities. The school focuses too much in sports and money. Student housing should not be open again due to Covid.
Junior,4,"There are a lot of different resources available for students and because of the location, the opportunities are worth the cost. The campus is very diverse."
Junior,4,The campus is livable and the events the schools plan are really fun for the students to participate in.
Alum,4,I think SJSU is a great univeristy. I'm a San Jose native and I loved attending here for my undergrad. Professors are great. I think students should seek out opportunities and create a relationship with professors. They could one day make a great refrence or letter of recommendation for a job or graduate programs. The campus is located in downtown and I think the setting is benificial.
Senior,4,"Affordable, very diverse and inclusive. Small campus compared to other state schools but it’s decent. A lot of student activities and events throughout the year. Many great campus services."
Freshman,4,Almost all classes were online but I did have classes in person for music chambers and such. It takes a cool minute to get use to but online isn't completely horrible. Definitely not the way I hoped to start college.
Sophomore,4,San Jose State provides a wonderful educational experience with amazing professors and academics. They provide many opportunities to gain work experience in all fields and do any amazing job to organize many events to socialize with other students on campus.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy San Jose State. The new gym is amazing and modern and convenient. The building are pretty well kept. The professors some of them you can tell enjoy what they do.
Alum,4,"Living close to San Jose University made it more affordable for me. Campus life was great! Everyone made you feel welcome, and there are various clubs and organizations you can join. I loved how San Jose State University is very diverse! Everyone is welcome no matter your background. I'm glad I chose to go here! However, the one thing I didn't like is how impacted the school was and how difficult it was to get the classes you wanted. You were lucky if you had an early registration date."
Freshman,4,"San Jose State University is in one of the most diverse areas, the bay area. The diversity contributes to the campus's atmosphere, allowing people to interact interracially in a comfortable manner. One thing I would change about SJSU is it food menu at the cafeteria. Serving the same food constantly can be extremely tiring for students and in the end, it's not worth the price the student pay."
Sophomore,4,I really do like this school. I just wish they did more for black students like they do other races.
Senior,4,"San Jose State University is a decent school and its great if you are planning to go into the Engineering department. Math and science is usually what we excel in and animation is also another major that is very well liked and popular. I'm in the Industrial Design program and its very competitive but pushes students to do their very best. Professors are also very engaging and professional in their craft. I mainly had friendly encounters with others in my major and people are helpful from my own experience. The only thing I would say that needs improvement on is the advising and campus resources. Some students have had poor uninformative advisors and reaching certain people became difficult. A lot of resources seem to be hidden so students need to figure things out by themselves. Since its in downtown, the safety isn't the best so I would hope that campus police would be able to keep watch a bit more."
Senior,4,"I mainly took online classes for my GE courses. A lot of the online classes used Canvas but sometimes a professor would have their own site or an online textbook as a tool. The content that was taught was pretty straight forward to the concepts that were in the class required textbook. Online classes can be helpful if someone were to be too busy working or having a hard time getting on campus daily. Its a good alternative and usually is more flexible. You can turn in assignments in a bigger time frame. There are timed quizzes and tests usually as well as some discussion threads to make up  for the in class engagement. Though, you would need to be aware that more readings and lengthy essays and write ups are frequent due to it being an online class and some concepts and ideas are better discussed in person with a class."
Alum,4,I only took 2 online classes while at San Jose State. The professors were very receptive to their students despite no in-person meeting.
Alum,4,"The professors were very informative and helpful towards my future endeavors of becoming a physical therapist. There is a homelessness issue in Downtown San Jose, however for the most part it did not affect the students. My least favorite experience of San Jose State is living in the Bricks dorm facility. Despite meeting a lot of friends in my building, the building itself was old, unsanitary, and a hazard to my health. I lived there for about 9 months and half of the time I was severely sick and developed a skin condition that I had never previously had before. My favorite experiences are the new Student Union building, the tremendous diversity of ideas and students, and the vocal clubs on campus."
Junior,4,"There's not much I dislike about San Jose State. So far, I've loved all my professors, I've met nice people, and there's diversity and inclusivity in regards to race, religion, sexuality and gender.  One thing I dislike about San Jose State is the state of the parking garages. They are very cramped and I'm always afraid of another student damaging my car.  Additionally, I wish there were more print stations around campus."
Sophomore,4,"This is an advance institution academically, but the learning environment is similar to most top Cal States; you will have the same experience at most universities. I enjoyed the rigorous courses, and challenging academia."
Sophomore,4,It was a new scenery for me coming from the city Los Angeles. It opened me up to a different environment including the people that live in that area.
Sophomore,4,The professors have been very understanding with the online learning experience and have allowed students to turn in late work due to the possibilities of slight disturbances that are experienced in the household.
Junior,4,"Have had pretty good communication with the professors and faculty, could be a bit better with response but other than that, it's good"
Junior,4,"A diverse and welcome atmosphere, accommodating to times of issue (i.e. COVID-19), willing to remedy a situation"
Sophomore,4,My online class was segmented in self-regulated assignments. There wasn't a lot of teacher communication and I learned the material through the lectures. Another online class was completely scheduled. The professor met with the students online at the same time every week.
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of opportunities to build community with school organizations. The professors are generally open to feedback and communication, so it helps to reach out."
Sophomore,4,it was difficult at first but everyone adjusted and professors helped a lot in adjusting us and making us comfortable with everything.
Junior,4,"The change from in-person to online classes this year was a bit off because I never saw it coming. However, online classes went really smooth, some of my professors had some experience with online classes and some didn't but did a great job adapting to it."
Sophomore,4,"I think SJSU is a very good school especially for specific majors. Big campus and opportunities to join clubs, meet new people. Very fun exploring downtown."
Sophomore,4,Professors very good at adapting especially during this rough time. Most professors really care for their students.
Sophomore,4,"San Jose State is a very welcoming school, teachers are very polite and really care about the students grades."
Freshman,4,"Because of COVID-19, second semester was online, which was difficult for all of us. Me personally, I cannot learn efficiently when I’m not physically in a classroom, so I was finding myself getting stressed or irritated with the circumstances quite often. However, majority of my professors were very patient and lenient during this time, and I applaud them. They emphasized everyday that if we have any questions, concerns, or anything we just want to reach out to them about, they are just an email away. I was concerned my grades would slip moving from in person to online, but they remained where they were and I am so thrilled."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I'm very proud to be attending SJSU. I'm in aerospace engineering, and my first year has been a rewarding experience. I've had understanding and outstanding professors for both my major-specific courses and my GE's who have guided me, and there are countless student organizations to be part of if you're looking to gain experience or just meet new friends outside of your major.
If you choose to attend here, note that you are your own boss. You choose how your college experience goes, and it is your responsibility to reach out to your professors and advisors if you have any questions or just want to chat. Yes, the school spirit is ""lacking"" at times compared to other colleges. But if you want that to change, be part of the change. Yes the safety is what you'd expect in downtown San Jose, but use common sense and you should be fine. Class registration is a pretty smooth experience as well, just plan in advance and keep track of the dates. The resources are there - use them."
Freshman,4,"For me, pretty much all my courses were shifted online. Even before the university officially made the switch to remote learning, two of my six professors this semester decided to transition to online learning after asking our classes what we would prefer. In general, SJSU did a great job with communication and the transitioning process, and all my professors were lenient and were willing to adjust to students' needs and concerns as necessary. Obviously laboratory classes will never be perfectly substituted as an online experience, but the transition was made in the best way possible at the given time."
Freshman,4,"SJSU is a commuter school at first glance, it is a public school in the downtown of the city, so expect a lot of diversity, to pubs and food, to fesival and part rooms, you think of it its prob there in the downtown.  The only downside like any other downtown is that there is a homeless problem and a viet gang in the local.  They tend to stray from the main campus and the few blocks surrounding it, cause poor college kids have nothing to rob.  Careful at night, and always ask for an escort guard when traveling between."
Freshman,4,"Online platform for the Covid-19 is an interesting shift, a lot of classes like STEM had a bigger impact, as you cant go into lab online, and most lectures had to be video recorded by the professor themselves."
Freshman,4,I personally love the the vibe on campus. Many students are accepting to who you are and have no problem helping you out. Faculty also is great since given any opportunity they will mention the many sources to help their students.
Alum,4,San Jose State is a great school with great academics and incredibly diverse. The professors in my major were all amazing and caring. I met great people there and had an amazing time.
Graduate Student,4,"I can only speak to the online experience with San Jose State University. As a new grad student enrolled in a 100% online program, I found all the information and support I needed through the school. Response time is excellent. I found the advisors to be available and very supportive."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my first semester at SJSU. As a transfer student I found it quite easy to find other students that are willing to get together after class to study together. The school has plenty of places that remain open late in the evening to continue my school work on campus. However, I do feel as if some of the teachers in the engineering department have not met my expectations as instructors. It feels as if some of the senior professors are trying to drill how to answer questions correctly for exams versus teaching us why and how the topics work."
Freshman,4,"San Jose State is a perfect getaway from home. The campus is beautiful and comfortable and makes the college experience a lot better. It is not the place to go if you're looking to party, but if you genuinely want a good college with great professors and a great environment, SJSU is a great place to go. They also provide great resources for their students and are very inclusive."
Senior,2,"The professors are not flexible, grade as if still in-person classes. Counseling for Academic success and graduation is low."
Junior,2,"The area around the school is not very nice at all, unless you are in downtown. The school itself is not amazing when it comes to aesthetics. There is a new Rec center that is pretty cool. Living on campus can be cool when you live with your friends or be ready to be annoyed all the time. In terms of the quality of the dorms, unless your are living in Joe West, its gonna look nice."
Freshman,2,"San Jose has provided me with a lot of great teachers whose class I've enjoyed taking. However, the area even just stepping outside the campus is terrible."
Niche User,2,"I started school here in 2008, and problems started from day one. The school is over crowded, difficult to get classes, and abysmal student support staff. The focus for SJSU was on college athletics and greek life. If you are not part of one of these organizations on campus, your college ""experience""may not be what you always expected."
Niche User,2,"It was an alright school. Unless you lived in the dorms or know people at the dorms you wouldn't know what was going on campus. People keep to themselves most of the time and a lot of teachers seem to only be there just to be there. Other than that, it is a public school be careful it is not as safe of a campus due to a lot of homeless people living there and countless alert texts. Lastly, school lacks funding and major budget cuts, which means it's harder to get classes and you got to make sure you get priority because you wont get the classes you need if you dont!"
Junior,2,"If I could go back in time, I definitely would've gone to another school. The culture he is not that great, no real sense of community, and often times the administrators are incompetent."
College Freshman,2,SJSU can be rather unsafe at times. We are in the heart of downtown which comes with the urban public lurking around. I advise you take extra precaution at night and try to avoid risky areas where shootings happen. Take advantage of the SJSU alerts and call campus pd if you feel unsafe.
College Freshman,2,"We're located in downtown San Jose, it's pretty bad. You just have to be careful and aware and you'll be fine."
College Sophomore,2,They only approach you if you are somewhat attractive.
College Sophomore,2,I go to school in downtown so crime rates are higher here than other parts of the city. I don't personally know anyone who has been harmed but it happens.
College Freshman,2,I do not feel safe walking alone
College Junior,2,There is no on-campus family housing.  There is no on-campus housing for mature students unless they are willing to live in a dorm.
College Freshman,2,"Although the school tries it's best to prevent assault, since the school is in downtown, there inevitable creepers."
College Freshman,2,The Greeks are a little desperate for members and they are always asking for you to take their flyers.
College Sophomore,2,Lately there have been multiple accounts of crime going on around campus so it's scary. Mainly robberies.
College Junior,2,Since the campus is open to the public a lot of robberies and a assaults take place.
College Junior,2,The Greek life on campus has become a way for people to separate themselves from one another. It promotes rivalries and non-Greek students are looked down upon.
College Freshman,2,"The actual sports teams at San Jose State are average. Although we are a Division 1 school, we aren't the best. By far the most popular sporting events on campus are the football games. Even then, attendance tends to wind down after the first few weeks if we are having an average/bad year. Most students attend the tailgates prior to the games. As far as the other sporting events, attendance is very low. Still, most students are proud to show their SJSU spirit and pride throughout campus, sporting events, and even other events. The school gym is rather small, often times resulting in it being overcrowded. The athletic facilities meant for non-athlete students could definitely use major improvements."
College Freshman,2,"I enjoy living in the dorms as they help me connect with people and learn to live on my own, but there is not enough space as some of us are stuck in a triple bedroom where space is way too limited. Security of windows are poor as before thanksgiving someone broke into my dorm. Prices are way too high for what is being offered to me and they are not as clean as the dorms could be."
College Sophomore,2,Don't like sleeping on campus
College Freshman,2,"Although I am an optimistic person, San Jose State University can be a bit a demon to face when it comes to anything regarding the human resources department. When I came to the campus for Admitted Spartan Day I had to go to the student services office to change my legal name for my student profile name in the school's database. It took me over a month for me to finally end the dilemma with my name successfully changed in accordance to my preferred name and have it entered in their database. For financial aid assistance, I would recommend that you be as direct and firm with the people at the main office desk as you possibly can. If you don't, the main office will direct you into a wild goose chase about the bureaucracy in hopes that you will find whatever it is that you are looking for. To get financial aid at this school, again, be direct with the main directory and ask them to redirect you to your counselor for assistance or to a financial aid advisor that has expertise in the field of helping students regarding the cost of attending the university."
College Senior,2,only fraternities and sororeighties are allowed into the parties unless you are on the list in which you know someone who will put you on the list
Recent Alumnus,2,"From what I've seen, off campus housing is not only expensive but the apartments and houses are sketchy and because it's in a major city, you get very little space for a lot of money."
College Junior,2,"Expensive, limited and often in sketchy areas. Finding places to rent sucks due to the downtown location."
College Freshman,2,"I have tried to receive financial aid, but got none."
College Junior,2,"Academics at this school really aren't good. The engineering and nursing are good, but other than that, it kinda sucks all around."
College Junior,2,Not great here. one of the worst in MW
College Junior,2,Super competitive. Lots of sletchy areas and usually far from campus.
College Junior,2,Everyone hates the admin here
College Freshman,2,"In the beginning of the year I had work study, but it was randomly dropped. I tried talking to someone about it but they did not help me. Also SJSU barely gives out grants because they have no money to give."
College Freshman,2,"I do not know much about off-campus housing but I had visited a classmate's apartment for a class project. She shared it with around 4 other people and the place was dirty, crowded, and cramped. As for the other apartment complexes I've seen near campus, none of them look visually appealing. Many are old, peeling with paint, and in need of remodeling. Also, there have been recent crimes happening near campus which do pose a safety issue. The best bet would be to live on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The cooks need to make sure the good is cooked thoroughly especially the chicken. The rice is always hard it's never fully cooked. They need to make more of the simple dishes like lasagna, meatloaf, etc"
College Junior,2,"Rent is expensive. For your own room, you are going to pay at least $600. There are not many housing selections equipped with a washer and dryer."
College Freshman,2,"Not only is staff rude, but they were charging me and threating me of dropping all my classes for not paying my tuition. However after being confirmed I'd be receiving financial aid and taking out loans, none of which kicked in leaving me to pay full tuition. After having to speak to several people and explain the situation and thankfully coming acoss some staff memebers that recognized it was the universities fault, they gave me my loan and financial aid money."
College Freshman,2,"For the price of room and board, the given quality is extremely poor and ridiculous. Aside from having to share a ridiculously small room, the bathrooms are filthy, and there seems to be a huge bug problem with in the dorm buildings. 

First week in we found dead cockroaches in our room."
College Sophomore,2,"I have tried with financial aid and they refuse me even though my family struggles to pay tuition. I work more than I should to try and help out with costs but I fear I will be in dept soon. Financial aid only helps those whose can't pay a dime, then they give some money."
College Senior,2,High prices for crap houses.
College Junior,2,"The shortage of sections available for classes is what really make students go beyond their years here in this university. The high impaction rates are also a big factor for getting into my major. Only a small amount of students spots are available every semester, and in order to get in, a high grade in only one class will make the difference. Since a lot of the classes required for admission into the major are wait listed, this makes students fall behind in their schedule, only making the application process more difficult and stressful."
College Freshman,2,No one provides help as to searching for housing and must be done yourself.
College Sophomore,2,At night never walk alone there have been many assaults (not sexual assaults though).
College Sophomore,2,They listen to the students when we call the media.
College Sophomore,2,"Most parties are hosted by frats, either in the frat house or in a separate house rented by a group of frats. You can only get into these parties if you are part of the frat or sorority or you know someone who is in the host frat."
College Sophomore,2,We are getting constant alerts about robbery or assault on campus. Mainly because it is an open campus
College Sophomore,2,"sjsu is right in the middle of downtown San Jose, which isn't the most safe place. Although their are a lot of bars downtown and in the downtown areas in the cities around San Jose, there is not a lot for students under 21 to go do for fun."
College Freshman,2,I don't feel safe on campus because all of the crime around sjsu.
College Junior,2,"they lose documents, always ask for documents I've already turned in, make receiving aid hard when college is hard enough to pay for already. Seems as if they're greedy."
College Sophomore,2,Only the Homecoming football game is made into a big deal.
College Sophomore,2,It's hard trying to get into a major
College Sophomore,2,I do not like being undeclared.
College Sophomore,2,"Most majors are impacted. Currently I'm undeclared because of this. The process to get in a specific major depends on your gpa, units, and prerequisites they may ask for."
College Sophomore,2,There is a new situation on or near the campus each month.
College Junior,2,Many students on campus try or take drugs or alcohol. there is no peer pressure. If you do not drink then you are still accepting into whatever group.
College Freshman,2,The DC is gross. The Student Union closes early and they took Subway out.
College Freshman,2,The crime is very high. Always a robbery and criminals running on campus.
College Freshman,2,The do not seem to care at parties. As long as they do not see you drinking on campus.
College Freshman,2,We are D1 but we definitely do not play like we are. People seem to go to the game to pre-game and drink.
College Freshman,2,The apartments look run down. Not nice enough for the offered prices and everything is usually already taken.
College Freshman,2,"It is awful unless you are in a sorority or fraternity. People usually stand around and drink and/or smoke. Some nights, you will hear about a party, go to it, and it will not be happening."
College Sophomore,2,most of the apartments near campus are filled with homeless people lounging in the parking lot. this is especially scary for a girl going back after a night class alone.
College Junior,2,The area around campus can be dangerous. There are often robberies.
Sophomore,1,"Horrible...I have emailed an advisor with a specific question before the add classes deadline, with which the reply was ""ok"" is that a joke?!That reply was 8 days later and one day till the deadline... now I am taking a class that I'm not sure I need.

I have sent emails to staff and have never gotten a reply to this day, it is pulling teeth to contact somebody. Professors are friendly but are subpar at teaching concepts, get ready to try and teach yourself. Stuff is on exams that were not taught in class or on homework, professors reply with ""you should know that"" how is that good education? 

Most but not all campus buildings look like a WWII bunker, with rats in the classrooms and homeless on campus. 

Advisors stink, they do not know anything about the programs to which they advise. I have been screwed over and my money wasted. 

The Aviation Program keeps changing advisors, are not organized, and the program is falling apart. 

Looking to transfer out..."
Sophomore,1,"This is my 2nd semester online and it is HORRIBLE. The semester COVID first hit the University promised to train professors and staff, improve online classes, and made it sound like FALL 2020 online would be way better....NOTHING changed and it seems like staff are lazy and like being at home doing minimal work for us students. Not to mentioned they announced online for spring 2020 as well...

Looking to transfer out..."
Freshman,1,The school was not prepared at all to go online and doesn't seem to care. I had a zoom meeting fill up because it reached max capacity and the professor said the school didn't expect students to go to classes. It is impossible to communicate virtually and all my professors have ignored my emails. Most of my professors post assignments late at night like 11PM and expect it to be due at 12AM. The school staff is incredibly rude and have no courtesy. The disorganized nature of campus and the professors have already caused me to fall behind on assignments and understanding the material. The advisors are extremely unhelpful and can do nothing to help the situation. The school expects students to be patient with the professors because of COVID and the wildfires but the students get none of that in return.
Freshman,1,"Worst experience of my life! I urge you, don't go here! The professors and staff are extremely unprofessional. All but one of my professors lacked communication skills. It was impossible to communicate with anyone on campus to help me with my problems. When I was able to talk to an advisor they told me that professors don't need to communicate or teach because this isn't high school. I had so many advisors lie to me and tell me I could get my money back if I withdrew now but now they are saying I would get practically nothing back. It is now too late to enroll in a community college or somewhere else. The school is too impacted to help any student stay on track. They lack professionalism and do not act like they are an accredited university. I've wasted so much time and money for an education that solely comes out of a textbook."
Sophomore,1,"There is little support from faculty outside of academic guidance. I struggled with adjusting socially, and the administration within the institution only made the situation worse. I wish they would actually practice the inclusive environment they portrayed at orientation."
Freshman,1,"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, students are forced to take classes online. I do not feel the same motivation learning online than learning in class. Since I am looking at a computer screen, I cannot connect with the professor. Also, with   learning from home, in order to attend class; instead of getting up, getting dressed, and walking to class, I just roll over in bed and log onto my laptop. I have become extremely lazy when watching a lecture and do not retain any information given. With the type of classes I am taking, I am really struggling."
Alum,1,"This university makes me feel that the US is now a 3rd world country! 

This university gives people a hard time, not in a challenging way. I feel that I barely escaped by leaving the area as its been drastically hit by crime and poor government system. The system is NOT on the students side and is criminalized. There were people who were trying to fail students and their own people literally. Due to poor government structure the education system doesn't back up the students when instructors or staff are corrupt / take their anger out on students either.  Night hours are way unsafe! Couldn't go to class without having fear."
Junior,1,"Not good at all, Lost of fees, horrible people in the dorms. Some teachers are good but most of them are terrible. They want you to buy textbooks that they made so can make more money. If you don't pay into their system you fail."
Junior,1,"Had advisors from this university and they were little to no help with my advising. They set unrealistic expectations, weren't understanding of particular student circumstances, and more of less I felt like a number than an individual at this university. I will say there are quite a few professors here that really did care about my learning, but overall I felt the advisors here were no help. If your looking for approachable and supportive advisors, I recommend not this university. Again, everyone's experience is different, so your may vary from mine."
Junior,1,"The administration does not have the students' best interest in mind and just want their money. Trying to get a hold of someone for help or guidance is impossible. Advisors are not helpful and direct students to look online, when in reality the information is not online. It is also impossible to get the classes you want even with advance registration. As a transfer student, no one helped me my first semester and I wish I did not go to this school. The only positive thing about this school are the professors. Some of the professors are amazing and I would highly recommend."
Senior,1,Do not care about students health. While other campuses have closed their doors do to an unhealthy AQI. SJSU will stay open.
College Sophomore,1,"I currently live off-campus and I will admit it is a hassle. The cost of the house it outrageous. You are giving a parking permit, but parking is never guaranteed and really hard to stumble upon. The landlords are extremely strict and do not even let you listen to music and enjoy your day."
College Sophomore,1,My first year I didnt receive any finical aid due to a paper I did not turn in but I had no help to know what I had to turn in I called multiple times and had the worst service ! My friend ended up helping me and I ended up receiving finical aid the last month of school which was nice but I already had to take out a loan.
College Junior,1,"Horrible Teaching. Tons of old teachers who are super apathetic. The overall vibe of the school is apathy. Nobosy cares about anything. This isn't a bias review, its really true."
College Freshman,1,I live in the Bricks and the living conditions are extremely poor.
College Freshman,1,Even after financial aid I don't have nearly enough to pay for tuition and housing
College Freshman,1,I received no financial aid
College Sophomore,1,They just like to party.
College Junior,1,I was not granted any financial aid so I need to look for scholarships.
College Freshman,1,I am transferring for Spring 2014. I hate this school and so do most of my friends. I would definitely go to a different school.
College Sophomore,1,"The interior design program is very bad because the course requirements change very often. Unfortunately, my major adviser has told me many times to take certain courses that were required for my major and in the following semester she would tell me that the courses do not longer count for my major. Also, the interior design program keeps adding and omitting classes, which is not good because I feel like I am wasting so my money in a field of study that cannot keep itself well organized."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. There are never any spots available and the cost of parking permits are a few hundred every semester. There is never any parking available and the streets are crowded with cars, which makes it difficult to get around and walk safely around campus from class to class."
College Freshman,1,The school does not help students find off-campus housing at all. 
College Freshman,1,My school does not talk to their students about financial aid. They expect us to figure it out for ourselves. 
College Sophomore,1,"Fake eggs and burned coffee gets tiring very fast if you have them everyday for breakfast.  Since the students do the cooking in the dining commons, the food can get pretty nasty.  SJSU should hire a proper catering team instead of risking food poisoning for all the students."
College Sophomore,1,Extremely expensive to live on campus and not worth it.  The RA's are not professional enough to handle conflicts and there is a lot of bullying that happens amongst residents.
College Sophomore,1,"Aside from students parking extremely poorly, the rates are sky-rocket high and the garages are not safe.  You can get tickets, but you can just as easily get your car stolen."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus wifi disconnects you very frequently, so it's hard to get any work done."
College Sophomore,1,There isn't enough financial aid to help all the students in need.
College Freshman,1,"UPD is okay, but definitely can do more to stop the usual campus crime. Students commonly open their emails to AlertSJSU emails informing them of different incidents that happen. Although it is good that students are being notified, the crimes should not be taking place so frequently. I personally don't go out alone past 9PM."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I feel more secure when accompanied by someone. Every month there was some type of incident, like rape attempts or murder in the parking lots. Not a great feeling to know someone might be following you on campus and specially to the parking garages. "
College Junior,1,"I love the faculty and teachers but the administration could care less about the animation department, closing it out from many interested student and leaving most of us to have to leave. "
College Junior,1,"school is very impacted yet they have money for 3 new construction projects, It's pretty disheartening."
College Freshman,1,"I'm listening to Hardwell Live from TomorrowWorld (post-event) on Youtube while completing this survey and the video has no trouble loading, but sometimes the internet just does not work.  Wi-Fi is unreliable because it might connect to the network or it will ask you to enter your log-in information a dozen times and still not connect."
College Sophomore,1,It is lonely because it is such a commuter school
College Junior,1,always smell drugs by campus village
College Junior,1,"NO FREE PARKING ON CAMPUS. Permits are $96/semester! It's a downtown campus, so street parking is limited and has meters. There is no easy way if you're not paying the big bucks. Better to take the bus (provided free as a student) or get a ride with a friend. And what makes it worse, is several of the classes are taught OFF-Campus and you have to find your own way if you don't have a car... it's challenging!"
College Freshman,1,Financial aid is not very supportive at this school. You have to push everything in order to get it processed. They also do not give very descriptive information regarding financial matters
College Senior,1,"The Student Union is very dynamic in serving its purpose but is not a popular hangout. Currently under renovation majority of the students occupying the building are on eating in the food court or getting books from the bookstore. However the are few lounging. The most popular hangout is the CVB Quad, which is not a facility but a public lawn/bench area in front of the suites."
College Junior,1,"There is not plenty of parking found. Unless one attends classes at the earliest sessions, being 7:00 AM. The chances of finding parking is very slim. Though the parking garages are very close to school. As well the city parking is very expensive. Even if you pay for the parking permit, one is not guaranteed a spot."
College Junior,1,Promised a spot in my first year int he impacted Animation major but 3 years later was told I can not get in and was blocked from all the classes. causing my plans to transfer to a new school
College Junior,1,"As a female student of average height, I feel unsafe on campus since 
1.) It is an open campus (meaning homeless people in library and walking around on campus) 
2.) SJSU students receive alerts through text messages of dangerous activity (like assaults) at least once a month 
3.) Campus is fairly dark and there are many unlit pathways and corners on campus
4.) On campus and around campus at night it is downtown San Jose, meaning gang activity and shady individuals 
5.) Even in daylight on campus I feel unsafe due to random strangers (non-students) 
6.) Transportations services run by Campus Security takes forever to give you a ride back at night"
College Junior,1,"San Jose State University is set up in downtown San Jose, and while there are housing opportunities those that are close to the school are not in the safest areas and can be quite expensive."
College Freshman,1,parking is an everyday struggle. there is no safety whether you park on street or anywhere on campus.
College Freshman,1,this school has horrid internet and computers circa 1998. Their website is awful and they only seem to choose the worst of everything. How can this school be in silicon valley and have slower internet than 90% of the country?
College Freshman,1,Restaurants here at San Jose are very far from each other. There are not many restaurants by the school so there aren't many options to choose from.
College Student,1,If you're greek you drink. That doesn't mean if you don't drink you're left out though.
Recent Alumnus,1,parking is hard to find on campus because they get full right away and it cost alot for one day. so its better to go on the bus and safe a lot of money.
College Freshman,1,Parking is a hassle. I normally take bart and bus to school instead.
College Senior,1,"Off campus housing is simply everyone for themselves. Unlike UC's, there are no off campus housing hosted by the school. It's either on campus provided by the school or off campus and you're on your own. Some apartments are nice and expensive, other's are cheap and dingy. You pay for you get and neighborhood feels unsafe, so the closer the better."
College Junior,1,"Campus Police constantly patrol the library, but I have never seen them in the parking garages (where attacks are quite frequent).  On my first day of school I was lost and hit a button to gain help, and after waiting 20 minutes with no response I finally left.  There needs to be more presence in the parking garages because SJSU is known for its crimes in these areas."
College Senior,1,"I only had a meal plan for my first year here (was a 100 entries centinnal plan) and not only was it disgusting, but it was super greasy and unhealthy....I usually like to buy gold points which allows you to eat at the student union and other eating places on campus except the dining commons. I dunno if they are changing things in there, but I hope they do. Another reason why I gave it a bad grade because it was super expensive. Mine was the 2nd to the cheapest and it was about $500...I saved a lot of money by buying my own groceries and cooking myself. I think if you were to pay for a one time entry it's about $10...IMO that value of those meals were worth no more than $5..."
College Sophomore,1,"The process of getting into my Occupational Therapy major was very difficult. After transferring to San Jose State, there are new sets of requirements to get into this program. It was a lengthy process too."
Recent Alumnus,1,"SJSU students who wish to live off campus have to find a place on their own.  Luckily there are many apartments and houses off campus, but SJSU does not help with that."
College Sophomore,1,"San Jose is a large and sprawling city with limited nightlife, few extracurricular activities, and poor public transit. It's hard to get around as the city is so sprawled and nightlife, especially in the downtown area, can be fairly sketchy. The police are very strict on enforcing drunk in public ordinances and choices are limited. Good local music is also sparse."
College Senior,1,Too Much Theft – There are way too many robberies on or around campus
College Sophomore,1,TOO MUCH MONEY – its way too expensive to park and there are too many rules
College Student,1,"The parking here at SJSU is not the best. Since we are located in Downtown San Jose, then it is very difficult in competing for parking with the locals and commuting students. Although, there is parking structures, they are a little pricey, especially for a parking permit.If you find a parking, let's hope that you make your time well spent."
College Junior,1,"Safety in our school is poor. The only police officers you see in school are at the parking lots giving tickets to students. There seems to be only two of them and sometimes you can't find them when you most need them. For example, there was a student and her friend shot at the parking lot. Where were the police officers? Not only that but there has been a lot of sexual harassment reported to police within school boundaries. If that was not enough, students have been robbed by strangers when walking around school at night."
College Junior,1,"Unfortunately, students at SJSU have no spirit for their school. Athletics are the only ones with spirit and I would have to say it's only 10% of them. Even our school staff seem like they don't a passion for their teams that represent them in state or out of state. I have only seen one banner in our school that was supporting our basketball team saying ""Go Spartans!"" I have not seen or heard students around campus saying how much they love their school."

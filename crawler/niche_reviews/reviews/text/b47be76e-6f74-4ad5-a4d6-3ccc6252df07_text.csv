Freshman,5,"Online experience is excellent , I believe that with covid-19 being a problem for college that my university is taking the proper step to ensure that we a students have a successful semester at are university . The faculty are always there to support in there time of need because they were once students as well and they know how hard college can be for there students and they just want them to succeed in life after college"
Freshman,5,"My overall experience at my university is great , I like my school very much it , the university gives you a since of love because they know how stressful college can be and they are always there to help in any way . Saint Francis University is what you make it to be it a loving community that values it's scholars education very well. From the administration all the way down to the professors value each and every student with respect and love because the school as a whole just want to so you as great students to achieve anything they want in life because they know as a student that we can achieve anything we put are mind to ."
Freshman,5,"The staff is very welcoming. My first day on campus I was nervous but the teachers, facility and upper class man made my experience less nerve wracking. They ensure your education is the number one priority. They also have multiple activities to keep students busy."
Freshman,5,I have not taken online classes but the advisor is great when it comes to deciding which type of classes are right for you and your classes.  They take the time to go over the pros/cons for your major. The zoom orientation was easy to use and the professors answered all questions.
Freshman,5,Saint Francis Staff has been so helpful and nice. They have answered all of my questions and made the application process easy. The advisors have worked around my current work schedule and made me feel like a part of their Saint Francis Family.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year of college here, and even though it was scary at first being in a new and open place, I have grown to love it. Education can be a little rough, but it is college. The staff is very polite and the students who attended are also very nice. The tools you get for attending the college as well like tutoring, are very useful when struggling with classes. You also get help with any technical issues, and any problems with money, the financial office is there to help you along the way. Professors go out of their way to see their students succeed, and the atmosphere of the college is very pleasant. The food as well is very wonderful and I most certainly am happy that I picked this smaller college than one of the bigger ones. The smaller class sizes make it easy to understand what is happening in the class, and everyone is there to help!"
Sophomore,5,"The online experience when switching over to classes online for COVID-19 was a little weird at first. Then, professors started to figure out what was best for them to relay information to their students, and it became much easier. I believe one of the reasons I did really well with the online is that, sometimes, while sitting in the class you can become very distracted. When I was doing online, I had to listen and take notes carefully, whether that was through youtube or online classes. The only issue I really had was that internet service was a little interrupted at points and sometimes the quality of videos was not well, but I adapted and overcame. I enjoyed the experience, but missed the meeting with friends for food and just having the professors in-class experience."
Sophomore,5,I love how everyone is so friendly and greets you even if you don't know that particular person. Even though the campus may be small I like how close everything is and how easily you can get to places.
Junior,5,I really like Saint Francis because it is just a close-knit community. I have met some of my closest friends that will most likely span the test of time. You get to know your professors one on one and they know your name by at least the 3rd or 4th week of school and classes never exceed 30 people.
Alum,5,"Saint Francis University is a great school where everybody knows everybody, which for the most part is a good thing. The professors are great and really care to help students. While there isnt a lot to do on the weekends, most students find themselves occupied by being on a sports team or a part of Greek Life, both of which are great programs. Everyone at SFU honestly become your second family."
Niche User,5,The staff was very friendly and genuinely wanted the best for you. The students were just as friendly and were willing to answer all questions and wanted to share their experiences.
Graduate Student,5,"Former graduate student in Mathematics Education, which led to teaching opportunities at the secondary and post-secondary levels.  The teaching transitioned to the insurance industry and I am now an SVP.  The foundation gained at SFU was invaluable and the professors I had were treasured then, but never more than now.  Go Red Flash!"
Sophomore,5,"Saint Francis University was my first and only choice for college, and I made the best decision by choosing SFU. Everything about the university is perfect for me, especially the small class sizes and campus. The food is average, but the dining team has great plans for the future, starting next semester. I cannot wait to go back in a couple months because Saint Francis is my home."
Sophomore,5,"As I go onto my second year of Saint Francis University, I believe this school was the right choice. As a freshman student, I was astounded by how welcoming the other students were. As I walked around campus, every single person would smile. I also believe the education is excellent. I am a nursing major and Saint Francis University has a one hundred percent passing rate. The campus is a beautiful place and it is always kept clean. There are many opportunities for people who come in with their phenomenal athletic ability. The dorms are typical college dorms, not too big. Police are always driving around making sure that all students are safe. Overall, I would say that Saint Francis University is a great opportunity to become that someone. This is a place I would recommend to anyone starting college."
Freshman,5,"Amazing staff and a beautiful campus! The curriculum is challenging enough to keep me interested but not hard to understand. If having a difficult time, SFU offers many resources to students to help them."
Senior,5,"Saint Francis University is such a great school to attend. They have a lot of activities during  the week and on the weekends to try to give students a home away from home. They offer masses to attend so students can attend a church if they want to. We have a lot of Greek Life on campus, which I am a part of, that gives students a way to connect with others and to make friends. I would like to change the parking up here. It is really difficult for some students to walk in the snow or to their dorms. The lighting around campus is also kind of dim and could definitely be lighter."
Junior,5,"I have been a student at Saint Francis University for 2 years now, and I love everything about the school. Although the school is ""in the middle of nowhere"", the scenery is beautiful! No matter the weather, students are out and about. The professors and everyone else  that work at the University are nice and care about you and your education. The University offers students many opportunities to get involved.  This includes club sports, Greek life, clubs such as Best Buddies, Colleges Against Cancer, Habitat for Humanity, ect. Altogether, I have grown so much as a person since I started my education at Saint Francis Univeristy"
Freshman,5,Saint Francis University has a unique environment. The visitation days for students interested in attending the university are very helpful and it's nice to see that the professors remember you.
Alum,5,"I like to say if you go up some mountains, then go up some more mountains, you'll finally reach Saint Francis University. Being a small university in the middle of nowhere, the students become a tight-knit community who support each other. Whenever there are events, whether is be sport, art, music, etc., the student body shows up to support each other. I made some really good friends that I still communicate with and visit."
Junior,5,I love the environment of Saint Francis University. It's a small town college that reminds me a lot of home as I view this campus as my second home. The students and staff at this university want to see others around them succeed and work towards a better life. We are a tight knit community as a smaller campus everyone is aware of each other from everyday interactions. I love attending and hopefully will graduate from the college amongst the pines.
Freshman,5,"I love SFU. There are many opportunities to do things outside of the classroom. The classes are challenging, which I appreciate because it makes me think more."
Sophomore,5,"I love that Saint Francis University is a small school among the pines. The people and professors there really make sure you are not only prepared academically, but for being apart of the community."
Sophomore,5,"Saint Francis is a wonderfu, small university with great programs of study and Division 1 athletics."
Graduate Student,5,I am currently taking classes online for my Master's program. My current experience with Saint Francis has been wonderful.
Senior,5,I love this Univeristy. They have a wonderful staff who cares about the education of their students. The university I located in wonderful little town and the campus is beautiful and well maintained. They have a wonderful adult degree and continuting education program.
Junior,5,"I love saint Francis!!! If you want to be someone in this world saint Francis is a great start. Being a student athlete here is amazing, we receive a lot of support from the  students, and faculty. Saint Francis is a great place to continue your academic career, It is very challenging but with hard work, and dedication you will succeed I promise."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at Saint Francis and I can't wait to go back for my second year. Even though its a small campus, it is still a lot of fun. As long as you have friends the size of the school doesn't even become noticeable after a while. Everyone is so nice and the professors love being there. The sports are great also. If there's one thing I don't like about Saint Francis, it has to be the winter but I've learned to adapt."
Sophomore,5,"I love Saint Francis University. The school has professors who love helping students do their best. Many students have interviews or jobs lined up right after graduation. Student organizations host activities on the weekends for breaks from work. Saint Francis University is a Division I college but is small so the athletics are good and entertaining to watch. The dorms are small, but they are functional for the needs of a college student. The town has many opportunities for apartments that get rented to SFU students. The campus rarely has incidents regarding the police. Campus Police makes regular rounds around campus to keep students safe."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending SFU. Although it is in a small town with no a whole lot to do, SFU has things going on all the time."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy going to Saint Francis University.  When I visited it here for the first time, I immediately felt like I was at home and I was really comfortable walking through the campus.  The classes that they offer here are really good, too.  They have great resources that are free to use like tutoring, the writing center, and the laptop help desk."
Freshman,5,"In your first year, the student activities organization tries its best to make sure there are things to do every weekend, giving students an opportunity to go out and meet new people. As someone who may be homesick, it really helps. Bring back Gubbio!"
College Student,5,"The drinking scene is very low-key here. I have never seen anyone peer pressured into doing anything. The administration is very strict though with drugs and alcohol. We're a ""dry campus"" so even if you're 21 you can't have alcohol on you."
Senior,5,"Saint Francis University is a wonderful school with helpful professors, a beautiful campus, and a faith-based atmosphere.  Students at this school are very motivated and interested in their studies."
College Freshman,5,"Many students are in the health sciences programs so their career prospects are very high, but even students in other schools are often very successful in finding jobs soon after graduation because of the great preparation and education they received at SFU."
College Sophomore,5,this campus is very safe
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is welcoming, helpful, and friendly."
College Freshman,5,It is a safe place. Cops everywhere.
College Junior,5,Professors are always concerned about how well their students are doing in their classes.
College Junior,5,SFU students stand out on resumes and applications.
College Junior,5,The maintenance is very helpful and attentive to needs.
College Junior,5,Greek life is where a student finds their best friends and home away from home. Everyone is very welcoming but finding where you belong is the most important!
College Junior,5,"Everyone is like family here, the teachers are always there to help, and there are many activities to join and be part of."
College Sophomore,5,"The police will come pick you up if you do not feel safe. However, with the police patrolling almost all the time you never have that fear of losing your personal safety."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are very helpful.  They will help you not only during class, but also during their office hours."
College Sophomore,5,The school works very hard to help students find an internship/job as well as helping them make connects with others out in the word field that could possibly help them.
College Sophomore,5,The class size is small so you can obtain great one-on-one the professors.  Everyone is there to help you succeed.  Our healthcare majors are very well known to people across the country.  Great University to belong to!
College Student,5,College is such a nice way to learn who you are and how to take care of yourself.
College Sophomore,5,"It's awesome! Athletics are great, education is top quality, and it's fun!"
College Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful.  The dorm rooms are extremely small, but there are plenty of places to get out and study or hang out with friends.  There are tons of activities to involve just about everyone.  If you want to do anything off campus, you definitely need a car, because there are no malls, restaurants, or activities within walking distance."
College Junior,5,Loretto is in the middle of nowhere. There is one small pizza place off campus. They owners of that restaurant are amazing people.
College Junior,5,The policies are great. I feel 100% safe when I walk at night. Police are nice and friendly. Staff are excellent. Great place and atmosphere.
College Junior,5,"The staff are great and intent on serving their best food. I once had cheesy bread sticks that was made poorly. The staff make sure that I wasn't forgotten and made a new batch right away. Frankies is great, lots of food choices, always fresh. Torvian has the best cafeteria food I have ever eaten. Always fresh and always something to eat."
College Junior,5,"It became my second home because of the family atmosphere it portrays. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would. Everyone is guaranteed a dorm during their undergraduate program/degree which is unheard of. Dorms are average size."
College Student,5,if you get bored with the campus food which you should'nt there's always off campus dining and you can dine out  or pick up your favorites
College Student,5,If anything is needed they will help you. if you will work hard to pay it off they will work with you so you can be flexible when paying
College Student,5,So much to choose from and the different varieties are so overwhelming to ones eye which craves everyones hunger.
College Student,5,I would say that overall this school is a great one. It has a nice spacious campus with many different activities to do around the campus. The whole place gives off a good friendly vibe and makes you feel at home.
College Freshman,5,RA's are cool and don't care as much. Bathrooms are always cleaned by our cleaning ladies daily. Just wish the dorms had more space to them.
College Sophomore,5,"its a great school but it is very, very demanding academically. They have a very high bar and getting A's is extremely difficult"
College Sophomore,5,the university finds our internships for us--they review them and do a great job
Senior,4,"For the most part, this campus is amazing. The people are friendly, be it students, professors, or other staff. There is always things going on to keep you busy, but they are not always the most interesting. The Health Sciences are awesome here, however, those of us in other programs sometimes get shafted in favor of them."
Senior,4,I have taken many online classes and each one has been different. It really depends on the teacher but most are very clearly set up and you can still get in touch with the professor if need be.
Senior,4,Saint Francis University is a small school. The professors care about the students and since it is a small school you get more help and a higher quality learning experience.
Freshman,4,My online learning experience has been very good with Saint Francis University. They have ensured I completely understand the material that is handed to me. Also the professors use not only one but many different learning visuals. The diversity in learning techniques have allowed me to really engage in the learning and grasp what is being thrown at me. In addition they have answered all question through email with quick responses.
Junior,4,"Professors did everything they possibly could to help us succeed. While it was a drastic change, I feel that our professors did the best they could with what they were given."
Alum,4,I like the closeness of the community and the one-on-one attention from the faculty. Your professors really get to know you and help you become a better person. There are so many opportunities there for studying a new language and studying abroad. The community is sort of diverse but they are still working out their own kinks like parking and housing.
Sophomore,4,"Saint Francis University is located in a beautiful area. It's a small college and it can seem boring at first glance, but it is actually really fun if you are not close minded. There's things to do on campus like sports and clubs. The health care majors all have great programs. The professors are helpful and know you with the small class sizes."
Freshman,4,"Saint Francis University is a small school with small class sizes. If you like being in a rural area, this could be the school for you. Most professors make an effort to learn your name and get to know you. SFU has a great reputation for health professions."
Junior,4,Very nice campus that offers many areas to create relationships with others while getting a quality education.
Senior,4,"I love the various extra-curricular activities that Saint Francis offers, including Greek life and athletics. The small community builds familial relations among students and makes the campus feel like my second home. I would like to see more activities available to students on the weekends due to the school's remote location and lack of activities to do off of campus grounds. I hope for the campus to expand the number of places available in each program so more opportunities are available for students and the university to grow."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Francis University is a great school with even better people and professors on campus! The worst part about SFU is the snow and cold.  Other than that, I have no complaints!!"
Sophomore,4,"I feel that this school is very good to have a degree from and the academics are very good. If you do not have a car, it can get boring, but if you get involved on campus, you can keep busy and have fun. I made amazing friends and we find things to do and we have fun"
Sophomore,4,"This university has pushed me to become the best student I can be. The academics are challenging and engaging and they offer a wide array of majors and minors. However, I take a lot of courses that are very unrelated to my major."
Niche User,4,"I have visited Saint Francis several times over my high school career for FBLA Regionals, Science Day, and the Side-by-Side Pep Band Event.  Overall, it is a nice school."
Freshman,4,"I love the small school feel, along with the teachers who are willing to help you in any way they can. The school can feel kind of isolating sometimes since there isn't much around it."
Niche User,4,"I thought that it was pretty good campus, the atmosphere was nice, and the people there were nice. Although there were two drawbacks. The first was that freshman don't have A/C and they get a small living space. The second was it's basically in the middle of nowhere and there's not much to do. However, the university does try very hard to do fun activities."
Sophomore,4,I really love Saint Francis. I have had really amazing experiences with everyone on the campus. All of the faculty are friendly and caring. The professors are all approachable and flexible. I think the campus is beautiful as well. I really wish they would stop cutting down trees and removing so many of the bushes and shrubs around campus.
Junior,4,"I love the small, hometown feel of the campus. Also, the professors are fantastic here. I would like to see the dorms updated and the directors of Residence Life fired and new people brought in"
Freshman,4,"I like the people on campus, everyone is nice and easily approachable. I love the support and easy access to professors."
Junior,4,This will become your home away from home and the place you long to be. This hidden gem on the mountain top is a community like no other.
Sophomore,4,"Saint Francis was not my top choice, but I'm very glad I ended up deciding  to go there.  The class sizes are small, so there is a lot of one on one time with professors.  Also, the professors are extremely committed to helping you succeed and will work with you to make sure you are reaching your full potential.  The campus is very small and not around any bigger cities, but the school has activities almost every weekend to make sure students have something to do."
College Student,4,"We don't have huge ragers, but you can find a frat party a lot, those are fun or just drinking in your room with friends. Many people go to IUP to party or places off campus. You just have to know the right people."
College Student,4,"We're not a very diverse campus, but everyone is very accepting if someone is different than them."
College Student,4,"Professors are SO helpful! They all want you to succeed and learn. There are so many different course to take! and its' nice having really small class sizes, so unlike big schools you are not just another number to your teacher."
College Student,4,There are always job fairs going on in and around the campus. From what other students have told me most people graduate and find a job right away
College Student,4,There is never any crime on campus. Ever. I don't even know why the police are always around because nothing bad happens up here in the mountains. But I always feel safe walking back to my dorm at night. and if you don't you can call the police and they can escort you or talk to you on the phone until you arrive back at your dorm
College Student,4,"Obviously being in a dorm is not great. But the rooms aren't super tiny! it's a good amount of space. Also, the showers, at least in the girls dorms, are super nice each having their own changing station and door. The bathroom's are cleaned all the time and along with the rest of the dorm! everyone is super nice, and if you want to get to know more people in your dorm your RA's have an event each month to get together! There's no AC though, so bring a fan and you'll be fine."
College Student,4,"The Greek life here is not like other huge schools you hear about. Since we are a small school Greek Life is usually low-key, but everyone always knows about them because there are so many people on campus in Greek Life! It's not like other schools though. Here there is no hazing for rushing or huge frat parties. All the girls are super nice and the guys! I'd definitely recommend joining!"
College Student,4,"Seeing that half of the school is on a varsity team it's a huge part of campus life. Games aren't hugely attended, except for the homecoming football game, and basketball and volleyball are probably the most attended. But everyone is still very supportive of all the teams! Stokes is the ""athlete's gym"" which is super nice but DiSepio which is the gym for everyone to use is also very modern and great to use!"
College Student,4,"This school is great! There are always so many things going on around campus, and if you ever get bored of that you can easily find a friend who has a car to take you out to Altoona or Ebensburg! Everyone knows everyone so it's kinda nice seeing friendly faces everywhere you go. I would definitely recommend SFU if you're looking for a small home-feeling campus."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are small, which I really enjoy because you get to know your peers and the professor pretty well and it makes it easier to hold discussions and get the most out of the courses."
College Freshman,4,Saint Francis is a very safe school and the police work hard to make students feel safe and prevent unsafe situations
College Freshman,4,About 1/3 of students are involved in Greek life but it is very easy to get into one sorority or another if you are a decent person.
College Freshman,4,"Saint Francis is an awesome school with a great atmosphere with professors who really care about their students' success. Students are expected to work hard and put in their share of effort, but professors are happy to help students when they need extra help."
College Sophomore,4,i know first hand that the athletics at this school are great because I am a varsity athlete.
College Sophomore,4,the education is great but the school is very expensive.
College Freshman,4,The school works to promote the best opportunities for the students.
College Freshman,4,The athletic program is well known and has a good reputation.
College Student,4,I like it so far.
College Student,4,I live in a dorm. Its not bad.
College Junior,4,Everyone has very high school spirit and all of the sports facilities are up to date as well as the team's equipment.
College Sophomore,4,We have many options to choose from.
College Junior,4,"Admission, and questions were answered in a very good and timely manner. I never felt like I was being a pain, and feel that I could always any question I may have."
College Freshman,4,Saint Francis is a small school which I like because you have smaller class sizes and get to meet people easier I think. It is harder than some other schools and more strict but it is overall a good school!
College Senior,4,I love all of my friends that I made here.
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus. Police make you download an app, (Rave) and you can press that button if you are in danger/uncomfortable, and they will come to you."
College Freshman,4,"The greek life wants you to join their chapter, and they host a lot of events on campus."
College Freshman,4,"St. Francis is a D1 school, so there are lots of people that play sports from around the country and even from different countries."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had any trouble with campus police. Sometimes they are in the dorms at night to make sure everything is okay. If you have a leg injury they drive you to class, and if you are scared/uncomfortable, you can call them and they will walk you back to your dorm."
College Junior,4,Lots of off campus apartments. All are close to school.
College Junior,4,"The financial aid is great. I had to attend another year because of changing majors and my scholarships were extended for that additional year. The school is expensive, but the education is worth it."
College Junior,4,The parties are safe and fun. DJ is always loud and has the most current songs.
College Student,4,this keeps things interesting and lets you have fun outside the school life and workplace
College Student,4,Everything is in walking distance and very reliable.
College Student,4,This place has great parties with a positive environment and responsible students that do not do the wrong thing .
College Junior,4,Just do well in your classes and ask your adviser to nominate you for any departmental scholarships.  I got a $3800 scholarship because I do well and was nominated.  Try to apply for a departmental fellowship as soon as you know you are enrolling.  My math fellowship is $2000 a year for all four years.
College Junior,4,"Plenty of attractive people here.  I think it's because of the high percentage of athletes.  Many people dress nice and others dress to the weather, which is always cold."
College Freshman,4,Division 1 athletics but attendance is low. Will win some big games on any teams schedule but not many championships.
College Freshman,4,Frats throw a lot of parties and hold dances for the school.
College Freshman,4,"Close to all your classes, and the freedom is the best."
Sophomore,2,"Due to Covid 19, the rest of my freshman spring semester was online. I hated online classes because some professors were not good at transitioning to online and others were hard to reach through email."
Freshman,2,"I like how the campus is small and my class sizes are small. The professors know your name which is nice, but the food is terrible and campus is very boring. There nothing to do on the weekends, there are very little parties here. I also live 4 hours from here with no car, but most students live close by and go home on the weekends. This leaves me and little other students here on weekends so I spend most of the time in my dorm alone. There is nothing to do in the surrounding town, and very little fun activities on campus. I know a lot of students that transferred out or plan to."
Sophomore,2,SFU has a beautiful campus and great facilities. Many of the faculty members were very impatient and unhelpful. I felt that the university treated me like a number rather than caring for me as an individual. It is a small university and the professor to student ratio is small so the students have access to their professors.
College Sophomore,2,they are community style dorms and the bathrooms are sometimes messy.
College Senior,2,It could always be better.
College Freshman,2,Smells weird and very small.
College Freshman,2,There are never enough seats open in some of the classes. It is very aggravating.
College Junior,2,Financial aid dept. is very slow.
College Freshman,2,The gym open to the general student body is very subpar. Very little space to move. You almost always have to wait to use the bench and olympic bars.
College Freshman,2,Most parties are very low-key. Joining Greek life is a must if you want to party. Campus PD is quick to close down large parties.
College Freshman,2,"Decent food is limited to the days that tours are scheduled. Other than days for visitors, the meals at Torvian are very low quality."
College Junior,2,It's a small boring town on the top of a mountain.  I would never live here.  It's too cold even though it has some nice nature and environmental scenery.
College Junior,2,"The police are way too uptight about things here.  My friends were of age 22 and 23 at the time when they got stopped on the side of the road on a Saturday night.  They were on their way to the bar and had not drank yet.  The officer questioned them and asked to see IDs and even called another officer down, and she breathalized them.  They were fine.  Also, they were over 21, so they did nothing wrong.  The whole situation was ludicrous.  The job of the police is to protect and serve.  They should prevent people from drunk driving, not drinking when you are 21.  The more they crack down on people, the more students want to drink and break rules.  They should realize that students are going to drink, and no amount of obscure strictness will prevent that.  I just wish they were here to help us."
College Junior,2,"These dorms are absolutely awful compared to any other school I have seen.  Most students live in a 14x10ft room with a roommate.  It is doable but inconvenient.  There is one very nice dorm on campus and when I was able to switch to it by my JUNIOR year, it was like heaven.  However, even this dorm is just average compared to others I have seen.  It is ridiculous the way the school works.  There are barely any options for apartments, therefore most students have to live in dorms all four years.  It is hard to even be eligible for an apartment until your junior year.  The worst part of it all is that they do not let you live off campus, because if you do, you lose some of your scholarships.  The only thing I am taking away from this experience here is that I will be so grateful of whatever I live in after school."
College Student,2,We have to live on campus or in apartments that the school rents.
College Freshman,2,You have to drive anywhere away from Loretto. Cresson and Ebensburg are closer places to go and a lot of people will make the 20 min. drive to Altoona to have fun.
College Sophomore,2,They try to help you but the school to way to much for average people.
College Freshman,2,"limited on the places to eat. Saint Francis offers flex bucks, and if you have grants or va paying your bills they can tack it on to your bill, but offer you run out before the end of the semester, you got to pay out of pocket which i dislike"
College Freshman,2,only a few selections on campus. gets pretty boring quickly
College Freshman,2,"not a whole lot of big parties or clubs unless you travel 30 mins. I know academics are important, but if you want to cut lose no real good parties are here"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Seeing as how campus us located in western Pennsylvania and the school year runs from late August to early May, it snows roughly five out of the nine months of the school year.  However, when the weather turns nice, everyone can be found outside enjoying the nice weather."
College Freshman,2,I fell that this school needs to address the drug scene more in depth and work harder at curbing drug abuse.
College Senior,2,"The campus police are strict, especially with alcohol and parties.  But it's really dissapointing to me as a white female to see the laxity given to the africian american males/athletes.  I have been in multiple dorms doing service work for the school in which the residents were smoking pot and nothing was done about it.  In my opinion, the police are unfairly strict."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life does not have many houses here so unless a member rents a house they do not have their own parties. A lot of people are in Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"The campus can be pretty strict at times but overall it is not bad. They do not allow toy weapons and are pretty strict about alcohol but other than that they can be lenient and just want kids to have fun but in a safe, and appropriate way."
College Senior,2,"The only bar in Loretto is the Loretto Pub and Grill or LPG. It's a really great bar with great service, but their drinks are more on the expensive side except for drafts, and it can get crowded very quickly. There is a bus to The Castle in Ebensburg on Thursdays, but those are the only options you have if you don't have a car or a friend with a car."
College Senior,2,"Underage drinking is quite rampant at SFU, despite it being a ""dry"" campus. Since we are basically in the middle of nowhere, many students feel it is the only way to have fun on campus. Drugs are not particularly common, and are extremely rare on campus itself. It is more common to find such things in the apartments in Loretto, but still not extremely common. Alcohol is definitely the biggest offender."
College Senior,2,"Not only is parking on campus quite expensive (close to $100 I think), it's also considerably limited. Spaces fill up fast each morning, and I often hear of commuters complaining about not having enough spaces. It seems to be a struggle, especially in the fall, for the university to figure out the best parking situation for all the students who have cars."
College Freshman,2,"There were many times when me and my friends would have to park in the grass because there was not enough parking spot. Also, they would give out parking tickets for the dumbest reasons!"
College Student,2,"Golden Silence – Although one would expect a college campus to be bustling with activities, it is dead quiet here at Saint Francis. There are few outside activities offered at night and the partiers tend to stay away since it is a dry campus. Once it hits midnight, the boredom begins."
College Junior,2,"Few, Not Many – While the college itself is located in a very backwoods area, there are some ethnic groups. There are roughly 30 international students who hail from all parts of the world. Other than this group, the most ""ethnic"" group that we have are from Baltimore."
College Sophomore,2,very little life outside of campus unless you want to drive to altoona. all in all incredibly boring. basically the only fun comes from weekly trips to walmart haha
Recent Alumnus,2,can go from 99 to 70 degrees within two days...school is either too hot or too cold and slippery when icy because they don't salt enough
College Freshman,2,Well i have been trying to go help since June and it is now November and now they are not helping as much. They where doing alright till now.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough parking on campus, and it is inconvenient. Therefore, tickets are given out regularly."
College Senior,2,"The dorms aren't too bad. The selection of RAs makes me wonder what they want in RAs. The facilities for laundry and bathrooms are all well kept, and most people are respectful in the dorms of keeping quiet hours. Cost is a bit much in my opinion. The housing process was terrible this past year, but hopefully will be improved upon."
College Junior,2,"Eighty bucks is WAY too much to park, I don't care how much the security cameras cost. Not everyone who goes to this school is rich."
College Senior,2,"More of a Hassle – While the price of parking on campus may seem pretty high to our students, it's much cheaper than most schools. The fines for illegal parking or parking violations, though, (which you WILL get if you break the rules, even once) are ridiculous. The availability of on-campus parking isn't very great. Unless you're looking to drive at least 10 minutes to get to a different town for shopping, dining, etc, it's not necessary to have a car on campus. On the weekends, everyone just walks wherever they're going. I think it's more of a hassle than anything to have a car on campus."
College Junior,2,"Cars Are Best Option – The best option is by car, and even then, it is not feasible to drive across campus because there are no empty parking spaces except in JFK (which is the farthest lot from almost everything). There are a few shuttles running to the stores nearby, and you can schedule shuttles to the train station to get home for breaks, but it is not always reliable."
College Junior,2,"Fun Campus, but Nothing to Do in Town! The campus is really fun, but there is only one bar, one place to eat, one school, and that's about it in the town of Loretto! There is nothing really to do in the town at all. It would be nice if there was more to do!"
Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately, a small, rural, conservative university inhibits much of the culture, diversity, and opportunity I had dreamt of for my college experience. 
Institutional debt has inflicted great damage on all areas of the university, especially that of the fine arts department which now approaches eradication. Geographical isolation causes difficulty with off campus activities like medical shadowing and community volunteering, both of which are crucial to my degree and humanitarian ambitions. I also struggle to cope with a similar isolation on campus. Though its tranquil silence and scenic pines cast a unique peace across campus, people and sociability are scarce. This lack of human interaction has proven most detrimental to myself. As expected of a small modest school, research opportunities and academic resources are not easily obtainable. I have learned that advanced education beyond memorization is not conventional; it cannot be expected at every school."
Junior,1,"Terrible administration.
1. They favor athletes. No-open-flame policy ex: Classmate got a candle for her birthday, left it STILL WRAPPED + UNUSED in her desk drawer to take home. Res life found it during inspections and made her do 10 hrs of community service.  No alcohol policy ex: Soccer team throws a party, gets busted, gets let off. 
2. This week it's been below 10 deg and we still had classes. SFU ran out of crutches with so many people slipping on ice. 
3. Student health center misdiagnosed/gave me improper treatment 5 times.
4. They ping-pong whose responsibility it is to address your situation. I've experienced it with transferring community college creds, scheduling events, and proposing programming to help students (got bounced around so much I never finished it). 
5. Good things about this place: secluded, small, most professors are great. I'm a Junior; would transfer if I could, but no other school has my major and transferring would prevent me from graduating on time."
Junior,1,"The school has terrible food, no fun activities to participate in on the weekends. It is really hard to get funded for research. The administration only cares about money, but has no consideration for the students. "
College Senior,1,There are limited courses with a limited amount of space and the professors are not helpful.
College Senior,1,The dorms are probably the worst part about living on campus.
College Senior,1,"I don't feel comfortable at this school, it is not a positive environment. I am transferring next semester."
College Freshman,1,I've recently taken up petroleum engineering at this school and I hate it. The engineering department is awful. So many of the teachers here are under qualified. A physics lab teacher was teaching physics after taking Calculus 3 the semester before. This education system is terrible.
College Senior,1,"If I had the chance to do it again, I WON'T"
College Senior,1,It's a hit or miss. Mostly miss.
College Senior,1,About 40% of incoming freshman play a sport and about 25% of them transfer because they are manipulated by scholarship money they were suppose to receive. Most students come in ineligible but the university doesn't tell them until they are already enrolled here. Which puts them in a stuck position until they transfer. Not only that trying to get a release might be the hardest thing because the school is worried about their retention rate rather than worrying if the student is happy or not.
College Senior,1,Overall this might be the worse university in western PA. The school is very money hungry and doesn't care about students who aren't athletes. They are too consumed on how they are viewed by others that don't attend the school. Rather than focus on their students her on campus. It is very expensive and isn't worth the student debt. They will find a way to make you fail rather than help you succeed. It's a very small campus with a student to faculty of 1:15 yet students are still unnoticed. If you are in need of help they just push you along to the next person. The only thing good about it is that you can go home over break and take a breather from this place.
College Freshman,1,No quality off-campus dining in the town of Loretto. A car is needed to go anywhere decent. Closest good food is thirty minutes away in Altoona.
College Junior,1,"There is nothing by our school in terms of off-campus dining.  There is a pizza shop called MVP but the hours are bad and they don't stay open very late.  There is also a bar called LPG but people under 21 are obviously not allowed in after a certain time.  Other than that, there NOWHERE to eat by our school.  The closest places are a 10 minute car ride away (Sheetz, McDonald's).  This is bad for a few reasons:  first, students are upset because we don't have any options.  Second, we don't have the option of spending money at a restaurant, therefore, we are not stimulating the local economy enough.  Lastly, it is dangerous to not have any food options on campus because that increasing chances of drunk driving.  I have seen people I know get into cars with a driver that had drank, just because they want food that badly, and have no where to go besides a 10 minute drive to Sheetz or McDonald's.  This is dangerous and was even proposed to the school, and the best thing they could come up with is a litte glass box filled with food that is open 24/7.  Students don't want that.  We want a Sheetz, McDonald's, TacoBell, Wendy's, or anything that will stay open late and serve decent food, not plastic wrapped stuff out of a box."
College Sophomore,1,Everything is easy and anyone can get into one. There is also no housing for them.
College Sophomore,1,There is really nothing every going on. Everyone leaves for the weekends for traveling on sports and people going to party at other colleges
College Junior,1,Only to do is go to the bar outside of campus. Everybody is not 21
College Sophomore,1,There is always drug and alcohol use if you look for it hard enough.  The campus police really crack down and community service is the usual punishment.
College Sophomore,1,"There is only one bar within walking distance. Since there is very low crime, campus police really crack down on alcohol regulations."
College Junior,1,Worst food I've ever eaten. I waste so much money driving to altoona to get food.
College Junior,1,There are many people at SFU who have different backgrounds and religions. Most people here are white but we have a lot of different races and ethnicities.

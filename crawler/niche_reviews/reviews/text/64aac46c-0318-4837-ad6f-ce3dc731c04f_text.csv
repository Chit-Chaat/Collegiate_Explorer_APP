Graduate Student,5,My online experience with Clark this semester has been amazing. I found that the professor Are very flexible and willing to give you extra time to understand the material as working from home means less connections with peers to go through materials.
Graduate Student,5,"I love Clark University because it fosters relationships with the community. We have multiple organization from Worcester come in during the semester so we can have access to sign up or learn about their community work. As a public health student, I find this such an amazing opportunity for career prospects."
Freshman,5,The professors have prepared well for their online classes and are committed to keeping Clark healthy and safe this fall.
Junior,5,I love everything about Clark.  Everyone is nice and welcoming.  The professors are great and easy to reach.  I will be a junior and have found it easy to get assistance with everything.
Senior,5,Clark University cares about their students. Small student body and class sizes allow for students to know their professors and get the help that they need to succeed.
Freshman,5,"Great small University with big picture in mind.  Proffesors are close with students.  They care about students' current classes and their future as proffesionals. Academically, it's a daily challenge that is preparing the future generations of decision makers.  Degrees offered really give students a well rounded perspective in their fields.  
Great for student-athletes.   Well balanced programs.   
The campus has a lot of programs to get involved with the community. Teaches students to give their time for good causes."
Freshman,5,"I am an upcoming freshman at Clark University and even before stepping on campus to start classes and live the college life, the Clark community is making me feel very welcome"
Freshman,5,The academics are good and they really are generous with scholarships and grants. The atmosphere is welcoming and very nice
Sophomore,5,Clark University is one of my happy places.  All of my courses are fantastic and they help me expand my mind and further my understanding and knowledge of the topics covered in the courses that I am taking each and every semester. I have a lot of opportunities outside of the classroom to make lots of friends with similar interests and just make a lot of fun new memories that I don't think I would have been able to make anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"Absolutely love my experience at Clark! Everyone here is unique and different in their own way and clearly has a passion for learning. Despite it being a small school, it still feels big because of the community we have with roughly around 3000 students altogether. Everyone is sweet and there’s all sorts of ways to get involved and be part of the school! The food is also amazing in the dining hall. If you are looking into psychology, the program for that here is honestly remarkable. I’m a business major however and the resources Clark has given me are truly helpful."
Alum,5,"I adored Clark University! My experience was super unique in that I was a science major who studied abroad and I was involved on campus. As a woman of color I was met with a community of professionals who always wanted to help make my experience better which is rare in higher education. The student body was eccentric, dynamic and nuanced in many ways. Clark's academics are rigorous but there is so much available in the way of help that there is no excuse to not be successful. Clark is not a school for someone who lives their life within the box. Its for the person who is passionate, creative and colors a little outside of the lines. I wouldn't not have had it any other way. It was a great fit for me and I met some of the most amazing people who are still some of my closest friends."
Niche User,5,"Very welcoming and friendly campus.  Everyone is nice and inclusive.  No one sits alone...Beautiful campus, nice dorms, great food and lots to do.  Easy to get the courses you want and professors are generally really good."
Junior,5,The small school environment gives students excellent access to research opportunities and professors.
Sophomore,5,"Clark University is a place like no other. The professors are amazing and so willing to form relationships with students. The campus culture is unparalleled, we're quirky and fun and motivated."
Sophomore,5,"Clark University is a small institution in the heart of MA. It is a liberal arts college with strong programs in biochemistry, psychology and environmental science. It is very diverse, with 20% of the student population being international. This makes you learn more about the world and grow as a more complete person. My experience at Clark has been great so far!"
Freshman,5,"Many of us would like to believe that we practice our profession with a lot of evidence. Our belief stems from the act of having read and planned for treatment planning seminars as students. As we read the papers we rarely, if ever ask – what paper is this? An opinion, a bench study or what? Can you identify the dogmas we practice in dentistry? There are many. After we graduate from dental schools, nearly all of us have little access to the library of information housed within universities. Most of us depend on accessing the internet for information. What your dental education must have done for you, to prepare you for your craft, must have been also to teach you how to recognise which practices are dogma and which are scientifically validated. It would have taught you to discern the nuanced statements made in guidelines to dental practice as well as to discern which articles are about ideas that are not yet validated."
Junior,5,"As the commercialization of American higher education accelerates, more and more students are coming to college with the narrow aim of obtaining a preprofessional credential. The traditional four-year college experience--an exploratory time for students to discover their passions and test ideas and values with the help of teachers and peers--is in danger of becoming a thing of the past."
Freshman,5,"Midnight Bagel Brunch. Nuff said. It’s an amazing place. 




Midnight Bagel Brunch is literally worth the whole tuition."
Freshman,5,"Since its founding in 1887, the University has produced alumni who boast notable individual achievements, yet who also changed the game for everyone by fashioning new approaches in science, business, literature and the arts. As Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie '73 told a 2013 reunion audience, ""At Clark, it wasn't just a professor determining what the paradigms of the moment were. I didn't want to hear the paradigms as they existed; a lot of us wanted to hear the paradigms of what could be. That notion infused me with energy to go after things that others would say were conventionally unrealistic."""
Senior,5,"I am a señor at Clark University, and I can't imagine going to any other college. There are many clubs and groups that pertain to all different interests. The university provides excellent resources and opportunities to engage with the surrounding urban community outside of campus, contributing to a more enriching learning experience that is also beneficial to the city."
Junior,5,"Clark is a really great school like any other and your experience is really what you make of it. Don't beat yourself up trying to get accepted, though, because I'm sure you can have an equally great experience at another college that may be a better fit for you. Good luck in the college search process!"
Alum,5,"Clark is a place where students are encouraged to pursue their interests, with just the right amount of mentoring and guidance.  There is no shortage of rich cultural experience to be had in Worcester, and there is something for everyone."
Sophomore,5,"I've really enjoyed my time at Clark so far.  I've had some professors I've really liked, I've found some good friends, and although it's expensive I'm holding out for the free fifth year."
Freshman,5,It's a great place to go for a great education. The community is very accepting and welcoming. Professors are generally top-class and are passionate in the subject they're teaching. They offer various opportunities depending on your major and assistance when pursuing internships.
Alum,5,"I loved Clark! I found my education to be excellent and the professors were very knowledgeable. The diversity of classes is unmatched and I was able to have deep discussions with classmates on a regular basis regarding race, religion, poverty, global issues, and the like. I would go back to Clark in a heartbeat and encourage others who are looking for a quality education alongside an incredible experience, to go to Clark."
Sophomore,5,"Clark is a beautiful campus with amazing professors and academics. The professors are easy to reach and always open to talk. Clark offers a very open and accepting community that encourages social and political involvement. There are many opportunities to volunteer in the surrounding city and clubs for all interests. Clark is also a very small campus, perfect for people who do not like to walk very far and someone who enjoys a close knit community. Clark may be located in a city commonly referred to as dangerous but I have never felt unsafe during my time here and University Police takes their job very seriously. The only downside to Clark is the poor food selection and some dorm halls are somewhat outdated. Overall, Clark is one of the best universities in New England."
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Clark. It was such an inclusive environment that helped broaden my horizons and introduced me to so many amazing people and experiences.
Junior,5,"I am a rising junior at Clark University, and I can't imagine going to any other college. There are many clubs and groups that pertain to all different interests. The university provides excellent resources and opportunities to engage with the surrounding urban community outside of campus, contributing to a more enriching learning experience that is also beneficial to the city."
Freshman,5,"Clark University has lots of opportunities for science majors and various great 5th year tuition-free programs. There is also  Spree Day, which is very liked by the students."
Junior,5,It is a great school that will challenge you and introduce you to the most incredible people. The neighborhood and surrounding community will become your home.
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience so far at Clark. The professors are fully engaged in teaching and want to see their students succeed. Outside of the classroom there are a multitude of activities and opportunities for student involvement on and off campus. The school promotes community involvement and truely tries to integrate the students into the Main South area.
College Freshman,5,Academics here are great. They are challenging and the workload is a lot but also manageable. You learn a lot in your classes and the professors definitely want you to succeed
College Freshman,5,there are so many different people here and everyone is accepting
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone at Clark is very inviting, open minded, and ready to challenge convention to change the world for the better!"
College Student,5,Campus is very safe and UP makes sure of it.
College Student,5,"Housing here is nice, especially freshman housing and junior/senior housing. A lot of options too"
College Freshman,5,Ensure that health and safety is always a priority
College Freshman,5,Very passionate about letting students express
College Sophomore,5,I am so glad I chose Clark. I love my classes and I have great friends.
College Sophomore,5,"Clark is awesome! The classes are eclectic and interesting, the professors are engaging, and the students are awesome and diverse."
College Freshman,5,"I literally love Clark University in terms of the atmosphere. I've made so many friends; I have like 20 at this point which is way more than I expected but I love each one of them. My physics, computer science, and chemistry professors are really good, except for my honors calculus teacher. I'm still getting used to his way of teaching.

I also love the cafeteria here because they are feeding us really well. The food they serve here is really good. Sometimes they have like pasta night or Chinese food brunch. Also the employers are really nice. There is this one man named Tony, and everyone loves him because he is the friendliest and most lovely out of all the cafeteria employers. One thing thing that I love is that they serve pizza everyday so if there is a day that nothing looks appealing.....I can always count in the delicious pizza. The other day I tried shrimp pizza and pizza on a bagel. It was very delicious.

Other things I love are were I live, the library, and the athletic center. I am having a wonderful experience at Clark and I'm really glad I picked this University. I would honestly pick this university all over again if given the chance. :)"
College Junior,5,"Clark has changed me for the better. I am more conscious of the world around me and want to make a difference. The community of ""Clarkies"" is unlike any other. Clark changes to fit you and not the other way around. I have never seen a more accepting place."
College Freshman,5,"Classes are perfect sizes, staff is helpful!"
College Junior,5,Clark is exactly the right place for me
College Student,5,There are so many great places to eat in Worcester!
College Student,5,"Students are very serious about school, but they also know how to have fun and be safe when the time comes for that."
College Student,5,"The rooms are spacious and for the most part don't have that ""prison cell feel""."
College Sophomore,5,I'm independent but still super close to classes.
College Freshman,5,"Without the scholarships I would not be able to afford to go here! Financial aid made it easy, they answered any and all questions, and worked well with my family."
College Freshman,5,"No matter your major, you can find opportunities that suit your specific interests."
College Freshman,5,I couldn't ask for a better school.
College Freshman,5,"You can find just about all kinds of people here. There are students of all races, religions, ethnicities, and national origins. The only non-diverse area is political affiliation. Republicans may be disappointed, especially socially conservative ones."
College Freshman,5,"People think the best programs at Clark are psych and geography, but there are very few ""bad"" programs at Clark."
College Freshman,5,There are tons of great classes here. They make it easy to get a well-rounded education while enjoying all of your classes.
College Freshman,5,"I have so many great friends and it's only the beginning of my second semester. The students are funny, kind, accepting, and AWESOME!"
College Freshman,5,The housing is awesome. Halls are conveniently located and the common room is great for socializing.
College Freshman,5,"I have had some amazing professors so far. Also some small lasses where you can voice your opinion and actually participate. Please consider the horrible amount of money you and/or your parents are spending (without scholarships) for college and really THINK about what is most important, academics or football games. Please dear god understand that you should seek small classes and small universities where you can get personal attention and where you can voice your opinion. Are you going to college to get wasted at football games or get an education. Geez"
College Freshman,5,IT'S THE BEST BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY! WOOOO
College Freshman,5,"I am in a particular dorm that has spacious rooms and nice brick walls, and rugs. There's a kitchen nearby which is nice. I am very happy actually about it. Not really complaining about it. I mean for the cost of education in general the housing should be better still, but comparatively to other universities I've seen it is very nice. Perks of going to a small school, kids. Learn now."
College Freshman,5,I'm having a great time in college. Classes are well sized and challenging enough to be effective but not discouraging. I have a great and rapidly growing group of friends and have a genuinely good time everyday.
Sophomore,4,"Good school, bad location- there is not much for students to do in the area. The school is a bit expensive for what it is. Students are diverse and intelligent."
Freshman,4,Wonderful people and a beautiful campus. You are surrounded by a diverse community and you become apart of the Worcester area.
Sophomore,4,"With COVID raging the country, I had to take all of my Spring 2020 courses online and 2 of them for the fall 2020 semester.  The professors adapted quiet well to the change and I feel like the professors I had were about to sympathize with us, as they were going through the pandemic alongside us."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, coming to Clark was an excellent decision for me. I love that I have many opportunities to perform research with affiliated faculty and get to know my professors due to the small class sizes. I feel like I matter here and that professors know me in comparison to a state school that has over 200+ people in a course. I feel like I fit in here and that being diverse is absolutely welcomed here. I feel like we need more diversity though, since we are heavily majority White with a glimmer of POC.

There are some issues with the administrative personnel, especially with the handling of COVID-19. I feel that the administrative personnel sometimes care more about money, clout, and notoriety than the lives of students, but I feel that is normal among other universities."
Junior,4,"The professors were easy to reach and instruction remained top notch.  However, it is hard to replicate the classroom experience with these top notch instructors. The transition to online learning was smooth.   In fact, the closing of the university, moving out of dorms, etc was well though out and done in an organized, efficient but I rushed way. I am glad that classes are resuming in person in the fall though I know it will be fine if we need to go online again."
Sophomore,4,"The switch to online classes was very sudden, and in the time frame given I think they did a good job working with what they had available to them. I think for most students it was just hard making the switch between in person and online classes but the majority of professors took that into consideration."
Sophomore,4,"Although small, I love the campus that Clark has created and makes me feel like Im at home again. The food on campus is a lot better than the average college campus food. The dorm rooms are decent sized and have a variety of options for halls to live in. The campus community is strongly ""political"" which doesn't bother me too much but can sometimes be overwhelming."
Sophomore,4,"Clark is a small liberal arts school with a nice campus. My favorite thing about Clark is its small size -- if I ever forgot something in my dorm, I could quickly retrieve it, and in the harsh winters, I was never outside very much. Most professors are very knowledgeable and caring of their students, and the psychology program (which I participated in) is very highly ranked. There are a variety of resources for students to use, such as the Center for Personal Growth (essentially therapy), Information Technology Services, and  Multicultural and First Generation Student Support. There is a large range of clubs that cater to different student interests, and students have the capacity to create new clubs. In addition, Clark boasts 30 majors and minors as well as 12 concentrations, but if students are not interested in any of these programs, they have the ability to create their own majors. Overall, Clark is an excellent school that provides students with many opportunities to flourish."
Junior,4,"Honestly, the transition to online learning for me was fairly smooth. My professors adapted well to remote instruction for the most part. My assignments remained essentially the same because of the nature of my courses—all psychology and sociology courses. If anything, I feel my course load got lighter and a bit more manageable, but still challenging. Of course, online learning will never be the same as in person instruction, so it was difficult to go without that in person interaction. I was just lucky enough to have professors who transitioned seamlessly to this change and made sure to keep a clear line of contact."
Junior,4,"What first drew me to Clark was a unique atmosphere of inclusion and the feeling that everyone who was at Clark wanted to be there. It has lived up to that expectation. Overall, I have enjoyed my courses. All of my professors (mainly in the psychology department and sociology department) have been incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and attentive. At Clark, I have finally learned what is it I want to do with my life with the help of a wonderful professor whose passion ignited my own. Despite being a small campus, there is always something to do. The events Clark puts on are always so much fun and present an opportunity to interact with my peers. For me, the only downside of Clark is the fact that it is such a small campus, but that is due to sheer preference alone. I have gotten so much out of Clark already in just my two short years here, and I can’t wait to learn and discover more."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is very friendly, helpful, and is respectful of each others' differences. Although the campus is small, there are many opportunities to get involved in activities in the community or school. Academically, the workload is not insane, but I still feel a little challenged. One downside to this school is that they seem very political."
Freshman,4,"Overall, a good school with amazing professors and classes. The area around the campus can be a bit unsafe, but just take precautions. Travel with friends during the day, theres a lot in Worcester to see and do if you have time. The dining hall provides a lot of different choices of food, and theres also many places on campus to get coffee or other food. The people are extremely nice and welcoming, always ready to introduce themselves. Dorms are nice, nothing crazy but overall solid. There are tons of clubs, teams, and different volunteer opportunities for you to participate in. There are also a lot of research projects and internships on and off campus to get involved in. The library is the best spot to get a lot of work done, and the fifth floor specifically is ideally quiet."
Niche User,4,"Although I am not a student at Clark, I took a tour of the school and fell in love. The campus was nice and it seemed to have a very inclusive and friendly environment. Our tour guide was super nice and the students at Clark University seem to have great relationships with each other and also have a love for the school. The only thing that I didn't love about the school was the dorm rooms. Compared to other schools, they weren't that bad, but they seemed pretty dark and cramped. It's something I can look past though. One good thing about the dorms is that every floor has a common area with a kitchenette, which I thought was pretty nice."
Niche User,4,Clark has an amazing psychology program and for those who are interested in psychology a fun fact about Clark is that Sigmund Freud spoke there.
Senior,4,i thoroughly enjoyed my years at clark university. I would change the varsity sports team access to a weight room.
Sophomore,4,"Everyone is wonderful! I have only met maybe one or two people on this campus that I didn't like.  Faculty and Staff are amazing. Bureaucracy runs slow, but that's a college."
Sophomore,4,"Clark can seem a little intimidating for students who are new to the area, especially because of the surrounding part of Worcester. In reality, it is a very accepting and non-judgmental community. It is a very liberal college, but those who are a little more conservative or who don't identify as extremely liberal will also find it easy to get along with others and find their own group. Respect is key  at Clark, no matter what belief, political affiliation, gender, appearance, race, etc."
Sophomore,4,"I think its generally a very good college where students are curious and intellectual and faculties are intelligent and caring. However, it might be small for some people since it feels as though there are limited groups of people to talk with."
Junior,4,It's an enjoyable experience with small class sizes and very engaged professors. I have loved my time here so far.
Sophomore,4,"So far Clark has been a great place for me to earn a degree. The academics and culture really create a unique home like enthronement where everyone knows each other.  I've been impressed by the amount of hands on opportunities the hands on opportunities that the school provides in terms of class work, volunteering, clubs and internships. It seems like almost everyone can find some way to get connected to the community which really helps to make Clark stand out from other four year schools."
Freshman,4,"Clark is a great place for individual thinkers. Each student is motivated and the professors are helpful yet challenging. Clark's campus is small and there are limited options for food. Also, Clark's location in Worcester is not ideal but also manageable."
Junior,4,It's a liberal arts school so there's no stress to stay in one major. I get to diversify my classes and not feel so confined to my major.
Freshman,4,"It is a small liberal art college. you can go anywhere on campus within 10 minutes, and it helps a lot when you wake up late.  
Again, it is a small community, you would see familiar faces anywhere you I have never expected. People notice you easily, compared to big universities, and vice versa; It is easier to make diverse friends without being constrained in a certain ""group."" 
Clark is one of rare colleges that give substantial amount of scholarships to out of state students and even international students. Almost 70% of the total undergraduate students are out of sate and 15% are international.
Professors are generally kind and generous. 
For the campus cafeteria, well, ice cream here is the best!
The only thing I do not like is housing facilities, but other dorms in campus are much new than mine..so this might not matter."
Freshman,4,"Excellent entry as a freshman to campus, athletics and academics. A lot of support provided during transition to the school."
Sophomore,4,"I have absolutely loved my first year Clark University!  As a member of the field hockey team, I was able to meet new people right away and there are always people around to support me in my studies and on the field.  Clark University allows me to study International Development and Social Change as well as French and still participate in varsity athletics."
Freshman,4,Clark is a small liberal arts school with a very welcoming community. The academics are rigorous but not too overwhelming. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. Clark has lots of resources to help with post-graduation plans
Sophomore,4,I don't have no type of experiences right but probably later on I'm have some experience but it seem like is a good college.  I will to know more about this college.
Junior,4,"Clark University is a located in Worcester, MA. Though campus is safe, the area surrounding campus can be sketchy at times; but, like all universities, the safety of students is a top priority. It is a very interesting and diverse community of students and professors. Most professors, faculty, and staff are kind and have their doors open to students when ever possible. One thing Clark is really focusing on these days is the job availability to students within the campus community so as to have students gain experience within their fields of study, or within other fields that may not pertain to their field of study."
Freshman,4,What I like about Clark University is the strong academics and the small campus setting. Clark has a great community and is centered around the schools motto.
Sophomore,4,"I have been very happy with my three semesters at Clark. My class sizes have been small and class discussions are always educationally intimate. It's in a very accessible area of Worcester, with a bus stop right across the street from campus and transportation offered by the school any time after 4 pm."
Freshman,4,"Clark is a TINY university and has all the perks and drawbacks that go along with that - everyone knows everyone, there are only two dining options, classes, even lectures, are pretty small, it takes about three minutes to walk across campus, and so on. Students tend to be really liberal and really do want to change the world, as the motto implies. Classes aren't that challenging, but you have a lot of flexibility in making your schedule. The party scene is kind of nonexistent and parties are usually BYOB so most people who want to drink or smoke get their own stuff and do it in the dorms. Worcester is kind of a dump of a city, and it doesn't really have anything to do in terms of night life, but it is relatively walkable and Clark is involved in a lot of revitalization projects. If I could change one thing about the school I would triple it in size, but of my friends, I'm the only one who thinks that. Overall, I'm happy and would probably make the same choice again."
Alum,4,"Eclectic student body. You can find a friend group no matter what you're interested in. High student interest in activism. Better than average dorms/housing. Worcester is diverse and has many cheap and good eats, but the Main South neighborhood surrounding Clark's campus can sometimes be sketchy. "
Freshman,4,"Overall, I think so many people find a home at Clark that complaining about trivial things feels whiny! It's a welcoming and open community where 99% of people are very caring about your well-being and happiness. I love this school"
College Freshman,4,"dorms are pretty big especially for freshman. all the dorms have nice common areas and they are very close to academic buildings, dining hall, parking garage, and athletic facilities."
College Freshman,4,"as an athlete, I really enjoy being a part of a team. It helps you make a group of friends quickly which is nice. being an athlete means you are kinda separated from the other students at Clark tho. you definitely see that sports teams do their own thing on campus"
College Senior,4,This is a place that I genuinely believed made me a better person.
College Sophomore,4,"Some of the housing buildings at Clark are very old, and in general sad. Some

Don't have a water fountain anywhere in the building.  We start school in mid August some even earlier for certain programs but there is no AC available, some buildings are made of bricks meaning in the heat it feels like an oven."
College Sophomore,4,"The teams are really good both during their games and in school, ,Clark does a really good job finding the balance between student and athlete"
College Sophomore,4,Its good since I go there for almost free
College Student,4,Overall its actually pretty good...I'm here for my education and I can get it at a good school with good people so Im happy.
College Student,4,"I did not expect to come to the school and did not enjoy it my first semester. However, after my 2nd semester it as become a home to me. Worcester sucks, but that helps you to stay on campus and focus on your study. People are very nice here and professors are awesome! If your thinking of majoring in a science field though this may not be the most competitive school for that."
College Freshman,4,Very diverse student body. Many opportunities
College Freshman,4,Very helpful LEEP centre and Career Services
College Freshman,4,"Spacious rooms, very social and friendly atmosphere"
College Freshman,4,Great gym. D3 so not a large focus on sports
College Freshman,4,The campus feels very safe and there is access to security personnel. If you are off campus help is only a phone call away.
College Freshman,4,So many graduates have gone on to do great things. Clarkies are such a tight knit group that alums look out for other alums. It is a good feeling to be able to say I am a Clarkie and hear about other people's experiences when they or their friends went to Clark.
College Freshman,4,Professors have been very approachable for the most part. When having difficulty they really want to help.
College Freshman,4,"I am on the cross country team and my teammates are my friends too. We go to the sports events and support our friends that are playing. But sports don't overshadow other events on campus, I think it is a good mix."
College Freshman,4,Had a difficult relationship with a roommate and the school helped resolve it for the best outcome for both of us. Teachers have been very easy to speak with and classmates take their education seriously.
College Junior,4,Professors are an average really approachable and unerstanding. They go out of their way sometimes to make sure we understand topics.
College Freshman,4,Professors are good. Not enough classes
College Freshman,4,My professors have been really great
College Freshman,4,"Many of the dorms are on the older side but there are a lot of new add-ons to the building, such as study rooms and lounges"
College Freshman,4,Clark does a great job with health services and safety on campus. I always feel safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,I like the dorm rooms very much. I happen to be in the hall with the largest of the freshman dorms and its great.
College Sophomore,4,"Worcester isn't a safe area, but Clark acknowledges that. University Police can always help you if you have problems."
College Sophomore,4,The halls at Clark are awesome.
College Freshman,4,I really like the teachers at this school. They are very nice and welcoming. The classes are definitely my favorite part. The teachers are very enthusiastic.
College Freshman,4,The campus housing is very nice and its a brilliant way o meet friends. Actually most of my friends live in my same hall. Everyone nice to each other. On each floor we have somewhat created a community.
Sophomore,2,"I think that university online classes are super hard to get along with, I would much rather benefit from having in-person learning."
Freshman,2,"I am transferring out of Clark University. The academics are impossibly difficult to handle for me. I am an English major, and even with just two English classes, I have multiple novels and articles to read every week, and well over 100 pages of reading per day. Maybe some students could handle that, but I don't think that's average at ALL compared to what other schools have. The food here is extremely poor quality and the dorms and living options are small and difficult to work with. There are very few parties and I don't fit in here at all. Whenever it snows, they don't salt the pathways so everyone slips on ice. On a positive note, I will say that despite their difficulty, classes here are engaging and professors are really amazing. So if you are able to handle an EXTREMELY rigorous academic workload, the classes here and the teachers are awesome, so this is the school for you. Otherwise, go somewhere else."
Sophomore,2,"This school is liberal to the extreme. I was liberal when I came here, but now I'm kind of conservative, and it sucks that there are so few conservative students. I am doing math and economics, which isn't very prone to liberal bias, but if you are conservative or centrist and want to do political science, or just like politics, I would not recommend Clark.
But the food is pretty good, and the professors have been really good.
Warning: they will only accept four AP tests for college credit, which is one semester.
tl;dr Clark is a liberal bubble with a lot of annoying requirements, but the math/econ professors are great!"
Freshman,2,"Great academics, terrible social scene. Worcester is not a great city by any stretch. The students are very cold and standoffish, and if you don't make friends during Week One you won't at all."
College Freshman,2,no one cares if you drink or smoke
College Sophomore,2,People smoke weed a lot.
College Student,2,Career and internship opportunities are plenty for liberal arts majors but very little for science majors. Very enclosed within Worcester as well.
College Student,2,Atheletics is not a big thing here. Do not come here for sports or big parties. The gym is very nice though!
College Freshman,2,"The professors are pretty great. You can tell they love what they do. However it's really easy to just slide by here because it's so easy (and a little boring). RLH is absolutely horrendous. They do not care about the students and do not have any standards. There is also a housing problem because they didn't think ahead when assigning room, now there aren't enough."
College Junior,2,"The university police are more agressive towards people of color. I am from the neighboorhood, so I feel safe walking around, but I feel I always have to keep my head down around the univerisity police. Thus, I do not feel safe around the university police."
College Junior,2,"Their is no alumni networking. And their is a huge lack of diversity in terms of employees being hired. Career services tries their best to help, but it also lacks the ability to cater to every student."
College Sophomore,2,Career Services is not helpful at all.
College Freshman,2,"The cons definitely outweigh any pros. The location is bad, the buildings aren't very nice, the food isn't very good, the place is a general disappointment."
College Freshman,2,"The food's bad, the administration is very disorganized (I've seen multiple typos in official documents as well as dead links on their website.) A lot of people are stoners here, and everyone else just isn't fun to hang out with. The roommate survey they send you is completely worthless, because I, along with many others, was paired with a completely incompatible roommate. (We put completely different answers on our surveys.)"
College Freshman,2,The Health Center is off campus and inconvenient. The school is very into programs proventing assult and couseling is great but Health Center isn't work the hike there
College Freshman,2,"worcester is not safe at all, you will live in fear"
College Freshman,2,It's on a sketchier side of Worcester. However a 15 minute car trip will take you to somewhere nice.
College Freshman,2,House parties get closed by the police very often since there are lots of families in the surrounding neighborhoods. But there are so good clubs around and they often have college nights and parties. Most students use the school escort to a point then take a cab the rest of the way. Also some parties provide shuttles from campus to the clubs and you only pay a small amount like $1.
College Sophomore,2,Clark's WiFi reliability is unacceptably bad
College Sophomore,2,"If you want a 'party school', Clark isn't it."
Freshman,1,"Poor quality for the price, not worth it at all. My experience here was awful. Not worth the expensive price tag."
Freshman,1,Online classes at Clark were a nightmare. Professors seemed to struggle to translate the courses to an online format and therefore gave a ridiculous workload to students.
Freshman,1,"In the short time I attended Clark University, it taught me that no matter how much a school markets itself to be inclusive and welcoming, it probably isn't. Most of the kids at Clark come from privileged families and claim to be ""woke"" but somehow manage to be some of the most racist, homophobic & ignorant people I've ever met. There is an extremely cliquey atmosphere present on campus and I've witnessed multiple cases of bullying.

The administration at Clark University seems to make the conscious choice not to listen to students. Based on my personal experiences with departments such as Title IX to the financial aid offices, there is little care or accountability present on campus. The dorms, food, and area around campus (Main South) are incredibly below average as well.

While I understand no university is completely perfect, Clark University has managed to destroy any previous expectations or respect I once had for it and has led me to transfer after just one year of attending."
Niche User,1,"Clark's strategy for enticing student's seems to be based solely on providing large sums of financial aid and hoping that factor alone will force students to look past the slowly eroding infrastructure and student life that is taking place on the Clark campus. 

The campus food is extremely poor and unless you can afford constant food delivery services or have the means to get off campus, then you must endure the lack of gluten-free, vegan, or healthy options provided by the Sodexo corporation. The area surrounding Clark is easily the worst area of Worcester 

The administration at Clark is also extremely incompetent, Departments such as Financial Aid, Title IX, Student Accounts, and the Office of President Angel seem far more interested in themselves than the students (which is quite unfortunate given the small size) 

The student life of a Clark student, it is a school I would describe as a ""go-home"" school, a large portion of students go home every weekend leaving campus empty"
Freshman,1,"Attended Clark University for freshman year of college prior to transferring to more affordable, more competitive, and more prestigious state university in the Mid-Atlantic. I absolutely despised my time at Clark. Worcester is unsafe and dirty.  Administration and student body are EXTREMELY liberal, to the point in which there is absolutely no diversity in thought. It is an echo chamber of ideas. There is a very athlete vs. gen population culture perpetuated by both parties. Athletes hang out with athletes. The cost is absolutely outrageous and Clark shorted my scholarship by 15,000 although I met all criteria. Courses were too easy. Felt as if they were ensuring that I would not fail, which is absolutely not representative of the real world. Boost GPA's in order to make everyone feel good. Overall, this school is an echo chamber of overly liberal ideas filled with an administration that likes to shield students from real world problems."
Sophomore,1,Many professors are not very engaging in class and the social scene leaves a lot to be desired. The surrounding area is crime-ridden so it's not safe to leave campus on your own.
College Freshman,1,"The RLH is unorganized, and uninterested in students. There are some good RAs and HDs. But I am mostly referring to the Dean of RLH and the overall sloppiness."
College Junior,1,Racially profiled and discriminated. Lack of support from administration on pressing issues.
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have Greek life on campus. The closest thing we have are upperclassmen of the Division III sports teams typically live in houses together as a team and those houses occasionally have house parties with kegs. But there are plenty of off-campus parties thrown by people not involved in sports teams as well.
College Junior,1,It's worth the commute to live a little further away from Main South in a nicer area!
College Junior,1,Greek Life does not exist.
College Junior,1,"Clark RLH, like most of Clark's other department, doesn't give a flying f*** about students. They have shown time and time again that students don't matter. This year they've started a program that basically allows freshman first rights to housing and doesn't allow other classes to sign up for singles/doubles/triples till the summer (!!!), completely brushing off current sophomores and juniors. That may sound great if you're a first year, but you become a 2nd semester sophomore wi ll think this is unnecessary. Also, RLH is a department that hires many, MANY mediocre RA's run by lapdogs that are more immature than an seventh grader. Good luck..."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid was unable to help me and rarely responded to the emails I sent them. 
However, the people in student accounts are fantastic."
College Freshman,1,It gets COLD here! Fall had barely begun and I had to break out the sweatshirts and fluffy coats. Worcester Winters are something not to be taken lightly.
College Freshman,1,"cold, slushy. long winters. but great for staying in and having great conversation"
College Sophomore,1,"Although Clark always emphasizes their ""diverse background of students"" the diversity the University is referring to is not race. There is a large population of International students that attend Clark, however international students of color are not the same as domestic students. The ALANA (African descent, Latino /a, Asian, and Native American) population is very small, I believe under 8% which is shameful for a University located in an urban area. There are amazing people at Clark, the majority of who are warm and friendly people, but the University lacks domestic diversity, and that is why I would grade Clark with a D."
College Sophomore,1,"Its usually cold all year around. Out of the whole school year you might not need your jacket for 2 months, maybe."

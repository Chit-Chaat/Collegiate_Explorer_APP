Freshman,5,"We meet on zoom based on our schedules, but it’s actually quite fun. Most of my professors are fun and encourage us to engage. We often have breakout rooms where the students can speak to one another. And since it’s a small school, many of us quickly became friends."
Freshman,5,"Since it’s a small private school you really get to have a closer relationship with your professors, counselors, advisors and fellow classmates. Even during this pandemic Hope has done their best to make learning easy and fun!"
Sophomore,5,"Hope International  is a small private university located in Fullerton, California.  Being in the middle of Orange County you have unlimited options for eating and entertainment. From Hope, Disneyland is only 12 minutes away while  beaches are twenty. You end up knowing everyone that you go to school with therefore its a very close knit community. At Hope you feel like you are at home."
Junior,5,My experience has been really good. Professors are very understanding and they are very helpful. The environment is really nice. Perfect!
Junior,5,I have been taking online classes for a year. They are really helpful for me that way I can log on whenever I am free.
Junior,5,"My online experience at HIU was somewhat good. I am good when it comes too taking one or two online courses but when it is more it just gets to overwhelming for me. I get distracted very easily and can not learn or process much. However, the professors are very helpful and understanding. It is up to us as students to reach out to the professor if we are having any trouble."
Junior,5,"This is my first semester at HIU I did not really get to experience a lot due to the corona virus. However, the time I did spend at HIU was great. The professors were great and very helpful. I got to participate in an after school group where we would go work with elementary school kids. It was fun and it gave me the chance to meet new people."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Hope Internation has been good. The professors have been very helpful and supportive. The class sizes are small which helps because one can get help from professor easily as well as classes are always available. There are many resources for students which is very helpful as well.
Freshman,5,They have been the most amazing college to work with! They are always quick to answer my questions and concerns. Their online courses are easy to navigate and clear on instructions.
Niche User,5,"Hope International University is an incredibly small, student driven university, centered around Christ and honoring Him. With a strong heart for God and a passion for serving others, I truly hope to attend this wonderful college in the next year or two and better my relationship with God as well as advance my knowledge in the area of psychology and building relationships."
Niche User,5,What I like about this University is that the staff is very welcoming and very helpful. Another thing that I really liked about the school is that the teacher to student ratio is small.
Senior,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE the professors! School is amazing and the people here are great. I feel like everyone at this school really cares about the students and does what is best for them. I believe that they actually care for us and the lead us by examples. God is amazing and they remind us every day.
Graduate Student,5,Professor put in a lot of work to assist students in achieving their goals. The learning environment is excellent and study/work load is manageable. It’s easy to get the classes you need.
Graduate Student,5,"I take online courses and I love it at Hope. I like having access to course work at any time also giving longer deadlines than sitting in a classroom. Teachers are flexible and although the campus is small, which is nice, there are extentions around Fullerton and Anaheim for counselors, financial aid and academic offices. People complain about the cost but you have to remember it is a private Christian university."
Sophomore,5,I am doing the online program. I find the workload not too bad. The professors and advisor are very helpful and encouraging. You only have to be active for 3 days out of a week for attendance. I enjoy it here.
Junior,5,"Hope International University is a beautiful school that can help your faith with God. The Professors truly care for all their students in their courses. This is my first semester at HIU and everyone is friendly and care about you as well. The only downside is that the school is expensive, but worth it."
Freshman,5,I like the fact that the classes are small so it's more hands on learning with your professor. I feel as though hands on learning is better because you get to learn more about the professor and how they like to teach and it's easier because they intend to help you and want you to succeed. The professors work with you as much as they can and I find that very helpful
Freshman,5,"Hope International University has become one of my greatest experience and I am honored of being a student there. Their campus is absolutely marvelous and quite sanitary. What I like about this university is that it's small! I don't have to be lost looking for my classes or riding my scooter to get there. On the contrary, I could use the stairs or the elevator instead, and it's only three floors. And you know what's great about having a small campus? Being able to connect with students and faculty members. It is a great way to become closer and united instead of being distant. Most importantly, understanding that each individual is unique and different no matter what religious belief, ethnicity, or race."
College Junior,5,"I enjoy the education courses, they teach you a lot and I love the teachers. they are all very enthusiastic about their jobs and love being in the classroom."
College Junior,5,I am a girls soccer player at Hope! I love being at and hope and playing with those amazing and driven girls. We support the other sports as well and they support us. The only problem with the soccer teams is that we have to practice at Cal State Fullerton because we don't have a field and I believe that's unfair.
College Junior,5,Hope is a very diverse school and that's why I like. the Koreans that come all the way from south or north Korea make it even more diverse. You get to learn from different people and get to understand how they live there lives.
College Junior,5,"I love Hope International University, even though it is very expensive. I love being at school and the teachers really care about each student. the only thing I am worried about is not being able to stay at the school of my dreams. This year has been really hard on my family and the school needs over a 1,000 dollars for me to stay enrolled this year. I have been searching and applying for scholarships and could really use one."
Recent Alumnus,5,I believe that the involvement of the professors and all faculty of the school in seeing and making sure that each student succeeds in all that they do.
College Sophomore,5,I would make sure I got enough scholarships and grants if I could do it over again
College Sophomore,5,"Seriously so honored, fortunate and blessed. Just wish I could afford to graduate...."
College Sophomore,5,"Amazing professors, helpful, relational, sincere, challenging."
College Junior,5,"Professors: Well equipped and knowledgeable of their subject matter

Curriculum: Excellent and suited to academic needs

Registration process: Smooth and easy, detailed instructions

Workload: Can be heavy, but reasonable for my degree."
College Junior,5,"Being California and sunny most of the time, it is always great weather!"
College Junior,5,"I am ecstatic about my program because it is exactly what I have been looking for. I would not do it all over again, because it has taken me a while to find this kind of school and program. My goal is to be a missionary and so Intercultural studies is imperative for my experience. My concern for finding a job is not as stressful, as I am currently in the middle of on-the-job training."
Recent Alumnus,5,Lots of yummy places to go :) A lot are in walking distance too for people who do not have a car
Recent Alumnus,5,It's southern California... It's always nice :)
Recent Alumnus,5,One of my favorite parts about the school was the diversity :) I Loved learning about the different cultures and beliefs of others!
College Sophomore,5,Classes and registration are super easy!
College Sophomore,5,This is a Christian school!
College Senior,5,"I have completed my first seven months in the Marriage and Family Therapy program and I couldn't be happier.  My professors are outstanding and experienced in the field and the program is amazing, further evidenced by its COAMFTE certification.  I have no doubt this is one of the best schools in America for MFTs."
College Student,5,"Warm, sunny southern California weather.  What can I say?"
College Freshman,5,Because we are a small school we don't need so many computers but the ones we do have are updated and are always working. It is never too crowded that you cannot get a computer.
College Freshman,5,"The weather is great in fullerton. Its almost always sunny, and there is rarely a bad day out here."
College Freshman,5,Fullerton is pretty much a college town and the locasl are very friendly towards students.
College Sophomore,5,Being that this is a Christian University makes the consumption or attempts to even bring any illegal drug on campus that much harder. There are also security guards which continually patrol throughout the night to make sure everyone is behaving.
Sophomore,4,I did not plan on taking any online courses but due to covid-19 I had to take six classes online and Hope did a great job with making the transition very easy. All of my professors but one were very understanding and patient . The transition to online was new to them as it was for us and they really understood that.  They were all very encouraging through the rest of the semester that we had to spend online.
Freshman,4,I am an incoming freshman. So far the school is great. Low student to teacher ratio which is something I wanted. Teacher seem invested.
Alum,4,"Great atmosphere for growing friendships. Faculty and staff, do a great job with balancing teaching and helping students create a deeper relationship with God. Can be difficult at times to register for classes. But the University makes up with it with easy teacher accessibility and small class sizes."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school everyone is so nice. Great Christian Based school with amazing and greeting professor and students! It's my first year and I really like it here, the classes are pretty challenging but you'll get through it."
Junior,4,"Ironically, Hope International University lives up to it's name. For students, like myself, who come from low-income areas Hope is a great place to turn too. They provide scholarships for all their students! The campus is small but as a result of that the community is safe and friendly, a home away from home. Whether you're a Christian or not the relationships created with students, faculty, and professors goes beyond the classroom and prepares you for life, your career, and a source of encouragement for difficulties life throws your way. It challenges you academically and the professors aren't there for the paycheck only, they are passionate scholars who desire their students to grow academically, so they can become scholars as well. Hope successfully lives up to its name."
Junior,4,"This school is great for many reasons. Firstly it is because of the student to teacher ratio being small so you can form relationships with them and be more successful. Second, the professors genuinely care about you succeeding and are there to help. Lastly, for a private institution, the tuition is more affordable compared to others."
Alum,4,"Hope International is a very small school, but that means getting to know your professors and classmates on a personal level. The professors show that they truly want you to succeed and do everything to help you."
Junior,4,"People and teachers are nice and really helpful, just wish that the campus will be a little bigger and the athletic facilities closer."
Sophomore,4,I am enrolled in Hope's online undergraduate Human Development program and I love it. I was really worried about doing college online but it has been a great experience. I feel like my professors truly want me to succeed and my classmates have all been so respectful and really seem like they want to be a part of the school.
College Junior,4,"Great online programs, the professors are quick to respond to your questions and needs as if it was a on campus experience."
College Senior,4,There are several places to pick from and all are within walking distance.
College Senior,4,Parties are hosted and put on by the school. The best ones take place during any NSO. These parties/events make a positive impact on every student's experience.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are many places for students to hang out and get away from the everyday class routine
College Junior,4,We have security guards on duty 24/7 and the campus is so small no one that doesn't belong could hide.
College Junior,4,the girls and guys at Hope are all very open and welcoming to new comers. There isn't that many students so you get to know everyone and its like a big family. No matter who you are there is always some one ready to be your friend.
College Junior,4,I love all my education classes and it makes me very excited knowing I will be a teacher some day. I am learning a lot and thankful for all my education teachers and showing us how to be a great teacher.
College Junior,4,Its a lot of work but that's what college is about. College is working your butt off to get far later in life. The teachers know what they are talking about and always want to help those who ask for it. I am very thankful that the teachers care so much for each and every student.
Recent Alumnus,4,they're pretty cool and down to earth. Their looks are norm but with their own style.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Student life on campus is really cool because they involve all students, residents on campus and commuters."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Team performance, fan support, student involvement, school spirit, and athletic facilities are what really affect the athletics scene in a good way."
College Senior,4,Mostly mild/temperate weather in SoCal. Usually great year-round.
College Sophomore,4,great to see such beautiful people around town
College Sophomore,4,lots of interaction with the surrounding community
College Sophomore,4,I chose this as my graduate program because of many other reviews.
College Sophomore,4,nothing but good things to say
College Sophomore,4,There are different types of cuisine located in and around the school
College Sophomore,4,Security is always roaming around
College Sophomore,4,Downtown  Fullerton is a 5 minute drive away
College Junior,4,The financial aid process was smooth and all the instructions was detailed and easy to follow.  The financial aid office was helpful in all my dealings with financial aid and I did not have any problems getting the aid I need.
Recent Alumnus,4,The drug and alcohol policies are necessary so I agree with them having them. I don't think peer pressure was a problem at the school. 
Recent Alumnus,4,"I loved the faculty at the school! Great teachers!!! You can always go ask them for help, advice, anything! Definitely make the school a million times better!!! The registration process was ALWAYS a hassle. 99.9% of the students had to go to the registrar's office to have them register them because the online process never worked "
Recent Alumnus,4,Loved the psychology program. I actually switched majors because of the teachers and program. Only thing to improve is providing students with job information and internship ideas. The school doesn't to care about what you do after you leave
Recent Alumnus,4,The staff was very nice but there was always some issues that came up. Apparently the process has become smoother since I left
Recent Alumnus,4,The only parking issue I had was some time my card wouldn't let me into the back parking lot!
College Sophomore,4,Great to hang out and eat!
College Sophomore,4,"Its easy to find parking at Hope. Because there isn't that many students that drive, there is always space for people to park. and the parking lot is only open to students and faculty so people who go to CSUF wont be able to park there and take up all the spots."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am on the Graduate campus, and as far as I'm aware there is very little drug use and/or promotion of drugs on campus."
College Senior,4,"The computers provided are all Apple computers with either Apple or Microsoft software to run them. They run at high speeds and are very reliable. However, there is a limited number of them so during finals week it can be difficult to find one open. A laptop is a good idea simply because you can take it anywhere on campus and still have internet access."
College Senior,4,There are plenty of local spots that are walking distance from school. A variety of options in food and relaxing environments to spend time with friends.
College Senior,4,Everything is so close. Walking distance really though buses are also available to get around. Anything long distance is best going by with a car.
College Senior,4,"Campus is really safe, cannot complain too much about it other than the security guard tries a bit too hard to keep the campus safe and quiet."
College Sophomore,4,There are strict rules to drugs if you are living on campus.The school also is a smoke free zone which is great for me since I'm allergic to it.
College Sophomore,4,"Fullerton has quite a few schools around the area of where my school is. Cal State Fullerton is right across the street. There are plenty of stores and restaurants surrounding the schools. Not to mention that Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm and Huntington Beach are close by."
College Student,4,I like the focus Hope puts on developing leadership.  Do to Hope's small size the student to teacher ratio is very good.  This allows a lot more of a personal and deep academic experience.
College Student,4,"I honestly think it is pretty good.  A lot of college students seem to like to talk trash about their campus food options.   From what I have experienced, Hope has good campus dining.  Fairly good variety."
College Student,4,There is comparatively low amounts of drugs on campus. Of course it depends who you hang out with.  Weed would be the most common but compared to most colleges there is very little drug use.
College Student,4,The school is small so not all sports are represented very well. Having said that the school spirit and facilities available are impressive for such a small college.
College Sophomore,4,"Very reasonably priced, and good food plans with great options. Friendly housing mom/dads. Each room has there own bathroom which is also very nice."
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors here at Hope want students to go up a level in their view of themselves. the professors push students to be better than they believe they can be, both intellectually and spiritually"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I simply filled out a FAFSA application as I did in previous years,  The process is rather simple and is just a matter of following the instructions provided on the FAFSA website.  The financial aide office at Hope was always ready to answer any questions that I had regarding my financial obligations or options.  I would recommend that new students tap into the resources offered on campus at their financial aide office."
Recent Alumnus,4,"As with the other Universities I checked in to, Hope requires an essay explaining why you are interested in getting your education in the field you are applying for, along with application form, $40 application fee, professional and spiritual references, and questions or forms stating your financial intentions, which may or may not include grants or scholarships  ."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I started and completed my Bachelors degree in Human Development at Hope through online programming.  I enjoyed my experience at Hope because if allowed me the flexibility within the confines of the course deadlines to complete all my coursework online at a pace that worked for me and my family.  The amount of online coursework seemed intense, but my experience is limited to Hope therefore the validity of my opinion of narrow.  I also found the curriculum and discussion requirements to be challenging without being overwhelming.  This gentle balance along with the freedom to express my spiritual passions is what has brought me back to complete my Masters."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I received my B.S. in Human Development with an emphasis on counseling through Hope International University.  The online curriculum, flexibility, and community that this University offered allowed me to not only expand my knowledge about the development of human beings of all ages, but provided a Christian worldview perspective that not all universities offer.  I believe that the Christian world view perspective will allow me to serve a broader population of people.  With that being said, I am excited to continue my educational experience at Hope."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have not participated in an internship program yet.  However, I have found out from my phone conversation with the school representative at Hope that I will be able to participate in an internship program and get paid if it is an approved site by the University.  This type of flexibility is not offered at all Universities, which makes it very difficult for adult learners to be able to take care of their families financial obligations and go to school simultaneously.  The opportunity to work at the same place I am conducting my internship was  one of the main reasons I chose to continue my education at Hope."
College Freshman,4,"Public transportation is good. The buses are always running and takes you by grocery stores, down town fullerton, and off campus apartments."
College Freshman,4,There are alot of different resturaunts off campus and there is the cafe at Cal State Fullerton accreoss the street which is great. Down town fullerton is a few minutes away with more dinning options.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are pretty old, but close to everything."
College Junior,4,"I love the community and campus life at HIU! It was easy for me to settle in, I have only been here for a semester and I call this place my home."
College Sophomore,4,The weather is pretty good during the year. A little gloomy in the winter season but we are in Southern California so it is not too bad!
College Senior,4,"It's Southern California. The campus does have a large indoor student center with gym and a couple good hang-out spots on campus for when it rains - but since it's typically sunny there are a ton of lawns, benches, and outdoor areas that are great for studying or hanging out."
College Senior,2,"I've worked for the school asking for donations from alumni, and most I talked to didn't have good jobs and were upset about the value of a Hope degree."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a great place to live don't get me wrong. The environment is superb, but the cost is way too overpriced for the rooms and dorms you live in, including the food."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus was far too strict for me, but it is a Christian school so you should no it will be more strict"
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus housing while I was there was terrible!!! Four of us to a dirty old room! Now there are new apartments :(
College Sophomore,2,I don't have financial aid!
College Senior,2,"There are a few apartments around that belong to Cal State Fullerton but a number of Hope students reside in them anyway. However, a new housing option is being available to Hope student off campus this coming school year."
College Freshman,2,"The computers at Hope aren't that bad. The WiFi is decent, but its slow at times and some times it disconnects."
College Freshman,2,The food options in the cafeteria are very repetitive and limited.
College Junior,2,"Many majors are not offere here, mine included. I will ba taking my major courses at Cal State Fullerton, and bacause of that I feel a disconnect."
College Freshman,2,"English is not my first language , so sometimes is a little hard for me to understand the test."
Recent Alumnus,2,Fair but Could Be a Lot Better – The campus dining was recently changed but some of the issues still remain. For those who have the unlimited plan there are a lot of options of when to eat. For those who are commuters there is only one choice of meal plan. In my opinion the lunch menu is the best. For breakfast there were not always a lot of options and some of the choices were boring and repetitious. I do not experience the dinner option often enough to rate it and as a commuter I do not experience the weekend brunch option. From what I have heard the menu on the weekends is not that great.
College Junior,2,Rain or Shine – Here it is either stupidly hot and sunny or ridiculously cold and rainy.  The weather here can change day by day.  Thunderstorms today and 95 degrees tomorrow.
College Junior,2,First Come First Served – Hope's campus parking i think its the same as any other campus. Theres what i like rush hour where everyone is getting out of class and going home so theres parking spots available and if you not there on time some ones else will take your spot.
College Senior,1,"Internet never works, meal plan has to be bought, not vegan options. Kitchen not up to code so the ovens and stoves got taken out, ac and heated never seem to work, and the water gets turned off for hours at a time."
College Senior,1,"The professors are good, but the classes are way too easy and I feel like I didn't learn anything except for theology, which is NOT my major. They also make you live on campus, it's very expensive and its GROSS. The water gets turned off frequently, the stove and ovens just got taken out because it wasn't up to the fire marshal code, many of the other parts of the dorms I'm sure are also not up to code. The meal plan sucks and doesn't accommodate for students with specific dietary needs well. The internet also NEVER works when you need it to. AC and heater also doesn't work well. Wish I would've transferred."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene at this school. It is a ghost town on the weekends.
College Freshman,1,I' am highly upset that I have to pay so much money for disgusting food!
Recent Alumnus,1,There was literally no nightlife and you got in trouble if you went out. 
College Sophomore,1,This is a Christian School!
College Sophomore,1,Since Hope is a private christian school there are no Greek fraternities or sororities on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The campus police are pretty strict, but the Residents Life Coordinator are worst. They don't allow drinking or cigarette smoking on campus period. On the second day of school they had kicked out ten(10) students without any warning. If your of age and go off campus to drink and come back acting even a little drunk they will kick you out the dorms. Since its a private christian school, you pretty much cant do anything non-christian."
College Senior,1,"The school is very strict when it comes to appropriate age drinking on campus. It is not allowed. We are separate in dorms by gender. Also Campus security enforces the idea that we, college students, should not hangout on campus tables, located outside the dorms after quiet hours (10 PM). It is quite strict in that manner."
College Sophomore,1,Religious School – The rules are real strict if you have a girl in the room the door has to be open. Also the drinking is prohibited on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Freshman Dorms Are the Worst – 2010-2011 Was my first year at college away from, so unfortunately I had to live on campus. At first I was really looking forward to live on campus and meet my roommates. As I settled in I quickly realized that they must have put me in the wrong room becuase the people i was with were the worst! When it came to cleaning I did all of it, and it even got to the point where I had to have the RA come in and make a chart for us in order to get things done. Overall the dorms are in horrible condition, and I would not live there unless you absolutely have too."

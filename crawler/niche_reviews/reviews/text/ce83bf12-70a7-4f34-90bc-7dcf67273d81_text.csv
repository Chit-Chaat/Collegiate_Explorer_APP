Freshman,5,"I love that the advisors are always available to to assist me. There is Hangar where students can go to unwind and decompress with food, video games, and other fun things. If I need help with a subject or assignment there are lots of tutors available and I can even submit my work to them to look over and they send it back with corrections within 8 hours. We have great professors as well."
Freshman,5,I have not taken any classes online. But I have taken the orientation online as well as meeting with my advisor. This school online options and zoom classes as well.  I plan to take online classes next semester.
Sophomore,5,"Learning online at NWFSC has been very convenient and flexible. You make your own schedule and come up with a plan every week to complete assignments. For the most part, my online professors have been very easy to reach and often answer emails the same day."
Graduate Student,5,The online classes that I did take were very easy to get through. The instructors communicated within a reasonable amount of time. I never had any glitches with the online platform that the college uses. I got A's in all the online classes I took. I Recommend  Highly!
Graduate Student,5,I liked how close the college was to my home. The campus was beautiful and the buildings are all within walking distance of each other. I hardly ever had any problems with my professors. I learned a lot attending this college
Sophomore,5,My classes have been all online and I have loved every second of it! The online experience here is through Blackboard so it is easy to handle.
Sophomore,5,Northwest Florida State College is a wonderful school! I have only been learning here for a year and I have already learned so much.
Senior,5,All professors are teaching because they want to and genuinely care about their student's success. Professors are usually easy to contact and open to helping students. Students are also very friendly and will always offer to help others.
Sophomore,5,Northwest Florida State college has many campuses which helps make it easier for many people in the area to attend. All of the professors I have had are cool and understanding. I would recommend attending here.
Freshman,5,They have helped me every step.of the way. Teachers and staff are so friendly. I cant wait to become more involved!
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed all the teachers I had. They were are all very nice and friendly. In addition, the school is very pretty and well maintained. The student lounge is a very cool new addition to the college, for it allows students to take some time off and relax with friends. Various video game consoles are kept in their for students to have fun."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my school!! I have the opportunity to bond with others while receiving such an important education for myself and for my future. I love the atmosphere and environment that I am surrounded in! It's honestly a joy to attend at Northwest Florida State College
Freshman,5,How do I feel about Northwest Florida? I currently enjoy attending Northwest Florida. It a very small and student friendly campus. It's a simple concept campus which is very helpful for a first year student. I have been able to have 1 on 1 time with any teacher. The classes are normally between 15-30 students which gives a lot of room for teacher interacting. There are a lot of hangout spots and study spots for between classes. Tables and benches set up everywhere in the shade or in the sun whatever your preference.
Freshman,5,northwest Florida state college and is beautiful in a great location. All of the professors want to help and encourage students to push harder and become something more than you thought or even imagined. Even for the students who never imagined they would be going to school or be allowed the chance to further their education. Northwest Florida state college is a great school and really opens the door for opportunity to students.
Sophomore,5,"Everything on campus is easily accessible, and it's easy to walk from one side of the campus to the other for a class."
Freshman,5,"So far it has been great. The teachers are great and the classes aren't too difficult. They offer tutoring and have a nice library. I have not had a problem with any of the teachers I've met so far. The campus is very beautiful too, and with numbers on the buildings it makes everything easy to locate."
Alum,5,"Northwest Florida State College is a great college with great teachers and academics, and I was able to finish my Associates degree with an idea of what I wanted to study for my Bachelors. There isn't much to do on campus, except go to the gym or cafeteria. But overall, it is a good school to attend!"
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed the small class sizes, and individualized help that you get from the professors in your major.  They have all been encouraging and take a personal interest in their student's success.  It is a beautiful campus that has a lot of extracurricular activities and fine arts programs as well.  Great opportunities for a smaller college."
Senior,5,"College campus is improving for the better. New main building area is set up to help students be able to see an Academic Adviser with an appointment or walk-in, but an appointment is highly recommended. A new Vet Success Center was also created to help assisted Military and their spouses."
Sophomore,5,The college campus is very open and beautiful. Faculty are  very helpful! Great experience. I attended the Collegiate High School on the college campus and everyone was very willing to help me  out when i needed it. I recommend this college to anyone.
Freshman,5,My experience over all has been great but northwest can improve on the effort put in the teaching of the classes a lot of times I'm having to get help because the  teacher does not take time to teach the material
Niche User,5,"I am enrolled as a dual enrollment student from South Walton High School. I enjoy taking the online courses, as the professors are super flexible and they have a wide variety of courses available for dual enrollment students, from abnormal psychology and economics to computer science and nutrition. Overall, I have learned a lot from and enjoyed all of the dual enrollment courses I have taken through Northwest Florida State College."
Freshman,5,"The college has provided me with a great experience. They have few athletics available and the only housing is off campus for the athletes. Most of the professors I have had have been great; if they aren't, the college provides an opportunity for you to rate them. The campus is pretty for this area."
Junior,5,The best school I ever attended just  there's that one or  Professor's I would delete but all the others love their job and go out there way to help you to succeed and to reach your goal even will help you with computer help if you're not  good at it you can go get help anything that you could imagine you need to succeed at this school is there
Junior,5,"NWFSC has given me the education and skills to complete the registered nursing program in 2019 and the path to succeed in earning a nursing degree (BSN) in 2020. Overall, the program has provided real experiences in nursing, above average teaching with practice and goal/education center pathways to achievement. Some professors could enable more clear teachings by following structured material rather than venture teaching. Go Raiders!"
Senior,5,"The Councilors are there to help and have been really great, Teachers have the knowledge and many of them encourage the students to expand the mind."
Sophomore,5,"I have been a student for the past 3yrs on and off, and the counselors have been so understanding with my situation. I would recommend to anyone trying to further their education."
Freshman,5,"The teachers are amazing and keep you interested in learning, especially the ones with the classes that are three hours at a time. The education is top-notch, and despite there being a large number of students per teacher, they still try to build a relationship with every student. An amazing college!"
Freshman,5,I really liked the online website it was very helpful in informing me of the different majors at the school. The advisers are also a very big help for military members and help them achieve the goals they want to.
Niche User,5,I like the fact that I am able to get quick and efficient help. People are very polite and professional at Northwest Florida State College.
Niche User,5,"Everything about this college is great the professors, staff and other students. They professors seem really committed to helping all of the students achieve the best grade possible. Personally I love the different events  and clubs that are held on campus. For example, we just had our annual Fall Festival and it was so much fun! There blown up games, face paint, food and it was all free. The college also puts on a career day which can come in handy to those in need of a few extra bucks."
Sophomore,5,Northwest Florida state is an excellent academic program. Professors are extremely welcome and helping to all students. Most students are on a name to name bases with all their professors. It a great place to go to.
Freshman,5,I really like the class options. The teachers are super helpful also! I think that there could be more classes offered at the Fort Walton Beach campus because I can't drive out to Niceville. I have really enjoyed the relationships that I have made with my fellow students and teachers.
Junior,5,"Northwest Florida State College is a very friendly place, with nice teachers and administration. I chose this College because a lot of my friends graduated from here, and now they are very successful. First of all this college has a good reputation and very good reviews. Second, of all, they have a lot of options in different fields."
Freshman,5,Overall the staff has been extremely friendly and helpful and the teacher are great. I have the option to learn online or on campus and also have the option do hybrid classes so I can get done quicker. There’s locations all surrounding me and I have my pick at which campus I’d like to learn at. Parking can sometimes be a bit hectic but that’s because it’s not just a bunch of young people coming to classes there’s people of all ages either continuing their journey or beginning their college career. The advising team is extremely helpful in navigating my classes and career path and helping me decide what loads and class schedules I can handle with my work and home life.
Sophomore,5,"What a great school!  Perfect class size for college classes and you can really get to know your professors. Despite being such a small college they offer a wide variety of classes and are open to creating more sections of classes if need be.  I am bummed that I have to transfer to finish my degree.  Parking is easy and never have to walk far because the campus isn't too big.  Overall, great experience."
Alum,5,I loved everything about NWFSC. I was able to build friendships with many students and I was very active around the community and campus. I enjoyed my two years there and also playing baseball was a great opportunity I encountered.
Freshman,5,I love the small college feel and experience I get at Northwest Florida State College. The professors are amazing and give a quality teaching experience and have the ability to help students inside and outside of the classroom.
Freshman,5,Wonderful school. Really try to help you in any way they can. Can tell they want the best education for you.
Freshman,5,I am currently in a program as a junior in high school attending college here to complete my high school diploma and my associates degree at the same time. It's a great program and I am very thankful for this opportunity. The people here are great!!
Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Northwest has been positive. My professors are extremely kind and well prepared, since it is smaller classrooms there is a lot more one on one time, and that's a nice touch because we actually know more about the person teaching us. The campus Is beautiful and all of the staff the works there are very sweet. I don't really have anything negative to say, some of the parking could be better, but most buildings re easily accessible."
Senior,5,"My time at Northwest Florida State has been very positive and would recommend this college to anyone interested in obtaining a quality education. Each instructor strives to help their students learn and progress in their classes. In addition, this college gives high quality education at an affordable price. I am thankful for my opportunity to attend this college and would recommend others to attend."
Freshman,5,Great school with great teachers that are always straight to the point. I recommend attending this college if you are wanting to go to a junior college before going to a state school.
Freshman,5,Northwest Florida State College is a wonderful school. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering furthering their education in any field.
Niche User,5,Northwest Florida State College is an amazing college with the nicest people I've ever met. The professors are very helpful and always make sure we have help when we need it.
Freshman,5,"I like this college because there is such a wide variety of things to do. We have a cafeteria with different cultural inspired food, a Barnes and Nobel bookstore and cafe. There are also so many places you can go on campus to receive academic help."
Senior,5,"A great, and inexpensive, school. Received am AA, and have returned for a Bachelor's degree.

Very down-to-Earth professors in the Management & Supervision degree plan."
Sophomore,5,"This college is amazing. There's a good range of classes for it being a small school, wonderful teachers, a gigantic library, and helpful, cheerful staff everywhere. Oh, and the food is awesome, in the cafeteria and in the vending machines! I've had such a good time at this sweet school."
Junior,5,"The professors are top notch. The class size is perfect where you can get one-on-one time with an actual professor and not an aide or intern. The students are very supportive, helpful and friendly. There is a great spirit on the campus. Sometimes parking can be an issue but that is a problem on every college campus. I have enjoyed my time here and look forward to my last two years to complete my Bachelor's in Elementary Education."
Niche User,5,Northwest florida state college is a college I plan on attending because it's something very efficient to me and local.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at NFSC was a wonderful experience; small campus where teachers can dedicate more one on one time with thier students. The quality of teaching was outstanding and the staff was always helpful, very corteous.  The curriculum was well rounded to prepare students for the future.  It became a four year college while I was still there earning accreditation for Nursing and Project Management. I would love to see them provide more bachelor's degree like computer science, Information technology, and other careers on demand."
Senior,5,"I don't have anything to tell you about this survey, but it can be like when I answer some questions that I am totally interest in for lots of scholarships."
College Sophomore,5,NWFSC is a great college to go to for students that aren't ready to go to a four year University.
College Freshman,5,I'm currently taking classes with professors that teach in the Nursing Program.
College Freshman,5,I've had some amazing professors at my college!
College Sophomore,5,Plenty of class availability for your schedule. I worked full-time and was able to keep a manageable school schedule to not be overworked or burdened.
College Sophomore,5,"it is very enjoyable, and the campus is nice."
College Sophomore,5,I act and the classes fit well around my schedule
College Freshman,5,It is easy to schedule classes around other responsibilities and professors are always helpful and understanding about conflicting commitments.
College Freshman,5,The online courses help to reinforce what we have learned in the traditional class setting.
Sophomore,4,I love this college because it is very affordable and convenient for me. It has a huge bookstore and very friendly staff that makes you feel welcomed every day. I would like for the college to have more extracurricular options and clubs/organizations.
Senior,4,"I have been enrolled at this college since 2013 and have had such a positive experience. If you’re looking for a quality education without being in debt for the next 20 years, this is the school for you. They have such a wide range of programs and one of the top nursing programs in the state!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors are great, the classes aren't too expensive. I wish student advisors were more helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Teachers are enthusiastic and approachable. Classes are well-structured, and lectures are usually easy to follow. Would prefer more classes be available at the  Fort Walton Beach campus, since having to drive to Niceville is a long commute."
Sophomore,4,I've been taking classes at NWFSC for 2 years and will be earning my Associates Degree from them in May. Its a great school for anyone who wants to stay in the area or at a smaller college. They have the lowest tuition rates in the state and you can get the same quality of education that you would at a larger university. The campus has a lot of resources and they're always trying to improve it. A lot of great energy here!
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Northwest is pretty good. Most of the professors care about students and their education. The downfall is that there is only one professor per category of class sometimes. Such as only one chemistry professor on the campus etc."
Freshman,4,I mean it’s a pretty basic state college to me. The professors (most) are pretty chill. They relate to students a lot and it makes me feel good about myself. We need a lot more here but I like it
Freshman,4,"NWFSC is a small and simple college. It is local and easy for me to get to without wasting gas as well as not being nearly as expensive as most colleges. The classrooms are more like high school-sized, so the students there are able to interact better with the teachers, which majority of the faculty and staff are kind and easy to talk to. The college also offers a free tutoring program at the school's library, a gym that is easy to access before and after classes, places to relax and complete homework or study for big tests, etc. Overall, NWFSC is a great local college to start at."
Senior,4,"I have been attending this college as a dual-enrolled student since 2017. The professors here are well-educated and kind. Their priority is to help the student be successful in their class. Even though this is a small campus, there is still a nice sense of community here. This campus is very safe and I feel secure attending class everyday."
Niche User,4,This college is very good community-wise and it offers a lot of opportunities for students and prospective students.
Niche User,4,"I loved going to college. I went to this University mainly while I was still in high school and they were great with my scheduling and treating me with the same intellect as regular college students. Great hours for the library, which I took advantage of, and great resources to help succeed. Great professors, all were very kind, very laid back and great at teaching the materials."
Niche User,4,"I am a high school student enrolled at the college's Collegiate High School. The community at NWFSC is quite welcoming, and it is not difficult to find a good lunch!"
Niche User,4,"It's a very nice school with dedicated teachers. Everything is kept up to date, it's only slightly difficult to meet with counselors. There are three campuses and they are all in nice surrounding cities. The main campus has great food and it's beautifully decorated."
Niche User,4,"So far, I enjoy everything NWFSC has to offer. The professors are great (most of them at least), the people are easy to connect with, and the campus is like any suburban area."
Sophomore,4,"Northwest Florida State College offers the small town feel. It's easier to interact with teachers, and the class sizes aren't overwhelming. Also offers multiple campuses in the general area. Unfortunately though because of it being a smaller community college, it is somewhat limited in amount of programs."
Sophomore,4,Northwest Florida State College is an amazing school. I am currently in the Recording Arts program and it really prepares you for the industry with real bands coming in to record music and students individually being able to practice mixing. The professors are friendly and willing to help students every step of the way.
Sophomore,4,"Northwest Florida is generally a high quality college even though it is the smallest and cheapest in the state. You can tell President Stephens deeply cares for his students and music. We have strong programs for education, vocal/musical theatre people, nursing, hospitality, a high quality music production program, and a welding program. Those are the ones I hear most about. Just beware some teachers as with any college, beware the websites as whoever made them could have made them way more logical and user-friendly, and beware that a lot of classes kind of leave you in the dark with grades so you'll have to keep good communications with your professors. Otherwise it's the cheapest way to get your associates in the state of Florida if you can afford the uber-expensive and limited rentals Niceville has."
Niche User,4,The professors at Northwest Florida can really be hit or miss. Some of the professor care a lot about what they are teaching and are really passionate about teaching while others couldn't care less.
Freshman,4,I have only taken two classes with this college. The professors were all great and more than willing to help you if you struggled. Their campus is easy to navigate and their facilities are in like new condition in most places. Their student service is relatively quick about helping you fix any problems you might have or pointing you in the direction of someone who can help. The surrounding immediate area is filled with beaches and sites to keep you plenty entertained.
Sophomore,4,"It is a great college to get started with your educational experience. I am so glad that I decided to start locally and begin my college education. The professors are always willing to help you. The class sizes are just right to where the professor gets to know you; you are not a number, but a person. I would like to see more classes offered for more specific majors (Geography major, but no classes offered in Geography at NWFSC). However, as a place to receive my A.A. degree, there is no better place to start."
Sophomore,4,"I have so far enjoyed my time at Northwest Florida State. The teachers have been kind, the classes enjoyable, and my desire to learn has definitely grown since starting their. The campus is beautiful and peaceful. My only wish is more clubs and more opportunities to be a part of student activities. I feel as if not enough activities are offered and I would love to have more opportunities to meet other like minded people."
Sophomore,4,"I like the professors in the math department, English department, and business department, and Science department. The history department has a poor American history professor and the college did not offer another American history professor. The camp-us s open but safe since they have a police academy and active police officers on site. I hope they improve some of their programs and hirer better qualified counselors."
Sophomore,4,"Northwest Florida State College is a great school to get a two year degree and their sports programs are fantastic. The campus has no dorms. Their ROTC program needs some work and communication responses from some teachers need to be improved, but other than that it is a great school for two year degrees and even some four year degrees."
Freshman,4,"Northwest Florida State is a small college located in the center of a little bit bigger town of Niceville. Since it's not a huge university, teachers know you on a first name basis and really interact with you during each class. I always feel safe walking from class to class or leaving because it seems like every time I walk outside and turn a corner a campus police officer is nearby ready to assist anyone. There are very few sports teams due to the population of the college but the men's and women's basketball, baseball, and softball teams all excel due to the commitment of the players and coaches. The campus itself has a mix of personalities where on one side of campus is a more nature oriented section with open areas and pine trees, while on the other are delicately placed statues and fountains giving it an artistic feel. All in all this is a great area to spend two years then transfer or stay all four years and be able to stay close to home in a more comfortable environment."
Niche User,4,northwest Florida college is a very rich in education school. exceeding with student each year ready to learn with a high exception . the teacher are kind and is ready to reason out students that are not quite sure on the lesson or problem being taught in class. i must say this college is increasing like high on my list to apply too
College Senior,4,My advisor has been awesome in helping me transfer
College Senior,4,The campus is small and easy to get around. Parking is horrible as there is never anywhere to park
College Senior,4,It has been great. Everyone is there to help you no matter your situation!
Recent Alumnus,4,On-line classes are easy and convenient for students who work.
College Junior,4,All of my classes transferred from my last school.
College Junior,4,I'm excited for the career prospects after I graduate the RN program.
College Junior,4,I'm a new student and will start classes in Fall 2016. I can tell you I've been incredibly impressed by the Nursing staff and the career prospects for RN graduates.
College Sophomore,4,they do your schedule to you
College Freshman,4,There are many classes to choose from and teachers are flexible.
College Freshman,4,Some online classes require more work than in-class and most professors are good about getting back to you in a timely manner.
College Freshman,4,I'm not a post-grad so I don't know about this response
College Freshman,4,"We have a lot of great professors, just look on ratemyprofessor.com"
College Freshman,4,I see career service fliers everywhere
College Sophomore,4,They have great hybrid classes to combine online with limited classroom experience
College Sophomore,4,They do a good job
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors are really good. Class size not too big for better class interaction.
College Sophomore,4,It has a great Education department for my degree.
College Sophomore,4,It's been good. Professors are really good. Low class size makes it enjoyable.
College Junior,4,I loved my online classes however I learned nothing. All the answers are available on quizlet.
College Junior,4,Being a nursing major is great. The teachers are very helpful and make it easy to apply to real world medicine.
College Junior,4,"The classes that are offered have a large array of possibilities. Transferring credits was never a problem and I really have not stumbled across any ludicrous experiences nor let down expectations. If I was unable to take a class then, chances are, there is an online option. I am a happy camper when it comes to academic flexibility."
College Junior,4,"The career services are like dictionaries of knowledge. They can answer any question, concern, confusion, complaint that a student may have. And if, on a blue moon, a student has a question that just completely is baffling, then the career services personnel hunt down the answer. Nonetheless, he overall experiences that I have had with them ended up with a happy student."
College Junior,4,"The professors are absolutely phenomenal. Very well educated and also very encouraging. The class sizes range anywhere from a group to a packed classroom of 30, of course, depending on the class. Some of the professors follow your ""basic"" teaching modules of ""write this down as I lecture"", while others follow the ""put your pens down and watch this cool thing"". You get the best of every teaching style."
College Junior,4,"Of course when speaking about the ""quality"" of anything, you also have to look at the student's desire and drive. A lazy student would say that everything is too difficult while a hard-driven student would take on anything and call it a good challenge. I would say that the employers recruiting game is strong, meaning they really grab you and guide you. The career center is exceptional, very informative and helpful."
College Junior,4,"The program sculpts and strengthens you so that you can fully accomplish and persevere in any field that you choose to pursue. The schedules adapt to your life instead of the other way around, sometimes there are classes that are not so flexible but that never stopped me. The workload is in between the crossroads of hair ripping and snoozing; just right, challenging, clever, and honestly building."
College Junior,4,"As a returning student, I was very glad to come back. This school really does teach you and takes the time to do so. The professors, well I can only speak on the behalf of those that I have come across, are very well knowledgable about what they teach and they tailor their knowledge around what you are needing to succeed. I could stay a college student here for a very long time if the adult life was not pounding at my door."
College Sophomore,4,there are many on campus opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"I am getting my AA, but it is nice."
College Sophomore,4,The Professors were great and really listened.
College Freshman,4,I dont know about any of the post grad stuff.
College Freshman,4,Good school certain teachers are bad.
College Junior,4,I enjoy how flexible my schedule can be and it works in well with my part-time job.
College Junior,4,"I have not taken any of the online courses at NWFSC. However, many of my friends say the online course are fun and reliable."
College Junior,4,"Most of my professors have been excellent in what they teach. However, you get a couple who know the information but have trouble teaching it to the students."
College Junior,4,"So far the courses I have been taking to major in biology are fascinating, but I'm not sure how they compare to a bigger universities courses."
Niche User,2,"I have mixed feelings about NWFSC. My advisor was not consistent and hardly available and I had a few online professors that were nearly entirely absent throughout the semester. When the school was notified, they didn't really seem to care.  On the other hand, some professors were great and I learned a great deal in their classes. Overall, I'm not impressed and in the middle of transferring to a new school."
Recent Alumnus,2,The career center at Niceville is not very helpful to all students.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The on campus career center at the Niceville campus isn't very helpful, it's small and they aren't helpful."
Recent Alumnus,2,They have one job fair a semester with only a couple options that only benefits a small group of people. They don't have alot of job opportunities for many different fields.
Recent Alumnus,2,Alot of my professors didn't care about their students. You will have either no homework or a ton of homework there is no in between. The all access gym is really nice and updated. I wish they had a pool to use though.
College Sophomore,2,"I did receive enough financial aid for tuition, but not for my housing and food. And school does not advertise their scholarships to students so most students do not know all the scholarships that are offered at school."
College Junior,2,No campus aesthetic. None. Idk about the athletic center. That very well be the main event of the campus. Library is nothing special at all. Trying to print from the computer is a HEADACHE. Student center is a joke.
College Junior,2,"I barely knew what the graduation process was. I'm guessing if I wasn't solely an online student there might be more communication but I just applied for graduation and hoped for the best. I have still have yet to hear about any ""post grad""/alumni opportunities but I guess I'll have to poke around the school to find out."
College Junior,2,"I'm transferring out of a PWI that was also private so I may be spoiled. However, I took mostly online classes and they were super easy. I'm glad it helped fluffed up my grades but I enjoy a challenge. I wish they had a psychology degree but I guess it was for the best because I would still be at NWFSC."
College Junior,2,I have visited more colleges with more to offer and know what this school is missing.
College Freshman,2,"Nothing really sets us apart, except for our basketball team. It's a junior college, and most of us are just waiting till we can transfer to a bigger university. "
College Freshman,2,"The people i've met are very nice, but its a very calm school. There are no parties (which isn't always a bad thing) but that also means theres very little social interaction within college students. Don't get me wrong i've only been here half a year, and i've met some great friends, but like I said, very limited activities. "
College Junior,2,"A lot of classes I want are only offered one day, so it's hard to work full time and try to be a full time student, especially when the classes I need all clash."
College Student,2,"I'm not familiar with the computer labs, printers, etc. No one speaks about it. It's like pulling teeth to get information out of anyone."
College Freshman,2,"I love the school's class size and I definitely feel like I get my money's worth because of the one on one attention that is available. However, our financial aid office is terrible. They are very unhelpful and everyone tells students different information. It needs to be more organized."
College Senior,2,It needs better security obviously since some of our i formation was accessed and leaked out; ss # and such.  It is slow the technicians never get back with you for assistance.
College Senior,2,Availability of classes and accreditation can be improved upon!!!
Recent Alumnus,2,Tuition Assistance – The employees at the tuition assitance office were rude and extremely unwilling to help.  The more questions I asked the more irritated the employees were.  Got only the bare minimum assistance and missed out on an opportunity due to lack of information from employees.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Helpful If You Plan on Getting a Career They Offer. Unless you plan to transfer to another college with what you want to major in, the college career center only has information for their current careers they offer so no use to people who want to transfer."
College Junior,2,"Not Enough Clinical Time – In the nursing program there seems to be quite a bit of busy work, tons of self teaching, and barely any clinical time.  One of the most important factors about being a nurse is the medications and the entire pharmacology course is self taught, ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,Horrible FInancial Aid process. They don't tell you everything upfront so lots of delays in paperwork processing and receiving awards.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This is just a community college, a place to get your 2 year degree and nothing more."
College Student,1,"The student body at my school are really rude. No one talks to anyone, and or they ignore you."
College Senior,1,It could use more!  It almost feels like an old abandoned school.
College Senior,1,"I do not know anything about my schools career services. with this said because I do not know, it must be only marginal"
College Senior,1,Keep to Yourself – I wouldn't be friends with anybody I met in my classes. Lots of weird kids and nerds. Anybody else is over 40. Sign up for classes with your friends and you'll be fine.
College Freshman,1,Alumni - what alumni!? ...Alumni..? what alumni!? After graduating from the school thats it! Good-bye have a nice life.
College Freshman,1,"Course Work – I've taken online courses previously and will never again unless there is NO other choice! Me and other students had A LOT of difficulty with the program(s), getting in touch with the professor, and understanding the material and due dates. When I stated my concerns to the professor I received no help at all!"

Niche User,5,"The online learning experience at FIT is nothing less than amazing.  The professors are wonderful, the courses are manageable (even for someone working full time!)"
Niche User,5,They offer an amazing education.  I took online coursework through Florida Tech and thoroughly enjoyed their classes.  I highly recommend attending their online program for ABA!
Graduate Student,5,I have taken all of my classes online and not had any issues. Florida Tech uses Canvas as their instruction platform and it seems to work extremely well for what is needed.
Freshman,5,"There are plenty of universities throughout the U.S. As an undergraduate student at Florida Institute of Technology, I highly recommend and suggest taking a look at this university and consider it. Florida Tech offers the critical attention that every student needs, and it brings to their freshmen a smooth transition to college life. Also, the university is well-organized and is prepared and ready for any unexpected event such as this pandemic. Their job is to educate students, no matter the situation we're passing through, by taking safety measures. It gives information with clarity and ensures their students had completed training related to Title IX and college transition. They have friendly and charismatic staffs that are always at the disposal of their students in anything they need. Florida Tech is a great place to start, and I don't regret choosing this university, which offers high-level education and is one of the best universities in the nation for return on investment!"
Freshman,5,"Even though we're going through a pandemic, Florida Tech takes safety seriously, and it is the number one priority in the university. It is the student choice and will to either take their classes on-campus, remotely, or half classes online and half on-campus. I was impacted by this pandemic indirectly, and for prudent and wise reasons, I am currently taking my classes remotely. My online experience with Florida Institute of Technology is excellent, extraordinary, and exceptional. They provide all the necessary resources for their remote students and ensure all their students are learning efficiently.
  Furthermore, the university has excellent personnel and staff in which they kindly support their remote students at any time. Florida Tech uses a platform called Canvas, where their students can do their assignments, homework, quizzes, exams, and join their live-class session! With all this, it seems as if you are taking your classes face-to-face."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my time at Florida Tech. The faculty and staff are supportive. The classes are rigorous, practical, and tied to real world problems. I feel prepared for my career and know that I can flex around whatever confronts me thanks to my training and education at Florida Tech!"
Junior,5,"My older sister attended and graduated, so I knew a lot about the school before I went. Personally, I love it there! The campus is beautiful and there is so much diversity. They hold an international fest once a year to celebrate it. The academics are tough, I'm not going to lie, but there are tons of academic support centers to help you with whatever you need. Plus, teachers are always at office hours and enjoy seeing you. I am a member of three clubs on campus and they are enjoyable. The cafeteria food is good. It is a big campus and parking is sparse. A skateboard or bike is not a bad idea if you live on campus. Dorms are okay, depending on where you live. Very small rooms though. Overall, I'm thrilled."
Junior,5,Great support from Bisk Representative. The school has a simple and easy to use Canvas layout and great instructors that care.
Junior,5,Good online platform. The school uses Canvas and uses a Bisk couch/representative that helps you with any issues you may have.
Alum,5,This school had such passionate professors who were highly involved in their field. You could essentially see what kind of work you could be doing when you graduate. There are plenty of clubs to join and events to participate in.
Freshman,5,"People are very nice, Excellent school to go, Very responsive, and has good sportsmanship, Easily to understand"
Freshman,5,My online experience was a good experience to learn from meeting new people and meeting the professors with them teaching us what we need for our future careers
Freshman,5,All the classes got moved online and i enjoyed all except one. It was the professors fault tho because he didnt know how to work the apps.
Niche User,5,"It was a pleasant visit. I am attending later in the next year and hope to highly progress with an education from this school. It is perfect for my my major, Ocean Engineering, and has lots of opportunity. I hope to greatly progress my future after leaving this school with a degree."
Freshman,5,Great location and weather. Diverse student body with excellent professors. Many majors to chose from with a lot of help in each choice. Student life is good with the beach being close by and the parties are decent. The male-female split is 55-45which is good for a tech school.
Niche User,5,"My experience there was very interesting because they seemed mostly serious with the technology they have over there from Engineering,Physics, and other Stem majors. I was just there for a tour."
Alum,5,"Great military friendly college with flexible learning options for the modern student. I completed my bachelors in Business Administration/Management online and successfully graduated with honors. I attribute my success to the user friendly resources available for online students as well as dedicated and fair professors. I was able to utilize military tuition assistance to cover all of my tuition costs. The school is also continuing to become more recognized as a prestigious learning institution and I feel I am of equal or greater qualifications than many of my professional peers with degrees from UCF, Auburn, Rollins and other major colleges."
Niche User,5,This school is amazing. Incredible diversity. I am impressed with all of the professors. The school size is small enough where everyone can receive a proper education.
Alum,5,Great prospects upon graduation. Do not expect this college to be a party school. Professors are great and I would partake in many more clubs if I were to relive college. Be ahead of your classes and you would land a great job after college. GET AN INTERNSHIP. Internships can be easily obtained as a student of Florida Tech. It is your best chance of getting a good job after college.
Freshman,5,I love the diversity of FIT.  I have met some amazing people from so many different regions of the world.  The professionalism of the staff is exceptional.
Niche User,5,"Florida Tech is such a beautiful, well kept campus offering state of the art facilities for my child.  We couldn't have made a better choice for her academic career!"
Freshman,5,The online program has been excellent so far! I receive weekly phone calls from my advisor to keep me on track and check in on my progress. They truly seem like they care about my success and I'm not just another number.
Freshman,5,they have anything you'd be interested in studying. great professors and they always go above and beyond
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman student.  Since I accepted I would have like to receive more information about the program as it directly related to the major for which i registered under - which is actually incorrect on my account.  i feel that as I have pointed out some errors things on my account took a while to correct if at all.
Senior,5,"It is a fantastic experience being a student here at Florida Tech. It is relatively a small campus compared to many other universities, but here at FIT a student always gets one-on-one help from professors and staff."
Freshman,5,"Its a small campus but some event, either reslife or sports or campus activities is going on almost every weekend, plus you can go to the beach whenever. The classes require you to put the work in, but its worth it overall with all of the connections and access to research and work you get before and after you graduate"
Freshman,5,great staff  Specially Jomanda if you have any questions she always try to help you in the best way  she  can. always returning your email or voicemail in a as soon as possible. I highly recommend it
Senior,5,"This is one of the best schools in the country. The professors genuinely care about their students, and there are many experience opportunities for students. There are also over 100 student organizations for students to get involved in."
Sophomore,5,"As an active student, the best thing Florida Tech is that there are truly no limits in what you want to accomplish. There are so many resources and opportunities available to students that you really get to do exactly what you love. Evan's Library is one of the best libraries I've ever set foot in. The same campus helps students make friends easily. The only downside to FIT is the party scene, but partying is overrated in my book. If you are looking for a school to build a career on, this is the school for you."
Graduate Student,5,"I am an online graduate student who is currently an Active Duty Army Officer. FIT has been extremely helpful with regard to Tuition Assistance, course flexibility, and various other topics. The professors are very professional and are truly there to help their students succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"The professors in the Graduate Programs at FIT are top quality, and extremely interactive with the students and learning experience.  They provide a comfort level for students to ask ""stupid"" questions, and are always finding new technologies to help increase the value and benefit of the programs."
Sophomore,5,"FIT has so many things to offer all of it's students in the form of career choices/ studies, clubs, sports.  The small classroom ratio allows students and professors to get to know eachother."
Sophomore,5,My school is the best. The teachers are amazing and the work is very easy to do based on our schedule!
Freshman,5,Great school and it has a beautiful campus. Currently they are adding more plants to their forest so it can become an actual rainforest. So much goes on here such as haunted houses for halloween. There is so much to do and beautiful facilities!
Alum,5,Florida Tech has a top of the line computer science and engineering programs.  I just received a masters in the field of computer science from there and my son is attending there as well. He is currently is a junior majoring in Electrical Engineering.
Junior,5,Excellent communication with students.  Has a very user friendly course program.  Very informative and purpose driven.
Alum,5,FIT was a great experience. I am currently planning to return for another degree. The diversity is wonderful for learning about other cultures as well as the wide variety of fields to choose from for your career. I highly recommend FIT as an excellent educational opportunity.
Graduate Student,5,"Went orignally for Flight school transferred into Science. Amazing courses and Teachers.. Great Campus Life. Was on Crew team, Fraternity, school paper. lots to do, but be careful,  School in Florida has lots of distractions and the beach doesnt help."
Freshman,5,"Awesome faculty! Really makes me feel good!  Great food! Great dorms, I love where I stay.  There are a lot of events that make this school fun.  It can be a hard school, so dedication is needed to persist through challenges.  Only bad thing is the internet there is not that good at all, goes out way too much for how much the school costs."
Graduate Student,5,"I have been a student of FIT since 2011 and I have loved it.  I found some of my teacher really loved what they were teaching and it showed when they would teach you.  I especially like how many of the classes taught you real world computer examples that I was able to use right away.  I had some instructors who gave some trouble, but all in all, there were a lot of good instructors.  Some instructors had a prude style of teaching that helped with his or her class.  This is a wonderful school to learn from and to share your ideas with your classmates.  Wish they had a Phd program online for IT classes.  Maybe in the future, there will more PhD classes added to the programs."
Junior,5,Small campus and class sizes which makes everything more intimate. Would like more food options on campus.
Sophomore,5,"FIT offers a hands on education and prepares students for internships and  jobs. The classes are rigorous, but worth it. Some professors are extremely good, others are sub par. There are also field courses, which are extremely valuable. FIT has excellent diversity, which they represent at the International Fair and Africa night. Additionally, there are international food nights at the dining hall. There is a wide variety of food and always healthy options available at the dining locations around campus. There are ample opportunities to get involved on campus, so the student life is good. The dorms are a bit old and have a few problems, but they aren't awful. The campus is very beautiful (especially the Botanical Garden) and feels completely safe. It is very close to the beach and  downtown, so there are some things to do."
Junior,5,Florida Institute of Technology is a fantastic school that I highly recommend. They genuinely care about their students and ensuring their success.
Niche User,5,The staff and students are very friendly and the campus is peaceful.  It is in a nice area and there are many opportunities for students to be active with the community.
Freshman,5,Excellent Academics and awesome professors. Florida Tech is a tier 1 STEM university. Florida Tech has some degrees that can be completed completely online.
Freshman,5,The advisors have been such a great help with getting all of my documents needed in order to start school on time. They are very on top of everything that’s needed.
Sophomore,5,"Florida Tech is a very diverse school with many different activities provided on campus, from sports to clubs and on campus events."
Freshman,5,"Florida Institute of Technology was my dream school. I first learned about it when I was a freshman in High School. I love the small classroom sizes. Also, the ability to be involved in research projects is amazing, and intend to  take advantive of it."
Freshman,5,I love the location and the academic services that Florida Tech has to offer. The school is close to the beach and the downtown has many restaurants and shops. The school offers a wide range of free services to students to help with academics. For example there are free tutoring services for math and english.
Senior,5,"Great school. Not to big, good location. Great professors. Very personal touch. Even though an expensive private school, they give out excellent scholarships so attending is affordable."
Sophomore,5,"I am only an online student at the university, so I'll say positive things that FIT provides to online students. FIT provides 24/7 support to students like myself on tutoring, financial aid, class counseling, and more. The professors and staffs help you reach your goal in earning a degree the same way as if you were on campus."
Alum,5,Received my Bachelors in Arts. Very professional and experienced professors. Always available for help. Curriculum prepared me for the real world in marketing.
Graduate Student,5,"This is a great university. The classes are tough, especially the math classes. I do feel that that toughness is preparing students for the real world."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent university, outstanding cadre of professors, very professional administrative personnel that will help and guide you through the necessary steps in achieving your goals."
Alum,5,"Online student; but the connections made you feel like you wee part of the campus community. I went to the campus in Melbourne, Florida to graduate this past summer and all the students that graduated whether on campus or online were all celebrated as one !"
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely LOVE. There is nothing that I can say negatively about this school. The instructors, staff and support are absolutely incredible. I have never felt shrugged off or like I am just a number. I wouldn't choose any other school over Florida Tech. GO Panthers!"
Freshman,5,I love Florida Tech they have so many classes to choose from and the teachers are awesome are there for all your needs.
Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is friendly. Lots of activities and clubs to participate in. Campus is very well maintained. Lots of opportunities for extra help.
Freshman,5,"I am a incoming freshman to Florida Tech and during the week of orientation I started to feel at home with the school. I started to picture myself receiving more then an education, but a family. The values , students, and campus is a unexplainable feeling that show be experienced when starting the next chapter in ones life."
Freshman,5,"I am a military spouse living in Europe. I have a daughter which I'd rather home school and FIT gives me the opportunity to complete my degree entirely online. The staff is very helpful and always acts with a sense of urgency whenever I have a question/issue. The professors also challenge us, discussion boards are always filled with diversity, and online programs used for class are not only straight forward but actually teach quite well. I appreciate the school for going the extra mile to prepare me as a student."
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student at Florida Tech, I have had a rather positive time at the school. The classes are actually beneficial, the professors are helpful, and the tuition is quite reasonable. Occasionally the assignments require quite some time to be graded."
Alum,4,There were always lectures available online to students so if you missed anything you could catch up on your own time.
Alum,4,"I've taken a few courses online and as with any online class of course there is the chance of technical issues. However, beyond that the professors were well versed in the teaching software and made the online classroom into a functional learning environment."
Alum,4,"It was a very pretty campus and an amazing location. The facilities were really nice and the professors were generally great. The small class sizes were great for in depth learning opportunities and several opportunities to get involved in research. The school had several student organizations, if you have an interest there's an organization for you! It was overall a pretty amazing school."
Junior,4,"I completed the Spring 2020 semester online due to COVID-19, and the professors made the transition quite easy. You could tell they were working hard to give the students the best experience possible, and made it known that anyone with issues or questions was welcome to contact them. The professors and school were very understanding of the situation."
Junior,4,"Florida Tech is a great place to go to school, with countless opportunities and majors to study. The community is small, which allows you to connect easily with professors and people in the community. Everyone I have met is so nice and welcoming, and I couldn't have asked for a better start to college. Everyone takes academics very seriously, but also knows how to have a good time. The easy access to the beach and proximity of malls/attractions makes FIT super fun."
Senior,4,After I finished the spring term for online classes. The things didn't turn out that kinda bad. Students and professors all know how hard to transfer face to face to online. All faculty members are love to help and did help a lot.
Senior,4,"Everything is fine, but the tuition is not worth it. Due to the big change this year, FIT did give us some discount on summer classes and have P/NC police to help us get through this difficult situation."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the school, however it is very expensive for what it offers, other than that it is a great school"
Freshman,4,"Florida Tech is a wonderful place to focus on your grades and has amazing opportunities to help advance your career!  Social scene is kind of small, but it is a great environment overall."
Sophomore,4,I am currently attending Florida Tech and am enjoying it very much. It is a great school with majority friendly students and staff. Florida Tech also has a large variety of opportunities and ways to help you while you are attending and once you graduate.
Sophomore,4,Florida Tech is at first glance a great opportunity but the longer you stay the more you start to realize that the main goal of most of the classes and teachers is to weed people out.  Take this for example when you register for classes they don't show you the professor's names because they know that they aren't good.  Other than the small things like that the school is very secure and has a lot of amenities.
Niche User,4,Florida Institue of Technology is a great Engineering School and has many connections in the industry which lead to amazing job opportunities. The college life is thrilling since it is very close to the beaches and the Florida heat supplements my point. It is an enjoyable experience to be there. I would like to see FIT increase their scholarship amounts for international students.
Freshman,4,"Florida Tech is a small private school in Melbourne, FL. I recommend students coming to Florida Tech to have a car with them if possible due to how hard it is to get around the city and to other places. Panther Dining Hall is an easy option for food, but people may get tired of it easily."
Sophomore,4,"I love Florida Tech. The flight program is amazing, the school is close to the beach and other large cities such as Orlando and Miami. Also, The peopel I've met here will be life long friends. I have lerned to grow into a better person and don't feel that I'm just a number or another person."
Senior,4,"For being such a large school, the classroom sizes are small for a better learning experience. All of my professors have been extremely helpful when needed and you can definitely count on them for any help or questions regarding anything. I hope to continue my education there and absolutely love it! Could not have asked for a better school to attend."
Senior,4,It is a great school. It provides a small class setting that allows students to get closer to professors
Sophomore,4,"If you feel at home in a small school setting, Florida Institute of Technology is the perfect place to call home for your college time."
Junior,4,"The Florida Institute of Technology provides substantial education from industry certified and heavily accredited professors. You can expect to be taught everything you need, in order to find success in your chosen career path. You’ll meet a wide variety of students from all over the world. The campus is full of culture and diversity. I can’t say the same for the local area, unfortunately. You will hear talk of “Melboring.”"
Graduate Student,4,"Great professors, small school. Overall, good experience. Not a party school whatsoever. Huge focus on athletics, they give out a ton of athletic scholarships.  They also have a huge focus on engineering, nice engineering lounge. If you want to pursue a degree in engineering, this is a great school for that."
Senior,4,"Student Advisors are very helpful in the beginning of your journey as a new student. They make time for you at your convenience and give you recommendations on course load, books, and future planning. However, after the first year, that diminishes and you're on your own."
Junior,4,it is a very nice college to attend. There is a nice beach nearby and the food is good. The astronomy classes are very interesting.
Senior,4,"In terms of what I liked about Florida Institute of Technology, there were several aspects that come to mind. The college is very diverse with several different cultures represented, which allows the students to learn more about different countries. The classes are challenging which causes us to try our best to do well and in turn strengthens our level of understanding."
Sophomore,4,"FIT is honestly a really good school. The only problems I see with the school are 1) the wifi goes out randomly, which is weird for a tech school, 2) some of the professors don't seem to be the most qualified for their position and/or are not as good at teaching as they are at research, and 3) if you don't live on campus your first year then you have less of a chance of finding good friends. Other than that, though, the classes are challenging enough and the work is usually productive and helpful in your learning, which is definitely appreciated."
Sophomore,4,"This school is really tough when it comes to academics, however, it really prepares you for what comes after college. Great professors and very diverse."
Junior,4,"Majority of the course instructors have been great. I have gained a great deal of information from taking courses at Florida Tech. The financial aid process is not always simple which can bring stress during the courses, but overall it is a good school."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed my time at FIT because of the people I have been able to meet as well as the educational opportunity I've been able to receive.
Freshman,4,"Though the environment is light and fun, academics standing and expectations are very tough. The school do facilities multiple academic support centers for all subjects matters to see students through the rigor of the curriculum. Classes are small, so all your professors know you and attendance is mandatory. There is much to do to keep you active outside of academics, from social and cultural clubs, dance groups, academic societies and non varsity team sports. 

The food selection and flavors are just amazing in every eating location. There are several pools throughout the campus to keep you cool. A relaxing botanical gardens on campus makes for the perfect serene place to get away from it all."
Graduate Student,4,Structure of the MBA online program allows for focusing on one class at a time.  Instructors are easy to communicate with and workload is not overwhelming for being only 8-week terms.
Sophomore,4,"I go to the online school, but I got to say that the classes are really geared for you to learn something. You have to be motivated to teach yourself, since the teachers also teach the on campus classes usually as well. They have video lectures, a detailed printable notes list for each section, and a detailed classroom with reminders on what to do each week. The online Discussions are interesting, and even when you have to write a paper, the teachers give you a wide set of choices to chose from so you can pick a topic that interests you."
Senior,4,"Great school! Good facilities, nice professors, and a great diversity of students from all over the world."
Junior,4,So far I have had a very good experience at Florida Institute of Technology. I love how diverse the students on campus are which provides an opportunity to learn about other cultures and customs. The academic program in my biomedical engineering major is difficult and competitive.  Most of the professors are willing to help their students and relay their relevant course information well. It doesn't get better than living at the beach!
Niche User,4,"FIT is a diverse school based right on the Florida Space Coast that offers a world-class education in a variety of STEM fields from Mechanical Engineering to the Biological Sciences. With under 10,000 actively enrolled, FIT offers a small-school environment with student backgrounds from across the nation and the world. Yet arguably its greatest asset is its community leadership, as the university funds scholarships and STEM competitions for primary and secondary school students throughout Brevard County, FL."
Freshman,4,"Florida Institute of Technology is an exceptional college with challenging, but beneficial classes and professors. The campus environment is very warm, accepting, and stress-free. In the other hand, the facilities can be given improvement for it to become an even better school."
Freshman,4,"I have taken about 6 classes with Florida Tech so far, and during all my classes the professors were very helpful and quick with responding to my questions. I have all been helped whether its for enrolling in my next class or getting my textbooks for class on time. This college is very helpful and has a great staff, that is willing to help anytime. So far I wouldn't recommend any change right now. Keep on the good work!!!"
Sophomore,4,The school is small and allows for students to have a more personal connection with teachers if help is needed. Small class sizes allows for students to feel more comfortable inside of the classroom instead of feeling crowded like at other big schools. Students come from all around the globe in order to attend this high end school and receive a quality education that will last a lifetime. Meeting great teammates and friends that I will have forever is the highlight of attending the university for myself.
Freshman,4,Florida Tech is one of the best colleges i have experienced. Florida Tech has a great number of nice and well rounded people to meet. The professors are always helping students pass no matter what.  One thing that i would change is the the amount of campus activities. There are few and not every may be interested in what is available. Besides that Florida Institute of Technology is a wonder place for students who are interested in the technical world.
Freshman,4,I like how up close and personal the classes are. The only thing I wish to change is the area that the college is in. Melbourne is a town that nothing interesting happens in; there is nothing for a young adult to do.
Freshman,4,Florida Tech has such a beautiful campus. I'll be studying online to receive my Bachelor degree in Applied Psychology. It motivates me to do well.  It is awesome that it is a tier one accredited university.
Sophomore,4,"FIT is a great school catered toward education, as well as opportunities for jobs outside of college. This college is always growing for the better and it deserves much recognition for its plethora of accomplishments!"
Junior,4,"Florida Institute of Technology has opened up many opportunities for me, such as choosing from a diverse selection of courses that fulfill my major. It has allowed me to be a part of a stimulating program in which I will be able to find a job afterward that meets my needs and leads me to success. I have met academic geniuses, including astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and have had the privaledge of learning under published academics with a passion for their subject. Overall, my experience at Florida Institute of Technology has been a great one. I am a member of two clubs, a student athlete, and a successful student. The challenges that Florida Institute of Technology has thrown at me have prepared me for life on my own and built me to the person I am. Being a panther was originally just a choice, but after my years here, it feels more like a privaledge."
Freshman,4,"What I like about this university is that it is extremely diverse. The ratio of native Floridians to U.S. residents from other states to international students is around 1:1:1. I greatly enjoy being able to meet and connect with so many different people from so many diverse and culturally sound places. Something that I would like to see changed would be the amount of intramural sports offered at the school. there are not too many options to choose from, so that would be a nice change to see. "
Freshman,4,"I'm a new enrollee at Florida Tech. So far, the representatives who have been helping me get through orientation and set up my financial aid and online accounts have been very helpful and quick to respond. The school has the type of degree that I am looking for, and it is online, which is exactly what I need. The online account is a little confusing, as there are two to three different sites that you need to get into, but once you've figured it out, it's easy to navigate."
College Senior,4,Campus security's presence is very well known on campus. I never feel uncomfortable walking around campus at any given time.
College Senior,4,"Greek life on campus has its difficulties with management, but overall it is great. A good amount of students go Greek and as long as you show interest it is easy to find a fit somewhere with diverse options. The Greek community is generally tight-knit. The school has a Greek Village for fraternities and sororities without off-campus housing, which are probably the best options for ""on-campus living."" Though it is about two miles from campus."
College Freshman,4,Security patrols on the daily and they do a good job
College Freshman,4,"The teacher are hard on students, but only in the best of ways. They want each of us to come to our full potential."
College Junior,4,I just started and so far its fine
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is great to make friends and get to know people outside of your classes. There are activities but not everybody goes. They hold movie nights, free food, etc. The important thing to consider is that the RA's are mostly nice and will spare you if you are nice. Rooms are not luxury-style. When i got my first dorm I was disappointed. I expected a cleaner place. Facilities do maintenance regularly. PanthAIR, the school's WiFi, is slower in the dorms around 30-50 Mbps per device. It is also not the best in reliability when the network is crowded. The oldest building is Brownlie."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is a great school to learn more than what is taught in classes. You can get involved in research and participate in a lot of clubs since the school is small. Professors care about you and if you work with them for a certain amount of time you are sure to get a TA position if you are willing to stay for grad school. It pays off and you learn. A lot of employers around that hire US citizens mostly. You get to meet people from all over the world, some are weird, others are really fun."
College Sophomore,4,The school offers so much opportunity for students to grow in their field and I feel it is amazing.
College Senior,4,"I feel completely safe on campus, even when attending night classes."
College Senior,4,The school has recently added more sports so that the school can compete with others.
College Senior,4,"FIT is a great school, it is just that it is very expensive!"
College Sophomore,4,Most of my teachers really care about their students and have a strong passion for their subjects.
College Sophomore,4,For freshman the best housing is CV and the worst is anything in the quad.
College Sophomore,4,It definitely comes with a price being in a varsity sport but the accommodations make it worth it.
College Sophomore,4,Most teachers really care about their students and subjects they teach.
Recent Alumnus,4,I'm sure it is great. I am an online student though so I have never lived on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Being a Greek myself makes me a little biased obviously, but I will be honest. Greek life has its ups and downs. At FIT there are 8 fraternities and 3 sororities that all have housing in a nice, large apartment complex called Panther Bay/ Greek Village. Being Greek at FIT, you'll find that its not all about partying all of the time. The Greek life is very community oriented and are generally built on the concept of making better men and women for society by helping them grow and mature in a safe environment. For the most part Greek life is respected and generally liked by most campus staff and non-Greek students. It's a great way to meet like minded individuals on campus and build lifelong friendships. It is also a great way to find people to network with and make connection to make strides towards achieving a decent career."
Senior,2,Very difficult to learn from and some teacher were not accommodating to the new system. I found a lot of teachers would not be flexible with students who were in different time zones which was frustrating.
Niche User,2,"I like that Florida Institute Technology specialize in Engineering. They don't offer enough academic supports to students who struggle academically. The Professors don't do enough to help students to pass there classes to graduate. There is very limited scholarships available to international students who make up 80% of the student body. In my opinion Teacher are not interested in students succeeding academically. If you can't pay you are put out, it become your problem, keep moving."
College Senior,2,"I have never lived on campus, but have been in most dorms on campus. The best housing is nice; however, you are going to pay big for it. The other housing really is not that good and is still fairly expensive."
College Freshman,2,The amount of money put into FIT does not clearly show in the prison cell they call housing. One has to pay the equivalent of buying a house to get a decent dorm.
College Freshman,2,Physics department head is the biggest jerk anyone will ever encounter.
College Freshman,2,It's not a fun atmosphere
College Freshman,2,Not a big part and little info about them
College Freshman,2,"I am living at Champbell Hall at the Quad Room, and these rooms are not what they offer in the website. The building was built in 1961 and everything got stuck in the 60's, the whole structure and facilities are kind of too old. Bathrooms are not the cleanest comparing it with some study aboard schools that I have been. The rooms have central-AC, but like it does not exist. So, I conclude that the housing might be expensive for what you are receiving in return; but, you can still survive."
College Junior,2,"I'm not a nightlife person but from what I hear, you have too drive to orlando if you want good nightlife."
College Junior,2,"From what I have heard, the financial Aide staff is not very helpful and causes problems often."
College Junior,2,"There is nothing unless you go downtown, and even that isn't that great. No real transportation unless there is a major school event. Parking is really bad for major events. No real club scene in the area, have to travel to Orlando."
College Freshman,2,I hear a lot of car owners complain about parking spots. I do not have a car yet so I cannot say much.
College Freshman,2,Area is boring for nightlife
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of open spots
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot to choose from and quality varies, many times to the extreme bad!"
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of variety
College Junior,2,"Florida Tech is not keen on going smoothly with anything, honestly."
College Freshman,2,"It's a science school in a sleepy beachside town. Unless you're partying with homeless people in Downtown Melbourne, you're attending Charity Benefits on the beach with people more than twice your age. Parties are weird in Melbourne and the nightlife is practically non-existent."
College Junior,2,There are fast food restaurants but not exactly close and not open late. Restaurants are scattered around the city but difficult to get to without personal transportation.
College Junior,2,"It is very difficult to get enough financial aid to cover tuition, room and board. It takes multiple attempts at getting aid that you are eligible for and deserve. There are even instances where renewable rewards are not added each year and you have to argue with financial aid to add it back. Their first suggestion is always to search for private loans."
College Junior,2,It's an hour from Orlando. That's about the best thing about it.
College Junior,2,"The public transportation is almost non-existent. They only come once an hour and stop running at 8 pm during the week, earlier on Saturday, and don't run on Sundays. Campus trolleys help getting around campus. The campus is small but for those who live a good distance away off campus, it really is cumbersome."
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is not a party school. There are not a lot of options in the immediate area in the way of bars/clubs. There are a few, but not as many as you may expect in an area so close to the beach."
College Senior,2,"Some of our teams are good, however, no one every hears about them. We have about ten different sports for guys and girls to play for varsity and then we have intramural sports. School pride is definitely not seen at Florida Tech, but it might get there one day."
College Junior,2,"The school has a comfortable environment, but don't feel that you need to be careless with simple task."
College Junior,2,the transportation isnt anything to brag about at the university.
College Junior,2,The are important and have the financial investment to  grow with time.
Recent Alumnus,2,They are not as active as the Greeks in bigger schools.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's Florida. The style is very laid back. I'm very fashionable so I graded the style as a C.
College Junior,2,The cost is $120 and if you don't get there early enough it is almost impossible to find a parking spot.
College Junior,2,"It is a very rich school, if you don't have money don't expect to do much. If you're international things are much better. Minority Americans are not treated with much respect."
College Sophomore,2,I could not find any scholarships to apply for the first year I attended Florida Institute of Technology. I am hoping that I will see them offer more scholarship options in the future.
College Sophomore,2,"There are some really dumpy dorms on campus, but the upper classmen housing is decent-albeit more expensive than normal. There are some res-halls that are much nicer for freshmen but for an extra cost. My biggest complaint is that everything is too expensive in general."
College Senior,2,"Hard to find a parking spot during high-traffic hours. Recently built parking garage, but is located at a distance from most classrooms."
College Senior,2,"Small town atmosphere. Questionable neighborhoods nearby. Does not really feel like a ""college town."""
College Senior,2,Small athletic program with a seemingly uninterested fan base. New football team indicates signs of future growth.
College Freshman,2,The new trolley system is not efficient and few students use it. The school was not designed with this service in mind and the stops aren't very close to the classes or dorms. It is a good way to get to off campus locations such as the football stadium or downtown Melbourne.
College Junior,2,"Florida Institute of Technology is a ""clean"" school, meaning that there's no wild party. In addition, Florida Institute of Techology has a trolley system in which it provide ride to anyone who want a ride around school. During the weekend at night, the trolley take student to downtown Melbourne to enjoy the city."
College Sophomore,2,"While there is a beach and a little bit of nightlife for those over 21, there's not much in the way of attractions in Palm Bay. I've lived her for about 12 years now and all I can ever find to do is movies or one of the local paintball parks on the weekend."
College Freshman,2,Don't drink or use drugs and you should be fine with all the security.
Sophomore,1,"I was transgender at Florida Tech and here's my experiences.
I wasn't allowed to transfer into housing that matched my gender identity until they put me in single housing because I couldn't be in the women's dorm.
Professors sir'd and misgendered me when I was wearing women's clothing. They have no sensitivity training. 
I had issues with my roommate and his friends deadnaming and misgendering me on purpose and the school didn't do anything to help me.
I was misgendered in the LGBTQ+ club on campus, too.

Here's my advice. If you're LGBTQ+, specifically transgender, you deserve better than Florida Tech. I'm not the only trans person at F.I.T. I knew who went through this, but I'm the only one brave enough to tell you that this school won't look after you."
Junior,1,Online classes are great except some of the teachers don’t help you out if you need help. You have to try to keep ahead of the assignments to hand them on the due date.
Junior,1,The teachers don’t care about helping their students out. The campus is pretty nice. The security department does a great job in keeping the students safe
College Junior,1,This is an online grad program.
College Junior,1,This is an online Graduate program.
College Junior,1,"I doubt I will even have my first day as the administration people are incompetent at everything but cashing their paychecks, can't hold onto transcripts, can't download transcripts, can't keep track of payments, can't ship ""welcome kits,"" can't ship books.  They are great at calling and email to have student fix their screw ups to the point of harassment."
College Freshman,1,Delta Tau Delta is the worst one on campus.
College Freshman,1,They party very often but they also do some things that are good for the community. It seems like they do it because they are forced to.
College Freshman,1,It's almost impossible to get around Melbourne unless you have your own car.
College Senior,1,"There are a couple bars downtown, but they are just that old school bars. There are zero clubs with actual music to dance to, the drink prices are slightly more expensive then my hometown, and most atmospheres are sketch."
College Junior,1,The school reflects a strong academic history and prensent.
College Junior,1,"There is not much to do, but what there IS is fun."
College Junior,1,Parking is extremely expensive and spots fill up quickly.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible. You think paying a hundred dollars for a complete year of parking will garuntee a parking space. If you are not on campus before 8 am, you just lost a parking spot unless you are one of the people who will stalk someone to their car to claim they're spot."
College Sophomore,1,The only good nightlife around this campus include parties normally thrown by one of the fraternities.
College Freshman,1,Very few parking spaces that are available for freshman.
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are extremely old and outdated.  They have been unchanged since teh 60's and are easy fir anyone to just walk right in.  If you want to pay significantly more the Harris and columbia village dorms are much nicer.  But like I said, they are extremely expensive"
College Freshman,1,"Security can be a complete pain in the butt. They charge you whenever you get locked out of you room, charge you 50-100 dollars for parking violations (i.e. $50 for backing into a parking space, $75 for blowing a stop sign). The RAs will come after you for the most minor things like the doors in CV (the freshman housing) never close completely and they constantly bang on doors telling people to close them fully. If you have anything that could be considered contraband (despite they never give you a formal list) make sure you hide it when you're gone because they intentionally search rooms to bust people for contraband lamps, fridges etc. They're not that hard on underage drinking. The first offense is a phone call home and a fine. Pot can get you kicked out of school."
College Senior,1,"Students that live off campus have a hard time finding a good parking spot because of students whom live on campus that take their spots and are not ticketed for it. I hate the idea of rainbow parking tags...where they can park where ever they want and I also hate the other parking tag that allows you to reserve a parking spot for all semester. This is a waste of money and doesn't fix the real problem at all. FIT claimed that this would fix the parking problem, but all it did was cause resentment towards the few students that could afford such luxuries. I even saw a parking spot that was reserved for the whole semester that wasn't even used at all. I think I saw a car parked in that spot maybe three times the whole semester. What a waste of a parking spot."
College Senior,1,"Exhausting and Not That Great – There are many opportunities that are amazing don't get me wrong, but it becomes a burden and not a chance to just have fun sometimes. I think that the three sororities on campus are too divided and obnoxious when it comes to working together. I wish the the reward of doing good for others' was worth the pain and agony of being a Greek, but most of the time it isn't. The Greeks at FIT are a joke most of the time and the rest of the time they are just looked down upon for being stuck up. The stereotypes bring us down and we need to bring ourselves back up."

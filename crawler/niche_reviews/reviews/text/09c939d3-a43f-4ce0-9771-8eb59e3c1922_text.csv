Sophomore,5,Santa Ana College has done a great job in assisting students during the pandemic. They have provided resources available to students such as loaner laptops and worked very hard at accommodating students through online learning. The instructors seem to really care.

The staff is very cooperative to assist the students in providing useful information and internship opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Due to pandemic COVID-19, the majority of classes run as online courses. The professors make us record the lectures and send a link to review as many as we want to. And we can divide zoom rooms to discuss and do group projects. Online courses make us save driving and preparing time, which is most beneficial to nursing students. Also, online learning is beneficial because we can log in at the most convenient time and study based on my own pace."
Freshman,5,The proffesors teaching online classes truly do a good job doing so! They understand that students have lives outside of school and try to make everything flexible for us.

I believe that the campus is safe as there's always security roaming around."

Graduate Student,5,It is a good school. It only needs to have more food on campus like restaurants to be more comfortable for students and to have more variety. I don't know if there are dorms or housing and I would like to know more about it and the price. I don't see parties around that area everyone is serious and just dedicate to study.
Sophomore,5,"Santa Ana is a great college with many resources and scholarships, but you have to reach out to counselors and clubs to become informed of these. If you take advantage of everything available at the college, you will be successful in higher education or careers."

Sophomore,5,"It’s a really great community college if you are not sure what you want to do after High School or didn’t meet the requirements to get into a 4-year institution right away.

The campus is also clean and organized. Student government's events are catered to de-stress students during midterms and finals. Tutors can be found almost anytime and they are patient with students. Counselors are helpful and keep in touch with students to assure that they are on the right track. Overall, I have had a great experience at Santa Ana College. I was struggling in my statistics class, but the math tutors definitely helped me a lot. In fact, I received an A in that class!. I am currently in my second semester and all of my professors are passionate about what they are teaching. This helps students engage in discussions and makes learning different. It is more than just sitting, listening to the professor talk and taking notes. I love everything about it."

Freshman,5,"Santa Ana College is very affordable with quality education. My first year was free and saved me a lot of money. The campus itself isn't the best, there is no student building or food court on campus (under construction). My professors were all very helpful and I didn't have a hard time receiving A's and B's when following directions and putting in the work. There is also many resources on campus for help.

Alum,5,"Santa Ana College was such a great experience. I had some of the best professors that really knew their material and had great experiences to share. They were always hands on, very open and willing to meet with students. It was very convenient and close to home, also a great way to get a sense of self and what I wanted to pursue as far a career and further education (bachelor's degree). SAC was affordable for those who are unable to afford a university right after high school, or those who are returning after years of not being in school."
Sophomore,5,I really like the opportunities that Santa Ana College offers to their students such as the wide variety in academic courses you can enroll in. As well as the free bus pass that allows you to travel all over Orange Country with your Identification Card and now just with an app on your phone.

Alum,5,During my time at Santa Ana college I became more independent and more involved during school. I wanted to put myself out there and I got involved in extracurricular activities and became student body president. The teachers are super friendly and kind and they care about how you are doing in their class. they are very welcoming during office hours.
Freshman,5,A school that is variable from social major to science major. Highly recommend for student in Orange County for AA degree and transfering program to 4-year university.
Graduate Student,5,"Over all my experience at Santa Ana college was wonderful. The staff are helpful and nice. Professors are welcoming 
 and always looking for the best interest of the student. There are different resources and services available on campus."
Freshman,5,"I am about to finish my first year of college.  So far I got really good professors this year. During fall semester 2017 the campus was under construction so it was kind of difficult to get to class because some walkways were blocked. Once the construction was done it's now a lot easier to get to class and it looks really nice. The securities make sure that the students are safe so pretty the safety in the campus is really secure. The professors care about their students and make sure that they will accomplish their career. The counselors are very helpful as well. There are places in the campus to get tutoring for any kind of class, there are workshops for scholarships, and there is EOPS so one can get their books paid. This college offers a lot of help and I strongly recommend this college."
Freshman,5,"I love the way there are different departments that can help you with your major. There is so much to explore at Santa Ana College, from the library to the schools sports events.  There are also places where you can quietly do work when you don't want to be inside a building. Another cool experience, would be the variety of food we can choose from. There are several food trucks that come to the campus and also the small stores have varieties of snacks and meals."
Freshman,5,"I'm about to finish my first year at SAC, and it has been an amazing experience. The school has so many opportunities that people don't look for. I've been able to visit 4 UC's up north and am planning on taking a class at UCI this summer. I recommend for people who want to go here to sign up for EOPS and U-Link. The Transfer Center is there to be used, so make to use your resources. FYI I'm a 1st generation undocumented student majoring in Linguistics and Psychology!"
Sophomore,5,"Diversity and endless opportunities is the best way I can describe the benefits from my experience at Santa Ana College. Throughout my time here, I have established many connections with students and professors. Because of this, I have had many job opportunities within my legal profession and have always had people whom I can discuss certain class topics that assist me in obtaining better grades. The biggest advantage for me is that many night and online classes are offered. This helps me a lot because I am a full time employee and have been able to be a full-time student as well. The flexibility has allowed me to better schedule my study/homework sessions. All the resources made available to students gives me or anyone in attendance no excuse of failing and not transferring. Due to what I mentioned above, I will be obtaining my Associates Degree in Psychology this June and will be transferring to Cal State Fullerton."

Even though we do not have posh buildings, we have all of the kinds of program that can help you to be a student that more close to your goal, helpful professors who might be your life guider, supporting friends who always get your back. Santa Ana College does not that much reputation than other colleges, but it is the best college in my view."
Junior,5,"I liked that it was not a big campus, so I felt like I was always able to get help with financial aid, or counseling real easily."
Sophomore,5,"At Santa Ana College, Professors are very helpful and want you to be successful. The Professors want you to transfer to a University after you finish at Santa Ana College. The Campus is nice and maintained."
Alum,5,"Santa Ana College was a wonderful experience for me, and everyone else I know that has gone here throughout the years. I am so glad that I got to go to such a great college to get my associates degree. What really stands out at SAC are the professors. They are supportive, caring, and want to see their students succeed not just in class, but in life too. The college also offers a lot of different programs to help students succeed, along with easy to access math, language, english, etc tutoring. The biggest complaint I had was the construction, however a lot of it is done now and the campus looks quite nice."
Alum,5,Great Community College! Their nursing program is one of the best programs in Orange County. Its very competitive to get in. Many of their professors really want you to succeed.
Graduate Student,5,"Professors are great, school is being remodeled so it's a bit crazy right now but once it's done it will be great."
Graduate Student,5,"I was skeptical of being part of community college, however, it opened my eyes to the enormous opportunities they have to offer. 
I've graduated from a university, but I had no idea on how to look for a job. The university prepared me to be a better student, but it did not prepare me on how to survive in the real world. 
Santa Ana College has programs for me to be involved by becoming a paralegal. It is arranging me to start and prepare for a future career. I am grateful to them for helping me start my journey."
Freshman,5,What I like about Santa Ana College are the professors and the counselors. They help you with any questions you may have and genuinely care about their students.

Santa Ana College cares about its students and makes sure they have everything they need to succeed."
Freshman,4,"I love how involved the counselors are with the students. The campus is great! There are also lots of student resources around campus such as the tutoring center and the computer lab.

Sophomore,4,I like that most instructors have been very helpful and offer extensive hours to assist students. They have some amazing Professors who are happy to share their knowledge.
Sophomore,4,"Since this is a community college, the population is very small and most classes are really easy. I really enjoyed it here because I got to know all my professors and peers really well and they got to know me. The campus is also great, it's not be as big as other colleges but it's really beautiful and spacious. Throughout your time there you will find that you will get to know every part of the campus, which is really fun. Not only is the campus great but the school is located next to many restaurants and stores, all those stores are right across the street from the school. Also the classes are all really great, there is a great amount of easier beginner classes in a variety of subjects but there are also more advanced classes in those same subjects that are basically a continuation of the beginner classes but also offer more insight on the subject. This school is great for those who aren't sure of what they want, or for those who aren't ready for the big thing."
Junior,4,Santa Ana College is a great school in my opinion. I've been in Santa Ana College for a few years now and I absolutely love it. It's like a second home for me and everyone is usually really chill. A lot of areas for resources. Good facility and interesting people.
Freshman,4,"I truly enjoyed being a student her due to the nice faculty and staff here. ALong with this the classes online are formatted well, as in the student can always do the work on time."
Junior,4,"I have taken classes both online and in person. The campus is easy to navigate and there are lots of food choices around in the area, as well as food trucks on campus."

Sophomore,4,"The school and staff are amazing. Santa Ana College is currently getting remodeled and it’s looking very modern and beautiful.

Sophomore,4,The professors are friendly and easy to build a relationship. I enjoyed every class I took at Santa Ana College.
Freshman,4,"Santa Ana college has treated me really good so far. I was skeptical at first if it would live up to my expectations of a good college, it sure did. The campus is very welcoming and in all makes you feel safe. The professors are caring about each one of their students which is not seen so much in other college campuses.  Santa Ana college has a lot of programs to help those students that are not financially stable at the moment. This campus wants you to succeed and they do not just say it but they show you through their actions as a school."
Sophomore,4,Santa Ana College always has a welcoming feel and friendly staff always working together to fulfill whatever is best for students. The professors are always ready to help and support their students academically. I would highly recommend my friends to attend Santa Ana College for all it has to offer.

Freshman,4,Been attending to Santa Ana College for summer school and has been the best units that I have made in the summer. Santa Ana College have the best professor there could be because they help the students with their classes and their careers.
Sophomore,4,"What I like mostly about the college is the teaching stuff. They go out of their way to ensure that students fully understand the material given them. In addition to the wonderful teachers, the classes are relatively small in number and this allows the teachers to spend a good amount of time to deal with the students problem in the classes. The campus is well maintained and never overcrowded for the sheer number of students enrolled. I would only increase on the number of foliage, but besides that I like the school program."
Senior,4,"Santa Ana College is a great school and it is full of diversity. The professors are caring and active in student learning. Although the campus is older and a lot of the buildings and classrooms are not used, I hope to see a change in that. Hopefully, in the near future, the vacant classrooms will be utilized to promote student growth and more learning experiences."
Sophomore,4,"what i liked about the college was that all the professors are very helpful and respectful no problems at all. Therefore the the campus may not be that perfect yet because due to all of the construction and adding all new buildings make a bit of a hassle and sometimes gets a little ignoring. the area around the school is not in a perfect city but it is decent enough to be safe. the campus security is almost like the secret service and are very helpful and chill and are always on every situation. Once the campus is complete the school will look really nice and probably get more funding into their Fire Technology program and give the fields different and better classrooms. Therefore, one field that needs to have better teachers is the math department because the school hires some math teachers that have a strong accent or who teach the material more difficult then it really is."
Sophomore,4,Many opportunities to grow and make connections. Professors and staff are very helpful. Theres not really any school spirit and the sports aren't really that popular. They're doing a lot of construction to improve the campus so Its looking very nice just a few detours. Making lots usually have a lot of space.
Sophomore,4,"This is a good community college with a very good psychology program and a really robust online program as well. My career and academic counselors have been wonderful and the instructors that I've had have been excellent. The school is located in a student-friendly area with plenty of public transportation, shops, restaurants and a fund downtown area."
Freshman,4,Santa Ana college is great and provides a lot of help to it's students.I received the help I needed to get back to college after not doing what to do with out financial aid.It's a pleasure to attend this college and the effort of its development is greatly noticeable.
Sophomore,4,"I have been at Santa Ana College for 5 years and have spent my whole high school years there. I love the amount of diversity the school brings and they have some amazing professors that I will never forget. However, there are certain professors that are the only professors that teach a certain subject and do not do well. They have been complained about for a very long time but nothing seems to happen. It’s very discouraging when it’s a foundation class for your major."
Niche User,4,"I enrolled for an early college class at SAC, at first I was really nervous because I was the only high school student in the classroom, but my professor made me feel comfortable and eager to learn!"
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the community of people of people and the diversity that the college has. All people are very friendly and respectful to each other and the campus. Navigation through the campus is and if finding a building is difficult any of the faculty can help. Changes I would like to see are more shaded areas because it lacks any protection from the sun.
Niche User,4,Santa Ana College was an amazing experience for me. There are a variety of different classes that you are able to take. The staff and professors were also very helpful whenever I was lost about a certain topic. Santa Ana College is a good start to plan your future and determine who you are.
Sophomore,4,They cater to everyone. Especially for those who are going back to school and work full time. It’s nice to see how many classes they offer in the evening for people who are extremely busy.

Sophomore,4,Santa Ana College is a great school to explore what you would eventually like to study. The counselors and administration are all excellent and professional who really want to see you succeed.
Junior,4,"Sac has helped change my life. I am onto my 3rd year attending. I have a full time job and have managed to earn my a/a by the end of this 3rd year. The classes are flexible and they have many options. Parking is fine if you arrive early, and there is plenty spaces."
Freshman,4,"I came from a previous college, which was self dependent study and not much focus on the student from the professor. Some courses here are the same, but I was impressed with the quality of education here. Experienced professors and relevant material focus to work situations. Looking forward to future courses here."
Junior,4,"Santa Ana College is a really affordable community college. The classes are challenging enough with moderate to strict professors depending on the class you are taking. The classes feel like what you would get if you were taking them at the university or state college level, so you are being well taught despite the prices and the fact that SAC is a community college. There are a variety of clubs and various student activities. The faculty for the most part is really caring and wants to see its students succeed."
Junior,4,"Santa Ana College is a good school although the campus and some of the professors need a lot of work. The lack of a cafeteria is  inconvenient, luckily there are restaurants nearby. Also, all the construction going on is downright annoying. It's hard to understand how they can afford to have so much construction going on but they can't fix a stall in one of the women's restrooms that instead of a door has a shower curtain."
Sophomore,4,Overall this campus and the professors have been extremely in being able to provide for their students. Offering free resources for many subjects as well as having office hours for any help from professors. Students are very friendly and campus has recently been remodeled and will continue to be remodeled for the upcoming years although the food offered on campus is not so good.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the fact thatthe come provides many students centers. The college really does care for its students and their futures. They have programs like financial aid that students can join ( of course,  the students must pass the requirements to join)."
Sophomore,4,Most of the time I was there the college was under construction. It started in 2016 and it is still under construction so that stunk. Education was a hit or a miss. Some professors were amazing and other downright were not good. I would recommend the college though. A lot of open classes and overall good people.
Freshman,4,"The school provides many resources for the students that are extremely useful. The staff is friendly and are always there to help. There are many places on campus that are useful for the students, in terms of helping them to succeed. They offer many opportunities to aid the students to succeed in their classes. Also, they provide support and assistance when the students are in need of it. The tutoring programs they offer are free which saves the students money and help them improve in their classes."
Sophomore,4,"It's a good community college. Not too expensive and a good education which is why I went. Graduating this semester and I've liked all my professors out of my many classes except for two (art history professors). The campus food isn't that great, but there's a subway, chipotle, starbucks, and in&out pretty close by. Campus was under construction for a long time, but it's shaping up now. In all though it's a good starting point to transfer to a university later on."
Sophomore,4,"Overall this school has great resources, staff, and accessibility for a low cost. I couldn't have asked for anything better."
Freshman,4,I really liked the teachers and the classes that I have had there. There are also a lot of programs that help all kinds of students whether it be academically or financially. Overall it's a good school that really helps their students get to where they want to go.

They have many good activities for international students."

Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Santa Ana College. They offer many programs that are resources for financing college expenses, transferring to higher education, and overall well-being of its students. Some of these programs are EOPS, CARE, Transfer Mentor program, and the list goes on. However, something I have not enjoyed about SAC are the unending construction sites, but other than that, everything is good."
Graduate Student,4,overall Santa Ana college was a great community college to attend. the only problem was the major construction that was going on the disrupted the classes and made it really inconvenient to go from one class to the next.
Freshman,4,Santa Ana College is a very good school to get your college career started. There are a lot of programs to help students pay for books as well as the college its self.
Sophomore,4,I have has a very good experience at this institution. It has recently gone under construction for renovation and new buildings which will only make it better. It also has a very diverse campus.
Niche User,4,"It has been a good experience in visiting this college, the campus is getting better. One thing they should changes is to have more security."
Junior,4,"Santa Ana College is a great college especially for graduating high school students that would want to have an affordable education at a community college before transferring to a 4 year institution. Every Professor at this college really wants to see their students succeed and transfer. Classroom size is typically 40 to 1, with the Professor always being available to answer questions from students. And there's so much diversity as well with the growing International Students Program, the college has been slowly becoming more and more diverse. What I would like to see change is that they hurry up with the construction around campus!!! I hate having to walk all the way around campus just to get to my class. I'm honestly really proud of my college, it's changed so much since I first came. Good and bad ways. Like how they also started a program where incoming freshmen who graduated from a Santa Ana high district can get their first year at the college free! "
College Junior,4,"Personally, I prefer to take courses in person rather than online"
College Junior,4,The school offers many opportunities and offers help for your courses.

Sophomore,2,"Some professors gave up on teaching, classes became self taught and were more difficult to learn from."
Niche User,2,"It's too crowded, the coffee always burns, and the food hasn't changed.  classes are not in the same area you have the campus then you have the Media center looked on Bristol and Edinger, which is rediculous."
College Senior,2,Classes are difficult to get in since they get full really fast. It does not help that counseling takes forver and there's soo many requirements for alot of classes. They definitely  need to make it a little easier.
College Senior,2,I think my school tuition is great . Really helps out people with economic difficulties . Financial is super slow however.   I've had a couple issues with financial aid and there's always a log line to get small things fixed
College Junior,2,I didn't get the money I was supposed to get for fall 2014. They gave me less than they told me
College Sophomore,2,Haven't really herd from them my self but bad reputation they have. Well based on the thoughts of the people I have asked not one of them gave me a pro only cons on the Student Body.
College Junior,2,they kept sending me papers after papers about my financial aid because something went wrong even tho someone from school had helped me and after i did all the paper work I didn't received anything because my GPA didn't meet the standard they were asking for
College Junior,2,"I dont qualify for financial aid because my parents make too much money. According to SAC I have to make less that $40,000 for a family of 4 to get any money which is absolutely crazy. That is how much my house costs yearly."
College Junior,2,This is something that can definitely improve. The dinning is something that is really really below par.
College Senior,2,"I received a board of governors fee waver after I applied myself for financial aid. In sum, their financial aid program its relatively average."
College Senior,2,I want to become a photographer major and Santa Ana college only has three classes of photography but they have other classes i need and i can transfer with the classes they have.
Recent Alumnus,2,Theres isn't much to say about this because I never paid much attention to this. The only thing I noticed was bulletin boards with job openings.
College Freshman,2,"To be honest, online classes didn't work for me. It would take too much of my time and when it came to test the study guide did no help what so ever. I would recommended it to people who have more of time management and don't procrastinate."
College Junior,2,TUITION SUMMARY – THE TUITION IS VERY HIGH FOR IT BEING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

Recent Alumnus,2,"""C"" Is a Passing Grade in My Country – ""C"" is a passing mark in my country,so if you scrod C and above it is possible to join in any univeristy"
College Sophomore,1,"This is my biggest complaint, and I understand that it is not only the schools fault. I reicived the fee waiver for my first two years, which was very helpful, but I lost it for my third and final year that is coming up because my father made too much money for a family of six. I also have never qualified for financial aid. I feel like the qualifications for financial aid are extremely unrealistic. Yes my father makes money, but I am the oldest of four children and with them having to pay for my schooling is going to hurt my family a lot. In addition to that, my father is the only parent that works. I am really in need of money for school because of the fact that I do not recieve financial aid, my parents are begging to hold paying for my school against me, and its making it difficult for me to want to continue because its making school seem like something negative in my life."
College Senior,1,They have very few poetry classes. Creative writing program needs improvement !!!!

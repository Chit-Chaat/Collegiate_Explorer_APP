Freshman,5,The transition to online learning was very smooth. The professors and staff made sure each student had the materials they needed in order to be successful.
Freshman,5,My experience at MidAmerica has been so wonderful. Everyone there is so friendly and encouraging. The professors genuinely care about each of their students.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the small, family atmosphere my campus has. For me, it is important to create personal relationships, and here I can do that. Professors know you by name and you are not just a number. MidAmerica is a faith based, private, Christian school, and faith is number one in my life. God is the focus, and I am able to surround myself with others that want to help me grow in my faith not pull me away. Overall, the campus is amazing and beautiful. I guess what I would change is definitely the cafeteria, but also lowering tuition. I do not feel that the school should be $42,000 a year, and still be raised each year."
Freshman,5,"I Mostly came to this school for their athletics and being changed how I viewed school and i made a lot of friends being here this place is amazing. The religious aspect of this school is very different from other I experience, but they do a great job of keeping the students active in the community and making sure that all their students have the ability to surpass their goals."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman, for the fall of 2020. I have visited the campus several times and each time I have become more and more impressed. I am very excited to be attending MidAmerica Nazarene University."
Freshman,5,"I like that everyone feels at home here! The community atmosphere is so loving and caring. No one is excluded out of anything. It's anyone's decision to do certain activities, but when students do go they love it."
Sophomore,5,"It's a fantastic University. Rarely do you find a University with a community that cares about you. The Professors actually care about not only your academic success, but how you're doing as a person. The school fosters a positive Christian atmosphere, and has plenty of fun social events. The food is okay, but there are many options to choose from each day. I would recommend MNU to anyone looking for a small Christian University with many opportunities to build friendships and connections, and also to obtain the skills and knowledge for not just a future career, but also for life in general."
Freshman,5,"I would like to thank this school for picking me.I was selected for one of their programs for student loan.The schools help pay backs the student loan fee. All I have to do is graduated from their school with a bachelor degree and have less than 43,000 income. Which is very easy to complete. Their school is a christian school therefore the campus is strict.Overall, the school picked me."
Sophomore,5,Everyone here is very friendly and willing to help. I've never felt more welcomed by a community. Everywhere you go there are smiling faces.
Alum,5,"This is a small university which is exactly what I was looking for. My professors know my name and face. The professors in my department (business) I each had several times. They really care about you. They invite you out to eat, over to their house, keep in touch after graduation, and are always happy to help you out with whatever you need. There are other factors that aren't great, like the food and the parking lots, but overall, I'm SO happy I went there. I left with great friends, a great degree, and great memories."
Niche User,5,"Considering I am going back to college since 2003 to a different university of my own choosing, I have throughly enjoyed my conversations with personal at MNU.  They have been helpful and kind.  They have taken a considerable amount of time to invest in me.  Something that even my previous university did not do when called upon to help me with continuing my education."
Alum,5,This university prepared me very well for my career.  I am happy with the cost and the quality of education received.
Graduate Student,5,I'm in the graduate studies program and I feel as though they are very attentive and there to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school so much. The community here is incredible. You never feel alone or like no one cares because we are all one big family. The education here is also amazing. Our professors truly care about us and our futures and that really leaves an impact on us. If I hadn't chosen to go here, then my life would be completely different. I am so thankful that I chose to attend MidAmerica Nazarene University."
Sophomore,5,I love the vibrant social and spiritual climate wrapped around learning from fantastic teachers who make learning in their classrooms feel like the greatest educational experience I could possibly have.
Junior,5,I like that MidAmerica Nazarene University is a small school where teachers have a relationship with students.
Graduate Student,5,I am just getting started in the MBA program but up to this point the MNU staff has been excellent to work with.
Senior,5,"I have appreciated the atmosphere of MNU. I have been encouraged to explore and grow, and I have seen my learning increase by leaps and bounds. I love the teachers; they truly care about me! I have been developing such a depth in my relationship with God and with others that I never even dared imagine."
Niche User,5,I like how welcome everyone is. I love how it is a christian school where chapel is part of your schedule.  The one thing that I wish that would change though is the price of Mid-America Nazarene University. It is really expensive compared to other schools.
Senior,5,This is a faith based college. We begin class with a devotional and prayer. Professors and all staff are here to help you and encourage your growth
Senior,5,"Midamerica  has been an amazing experience so far. In the one year that I've been here I have learned how to interact with people in a way I never knew I could. The teachers in the Ministry department have taught me how to interact with the world around me. It isn't just a Bible college, it's a place where you can learn to coexist with people around you and have your own beliefs but be able to love people even if they don't believe what you believe. A big focus on the campus is to help people in their faith. If you are looking for a place where you can grow as a Christ followers and as a person of society this is a place for you."
Junior,5,"I love going to MidAmerica Nazarene University. They have a strong, Christian support system and everyone on campus feels like family. The campus size is perfect, so I am able to get from class to class in a timely manner. Also, my teachers are awesome. They are completely devoted to teaching and are always willing to help when I have questions or problems. I would recommend to anyone MidAmerica Nazarene University."
Sophomore,5,"I love MNU! I feel safe, accepted, cared for, and like I fit in overall. There are opportunities to play sports, go out, get jobs, and do so much more. The professors really want students to succeed in every way! I would not want to go anywhere else!"
College Sophomore,5,"I feel like I am finally apart of a family on campus. I feel safe and accepted by most on campus and I really enjoy being there. The people I have met there and the opportunities that have been opened for me are great. I am already in an internship program at my school as a sophomore, working in my field of study. I am also able to branch out and do other things within my field of study across all different types of areas. We have a lot of opportunities to work in ministry in all different areas of the city and state. The school all together is a great place to be. The studies and classes are also great, the professors got the extra mile to make class fun and interesting while still being challenging. My dream school."
College Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere at MidAmerica Nazarene University is one of servant leadership, positive christian ministries, and a community that loves and cares for their students passionately. The professors go out of their way to make sure the students needs are taken care of. The school really wants everyone to succeed in their field of study with new improvements to buildings, new equipment and resources for the students. All around an amazing school."
College Junior,5,My overall experience has been amazing.
College Sophomore,5,"Coming from a college cheerleader, the sports around school tend be a big deal. We have very supportive friends and families who come out to see us play or perform our best out there to bring home a championship ring or banner to our school to show that being a student athlete can pay off in the long run"
Recent Alumnus,5,Love this school and the atmosphere it has. Great caring people.
College Sophomore,5,MidAmerica has the perfect small-town community feel.
College Student,5,A lot of fast food and regular restaurants give out discounts for college students which is great and the convenience is nice not too far and quite the variety to choose from which is always a great choice.
College Student,5,"I will be living in the dorms this fall but I have stayed in the dorms previously with some of my college friends and overall the dorms are a great way to interact with friends and get to know one another on a completely different level and learn different qualities. The cost of MidAmerica Nazarene University (MNU) is a bit pricy sitting at around $30,000 a year. Although it seems like a lot of money, the cost includes room and board, food and higher education leading to a higher chance of starting a career immediately after graduation. The location of MNU is convenient for college students because it's located close to restaurants, Walmart and the mall."
College Freshman,5,"Lot's of choices and there are a lot of student discounts you can get, especially if you buy a saver card."
College Freshman,5,"Kansas City is about 30 minutes away and has everything you could ever want. There's plenty of places to shop and the Legends is great. The Royals and the Chiefs are nearby so if you're a sports fan you can easily go. There are museums and symphonies and orchestras, which you may need to go to at some point for a class. The city of Olathe is a really friendly place to live and there are so many babysitting jobs available."
College Senior,5,Multiculturalism is discussed in classes and is accepting of everyone.
College Senior,5,The Master of Arts in Counseling program is CACREP accredited and definitely a valuable program.
College Senior,5,I ha feel that I have been provided with an amazing opportunity. I have learned incredible amounts of information related to my field of employment. I have also experienced a great boost in self-esteem.
College Senior,5,Professors are kind and considerate. They help with personal and professional struggles. They are easily accessible.
College Senior,5,There are plenty of options. Ranging from fast food to organic. Fancy to affordable.
College Senior,5,There is a perfect balance of peaceful greenery and city life.
College Senior,5,I currently live in an apartment near school. It is relatively new and definitely affordable.
College Senior,5,"There was and application to complete prior to being accepted for an interview. Once accepted there was a one day interview. The interview went smoothly and the interviewers made this a comforting and professional experiencing. GPA seemed to be important, but not the highest of importance. The interview and our ability to show empathy was of highest importance."
College Senior,5,"Internship has been a great experience. I currently have a paid internship, which is applicable to my program."
College Senior,5,"My program is different from normal programs which go by semesters. Mine goes by models and could be very confusing with financial aid, but the financials aid office employees help with anything and everything and are very kind. This makes the process go very smooth and frustration-free."
College Sophomore,5,"Go Pioneers! We are fully supportive of all our athletic teams, we are a big family!"
College Sophomore,5,"Community is experienced between Greeks and non-Greeks, there is no conflict ever."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Olathe! It has the best entertainment and environment to offer! Also, if you don't like the smaller feel, you are never too far from a bigger, busier city!"
College Sophomore,5,MNU is wonderful at opening doors for students! The training is extensive and personal; students are known and loved deeply.
College Sophomore,5,"No words can describe how thrilled I am to be at MNU, studying Youth Ministry."
College Sophomore,5,"Great campus, where I feel safe and comfortable!"
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are great. I have individualized attention. I always am learning and I feel that the teachers try to get to know you on a personal level. Chances are they actually care too.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school! I think everyone is very accepting and we all get along really well. I feel like I am wanted and the class sizes are great for a University. The teachers are all very helpful and you can tell they love what they do.
College Sophomore,5,"I may be completely wrong, but I have never seen any drugs on campus. I think it helps that we are completely Christian and most of us have a christian background, which does not include drugs."
College Sophomore,5,You have endless amount of options!
College Sophomore,5,It is in the middle of Olathe which is a huge city with endless places to eat and things to do.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are all personal with you and actually care about you. 
College Sophomore,5,"Always have campus police running around somewhere and emergency phones on campus
"
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is so close on this campus and even after you graduate.
College Sophomore,5,"Stay around for a few days if you do not like the weather, it will change by then."
College Sophomore,5,It takes 5 minutes to walk across campus and probably about 30 seconds to walk from the parking lot to your class.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone at this school is nice to everyone! I have not ever seen anyone being treated badly.
Freshman,4,"Online learning is not for me. I need to be in the classroom, face to face with my professor to have the best learning experience. This being said, having to switch to online due to COVID19 was actually a very smooth transition. All of my professors were very easy to work with, and we had much time in advance to get assignments done. Being someone who hates online learning, I had a very good experience with it."
Sophomore,4,"MidAmerica Nazarene University is a place where anyone can commit to their higher learning goals. The professors and students have a great relationship with each other, and everyone has fun learning in their desired field of study."
Junior,4,"So far everyone, teachers and students, have been incredibly nice and welcoming. The campus is gorgeous and breathtaking in the fall and winter months."
Junior,4,"MidAmerica Nazarene University has a great nursing program. The teachers are not only good at their job, but they are also just amazing people. The students are also very kind here."
Junior,4,"Great university with excellent nursing, business, and kinesiology programs. Excellent coaching staffs for the running programs, but I can't say anything for the others. Dorm life is so much fun with plenty of activities to take your mind off upcoming exams."
Junior,4,"Based on my major, the athletic training staff has been very helpful and encouraging throughout my experience here.  I learn a lot from them and have become close with each trainer there."
Senior,4,"MNU is a great Christian university! All college students will learn the values of being a Christian and how to maintain that relationship throughout the workforce, education, and life. This university also has a very calm atmosphere that will allow students to feel at peace when walking to classes, getting work done at the library, and so much more."
College Junior,4,Every one has been so helpful.
College Freshman,4,I feel that students career prospects of and value of a degree from this morning school is very high.
College Freshman,4,"I love the campus, the class ratio and everything."
College Freshman,4,I feel secure on this campus that's why I'm excited to be attending it.
College Freshman,4,There are cleaning ladies that are available 5days a week.
College Freshman,4,From my conversations with the coach I would rate the athletic department as great. I really love talking to them.
College Freshman,4,I haven't start at this school yet but I belies a great school.
College Sophomore,4,The amount of job opportunities are great. I will have at least a lot of networking and job requests through the school. I will be able to have a job in my field when I graduate.
College Sophomore,4,We have our 24/7 campus security that is always on alert for crimes being committed on campus. We also as a community take it upon ourselves to try and deal with issues such as safety of others very seriously. Walking in pairs and walking females back to their dorms. We have a very safe campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The living space at MidAmerica Nazarene University is small in the rooms, but it's great. The amount of room we have in the dorms works for the amount of people living in them. The rooms are comfortable and homey. I very much enjoy living on campus in the dorms. The walk to class from all dorms on campus is around five minutes at the most."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics programs are very successful at MidAmerica Nazarene University. The facilities are very good, our athletic training staff was the best in our conference this past year. Our women's basketball team was nationals this past season and our men's basketball team went very far this year into the national playoffs and so did our volleyball team. We have a very sound athletics program that revolves around serving and being Christ centered."
College Sophomore,4,What makes MNU unique is the atmosphere around the school. Once you step foot on there its like God put you there for a reason. You are able to learn from the best professor ands are able to get involved with college church and so forth. You meet wonderful people there who have the same dreams or beliefs as you do.
College Junior,4,The professors are great considering that at times they have to deal with a big number of students at times. The courses are also very relevant  and well presented in class
College Junior,4,Some courses like nursing have big career prospects. A good number of students get hired immediately after taking the exams
College Junior,4,I think the campus is very safe. You ca walk freely around the campus at any time
College Junior,4,"I like the way Christianity is inter grated with academics. It is wonderful to know the professors are with you at every stage of your program academically, socially and spritually."
College Junior,4,"The university supports athletics in every way. They are give tuition scholarships, are allowed flexible schedules and their accomplishments are celebrated by everyone."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I believe if someone was rasied on the schools thinking/rules, then there isnt much of a problem. If you aren't used to these rules then I think they would be hard."
College Student,4,They expect us to have enough common sense not to do anything stupid which is understandable.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Living in the dorm was fun, but i really enjoy living in the campus apartments. I feel like i have my own space but still have some social interaction with others."
College Freshman,4,"The students are from all around the world, but most of them are from the Midwest. Everyone kind of does their own thing and that's okay with everyone else. There are couples everywhere and the phrase, 'a ring by spring' is actually very true."
College Freshman,4,"The rules are there to keep people safe and focused on God. If you choose to go to a Christian school, that is what you should expect."
College Freshman,4,"There is always something edible in Campus Center, they have a salad bar and a sandwich line every single meal. The majority of the time the hot food is good, but some days it could be better. The variety is pretty good, except on the weekends when things slow down on campus. Some favorites are: Spicy Chicken Thursdays, Bacon Fridays, and Meat Night on Wednesdays. The ice cream machine is always on and available which is always a temptation."
College Freshman,4,"Campus life is fun, there always something to do or someone to hangout with when you're not studying and doing homework. The RA's and RE's are great people who are fun to be around. I chose a random roommate and it turned out pretty well."
College Senior,4,"The strictness on campus is great. The rules in place keep students focused on education and positive self-esteem. It is lenient enough to where students do not feel pressure to be perfect, but strict enough to provide healthy structure."
College Senior,4,"Campus security is not overbearing and do not cause students to feel nervous about their safety. They keep us updated if there are ever concerns about crime on campus. Students in evening classes can feel safe walking to their cars, as there is campus security active in the parking lots."
College Senior,4,I like the shopping and the museums in the kc area. I also think that the kc symphony is a pretty fun thing to participate in.
College Senior,4,"I actually live with my parents, but I know people who live off campus and are happy with their places. There are people who live in duplexes and in apartments very close to the school."
College Senior,4,I really like being a music major. I get to play my instrument and sing and hang out with other music majors. The workload is difficult so don't choose it unless you are committed.
College Senior,4,I didn't have any trouble because I already had my associates degree. There isnt any special thing that someone would have to do in order to receive a degree in music. There is a recital that has to be done before graduating.
College Senior,4,The school tends to be sport oriented. Which is okay if you are into that sort of thing.
College Senior,4,I like the library and Dewey's Book and Bean coffee shop inside the library. I also like hanging in the Bell Center because there are lots of music major hanging out inside the lobby. I also like walking around the campus and seeing how pretty it all is.
College Senior,4,"I was able to receive most of the money I needed to help pay for school. Unfortunately, I was not able to receive all of the money that I needed, so I had to work extra hard to save the needed money. 

The tips I have are to keep going into the office and asking about more scholarships that are available. Also apply for everything that they offer you. And don't be afraid to ask for a scholarship if you are in band or choir."
College Senior,4,I really like the restaurants in the area. There are plenty of restaurants to try. There are also little restaurants that are fun and its fun to look for little treasures around the city.
College Sophomore,4,Super fun to have a partying experience with anyone from MNU.
College Sophomore,4,I love the campus and students always have opportunities to experience college life even of such a small campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Weather is wonderful! A little gusty now and then, but the walk from building to building is never too long! And the campus is beautiful!"
College Sophomore,4,Parking is great! The zones are conveniently places and organized well by color.
College Sophomore,4,"MNU is comfortable for every type, a loving environment."
College Sophomore,4,I think there is a great amount of international students. This makes for great conversations and learning experiences.
College Sophomore,4,"The apartments around are cheaper, but still nice. However, I live with my parents and have no need for off campus housing."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus walkways are completely outside and it can get a little cold, however, the walks are never that far. Sometimes, depending on your intended major, you tend to stay in one or two buildings without much need to walk outside."
College Sophomore,4,"lots of diversity, lots of international students."
College Senior,4,"It's mostly the athletes that drink. Myself being one of them, but I really don't enjoy that scene much. I feel like the students who are non-athletes really, really look down on those students who do drink, and being at a Christian school, well to me, that doesn't seem very Christian. The non-athlete students can be VERY judgmental. Not all of them, no, but the majority of them are. On campus, drinking and drugs is pretty much unheard of. The school has a very strict dry campus policy."
College Senior,4,"The specific programs in the school are great, the nursing program for example, is very challenging and I feel like I'm learning a ton. The workload is heavy, but doable, the new Sante Fe building is awesome, and our lab is amazing. We are, unfortunately, almost completely separated from the rest of the school and that kind of stinks. I almost never see anyone from school outside of those students that are in the nursing program with me. Overall however, I feel very fortunately to have been accepted into the program and am so far very happy with where it's taking me."
College Junior,4,Since MidAmerica is a Christian college we don't have much trouble with that. There may be some but never seen any.
College Sophomore,4,"The winter weather does not make the campus experience any different then summer time when you live on campus, but if you live off campus that is a different story. The snow can be a pain to try to drive though to get to the school and many end up missing classes during winter due to the bad weather unless they live on campus. When on campus, the facility makes sure to clean off the walk ways so all students can easily get to their classes and to the campus center for their meals. I believe the school is doing the best they can during bad weather to keep the campus experience positive for all their students."
College Sophomore,4,Im a CNA and Patient care Tech. at the local hospital and nursing home in my area. They keep me busy but also both have offered me internships.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is strict on opposite genders visiting in the dorms. It is a christian campus so they do not allow opposite genders have romantic time together alone in a room. When lets say a male is visiting a female friend in the girl dorms, he must only come in during open dorm time and leave when open dorm time is over. Which means no sleep overs. And when he is in the girl's room, the door must be open at all times. The open dorm times increase the older you get. As a freshman, you have less open dorm time a week and at night, freshman have to check in with their RA and have a curfew of 1am. Older student do not have a curfew. They have a policy of students have to attend the Chapels which are little church services every week. You get points for each chapel you attend. By the end of the semester, you must have gotten 40 chapel points. 20 chapel points if your off campus. This policy is designed well. It is not hard to attend the amount for the semester. If you have a busy schedule, they will work with you and get you a good amount of point that you can do."
College Sophomore,4,"Getting transportation is not a problem at this school. Students who do not have their own cars can easily get a ride to any place they need to get to by another student/ friend or a bus. I have my own car so I can not tell you the cost of transportation. the campus is close to Price Chopper, Seven Eleven, McDonald, and a Hobby Lobby. Many students have walked to these places from the school. A smaller amount have walked to Walmart but it is a little further of a walk then the other places."
College Sophomore,4,The overall atmosphere of this school is awesome. The only thing I take points off for is for the busy city kind of atmosphere the school is located in. That can be a personal opinion though because some people like the city life while others like the small town feel a little better. I am one of those small town feel kind of people. The atmosphere within the school is so upbeat and everyone is super kind and smiles a lot. The workers are willing to help you with anything. They will seem like they care about you. I am a true fan of this school.
College Junior,4,"Computers, printers, internet speed are great at my school. I couldn't ask for more."
College Junior,4,There are plenty of choices off-campus. That's why I moved off camp. Also it's affordable and you get student discounts at some placed.
Junior,2,"Terrible. You are fined if you do not go to mandatory chapel. Title 9 reports are ignored. Residential life is not supportive, nor helpful. There is nothing to do if you are not an athlete. Dorm rules are strict. Guys/girls are not allowed in dorms on tuesdays and Thursday’s past 11pm. Dorm WiFi is often bad and the vents are filled with mold and mildew. People are condescending and there aren’t many events held. The cafeteria has had several health code violations.  The ONLY good thing I can actually say about this place are the teachers. The teachers care about their students, although they are not paid enough. The classes are small, however you can find that experience at many private university’s."
College Sophomore,2,Im not sure cause we dont have fraternity or sorority
Recent Alumnus,2,Not that great. You have options but a lot of its pricey.
College Student,2,They never straight up tell you if you received any financial aid or how much which is kinda annoying.
Recent Alumnus,2,There arent many scholarships available to students from the actual university. You have to fit certain criteria otherwise you'll be searching elsewhere for scholarships.
College Senior,2,very tough and difficult. No I would not do an accelerated program again
College Junior,2,"In the city, there are many things  to do for ages 18 and up. There aren't many clubs that I know of for underage students, though. Since MidAmerica is a religious university, there isn't as many parties, but there are still some."
College Senior,2,"I've never lived on campus. But I've heard tons of stories. It's incredibly difficult to get off campus, for one, and two I hear that they are just a difficult place to live. Just seems like they are forced to live there."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus can be quite difficult. The catering to students that commute is very good, but that makes it hard on the students that live on campus. It isn't completely horrible, but there could be more spaces and less parking citations."
College Freshman,2,It was ok the government is whack how they determine how much money you will receive.
College Senior,2,"Not What I Expected – I know its a private university but the rules they have are unfairly enforced. They are harder on the girls than the boys as far a curfew and other things. They will fine you for anything you do wrong. The students are friendly, unless your not 100% christian all the time then they will judge you"
College Senior,2,"Could Be a Better ""Tossed Salad"" or ""Melting Pot&quot – Our campus population has an obvious majority many different categories. Ethnicity is white (97.5% it seems like), a handful of African Americans, and a handful of other races/international students. Because our school is Christian, most of the students are Christian; now in terms of denomination, Nazarene probably reigns but students are actually more diverse in their Christian backgrounds. I'd say most of the students are well-off economically because the university is private and much higher financially than other colleges - but a good group of students do receive financial aid and join the work study program. Most are conservative here, so the political beliefs are pretty much homogeneous and we are not diverse with sexual orientation. However, in terms of acceptance anyone that is a ""minority"" is usually well-treated, as if they were a part of the majority; this is a great attribute of the community life within MNU."
College Freshman,2,"I Could Use More Help – I recieved some scholarships from the school and some loans from the government but my school for the fall is still estimated at $22,000. I wish they would promote more scholarships or offer more ways for students to do work study."
College Junior,2,"im an athlete and i can say that we dont have any nutritionist to tell us what to eat, and that the food we eat is not really that good"
College Senior,2,we are a christian school so everything is revolved around God and attending chapel is required. its difficult if you are not into the God scene to follow the crazy rules they have in comparison to other schools. its definitely not a state school... but it is safe and very close-knit.
College Senior,2,Not So Great – MidAmerica dorms are small and very strict. they do not allow students to feel independent and college aged. they are very safe but they have no amenities really. the cost to live in the dorms is high for the value. but they do make for an okay social atmosphere for students that like to stay in their dorms all day and night. the apartment style dorms are much better and allow for a different college experience than the freshman/sophomore dorms.
College Senior,2,"On Campus – in the freshmen dorms everyone is very friendly. there is great usage of the ""open door policy"" where everyone leaves their doors open which makes it easy to meet new people. The upperclassmen dorms aren't quite at friendly."
College Senior,2,"Unfortunately, because my school is so small, there isn't a very large math program. Most of the upper division classes are only offered every two years which doesn't leave much flexibility for adding another major or minor."
Senior,1,"Wouldn't recommend, supposedly nationally accredited and I haven't learned anything yet I am still almost done with my college coursing. Horrible cashiers office, don't ever plan to owe money to this establishment. Waste of my time and money!"
Freshman,1,"At first coming to this school seemed like a good idea and a good opportunity to get out and experience the life of a college student. Two months later I found out that you will not get that here. The food is absolutely terrible, the cafeteria closes very early, no campus life whatsoever ESPECIALLY on the weekends, for being a christian school the majority of them don't have true christian values, the dorms are like prison cells and are in need of serious renovation, I got depressed asked for help and never got any, I was also an athlete and the program isn't good. I would not recommend this school to anyone. "
Recent Alumnus,1,There are no Greeks in my school. Not allowed. We have honor groups instead.
College Junior,1,There really isn't much to choose from. Like most school have a lot of choices. My school is not even close.
College Freshman,1,The places to live around the school is just houses basically
College Junior,1,The college should value diversity and avoid being racial.
College Junior,1,"The faculty in this college are arrogant and unresponsive. They claim christians, but not at all. The financial department is a mess. They look for more money from students and not good education. It is like a social gathering with prayers and relatives around. Bad idea."
College Senior,1,"Students Are Held Accountable – As a Christian University, accountability is even more important among the faculty and students on this campus. The vision of this university is to hold its memebrs to a higher standard and uphold Christian principles. I believe this is fair given the mission and purpose of this school. We want to be Christlike examples for others in the community."
College Junior,1,man the weather is crazy out here. when it snows it affects our way of walking to school and when it rains so hard it comes with thunderstorms that affects our safety. the hot weather also affects us during our football practices.
College Freshman,1,"The availability of off campus housing is very limited at Mid America, almost all people live on campus and there is not a wide base of housing available near the campus either. The cost to live off campus would really not be an advantage to living on campus and it would be less safe as well as more responsibility. overall it would just be better to live on campus."
College Senior,1,the campus is a christian campus which means that there are no girls allowed in boys dorms and vice versa. there is a midnight curfew for freshman and the curfew goes up with the number of years that you live in the dorms. the campus police do as much ticket writing as possible and the fines can add up quickly... you have a lot of supervision at all times on this campus which means that there are lots of opportunities to break the numerous rules they set.

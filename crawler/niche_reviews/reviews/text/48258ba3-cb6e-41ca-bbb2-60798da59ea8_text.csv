Graduate Student,5,My online experience was great. Innovative tools and communication made the courses easy to understand and study out of the classroom.
Graduate Student,5,Beautiful Campus at San Diego and Seattle. Great administration and student body. Great cities and many opportunities.
Junior,5,"Bastyr is the ultimate melting pot between earth and science. Never have I ever found some a place, or a community of people, who nourish my scientific mind and spirited soul."
Alum,5,I am a graduate of the Naturopathic Physician program and ever since graduating I have made more and more money. I have been involved in a variety of different jobs within the integrative medical space. I recommend this school to anyone wanting to make a difference in the health and wellness of their community.
Junior,5,It is a small university and I enjoy it because the instructors and advisors take a genuine interest in what and how you are doing. They are very involved in your studies and your career path.
Graduate Student,5,"Bastyr resides on a pristine campus. Serenity and strength aromatherapy must be piped into the building through the air vents, because the environment is inducing of focused study, mental clarity and assurance of self worth. 
I love it here. The professors challenge yet are amazingly supportive, while ranking at the top of thier fields in credential.
I think it is worth the money, or i wouldn't be enrolled. But, my experience in the program is constantly building my confidence. nu"
Graduate Student,5,I am in my first semester of my Master's degree and they have been very organized and incredibly quick to respond to any questions I have.
Graduate Student,5,"As a new student to Bastyr, I am realizing how wonderful and helpful the staff is. In addition, the campus resources are awesome and the campus itself is just beautiful. I cannot wait to continue my education here for the next three years."
College Sophomore,5,Classes are small and tight knit. The same women in a cohort for three years is such a blessing.
College Sophomore,5,Most students have jobs before graduation unless they are setting up a new practice. Bastyr does a great deal to help students get placed into good jobs.
College Sophomore,5,Very supportive group of people! No matter the situation everyone works hard to support each other and makr campus a safe and healthy place!
College Sophomore,5,They have individual suites for students that live on campus and the accessories are amazing. Such a healthful and relaxed environment. Great sense of community and fun!
College Sophomore,5,From what I've seen and experienced already this is such a fantastic school. Everyone here is so dedicated and the faculty and staff do their utmost to make sure that the student life is as easy as possible while the students work extremely hard to meet their goals. It is a great place to learn and grow and I am thrilled to be a part of the school community.
College Junior,5,"The courses and professors have been exceptional. The nutrition program tracks are specifically tailored to each focus and the ease of scheduling has been a dream. I have respected, liked and learned a great deal from each professor I've come in contact with."
College Junior,5,Bastyr is extremely well respected and I believe I will have no problem finding meaningful work post-graduation. I have not interacted much as of yet with the career center (much of that will happen next fall) - so can't speak to that as of yet.
College Junior,5,"So far my experience has been exceptional. The instructors are all very invested in what they're teaching, their students and wellness in general. It is a wonderful and supportive environment."
College Junior,5,The courses and professors are fantastic and absolutely packed with information.
College Junior,5,"Bastyr is fantastic. The community is open, kind, and accepting and the curriculum is intense and stimulating."
College Senior,5,"Small class sizes

Passionate, informed, accessible teachers

Supportive community/class mates

Rigorous courses"
College Senior,5,"Class sizes are small, professors are encouraging and passionate, the courses are thought provoking and there are many different types of classes offered."
College Senior,5,Campus is very safe. There is a security team but I have not heard of their services ever being needed.
College Senior,5,"Bastyr is an amazing community within the school. The teachers are wonderful, supportive, and challenge us to work hard. The curriculum is intense, science-heavy, with an emphasis on natural health. With programs like Naturopathic Medicine, acupuncture, nutrition, botany, oriental medicine, and midwifery, we're able to interact with students from other programs and pick their brains for ways to enhance our own paths as well. The student body is very supportive of each other and it's just a great learning experience."
College Senior,5,Indian and Thai are my FAVORITE!
College Junior,5,"This is a new program but I feel honored to be a part of it and a part of Bastyr.  The cohort I am a part of is small and allows for sharing of ideas and intimacy.  It is evident that my peers are highly intelligent and emotionally evolved, as are the faculty of course!  Everyone shares a desire for all involved to succeed in this program and in life.  It feels as though this program is designed and implemented from a place of compassion."
College Sophomore,5,best school in the world
College Junior,5,Most of the students are very responsible and do not cause problems or concern with the administration.
College Junior,5,Bastyr students are health conscious and environmentally conscious and their interests and dress reflect that.
College Junior,5,I live in Seattle where there are many housing options.
College Junior,5,Students from all over the world attend the school and everyone is accepted.
College Junior,5,"Herb gardens, green housing, state parks with hiking trails create a beautiful surrounding for learning."
College Junior,5,Students have many people to turn to for help on campus.
College Junior,5,I wouldn't want to be anywhere else!
College Freshman,5,"San Diego is the prettiest city. Not only is it right next to the beach, and the weather is always perfect, but there are so many attractions and sight seeing close by. Restaurants are abundant, and downtown can be a fun weekend place to hang out -- and when you're ready for a real break, LA, Disneyland, and many other of California's iconic landmarks are close by."
College Freshman,5,"To be studying to become a Naturopathic doctor at Bastyr is amazing. The support of your fellow classmates and faculty is like none that you imagine in medical school. Everyone is there to help everyone out in succeeding. The workload is heavy, but if you are there for the right reasons, then it's things you want to truly learn and know."
College Freshman,5,There is so much help and support from the staff at the Kenmore campus to get you in the right direction for financial aid. I got everything covered and plus some that I rejected using. 
College Freshman,5,"I really love the location of Bastyr and the people I am with. The small class size makes us all feel like we truly are a big family helping each other out. I've learned so much from my classmates already, and I can't believe we have four full years to grow into the doctors of the future together!"
College Freshman,5,"75 and sunny all the time on the San Diego campus! Even though the campus may not be a traditional layout, the proximity to the beach and the glorious weather make up for it!"
College Freshman,5,"Diversity is something that is definitely seen on campus whether it is nationality, religion, polital, or general beliefs; however, it is not something that separates students at all. Everyone embraces the differences that we all have and use them to their learning advantage so that when we graduate we may be able to relate to all kinds of people and respect and acknowledge that we all differ in opinions."
College Senior,5,"The ground of the school are very well taken care of, everything is beautiful. The garden is amazing. There are lots of student hang out spots, and the dorms are super nice"
College Senior,5,"I have not seen any drugs on campus, other than people talking about alcohol"
Junior,4,"Online labs are less than ideal. The professors are making the most of the situation, but it is still not as educational as hands-on labs."
Junior,4,"Bastyr is a fantastic science-based institution for alternative medicine! The professors and degree programs are top-notch! My only criticism is with the offices (like financial, IT, admissions), you really have to advocate for yourself to get things done."
Junior,4,With COVID we're all learning together. It's been tough but both students and teachers have been real understanding with one another and that's where it matters most.
Alum,4,"Bastyr University gave me the most incredible education!  The professors made sure that as graduates would be able to go out into the world and be able to use our BS, or we were completely prepared to take the next step and enter into a Master's Program.  

That being said the curriculum was incredibly tough as most of our professors taught on the Undergraduate level, Graduate level and many of the professors taught the Naturopathic Doctors program as well.  So their standards set high for the Bachelor's programs!"
College Junior,4,Everyone knows everyone; you build a very large family and we all look out for each other.
College Junior,4,This college helps students to develop both in knowledge of their field and as a person.  It provides a well rounded look on all of it's programs instead of just pulling practices from one culture.
College Junior,4,"The dorms on campus are fabulous.  They are fairly new and very spacious; each student gets their own room and bathroom, only having to share a full kitchen, living room and study areas.  Everything is very close to classes and it's in the middle of a state park, so the setting is wonderful and hiking is a great thing to do each day."
College Junior,4,"I love the college, but it's a little hard to get around the community if you don't have your own transportation."
College Junior,4,"Campus security is not a focus at Bastyr per se - likely due to the small campus, the small student body, the small ratio of males/females and the location (360 wooded acres surrounded by suburbia). I have never heard of a single safety issue on campus or in the surrounding park area. I feel very safe on campus."
College Junior,4,I think there is an emerging field trend for natural health. I think a degree here is valuable.
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus. I hear that there has been one incident on campus this year, but statistically, that's not excessively terrifying."
College Junior,4,"There are 12 people per dorm. Each room has its own bathroom and the floors are heated. Sound carries very well in the dorms, unfortunately. Untidy roommates can be a hassle."
College Senior,4,"My degree is in dietetics which is a fairly popular field right now, I feel secure that I will be able to get a job after graduation. Bastyr is particularly respected in the nutrition field as well, so I think that will help to give me a leg up."
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is very unique, students live in large ""houses"" where each student has their own room and bathroom and share a large kitchen, living space area. People are generally respectful of common space (will vary depending on who is living at the dorm at any given time), cleaning crew comes every week or two and students are responsible for keeping the space clean between those visits."
College Senior,4,Many of the degrees offered like ND or acupuncture are fields where the healthcare provider must open a private practice. The rest are fields that are up and coming so many jobs are available.
College Senior,4,"The school is incredibly small, with only about 1200 students, about half of them are in the naturopathic doctor program. They instructors are experts and care deeply about their students success. I would definitely choose Bastyr again. I feel well prepared for the future."
College Student,4,Bastyr has one of the best doctorate of naturopathic medicine curriculums in the world.
College Senior,4,"Bastyr offers personalized attention and focuses on a holistic whole foods approach to Nutrition, while providing a rigorous science background."
College Senior,4,"You can normally get rooms off-campus, no problem."
College Senior,4,"We are adults, they have little limitation."
College Senior,4,"Everything is good, just expensive."
College Senior,4,"Small fridge space, REALLY nice rooms, and spacious."
College Junior,4,"The campus is small but has a friendly, community feel.  It is in a forested, beautiful setting with flourishing gardens and hiking paths to the water.  If you're looking for big and boastful, this is not the campus for you.  If you are looking for natural beauty in an environment where students and faculty truly care about what they are learning and teaching, you won't be disappointed."
College Junior,4,"A car is really needed in order to get out and enjoy all the area has to offer.  With Seattle and Bellevue nearby, there are many great eateries, museums, shopping opportunities, sporting events and nightlife options.  There are also countless outdoor enthusiast pursuits including hiking, biking, kayaking, paddle-boarding, sailing, skiing, snowshoeing, and more.  Without a car though, this campus is somewhat remote with limited public transportation options."
College Sophomore,4,we have no sport teams but we do have sport clubs
College Junior,4,Volunteer work is required for graduating which makes connecting to the field easier.
College Junior,4,Small class sizes allow for great discussions and assistance from professors.
College Sophomore,4,The students here are health minding and serious about their academic pursuits.  Drugs and parties are not a big part of the culture here.
College Sophomore,4,"Apply for FAFSA and scholarships.  They don't offer a lot of scholarships, but every little bit helps."
College Sophomore,4,"The internships for my program are relatively easy to find because there are not many people in the field.  I haven't begun the process yet, but I am not worried."
College Sophomore,4,It is a lot of really hard work.  Time-consuming and demanding academics.  The instructors demand excellence from every student.  That is why this school has a great reputation.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a pretty secluded campus.  I have heard of backpacks getting stole, but no other crimes."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't live on campus, but I wish I did.  The buildings are new with a common kitchen.  I hear that the rooms are small, but that keeps life simple while you study."
College Junior,4,Not everyone you meet has the same views.
College Junior,4,"Nature, scenary. No big parties."
College Junior,4,Very thorough and also dynamic!
College Sophomore,4,"Facilities are top-notch, as well as teachers, programs, and opportunities available for students."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many student from many different backgrounds on campus, but many are female Washington residents"
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus and everyone makes me feel very comfortable
College Sophomore,4,Everyone seems to be pretty open-minded and drug use does not cause any concern
College Sophomore,4,Just make sure to talk to the financial aid office - they are very quick with responses and are very helpful to a student in need
College Freshman,4,"Bastyr San Diego is not your typical physical campus. It is simple and small, but the weather and social aspect of it gives it a ""home-y"" feel. The students are like family always helping each other out, and trails can be enjoyed all around campus."
College Freshman,4,It very clean and has lost of natural resources for students studying natural medicine.
College Sophomore,4,Awesome healthy cafeteria.  Tons of restricted diet friendly options.
College Sophomore,4,they have broad variety of majors that really allow the students to pursue something they are interested in
College Sophomore,4,"The parking is great sometimes fills up quickly, so i have to be on time !!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Lots of out door recreation available- the campus is situated in a 100 acre state park, so hiking is a built-in luxury.  Lake Washington is on the west border of the park and lake activities are encouraged.  Local transit is easy to use and gets you to Seattle city center for everything culture-related."
College Sophomore,4,Shuttles from downtown and the university district.
College Sophomore,4,"I am going to this school because of the program that I applied to, it is the only program in the country that I even considered."
College Sophomore,4,There is a parking lot right infront of the main building and student village parking right next to it.
College Junior,4,"The food on campus is organic and fresh.  The Dining Commons first started out as all vegetarian and incorporated meat into their menu, but during my last quarter of my 1st year it seems that they have taken out the meat.  The vegetarian choices are still delicious and you pay by weight.  If you don't want what is served for that day, you also have a choice of making your own sandwich, salad, or pho.  They have a make your own omelette station for breakfast and a dessert station."
College Sophomore,4,"Bastyr is between downtown Seattle and some pretty wealthy suburbs.  The general attitude of the local people seems pretty respectful of the students.  That being said, the students at Bastyr are very serious about their education and don't give the local people much to get upset about."
College Freshman,4,"It seems removed from crime, tucked away in the woods right next to a seminary.  Very safe."
College Sophomore,4,Great instructors in the Herbal Sciences and AOM departments
College Sophomore,4,"Great school for our specialized fieelds, though the more basic bio sciences could use some better instructors."
College Sophomore,4,"Easy to Stay Fit and Happy – Kenmore is a great city, and there a lot of things to keep busy. There's easy access to the many attractions in the city of Seattle via bus or bike ride on burke-gilman trail. There is also tons of miles of hiking and mountain biking in Saint Edwards park which is located right next to Bastyr University. Also there are many local farmers markets to keep someone busy with healthy shopping."
College Junior,4,"I'm an MSN/DPD major, it is a great program. The workload is intense and the curriculum is challenging but it has a lot of opportunities for networking. Since it is a small school there is a lot of help from the teachers. This program focuses on whole foods and holistic health which is somewhat unique from other programs across the country."
College Junior,4,"Only Time Will Tell – I think what excites me about this program is that I can pursue my personal goals and growth while preparing to better serve my community.  I have concerns that I will not be able to make enough money to pay off loans for a long time. I plan to first gain considerable experience and achieve licensure as a Mental Health Counselor.  Eventually, I plan to begin an independent practice.  I think that finding a job in this field will be up to level of my own ability to pursue this.  I hope Bastyr can help me make the best out of my career.  Thank you"
College Junior,4,"It's All in the Culture – Because this is a school that attracts people that are genuinely interested in wholeness-based health, I would say elicit and damaging drugs don't even have a change to seep into the culture at this school.  There may be those outliers that partake in a certain ""nameless"" illegal plant because there is an interested counter-culture that parallels some of the values at Bastyr but I don't think it's forced upon anyone or leads to any negative impact.  Thank you"
College Junior,4,"Location, Location, Location!!! To Whom It May Concern,
My experience with security has been positive so far, even though it is still early in the game for my attendance at Bastyr.  It feels, sounds, and looks safe and that seems to be the way to know because I have not had any problems.  I think it is the location that appears secluded, but is actually cushioned in a cozy state park that is surrounded by healthy and safe neighborhoods.  It's off the beaten path and I think secluded by thick trees and trails.  Safety is obviously important to the school's leadership but they definitely have an advantage with the secure environment that protects the student population.  Thank you.

Jenny Donovan"
Alum,2,I never took online classes while I was a student at Bastyr. So this category of questions is irrelevant for me.
Alum,2,"Not a good value if you aren’t independently wealthy and are hoping to be able to pay back student loans. The ND program in particular prepares you to be self employed but there is no business training and job prospects are poor. If you want this career, go get your NP or PA credentials and then study functional medicine. Then you are employable and if you want to build your business you can do so while getting a salary with benefits."
College Junior,2,"Athletics isn't something that this school stresses about; we are more about academics, than sports and just about every student I've talked to is perfectly happy about that."
College Junior,2,Bastyr is a natural medicine college that lacks an athletic department.  There is a tennis court and a state park just off campus with hiking trails.
College Sophomore,2,"Ummm, There is a bar across the street.  I think people go downtown if they want ti party, but I don't think it is a very big concern."
College Junior,2,"Good for nature walks, bad for partier."
College Junior,2,My school doesn't have sports.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is an expensive area with limited availability. There may be a lot of housing in the surrounding area, but the wait lists can be more than a month, unless you get lucky. There is a 'pet rent' that all rental apartments require if they allow pets (a very new phenomena to me). Lots of variety close to campus if you can pay for it!"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really care about this and I have not noticed.  I am married and going to school for an education, not a dating scene."
College Sophomore,2,There is a mini mall across the street with some eating places.  If you want to drive there are a bunch of places in Kirkland and Kenmore.
College Sophomore,2,"No athletics, only clubs.  People don't go to Bastyr to play sports unless they are in the exercise science program."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot in walking distance, but the campus cafe has a great reputation."
College Senior,2,"I have only been up there a few times so far, but it seems like there isnt much parking available and it fills up quickly."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the greatest nightlife AT the school, however if you can get a few buddies to travel over to Seattle than you will have a BLAST!!"
College Junior,2,I feel that the Financial aid is fair at Bastyr. This school is a private school so it is expensive and this is my first year attending as well as receiving financial aid. I didn't get much help this year because I am considered a dependent under the Department of Education even though I support myself. I feel that the department is very knowledgable and useful with guidance of aid. I would suggest to wait until your are 24 to attend school if you are in desperate need of funds.
College Junior,2,"Parking enforcement is a joke. We pay for parking, but often will have to park far away because Board members are coming and have to park right in front."
College Sophomore,2,"Since it is an expensive, private school primarily with graduate degree levels in the natural health arts and sciences, it primarily attracts well to do White people. Its hard being a poor minority here in many ways, and it would be nice for there to be more diversity in this respect. Not just for my own experience, but frankly, these affluent White people just do not know how to talk to people outside of their bubble, so I dont see them effectively bringing this medicine to my or other non white communities. We are the only ones who can do that, so more of us need to attend these schools."
College Junior,2,"Science Corner – Experience with the science corner tutoring service has been unpleasant. Typically there is not enough tutors onsite to receive help in a timely fashion, and when a tutor finally is able to spend time with you on a problem, they are unable to really help you to understand a problem and work through it."
College Junior,1,There are no sororities or fraternities at my school.  I think that they are a waste of time and encourage bad behavior like partying to the extreme.
College Junior,1,Students are more focused on studying than partying.
College Junior,1,No greek life at the university.  No need for special housing or greeks versus non greeks.
College Sophomore,1,No Greek houses or organizations.

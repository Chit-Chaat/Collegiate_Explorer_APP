Freshman,5,My experience has been wonderful at SFSC. All the staff are super nice and sweet! My professors are really good and push me to do better.
Sophomore,5,"The online system is easy to use, and teachers are willing to communicate with you as well. Student email and all other personal functions are linked, so everything is easy to navigate."
Junior,5,"This is a beautiful campus and it gives central Florida an academic center that had not existed twenty years ago. It is my home away from home. Teachers and students smile at you. Lots of places to meet up. Amazing after hours culture, theater and art. The facility and staff are always willing to help the students. If you ask a question, but one of the staff does not know the answer, they will do everything in their power to get you the correct information. It is an amazing place to obtain your AA degree. It is close to home. The classes do challenge me, but it will prepare me for the university level classes."
Freshman,5,"I love SFSC!! It's just an amazing environment and I love the atmosphere given by staff and students. Education is easy to receive and excel in given that you apply yourself, then SFSC is there for you!"

Help is always available to anyone who is need. Class sizes are decently sized which makes the classroom environment comfortable. Overall South Florida State College is a great school!
Sophomore,5,"The teachers at this institution are driven on the desire to educate the students to their fullest ability. The small class sizes in relation to other state colleges is relatively small, which is a benefit for students so that they have the ability to connect with their professors more personally. In addition, there is an over abundance of tutoring assistance to be found on campus. Also the Student government is very involved with doing activities with the students on campus."

The campus is always clean, full of activities, and safe. When I go to that college I feel the real college experience especially at the main campus. There is so much offered there through academically, and socially."
Freshman,5,The instructors take the time to listen and will meet with u after hours if needed. Their goal is to see you succeed
Freshman,5,"The campus is very nice and everyone is nice and welcoming. The first time I walked into campus as a high school senior I was very reserved at first because I was so unsure of this big campus, but after roaming around and meeting people I felt right at home!"
Freshman,5,Great school for the price. The professors have all been great and are always available to help. I would recommend this school to anyone just starting out and getting a two year degree.
College Senior,5,"Online classes are great because you are able to work at your conivence, you just have to keep up on the she dates of things."

College Sophomore,5,I love the smaller classroom sizes because I feel there is more one on one time between me and the teacher.
College Senior,5,"I have learned greatly throughout my first year in college, and have surpassed what I actually believed I could not have achieved. Teachers at South Florida State College will do there best to try and help you, as long as you are willing to put the time and the effort into class the assignments. I truly believe if a student is as dedicated as I am to their studies they could achieve great things at South Florida State College.   "

College Sophomore,5,"Thus far, my academic experience has been wonderful.  With faculty and staff that care about me, I am certain my academic experience is going to be a success."
College Sophomore,5,"As a first year college student, my adviser helped me decide on a workload that would not overload me.  My instructors are very knowledgeable and care very much about not only me, but every student in the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,"The main reason I chose SFSC is because it's close to home and I am able to work around my personal schedule, i.e. my daughters school schedule and doctor appointments.  The school helped me fill out everything needed for financial aid and to register for classes.  I am a single mother so everything I do is for her.  Teaching is my passion and someday hope to have a Masters in teaching English in Secondary Education.  Returning to school after almost 13 years was frightening but the staff at SFSC has made it an easy transition."
College Junior,5,"if an individual can not assist me in a question or concern their in certainly someone who can, i am not passed around but better yet pointed into the right direction. in the way that i can ask the right person the correct questions."
College Junior,5,I love taking all of my computer classes online the teachers are great to work with!
College Junior,5,The student body is pretty large for a state college and has a wonderful outburst of many different personalities.
College Senior,5,"I chose South Florida Community College because it was closer to home. While attending the school i realized i made the right choice, as in classes were able to fit in to my schedule, counselors were very attentive in what i needed and wanted. I also had amazing professors who would take time out of their busy schedule to help students out when they asked for it. The environment is very friendly and the students and staff get along very well."
College Senior,5,I am on the softball team at South Florida Community College and the school makes it known and clear when extra-cirricular activities are going on at the school.
College Senior,5,They really help explain everything to students in the easiest ways possible. They are also very welcoming to new students and there are plenty of opportunities for everyone to get involved.
College Junior,5,You can always find help or find someone who can tell you where to go to get help!!
College Freshman,5,There is a place to print assignments everywhere you go! There is free printing here that the SGA provided for all students. There is a university center which is very quite and where most go to complete homework. The library is not very big but there are computers all around campus available to students.
College Junior,5,"The tuition is not as bad as I was thinking it would be, it is much more affordable than the college I wish to transfer to. Also, each sememster you can apply for a whole lot of local scholarships from the college and that is so helpful! I have received one so far, but I am thankful for that one considering a lot of people don't even take the time to try to get any scholarships. I feel good when I receive scholarships, not just from the school...anywhere!"
College Junior,5,I have taken both online and lecture classes and both have been good experiences.
College Junior,5,Everything is great! There are so many programs from cosmetology to Nursing.
College Junior,5,"We have a gym, as well as a personal trainer. The library is very helpful as well. There are always student activities going on here at our college."

College Senior,5,"Not only does the campus provide a lot of resource information in orientation day, but the also have an FYE class for upcoming freshman's to get to know the variety of resources the campus has to offer each and every one of them. Genious!"
College Junior,5,All of my teachers were expectional & knowledgeable about their subject. Overall I feel that I learned a lot & that it was well worth the money spent.
College Sophomore,5,"I think we have AWESOME resources, we have a state of the art campus, the library has everything you could ever want/need, you can access it from your computer at home, there are many different activities to do on campus if you are in between classes, the campus is very clean nice and very up to date."
Alum,4,The school provides what is needed for a community of students that do not have plentiful options.  The teachers are for the most part hardworking and invested in the success of their students.
Alum,4,"Lots of general education classes are offered online, many of the professors who teach these classes are dedicated to the student getting the most out of these courses.  The exception is the English department."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are very helpful, wanting their students to succeed. Some campuses are small, but easy to navigate. Counselors also work very well to make things easier for you. Doesn't offer too many degrees, but is reliable and affordable for an Associates."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID-19, we had to transition to online learning. The professors did an excellent job, even the ones that are not use to the online learning. We were all learning together. Each professor made sure the students knew about the online meetings and would remind us frequently. My professors did not want to exclude any student. They were all really reasonable. The professors even taught the students how to use some of the online technology. The professors made online learning enjoyable and easy."
Freshman,4,Great college. Works for busy  mom with two kids.  I can work when I need to to suit my college class schedule. The campus is clean and you feel safe as a student. Affordable as well which is also nice. I would recommend south Florida state college to anyone who has a busy life with kids.
Alum,4,"Small class sizes are a plus at this, now State University as it offers BA programs. They are affordable and have quality teachers!"
Junior,4,"The professors and counseling are all very helpful when you are in need of help! I have never had a bad experience with a professor. One thing that needs to change a little bit is definitely the living space for the students that stay there. They need better dorms. Also, there needs to be a more variety of food in the cafeteria. Maybe a Starbucks or something on campus!"
Sophomore,4,"small school and a good spring board to larger universities, good professors and learning environment. excellent library and inventory."
Sophomore,4,South Florida State College is conviently located in between Avon Park and Sebring Florida directly off the main highway. It offers many classes from education to cosmetology. You are able to take classes on-line or in the classroom. The offices are open at convient times throughout the year. The guidance staff is very knowledgeable on what classes are available and best suited for the degree you are wanting to obtain.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my experience so far at South Florida State College. I have gotten to meet new people, I have joined the Toastmasters club. I think the SFSC has the college feel I wanted without losing the hometown feeling I love. I do love the fact that wildlife is around the college, especially when studying. I love having the feel of nature close by. What I do want to change is for the criminal justice courses to be taught at the college instead of being all online."
Freshman,4,It is small which makes it an good environment to be in. Professors always help if you ask. It is easy to navigate though too
Niche User,4,The institution has basically every course for every major and its professors are pretty good as well. Student life is very open and diverse just not as populated as other major universities.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy all the extra resources to get help or tutoring. One thing that would be very helpful is if there was math or writing lab on Friday's.
Sophomore,4,"In high school I participated in Dual Enrollment courses at South Florida State College. My experience at the time was great. Currently I am struggling with starting back because I am being shuffled from office to office, not receiving much hands on guidance in terms of financial aid. People are helpful, but it's overwhelming for a student who has been out of school for a couple of years and wanting to return without mounds of debt."
Sophomore,4,Good experience overall made many new friends and got along with all of the professors. Wish the classrooms were bigger.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy south Florida state college because those that work their or even volunteer there are there to help me move on to the next step in life and that this is a crucial part of the rest of my life. Making the right decisions on what degree to pursue, who to hang out with, or even simple things that make studying easier."
Sophomore,4,This college is a good start for any student fearing college life and the expenses to start off slow and to move on to a university one day. The teachers are very engaging and seem to generally care about the success of the students.
Sophomore,4,"Thus far, I have enjoyed my experience at South Florida State College. I have found that most professors are always willing to do their best to help you succeed in their course. Out of the 50+ credit hours I have earned so far, I have only found one or two professors that I simply did not feel worked well with my learning experience. As far as a diverse learning program, it is evident that South Florida State College lacks the resources to supply every student with a wide variety of opportunities for his or her major/career choice. I am looking to transfer to a University in the Summer or Fall of 2018. As of right now, the college lacks some course recommendations which would help me excel in the Engineering programs at other Universities. That being said, I do feel that SFSC is a good local choice for many students who are looking to go right into the work force as soon as possible."
Freshman,4,South Florida State College is a great campus for students who don't like to be in crowded areas.  The classroom sizes are not too big or small for students to be able to be one on one with a professor if needed.  The area around the school is quite small and country like.  I would recommend this college to a student who is more interested in feeling at home rather than a big University style type of living.
Sophomore,4,"As a transfer student I have needed a lot of help , guidance, and better understanding as I take on bigger responsibilities. Being that this is my first time living on campus, advisers, financial aid, and admissions office has been nothing but helpful, patient and kind to me."
Junior,4,I liked the fact that this college was close to home. It allowed me the opportunity to save money by providing affordable classes with an investing education. The town is small but it has the right people to become close with and create a foundation for your future.
Freshman,4,It is a small college so you get to be very one-one-one with the teachers. It gives you the foundation for moving on to a higher level university.
Senior,4,South Florida State College is a small college and the personal encounters make for a great experience.
Niche User,4,This school offers a large variety of courses. There is the main campus as well as three other branches.
Freshman,4,"South Florida State College is a great college. The staff is extremely helpful, and is willing to push with you to get things done. The counselors are extremely knowledgeable and helpful."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is so helpful, kind, and nonjudgmental. The staff are so personable and invested in your future! Because classes are small, the student-professor relationship and the professors' ability to gauge understanding is superb!"
College Senior,4,"My experience has been very conivence, classes are easy to schedule around work"
College Senior,4,"The teachers really are passionate about the mateial they teach, and they are more then willing to help you"
College Senior,4,The teachers and advisors do their best to help you be successful
College Freshman,4,The college works with me and my work schedule. It provides me with options of night or day classes ranging from 8 in the morning to 8:45 in the evening. There are no hassles or frustrations because they make it clear and detailed on how things work.
College Freshman,4,"Some professors are updated with their material as it changes through out time, they are passionate, and have a handle on how to get students to understand."
College Freshman,4,Elementary Education majors have opportunities to have real world experiences as tutors and the work load is manageable with all the outside of classroom work.
College Freshman,4,I attended South Florida State College as a dual enrollment student. It is a small college where teachers can interact with their students. It is easier to go to this community college due to the cost of semesters.
College Sophomore,4,Teachers are very helpful and the quality of education in my major is great. I have learned so much and am very proud of what we can experience here.
College Sophomore,4,I just started but so far very good.
College Student,4,The career center and services are set up to take care of most needs. Extremely helpful !!
College Student,4,"Class size is comparable to a typical high school, lots of variety considering the school size!! I've had teachers take time out of their busy schedule to sit down and help me understand the few little things that just dont seem to click."
College Student,4,"Good school that offers hundreds of ways to help you, everything is super close!!! School breakfast and lunch helps students eat on a budget!!!!"
Recent Alumnus,4,It really depends on your professor. Many were very nice and polite but i had some that i did not like personally.
Recent Alumnus,4,They were okay with getting these things together but their is not a whole lot of experiences for it.
College Sophomore,4,Small classss work best for me.
College Freshman,4,Online courses are very easy to manage. I am able to access the class wherever and whenever I want
College Freshman,4,Most of my teachers are all willing to help me when I am having a hard time and many of them explain what they are talking about with examples that are very helpful.
College Freshman,4,I feel very comfortable in each class and instructors are willing to help when I need it.
College Senior,4,"This school is actually pretty great. It's small, but it has very knowledgeable professors and it's pretty cheap."
College Junior,4,It's a great school. I enjoy it and the professors.
College Junior,4,Everyone has been very helpful with the entire process.
College Sophomore,4,I have had some really great professors that really know what they are talking about and how to teach it.
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are not overwhelming with people, and the professors have time to do one-on-one explaining if it is necessary"
College Sophomore,4,There is not one person that I have met at this school that does not have a unique personality. They show it too!
College Sophomore,4,There is always some type of activity going on. As well as numerous tutors available for help.
College Senior,4,"I have not been to the campus yet. However, the entire staff has made sure they can help me as much as possible over the phone and via email."
College Sophomore,4,"In my opinion, I think that South Florida State College keeps a very clean environment. From outside, to the classrooms, to the dorm rooms and even the athletic fields/courts. I also think that the professors and advisors are extremely helpful as well. In conclusion, South Florida State just has a overall great college."
Recent Alumnus,4,Career center and the same hooligans is very helpful when it comes to time for graduation.
Recent Alumnus,4,It is normal. Everything is straightforward and understandable.
College Junior,4,"The college is very open towards students. If there's certain things someone worries about and you ask someone, the problem/problems are solved relatively quick."
College Junior,4,There's a very good social mix at the college.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Student Body is the small town people you know, with a few unfamiliar faces."
Recent Alumnus,4,Received my AA from South Florida and I am now working towards my Bachelors. Fernando is the best counselor I've ever had!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Teachers post their grads accordingly, within the next two days after a test has been given."
College Sophomore,2,It's not been as helpfully as I'd hope.
College Sophomore,2,I'll have to transfer but it's ok I guess.
College Sophomore,2,There needs to be more flexibility with the science and math courses
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many of the scientific classes offered at various times, they are pretty much set where they are and not flexible."
College Senior,2,I had to do it all myself
College Senior,2,having problems and haven't started
College Junior,2,Lab space is limited. Not much offered.
College Junior,2,This the only negative aspect in my opinion is some of the staff and info about financial aid. I am requesting a loan for the first time and needing to apply for a second one to afford my program and they just left me in circles.
College Junior,2,"My first day to take the assessment and the instructor hit on me multiple times and when i was speaking to the dean, for information not pertaining to previous comment, she was not very helpful and was not very polite either. She also did not seem to know what she was talking about."
College Freshman,2,There is a school gym which is open for about 5 hours a day... There is a school pool which is open for about an hour a day.. There is a library but not that helpful. Not many campus activities at all.
College Senior,2,The financial aid process is a confusing and they just expect you to know what you are doing. The financial aid office isn't very friendly either.
College Senior,2,I attend only at night but it seems that our school is mainly females. I don't know if this is because more females work during the day so they have to take night classes. Or maybe theres just not that many males interested in college around this area.
College Junior,2,I think the Financial aid department is helpful because many students have the opportunity to go to school because of financial aid. I don't like the fact that if you fail a class to many times you have to pay out of state tuition.
College Student,2,"I think the professors could be a little more helpful and not just say ""you are not babies your in college"". I wish the financial aid office would offer more to students in the area of finances because that makes a students life a little easier"
College Sophomore,1,I do not take online cources at my college. They are very hard to understand.
College Junior,1,"Worst Experience EVER – It took them 7 months to get my Pell grant approved, after it was approved I also started taking classes at Polk State College and had it transferred there.  Because I did this, South Florida wanted to charge me triple tuition for an out of state student.  Cannot complete my classes there because this school is a joke!"
College Freshman,1,"Not Many Options at My Satellite Campus – I am an English major, focusing on Creative Writing, and unfortunately my satellite campus does not offer any extra Literature courses that I can take. Not even the main campus has creative writing classes available."
College Senior,1,"Lack Luster – Everything seems to be non-challenging, just ""busy work"""
College Senior,1,"Wish It Was Better – It seems as if high school wasn't over yet. This community college's classes has dissapointed me. I have only been challenged in 3 out of the 10 classes I have taken in the past 2 semesters. I feel like it is busy work and get-in get-out style work. I am looking forward to transferring to a ""real college"" as one of my professors said last semester. I am just happy I haven't been paying out of pocket; my scholarships have covered everything."
College Senior,1,"My credits were not entirely transferred from Broward college.  I was forced to repeat a Humanities course, which I already completed, because it wasn't done in ""survey format.""  The extra work load from this course prevented me from obtaining a 4.0, during my last 15 credit semester, and focusing on my C++ programming course which I happened to also be forced to take in independent study.  I highly disapprove of this school and would not ever recommend it to anyone.  I don't trust the Financial Aid department here or what they've done with a lot of my grant money."

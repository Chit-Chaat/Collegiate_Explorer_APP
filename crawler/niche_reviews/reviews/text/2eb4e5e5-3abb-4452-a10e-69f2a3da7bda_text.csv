Sophomore,5,The classes online are very similar to the classes in person. This university has all the things that I was looking for during high school. I am just speechless to describe how great this college is.
Sophomore,5,"This is only my first year; however, I do not regret the decision to go to Duke University. The campus is beautiful and it is flexible so you can try out whatever class you would want. The professors are not just there to get paid, but are willing to help you in any situation. The food options are abundant. The safety of the school is also very good. I would extremely recommend Duke University to anyone that is looking to go to college."

Alum,5,"I did not take any online courses, as all courses were in person when I attended. The in-person learning experience was amazing - class sizes are small and professors are engaging and invested in your academic growth."
Alum,5,Duke was the perfect balance between rigorous academics and an active social life. The professors and class offerings were amazing. The Duke campus is beautiful and the Cameron Crazies community is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.
Graduate Student,5,"Duke handled the transition to covid-19 super well, transitioning all of its classes online. Professors are still grasping online systems but are quick learners and have been very adaptable."

Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Duke - it is the perfect combination of ""work hard / play hard"". If you enjoy college sports and/or school spirit there is plenty of it!"

Graduate Student,5,"Duke University works toward coming back to school safely in the fall, they are innovating every part of the Duke experience—from the academic calendar to residential living—to provide students the best and safest possible configuration of on-campus and high-quality remote teaching."
Graduate Student,5,"Duke is one of the best universities in the USA and in the World.
Many of the assignments University professors give are team assignments. Working in teams during the program is a way to provide a student with greater experience in team environments. Additionally, it is a way for a student to establish close relationships with your classmates and to develop a deeper network during the program."
Graduate Student,5,The school has given  us lots of work but professors very helpful with the stress. Very impressed with how school tries to make sure we have all we need to learn. Via online.  It’s pretty hard but it’s a hard school.
Graduate Student,5,I love Duke University! The school is focused on research and building skills to help you excel in your future. Whenever I have a problem they are always there to help. The professors are very friendly and helpful! I would recommend Duke to everyone!

Sophomore,5,"I applied to Duke University as an Early Decision applicant. Now that I have finished my sophomore year, I look back with the desire to change nothing about my decision. Duke University has brought me incredible academic and personal experiences that I will cherish for the rest of my life and future career. This university has given me access to motivated students to push me to do my best both in and out of the classroom. I have learned to think more deeply about my surroundings and individuals, and I feel prepared to face the challenges of the real world once I graduate."
Sophomore,5,"Campus: Presence of an only freshman campus (East) allows the building of valuable friendships with fellow cohort during the first year while allowing easy access to the main campus (West). 
Balance of academics with networking: The subtle influence of a large business-minded crowd helps in networking which can be valuable to win jobs in all sectors. This also allows for a realistic approach to later career options."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed it thoroughly. Be prepared to work hard, as this is not an easy school. BUt you will enjoy it."
Graduate Student,5,"I am an Exchange student at Duke University, and I realized how lucky I am to be enrolled in this University. First of all, it is well known for one of the best Universities in the United States and maintains a very good reputation. However, not only that but Duke campus is well structured with the best infrastructures, Labs, faculties, and public facilities. But the best of this university would definitely be the diversity of the people ether students or professors."
Graduate Student,5,It’s really good. I like it. I am the #1 basketball player on the team. I have good friends and my teachers help me a lot.
Freshman,5,"Amazing school! Can't wait to attend this fall.  Great sports teams, beautiful location, good food. The lemur center is really cool."
Niche User,5,"Atleast from visiting, I hear that this school is simply an amazing place. The passion and intellect of the students here is out of this world. Every student is so passionate and engaged. The strength of this community rivals that of Ivy League universities. On top of this, the campus is absolutely beautiful."
Alum,5,It is a school with a little bit for everybody. It is a great all around school focused on athletics and academics and everything in between. I had a wonderful time here!
Niche User,5,"Duke University is very popular among students who wish to study Finance & Economics as they hear about the excellent reputations of its Professors like Connel Fullenkamp.

With this quality it is going to take the one of the first three US University Ranking slots soon."
Niche User,5,"Shortly after receiving PSAT results, received a letter of interest from Duke University encouraging a closer look at its degree programs because scores indicated a strong match and a potentially successful academic career at Duke."
Freshman,5,"I chose Duke over UChicago due to the stellar academics, research opportunities, small class sizes and amazing school spirit and vibe.   Super friendly and down to earth students as well."

Alum,5,"Challenging and exciting, Duke opened doors I didn’t even know existed - would go back in a heartbeat!"
Works Here,5,Everyone and everything is made And organize to serve students’ interest and success first. Such a great staff to support student athletes’ accomplishments.
Freshman,5,"Duke is a PHENOMENAL school. It is a challenging environment, but it is definitely more of a collaborative and encouraging environment as opposed to cutthroat. I appreciate that so much. The people I have met here are AMAZING and I have the best friends. I am so lucky to go to Duke and I can't wait for the next semester :)"
Niche User,5,I live in Durham and it is a great school. There is always something to do on campus and I really love Durham. Very vibrant community and although some students are very well off there is a great sense of community and a lot of school pride. G
Freshman,5,I chose Duke over Stanford because of the focus on the humanities and incredible vibe. Duke's elite academics coupled with the best atmosphere in America make it the top school in the US.
Freshman,5,"Duke has a wonderfully beautiful campus.  Historic buildings give the presence of importance and stature.  There is a very professional feel among student population.  Graduate students account for more than half of their 14,000 students."
Alum,5,"Duke University is an amazing institution with a wide variety of opportunities to grow as a person, a student, and a professional. Beautiful, large campus, small student population, world-class faculty, and unmatchable basketball school spirit are a just a few things that I love about Duke."
Graduate Student,5,Best college i went there for 4 years. My whole family has went there. They love it so much. Food is cheap. Lots of entertainment.
Niche User,5,They were very helpful with all my questions. Definitely recommend considering and looking into Duke University and their programs.
Sophomore,5,"Duke is a great place to come for vast opportunities, career exploration, professional development and more. You can literally try anything here! It's so flexible. Campus is beautiful, the food options are plentiful, and research experiences are readily available. The academic advising here is amazing as well."
Freshman,5,"All freshman live together on East Campus.  It provides for a lot of fellowship and a great way to connect from day one.  The dining is some of the best in the country with both dining halls, restaurants and food trucks included in the meal plan."
Niche User,5,I did a summer program here with the engineering school. The dean was great and really helped us with our presentation skills. She videotaped us presenting and made us watch ourselves to learn from our mistakes. The campus is very pretty and the basketball team is great!
Sophomore,5,It's an incredible college in which students are engaged and challenged. Duke truly makes its students smarter and prepares us for our careers.
Alum,5,"Attending Duke has been the best decision of my life thus far. My experience as a student-athlete, STEM major, and member of the Duke community compelled me to grow in myriad ways, all in a safe environment that prioritized my success. My fellow students were brilliant and passionate in everything they did, and the diversity of thought benefitted everyone on campus. My professors and coaches were dedicated not just to my education in the classroom and on the field, but to my personal and professional development. My many mistakes in all aspects of my life were seen as learning opportunities. And most importantly, after my four wonderful years came to an end, even bigger and better things awaited."
Junior,5,"Love the endless opportunities to learn, the down-to-earth students, and the ability to receive funding for summer internships. No complaints, really."
Junior,5,I love Duke! The classes are engaging and there is always someone in the faculty that can help with any academic problems. The school culture is amazing and inclusive.
Junior,5,"i went to go and visit duke over the summer, when i went there the college life and campus was amazing and the academics were outstanding they have a lot of great resertrants near by and they have there own way of connecting the police to be there in less than 2 minutes but one thing i don't like was there was no diversity there and as a african american person i felt so out of place and uncomfortable there ."
Alum,5,Outstanding school ; Duke students are among the best and far more collaborative than competitive. A Duke degree opens doors for a lifetime.
Junior,5,"Duke is an amazing place to live, eat, learn, and cultivate who you want to be when you grow up (as cliche as that sounds). I was a student-athlete, and my experience with the student body and professors could not have been better. I love having all the support in the world from people in the Duke community. Additionally, the classes are diverse and challenging, and professors take the time to get to know you (if you do the same). 10/10 would recommend"
Niche User,5,"Everything I have learned about Duke makes it seem like an amazing college and campus. The education is good, and it has many different majors to choose from. It seems to be a very good community overall with the students and teachers being supportive of each other."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere here at Duke. I got to know amazing peers and professors who give me inspirations and encouragement to challenge myself. There is a wealth of academic and extracurricular opportunities.
Junior,5,"The most amazing school. Elite academics, prestigious name, and an amazing student community. We have everything, from gothic architecture to sports here! Come here if you want elite academics with a good social scene and real sports."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience so far has been positive. The campus is very large and spread out but very accommodating. It is a friendly environment and I have no complaints about anyone I have had contact with since I started here, The professors are fair and accessible if I need to speak to them. I do far am enjoying my experience here in graduate school."
Sophomore,5,"Duke, like every school, has its negatives. Overall, it’s an environment that encourages collaboration, ambition, and progress. The extra mile is always taken to care for students, with opportunities around every corner. I am so thankful for the support I’ve been given at Duke University, and look forward to my next two years!"
Alum,5,"Duke is AMAZING and it was truly the best four years of my life. Not your standard cafeteria food; eateries all over campus with food like Mahi Mahi burgers, Prime Rib steak, Ramen, and everything in-between (all on food points). Likewise, there's a 24-hour eatery and off-campus delivery options that you can pay for (Papa Johns, Sushi Love, TGIF, Chinese, Mediterra, etc.) WITH FOOD POINTS!! Obviously basketball season is crazy and amazing; campus is super lively. Football games are also fun and don't get enough credit. Campus is beautiful and dorms are super nice and constantly renovated. When Beyonce's Formation video came out, my professor cancelled our regularly scheduled class material and we analyzed the video + it's impact on modern culture. 10/10 loved everything about Duke."
Sophomore,5,"Duke is an amazing college!!! I love the people there are  incredibly welcoming, and nice. The school spirit and sports programs are FANTASTIC. Which is one of the reasons i went! I strongly encourage you to go to Duke University if you are in a tight situation about your future."
Alum,4,"I really appreciate the time I spent at Duke and the education I received. They provide numerouse resources to support their students both in their academics, mental and physical health. I just wish I new more about all these resources sooner while I was there. I do hope that Duke continues to cultivate diversity, inclusion, and safty on campus, which is a facet of campus life that I have seen grown over the 4 years I was there."
Alum,4,"I took a summer course in 2019, and I enjoyed the experience. The class was designed and scheduled in a way that was productive, and I was not hindered eventhough I was taking the class in a different time zone (3 hours difference). However, for the last half of the 2020 spring semester all classes shifted to online. I understand that these classes (especially the lab course) were not designed to be taught online, so the transition and completion of these courses was difficult. Yet, the professors were accomidating and supportive throughout the process."
Graduate Student,4,"Great school, LOTS of opportunities, great surrounding area. There are lots of jobs and opportunities to take classes within the research triangle, which is great. Lots of employers use the university system as a funnel, which is also great."
Junior,4,"My experience at Duke has been great, but I would like to see more meaningful involvement from Duke when responding to incidents of hate and bias on campus, as well as greater transparency regarding their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, there are amazing opportunities on Duke's campus to get involved in student life and create a meaningful community, but there is also a sense of rigorous academic competition amongst your peers that results in people bragging about their unhealthy habits such as getting no sleep in order to study."
Sophomore,4,"I love the opportunities that are available at Duke, and have loved getting to learn and interact with my incredible peers and faculty. However, I think there is still something to be desired at Duke in the way of social cohesion, as it can feel very stratified at times."
Niche User,4,The professors are understanding of the current circumstances and are easing up on due dates and projects with specific requirements.
Graduate Student,4,The school is beautiful. It’s such an unbelievable place to learn. The professors go out of their way to help if you need it. There a lot of organizations if you want to join a group.  Great atmosphere and lots to do in the Durham area.  A lot of great places to eat. I’ve had a great experience here so far.
Graduate Student,4,"I have always struggled when I take online classes, as I learn best in the classroom environment. When I started to have difficulty with Duke online classes and reached out to my professors they helped me come up with some new techniques to implement in order to gain the most out of my classes!"
Freshman,4,"I liked the engagement, resources, and opportunities available to students of all disciplines. There are many programs and activities to be involved in and professors are very considerate about students."
Sophomore,4,it's ok. durham is meh. people are mainly rich assholes. greek life is big but dying. the administration has some issues
Senior,4,"I love the interdisciplinary experiences available at Duke University and if there is anything that you are interested in pursuing, Duke will make sure it can happen. However, there is the ""effortless perfection"" that students are always striving for which can lead to unhealthy habits."
Senior,4,Wish they would have told me that strict BME majors don't get jobs. Unfortunately I had to learn that senior year instead. Other than my complete lack of career prospects... it was a great time.
Freshman,4,"Duke students go by a motto of ""work hard, play hard"" and it's awesome that the academics at Duke are so great even as the party scene is really lit!"
Junior,4,"Duke University is pristine school with beautiful architecture that makes you feel like you are walking through Hogwarts. Every student is granted with individual attentions because Duke as an astounding 6:1 student to faculty ratio.  Also, they have an interest of helping students where their families make an income of 60,000 or less. The only thing I wish Duke would change are try to include is diversity. As an African American, I wish for an university to have more than 10 percent Black/African American students."
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student, I have been very pleased with the education I have received from Duke. I have felt supported by professors and the academic leadership in my program, and feel prepared for a career as I near graduation."
Niche User,4,It was very interesting seeing a campus such as Duke University so racially diverse. Duke's campus life is on like any other University I've ever toured before. This is one of my favorite colleges to attend.
Freshman,4,Duke is a good school with good academics and a pretty nice campus and environment. There are a lot of interesting new things and a lot of opportunities here.
Sophomore,4,"Incredible resources, faculty, and extracurricular opportunities! They have a lot of specialty programs for getting more real-world/hands-on experience in one's career/major interests, including Data+, Huang Fellows, Bass Connections, and DukeEngage."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely stunning, and the opportunities for academic engagement are great. The atmosphere of the basketball craze is very fun and I really have enjoyed my first year. I wish the dorms were bigger and that there were not communal bathrooms. Surrounding area is nice but there's not much to it."
Senior,4,"Had a few academic road bumps, but overall, its the faculty that makes this school something else. The professors here are so amazing, and will often go out of their way to get to know their students and help whenever they can. I honestly wish I had spent more time getting to know my professors."
Freshman,4,"One of the best things about Duke is the amazing campus and the student-body atmosphere. Especially before big games (basketball of course), everyone comes together in support!"
Sophomore,4,"I love attending Duke university because it has the perfect balance of athletics and academics. The school provides a remarkable education for students and competes at a Division 1 level in all its athletic programs. Duke provides opportunities for students after they graduate, whether it be assistance in finding a job, internship, or networking. The university has very challenging academic classes and professors with great experience."
Sophomore,4,The courses delve into the concepts as if you will be spending your whole life studying it so really great academic wise. People are generally kind around campus and there are always a lot of activities for students to do. Something that could improve is the way minority students are treated by the faculty and administration. It is most definitely not fair treatment.
Junior,4,"Duke is a university with stellar academics. Like any school that is ""academically rigorous"", it can be stressful at times, so that is not unexpected. Sports are generally a big deal on campus (sports = basketball), and the food is good. It can feel a bit like a bubble though -- Durham is a city rich with life and growth, and while a lot of students don't venture into downtown much, I would recommend it. It has a great food and arts scene, as well as local grassroots organizations who deeply care about improving Durham."
Sophomore,4,"The school is amazing! Work hard, play hard— students take both academic and social life very seriously. Love the environment."
Senior,4,"I like the atmosphere at Duke, especially the professors. Even though Duke is a very tough academic school, the professors work with you. However not all professors are understanding and try to help out especially in harder classes when you need the support the most but most are."
Alum,4,"Duke has an excellent core of teachers, a beautiful campus, and the gardens are one of my favorite places on the planet. There were definitely great people in the student body as well, but overall people there are very self-interested and juvenile. As long as you can navigate that, going to Duke will be a very enjoyable experience."
Niche User,4,Duke has great academics but I wish they would stop overcharging their students fro everything.  The facilities are great but parking is expensive and not worth the price.
Freshman,4,"In my first semester, I appreciated the experience at Duke University. The Academic Rigor and the power of the school allow many doors to open when you attend this prestigious institution. I know personally that people find jobs swiftly. 
Concerning Diversity, the school representation is similar to the demographic makeup of the U.S. (Except that there is a higher percentage of Asians). With that in mind, many minorities complain but do not realize that this representation is a reality, this is how the rest of the U.S. is regarding variety. It is very diverse in comparison to so many other colleges around the United States. Furthermore, Duke has a plethora of international students ranging from countries like Zambia to Venezuela.
The West campus is gorgeous and East Campus is inviting, but Central Campus is extremely ugly. There is so much to do on campus: parties, food, clubs, and more. Inside of Campus is also very safe."
Niche User,4,"Duke University is one, if not the best, schools out there> they have great programs like FLUNCH where you take your professors out to eat with you, and DukeEngage, where students work in other places funded through the summer. They have some of the best foods in America, and although their basketball team is not the best, they do have a good one. I love the fact that they take new ideas and ""make it happen""."
Sophomore,4,"One of the best things about Duke is that it attracts some of the most creative, driven students in the country. There is a certain atmosphere of collaboration that is often absent at universities of the same tier. I also like how Duke encourages traveling abroad (and makes it feasible to do so). Most students participate in DukeEngage or spend a semester abroad which is truly incredible. However, Duke does not do a good enough job of admitting students of a wide variety of backgrounds. Most of the people I've met so far are heterosexual, white, and wealthy."
Alum,4,"Duke is a phenomenal academic institution. There is ample opportunity to explore various majors and coursework, and meet a wide variety of students from various backgrounds. Duke is very helpful and supportive in the employment process leading into graduation."
Alum,4,"Duke is a great school. A lot of dorms are far away from classes because of the different campuses, but generally they are nice and fairly spacious. Some used to not have air conditioning, but thats mostly been fixed."
Alum,4,"I attended Duke as a transfer student, so I have a different perspective on the school. Attending Duke as a freshman is an integral part of becoming involved in the community, so I would recommend living on East Campus and engage in everything there is at the school!"
Junior,4,"I really love the community at Duke, however I think there needs to be a social change. Greek life is too prominent and dominating of the social scene. Additionally, I feel like Duke likes to focus on bringing in donations from alumni instead of its current students."
Niche User,4,I like the overall atmosphere because everyone is so smart and enjoyable. The campus is very beautiful and the professors all seem very down to Earth
Senior,4,"Duke provides an overall great college experience. I think the highlights are the strong programs in a variety of fields, so if you're undecided this is a big bonus. As a premed student I found the close vicinity of the hospital to be a great asset as far as gaining clinical experience. There is something for everyone on campus, be it a student group, sport, activity, or academic endeavor. The downsides are obviously the price if you don't have aid, and the town is not very student-friendly, especially at night. Parking is a nightmare. School spirit is great - so much energy! Food has gotten an upgrade with recent renovations to West Union."
Sophomore,4,"Duke has already helped me grow in so many ways. I have enjoyed all of my classes and they have each opened my eyes toward new topics in unexpected ways. There are so many amazing professors and the campus is truly beautiful. Sometimes things can get overwhelming or difficult and the atmosphere may not always be the most supportive, but if you seek it out actively, it is certainly there!"
Freshman,4,The culture shock was real in all aspects of Duke culture including campus life and academics but there is no regret of my choice in universities. Duke has its own unique way of life that is unparalleled. 
College Senior,4,"A lot of security, but a couple people get robbed each year. Just like on most college campuses, there is a thriving sexual assault culture that many speak up about, but it is not enough. Many high profile assault cases, particularly those involving athletes. The school is being investigated by the federal government for their handling of sexual assault cases."
College Senior,4,"A lot of dorms are far away from classes because of the different campuses, but generally they are nice and fairly spacious. Some used to not have air conditioning, but thats mostly been fixed."
College Senior,4,"I've had great academic experiences, and gotten the chance for incredible opportunities. I've learned a lot about a myriad of fascinating and pertinent subjects. However, the student body doesn't seem to care about each other very much, and many people feel lonely. There is a huge emphasis placed on greek life and athletics that can be divisive."
College Junior,4,Everyone is obsessed with Duke basketball.
College Junior,4,"I haven't even started my accelerated bachelor's of science in nursing program yet, I will in a couple months, but I already feel like I have joined this Duke community. Especially in the medical majors, I feel like the professors are approachable, and genuinely care about your success. The only downside is it is very expensive."
College Senior,4,Duke is an academically challenging school. Professors are usually leaders in their field. But sometimes they might be too concerned with their own research. Duke is also a very white space. Everyone seems to want to be the same. There are other school that are of the same caliber but probably offer more diversity and individualism within the student body.
College Senior,4,"IF you start looking in your senior year, you are pretty likely to get a job after graduation. But of course, there are some people who dont. sometimes its hard because you have to had an internship, done research, or have done a million other things. That's really hard to accomplish in your four years."
College Senior,4,We have a lot of great new places to live. But there are also some pretty bad places that are really small. Depending on where you live you might be far from your classes.
College Sophomore,4,Duke is the home of the Blue Devils. basketball is the main sport on campus. I feel as an athlete myself that basketball is the #1 sport. Athletes support other athletes. The training facilities are good and are currently improving. The facilities for non-athletes are also of good quality.
College Sophomore,4,Duke is full of professors who are passionate about their subjects and there are abundant resources of for the students. Most if not all professors are the top in their field and are very knowledgable on the subject.
College Junior,4,"To me, the value of a Duke degree comes from the people you meet while you are a student here. Research positions are relatively easy to find, even if you have to travel 10 minutes off campus to Research Triangle Park. Also, since there are so many positions in research and academia around Durham, several alumni stay in the area, and they are willing to hire Duke students to help them."
College Junior,4,"My favorite part about Duke is the relationships I have formed, with students, faculty, staff, and other local people. I also just enjoy the Triangle area (Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill) in general. It is a great setup for research and academic collaboration (and also sports rivalries). I could see myself settling down nearby after I graduate."
College Junior,4,Duke is a great place to form connections.
College Sophomore,4,"I do alumni fundraising and it seems like almost all the alumni I call are doing really well. The degree definitely has great value, particularly for finance/econ type careers"
College Sophomore,4,"I don't have much to say about health and safety except that I have never felt unsafe as a woman on campus, or off."
College Sophomore,4,"Duke is an amazing school, academically. Every professor I've had has taken a personal interest in me and has helped me learn so much. I highly recommend Duke for its classes and opportunities.

The students are often very power-hungry and competitive, and drink almost constantly. 

Some of them are also great!

Because of the resumes of a lot of the students, it can be hard to get those big opportunities you hear about on the tours-- I got rejected from a LOT of things my freshman year, despite having a 4.00 GPA. But, it all works out. I'm not transferring because I truly believe that the academics are worth it."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors are experts in their fields, but advising isn't the best and workload is hard."
Recent Alumnus,4,I loved my time at Duke. It was challenging and stimulating and really helped to shape me as a person. It was true to the work hard play hard environment I had heard about and craved.
College Freshman,4,"Duke provides students with bundles opportunities; however, there is a lot of competition to access those opportunities."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Overall I have really enjoyed my first year at Duke.  It is difficult, but the professors care and the classes are interesting."
Recent Alumnus,4,I enjoy the professors and all the opportunities that are available.
College Senior,2,"Housing for greeks is sad. They live in on campus apartments. Greek people tend to view themselves as superior and it shows, despite the fact that everyone is a nerdy Duke student and wasn't super cool in high school. Non-greeks are hostile towards greeks generally, and greeks tend to be snobby and rude towards non-greeks (especially those in ""top"" tiers)"
Recent Alumnus,2,I think Greek life represents another realm of stratification at a university that already deals with issues of classism.
College Sophomore,2,"As an independent, I think the tier-ranking system of frats and sororities is fairly dumb."
College Freshman,2,School is expensive and the aid seems to be a secret formula.
College Freshman,2,Not into the party scene
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really have much experience with financial aid or scholarships. I do know that MANY students graduate in debt - it's a pricey school. Also, because so so SO many people are so qualified/smart, it seems virtually impossible to earn a merit scholarship, and if you do it's by chance."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is a dangerous, harmful force on this campus.  Many people I know were really hurt by the rush process, by being in a chapter, or by trying to have a social life an an independent.  Even though only 1/3 of students are Greek, it is clear that they dominate the social scene (or at least think they do)."
College Senior,2,Policies are very unclear about guests and drinking
College Freshman,2,"Especially for fraternities, I've definitely heard of more than one incidence of someone being pressured into trying a drug. You name it, it's here. For non-frat members, it's still very visible, but there isn't as much pressure to use."
College Freshman,2,"It sucks, there isn't much option. Sure Durham is a foodie town, but so far it's just restaurants after restaurants selling different varieties of sandwiches. It's good for the first one or two months, but after awhile, you'll get bored. Even the food options in Chapel Hill or Raleigh wouldn't be enough, but then again I eat out almost everyday."
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman, I am only allowed to park on smith gated warehouse, which is not even on East Campus (The freshman living section at Duke). Parking become extremely difficult when I have to park at West as the parking area in Bryan Centre gets filled up rather quickly. I ended up having to pay extra to have my car parked in the parking lot. If you want to get it for free, do it after 5 pm (there are usually some open spots in front of the chapel)."
College Freshman,2,"Although Duke has passionate art history professor, I felt that it lack the wide range of variety of courses including contemporary art, 21st century modern art, etc. These are areas that I would like to develop more as a student and I would like to concentrate more on. Additionally, the school's location make it difficult for me to immerse myself in the art industry."
College Freshman,2,"I don't mind strictness, but from the police, it tends to be targeted at ethnic minorities, instead of the whole Duke community. Admin also seems more strict when it comes to these minorities, but as a whole people hide things very well."
College Freshman,2,Sexism and racism are still very much alive here.
College Junior,2,"Over rated. Before coming here I read so much about the ""hot"" student body and was so let down once I actually got here..."
College Junior,2,Duke says were are truly diverse in the student profile online but we truly aren't. If you visit campus you will notice a huge white and asian population with few minorities.
College Junior,2,"Not good, not too bad."
College Senior,2,"Shooters. Oh youre tired of Shooters? sweet, because we're still going to shooters because you have NO OTHER OPTIONS. Seriously we go to UNC and NC state to change it up, because devines is awful, and there are not other options"
College Senior,2,"Seriously freshman housing is the only thing they get right. You have your own freshman campus which is nice, but the housing system is so stupid, I was penalized by the school for the amount of complaints I levied. They literally could care less about yu. If you have a ton of cash, chances are youre fine. But everyone else can ""suck it"" -- Duke University."
College Senior,2,"A bunch of rich white kids. There are a lot of kids who try to champion gay rights and foreign policy and some secondary shit. But in terms of fitting in if youre even a bit different, good luck. They resent you being there, so be ready."
College Senior,2,"The school supports it way too much, using them as a crutch to replicate close communities within the student body living quarters. But instead, the system produces a very noticeable caste system, where top frats and sororities compete for status, while the overall feeling towards non greek students can be a bit concerning. Instead of fostering a community where everyone is included, you feel the need to join any frat or sorority in order to not be left out of the party scene. And the whole selection process for women is unbelievably inappropriate, shallow and quite annoying because it creates a lot of drama that could be avoided."
College Junior,2,"I am not a huge Duke dining fan.  Most people eat at ABP, the Loop, or Grace's.  Freshman meal plan is absurd.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is one of Duke's logistical weaknesses.  Too few spots, too many students, and too much of a distance."
College Junior,2,The food is nothing special. Be careful at night.
College Sophomore,2,"Really overrated (I am in a ""good"" fraternity here). I could see the University getting rid of Greek Life altogether within the next 30 years. It almost seems like Duke University's administration is making it their mission to stamp out fraternities from the school and they seem to have this innate hatred for us. The school is incredibly hard on us. The only reason that the school hasn't gotten rid of them yet is that the school gets an absurd amount of endowment money from Duke alums in Greek Life (WAY more than any other group)."
College Sophomore,2,"I once got a $200 ticket (YES, 200 DOLLARS) for parking in a parking lot that I had a pass to. I parked in a spot not designated. Absolutely outrageous, a speeding ticket costs twice as less. "
College Sophomore,2,The disconnect between Durham and Duke University is incredible. Two totally different worlds. 
College Sophomore,2,"Central Campus is poor to be honest. West is great, however. "
College Junior,2,I have received many alerts regarding crime on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Durham is neither pretty or full of culture. As an undergraduate student I find it hard to do anything in Durham. It's not even like we have lots of natural resources in the area either. Furthermore, Durham is not a big fan of Duke-- we're polar opposites. Durham is lower to middle class, but Duke is full of elitist kids. They don't have a good perspective of us."
College Junior,2,Parking is very difficult. You need at least 30 minutes to have enough time to park and get to your class on time. The best days are the days when you get a lucky spot in the closest parking lot!
College Senior,2,"Many students who come to Duke are able to pay their full tuition, and the students on scholarships, myself included, are sometimes baffled at economic disparity around campus, as evident through the different clothes, lifestyle, cars, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"Duke is a private school. So for someone who is in the middle class, you get virtually no financial aid other than a little bit of work study. 
However, if you are in a situation where your family strongly shows a need for financial aid, the financial aid office will do there best to figure something out. Also, the financial aid office is open to fixing any mistakes that may show on your bursar bill."
College Junior,2,"Cookie Cutter – Everyone looks and dresses the same for the most part. Guys are fratty and wear pinnies and khakis and girls wear sundresses or gym clothes. Lots of school spirit and Duke attire but other than that, not too much variation."
College Freshman,2,"Off Campus Is Inconvenient – Going off campus to eat is really inconvenient.  9th street, right off of East Campus has some decent eateries (Elmo's Diner is great), but going late at night is sketchy if you're not with a large group.  Unless you have a car, it's really not easy to eat off campus.  Several places offer ""merchants on points"" delivery, which allows you to use your meal plan ""points"" to pay for food, but they can get pricey if you're not into pizza or chinese food."
College Sophomore,2,"The black people here really self segregate. I'm not being racist, I am black."
College Junior,2,"Freshman year is the best as far as parking goes. However on main campus, parking is horrible. The parking lot for majority of students is a good walk away from main classes."
College Freshman,2,Need More! We lost a lot of varsity recruits because the financial aid wasn't enough without an athletic scholarship. I got almost no financial aid and its really straining my family.
College Sophomore,2,"Terrible: hard to find spots and expensive. Vigilant police force writes a lot of tickets, although appeal committee is lenient."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman Meal Plan – Not a fantastic system. The Marketplace, the dining hall for freshmen, offers generally subpar food. There are quite a few restaurants to choose from, but as a freshman your meal points are fairly sparse and don't offer much in the way of flexibility before having to refill."
College Sophomore,1,They say that it's only 1/3 of students who do greek life--- but it feels like a LOT more.
College Junior,1,"Very, very poor and limited options.  As someone who enjoys exercising and eating large meals, I cannot spend less than $15 other than at McDonalds."
College Freshman,1,"It doesn't tastes good. at all. They all taste like paper. By the end of the year, I seldom use my food points as I spent most of my time eating off-campus."
College Freshman,1,Duke is stingy. So many people reject coz they can't afford it
College Freshman,1,"People always black out, it's never about having fun"
College Freshman,1,"Duke tries, but Greek life wins"
College Junior,1,"Greek Life allows a bunch of snotty, rich kids the freedom to party, drink, and belittle other groups of people. Moreover, it promotes a culture of anti-intellectualism at Duke, while making it difficult for students to find a living group unless they party."
College Junior,1,Bad. Very bad. Very stingy.
College Junior,1,People are snobs here. One thing to consider is the social scene when applying. Many stuck up individuals...
College Sophomore,1,Parking is only good in the summer
College Sophomore,1,"There just aren't many scholarship opportunities in my field, therefore, it is nearly impossible to get one."
Recent Alumnus,1,limited spots in a lot that i pay for-parking is horrible
College Junior,1,"Outside of academic quality, there is almost nothing good that can be said about Duke. It is too small, way too snobby, and painfully boring. The campus and the surrounding town are completely lifeless, and the school feels more like a church than a vibrant university."
College Junior,1,"It is an extremely snobby little campus, and the students are very unfriendly. Everyone is either depressed or just not interested in socializing. If you want an enjoyable college experience, this is about the last place on earth you would look."
College Junior,1,"Durham is a pathetic little city... avoid it at all costs. There is almost nothing to do, and the camaraderie between the city and the university is pretty much nonexistent. Much of the city is dangerous, especially at night."
College Junior,1,"Tailgate Cancelled – Duke tailgate was a tradition that brought diverse groups of students together before football games. However, due to an unfortunate happening, tailgates have been permanently cancelled, putting a damper on game days. However, this just means more build up for basketball season."
College Junior,1,"The Blue Zone Is Stupid – East and central campus have great parking, but living on west (which is most convenient) also comes with the worst parking. On game days people have to move their cars and finding a good spot in the first lot is almost impossible."
College Freshman,1,"Terrible bus system – On an average day, I spend at least an hour waiting for or riding on buses to get between campuses. Duke has West campus (the main campus), East (where freshmen live), and Central (apartments for upperclassmen). Budget cuts have made the buses run less frequently, and when they do they are overcrowded to the point where a simple bus ride can be a miserable experience. "

Freshman,5,"I personally don't have any complaints about Florida College. Florida College has excepted me into the school family. The ladies in the financial office are very caring. If you having issues they try there best to assist.The professor are willing to help you become successful. They offer tutors and different kinds of assistance if you are struggling. I have joined the women's basketball team, the coach is awesome. I love that we have to attend bible study. I enjoy being on there campus it's secure for young ladies and gentlemen. I hope I can continue to make Florida College my home until I graduate."
Freshman,5,"This college is centered around God. It has such a good vibe to it, and you feel right at home. All of your professors go to church with you so you know them. You are made to feel like you belong, where at other colleges you do not have any personal connection with your fellow classmates and professors."
Junior,5,This campus is the place to be for those who seek to grow intellectually and spiritually. You will never find a group quite as special as this.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed Florida College this past year. I played on the Women's Basketball team and absolutely loved it. The overall atmosphere of Florida College is simply amazing. The professors are so kind and are truly there to help the students in almost any way possible. I thoroughly enjoyed the smaller classroom sizes. I also really enjoyed the food. I really liked my dorm a lot as well.
Sophomore,5,I started going to this college last semester. It is a wonderful place to make friends and learn together. The staff are knowledgeable and always willing to help any students in need. The dorms are well kept and there are many opportunities for students to enjoy competition and friendship. I made a large number of friends and I look forward to seeing them this coming semester.
Freshman,5,"When I visited the school a few months ago, I felt welcome and appreciated. I feel that I will fit right in when I enroll for my freshman year there."
Freshman,5,This is a great spiritual environment with great people who you will make lifelong friends with. There are small class sizes and great interactive teachers who are willing to spend extra time so you understand courses
Freshman,5,Florida college is a great option for a solid education in a spiritual setting.  A small campus and class size means individual attention and personal connection between teachers and students.  On subjects I have studied before I am constantly learning new information from my professors.
Alum,5,Great place to meet people and get an education. Professors and staff take great care of students and are very helpful in achieving your goals.
Sophomore,5,"Florida College has given me so many opportunities and opened so many doors spiritually, mentally, socially, and physically. My biblical knowledge has grown tremendously and my love for the Lord and His people is exponentially greater. I  have not just been taught in the classroom but outside of the classroom as well. I am encouraged and renewed daily by the examples of others and have made powerful relationships with my professors because of the care and concern they show to each of their students. I have made lifelong friendships and developed in ways I never knew possible. It has given me a home away from home and I have loved every minute of it."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Florida College.  It was probably the best time of my life.  I knew a few years prior that's where I wanted to attend college, having participated in their camp for 5 summers.  I met a lot of friends at the camp who also went on to college there. Since it was a Christian college, it made it that much more like home."
Freshman,5,"I liked how all the professors care about the students and whether or not they would pass.  This school really helps you grow as a person in your faith with God so ,i would recommend attending FC."
Freshman,5,Florida College is the best place a Christian can go to. You are surrounded by many Christian's. The school is small which makes a small class size allowing for your professors to know your name and really help you in class.
College Sophomore,5,It is great the professors are easy to talk to and provide ways for student help.
College Sophomore,5,"I made a great decision to live on campus where i never missed anything that was going on, and all my friends lived right down the hall from me."
College Sophomore,5,"The best parties take place in our student center after hours (I'm talking like 2am). There's always good music, good food, and depending on the party theme, lots of fun stuff going on."
College Sophomore,5,"Nightlife is gr8. There are occasional parties, and people use Ubers to get around unless they get a ride from someone."
College Sophomore,5,"Many things can be said about the academic aspect of the school, but I'll leave you with one thing: the professors, the courses, the registration process, everything about it can be either a very good thing or a very bad thing. Many students have a bad attitude about their workload, or the gen-ed courses they are required to take, and they don't treat the professors with respect. Others are extremely optimistic about all of it (such as myself), and excel abundantly. It all depends on your attitude."
College Sophomore,5,"There have been a few known cases of intolerance, but it's not terrible."
College Sophomore,5,"Employers around the area are very active in recruiting students for jobs and internships, and our campus career department is helpful in that as well."

College Sophomore,5,Our administrators are very active in campus health and safety issues.

College Junior,5,"Florida College is a blessing to everyone who comes in contact with it. The professors and students genuinely care about one another mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually."
College Junior,5,"Florida College is a college based on morals found in the Bible. Standards given by God are the best, and being surrounded by fellow saints helps the education be spectacular!"
College Freshman,5,Everything is wonderful in that those who attend have large amounts of fun without having to worry about drugs or alcohol.

Recent Alumnus,5,"The facility and students we are one big family any issues you may be having they always there , and its stay between ypu and that person our school is not as big as most colleges but the people and facility are some of the best you could ask for.

Freshman,4,"Florida College is great because of, not only the education I received, but because of the fantastic professors and administrators."
Sophomore,4,"Florida College is a small, private school which focuses its academics around ""learning, living, leading His way."" Because of this, you are almost constantly surrounded by good influences and by people who care about you. While Florida College has a specific set of rules and standards, it is a place where you feel heard and supported by your teachers and classmates."
Sophomore,4,"Once we returned to our homes, all of our classes were transferred to an online format. While I did not enjoy the switch from campus life to online life, I felt that Florida College did an excellent job quickly adapting to the new format and helping us also adapt."
Graduate Student,4,"The environment at this campus is amazing, everyone is friendly with everyone and teachers genuinely want to see each of their students succeed."
Freshman,4,I love the environment. The teachers are so involved and will go out of their way to personally see to it that you are doing well in your classes
Sophomore,4,"In general most professors are very helpful, i broke my wrist while i was here and they helped me to catch up on my school. they rearranged test and homework for me because i missed school. Also in general the environment was great!"
Senior,4,"Florida College offers students with many opportunities to grow academically, socially, and spiritually, and provides numerous events to help students excel in each of those areas: concerts, devotions, academic panels, sporting events, society parties, internships,  etc. Even though FC provides its students with many life enhancing opportunities, there are some things I think they should change. FC should be more proactive in encouraging their students to interact with other groups; to not be so closed off from each other or the community. I also wish FC had a strong art program. This can help boost the college's enrollment and provide the opportunity to study art in a morally based environment. Despite these setbacks, I think FC has helped me to grow as a person; forcing me to learn how to be more independent, but to also help others who are dependent. The people (faculty, staff, and students) are encouraging and supportive whenever you need it."
College Sophomore,4,"The college is small very little crime, I feel safe."
College Sophomore,4,Many students are involved and many come to support during the games.
College Sophomore,4,"I attend a small private school that I would choose the school again and I will be returning, I have made so many life long friends and wonderful memories. Its has been fun so far, being on the women's basketball team has made it a great experience to be a part of traveling wth the team has been the best part. Moving to florida to attend school was the best thing that I did for my self."
College Sophomore,4,Florida College provides a fun atmosphere for christian students to be engaging and interactive throughout the whole school. It has a very small population of students which makes getting to know everyone very easy and campus life fun.
College Junior,4,Their is not much crime on campus. It is rare to hear about crime happening on campus and if there is crime it is usually not  a student who has committed the crime but someone off the street.
College Junior,4,So far all of my professors have been great. By mid-semester all of the professors know your name and they are all very willing to help you out side of the class room.
College Junior,4,Based on the fact that FC has one of the highest alumni giving % in the US most of their four year graduates must have good jobs. Their are lots of opportunities for on campus employment.
College Junior,4,This past semester I lived in Hinley which just had its common areas updated and over this summer they are going to update the rooms.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus. Security is always around and the police patrol during all hours of the night.

College Junior,4,They do their best for the most part
College Junior,4,I live on the top floor so I don't et bothered by obnoxious underclass men anymore
College Freshman,4,"There are all kinds of places to eat off campus.  The school is in the Tampa area, and because of that, you can usually find whatever kind of food you are looking for.  There is a great variety of places with regard to cost, health, etc."
College Freshman,4,"There are some rules that are not followed by the students, but the administration does not ""crack down on,"" but in general, while the rules are strict, they are not overbearing.  They are meant for our safety or our own good."
College Freshman,4,"It depends on what dorm you choose as to what the perks are.  Some dorms have more available space, but not enough storage, so it is necessary to provide your own.  Others have less open floor space, but have lots and lots of storage.  Also, the general atmosphere is different for each dorm."
College Freshman,4,"All of the financial aid I needed (except $1,000) was found and applied to my student account to allow me to attend."
College Freshman,4,"It's not really ""Greek living,"" but there are societies"
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are fantastic. They all know what they are talking about in their particular fields. Workload is sufficient for the courses
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most everybody at the school is either a business major or a Bible major, so it is a very popular program"
Recent Alumnus,4,There is a wide selection of majors to choose from. Plenty of choices for those who want to move forward with their life
Recent Alumnus,4,I am happy with my program. I would certainly do it over again because of the positive experiences I've had there. My career goals include opening my own business which I believe this program will help me do
Recent Alumnus,4,Guys and girls all get along great and we are all great friends with each other
Recent Alumnus,4,At first rocky I transferred to the same school dofferent lovation and name but falls under floroda career coppge and imstead of puttimg as a transfered they said I had a break in time so they where about to enroll me as a new student and the campus but got tooking care of I havent heard nothing so no news is good news I guess I know sometime financial aid can be a bit confusing ypunhave paper for days you have to sign and all ypu want to do is just start I can only imagine in a big university the confusion thay goes on im at a small college and for the life of me I was part time student and financial aid employee but they pull it together I still get on them to this day
Recent Alumnus,4,"They offer IT computer tech, medical assistance, medical billing, criminal justice associates and becholars to diplomas, the course work is a lot because some programs are 13 momths so your taking a individual who may never know any thing about they program and in 13 months be the best  in they field compared to any other individual and take the certification test and be certified through an organization that is certified its remarkable they also offer xray tech dental assistance I'm forgetting some."
College Sophomore,4,Living off-campus has more freedom but you miss out on a lot of on-campus activities
College Sophomore,4,Having your own computer is great to have
College Sophomore,4,We get assigned spots buy no spot is far away from everything on campus. The only down side is a fee but it's not that expensive
College Sophomore,4,so we have a lot of rules but most if not all of them are based on the morals that the great majority of the Student body holds. I do not find them over baring.
College Sophomore,4,its good we only have one security grad who I hardly ever see but I still feel safe on Campus.
College Sophomore,4,the Campus is so small that we do not need it at all. the Campus does not even cove a whole city block so everything is super close
College Sophomore,4,"we do not have Sorties or Fraternities but we have something Called Society's theses consist of  Sports, Community service, GPA, Volunteer service around campus, and involvement in the societies. Each society has officers and I enjoy our society's so much that I have been an officer on my society for  the past two years."
College Sophomore,4,In Hinley there is Great storage and a decant amount of space. College Hall could use a little more storage. I have not lied in the rest but they are nice.
College Sophomore,4,Sports are a big deal but they are not everything. the Intermural are a lot of fun and almost ever student is involved with them.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone has a spot that lives on campus, but I have not had a car so I do not know exactly how it is."
College Senior,4,This place is just fantastic
College Senior,4,I love living in the dorms
College Senior,4,People don't drink or do drugs on campus and its great
College Senior,4,I'm a business major and its a great program

College Senior,4,Greek life in the society is great. It's like family
College Sophomore,4,its good the school has a lot to offer so I try to use them all
College Senior,4,"Frequently the nightlife is quiet, spent in the dorms. Sometimes the students will go out for something to eat at a late night restaurant"
College Senior,4,Parking is not a problem at school. Each person has their own assigned spot and everyone adheres to their spot without issue
College Senior,4,"I have never felt in danger while on this campus. And although I don't get out at night to see the security guards, I kow that they are there protecting us."
College Senior,4,The social scene at school is great. You always have something to do with someone even when you're not looking for something to do.
College Senior,4,I love student life here on campus. Everyone is so friendly and wants to get to know each other.
College Junior,4,We have a lot of diversity but there is a large group from Texas but that is okay. I remember meeting someone from Egypt we call him Tati. lots of different people around the US. We so have a girl from Romania. No one is racist that I know of. More girls than boys which is awesome for me. We almost all Christians and we meet for Chapel every weekday at 10:15
College Senior,4,"Going into this particular program, I thought it was going to be easy because it is the subject that I love the most. It is easy for me but I have to constantly be on my game because my professor likes to switch things up at last minute. I love not having power point because I feel I pay attention more by him just lecturing."
Alum,2,The work load is high for standard classes. The credits at FC transfer out of state as extra curricular only. Several times the individuals Iâ€™ve dealt with on and off campus in the offices and administration have shown unchristian like behavior towards me and have hurt the image of the school. At one point it was so extreme over the phone that I had to report the individual to their supervisor. I am very disappointed in my experience and would not recommend this school.
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs and alcohol are clearly prohibited on campus, but a lot of students still get into them and sneak around behind supervisors' backs."
College Sophomore,2,Other then cars there's not much public transportation
College Sophomore,2,"It's really the main fault to be found at Florida College, that the weather is very hot for everything but maybe two months during the winter. The humidity is really high, and it makes exercising outside unpleasant. And to be very involved with the societies (our version of fraternities, etc.) requires a lot of time spent outside. But for that little while in February and March, it's actually very nice, and people spend time outside willingly."
College Sophomore,2,"Since Florida College is a private school, it was extremely hard to get scholarships. I got a scholarship through the band program but it barely makes a dent in my tuition expenses. I am going outside of FC to get a scholarship(s)."
College Junior,2,I Am Not Really Happy With Them â€“ They dont give much opportunity. and i Am only doing this to play basketball. My career goals are to open a business that is a gym just for basketball players training and to franchise it.
College Freshman,2,"Rain, Rain, Go Away! Florida weather is unpredictable and unpleasant at times. Rain is a constant along with humidity and bugs. It creates chaos when trying to get to class and stay in class comfortably. Try sitting still with water from head to foot. Add in the air conditioning and you've got yourself quite a problem."
College Freshman,2,"Old School Charm? Florida College is very dated and set in the past. The resident halls of Hinely and Sutton need much improvement especially when it comes to wireless internet, cable and cell phone towers. There isn't really a common area that includes a kitchen and places to make real food instead of the over processed, fatty foods from the cafeteria. The bathrooms in the dorms are also pretty crappy, usually with little warm water and poor water pressure. Overall, it doesn't much feel like home, the way a campus should."
College Freshman,1,"I say that it's the worst for two reasons.  The first is that this is a college with the majority of students being Christians, so there are not the traditional ""college parties"" to be found.  The second reason is that when people hang out in front of one of the dorms, play music, and just generally be loud, they are also obnoxious.  It is really annoying to pass them or even be able to hear them late at night."
College Junior,1,Dinning at Fc â€“ There are several restraunts around the campus area that are good places to eat. But the food in general that is on campus is horrible. The dinning service people cook the same thing all the time and at the same time the food is not very healthy at all. i suggest people that are coming to fc to get the 5 day meal plan so then your able to eat out on the weekends if you don't like the food.

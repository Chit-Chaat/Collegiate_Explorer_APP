Freshman,5,I take all of my classes online. Two of which include scheduled zoom meetings every week. The college website called My Courses gives me access to my assignments and grades. It is easy to use.
Freshman,5,"I like how the advisors and counsellors are always there for you. It is easy to reach out and get the help you need. In these challenging times, They understand personal struggles that seem to be affiliated with everything today. Online classes are difficult but knowing that you are not alone in this process makes it that much easier."
Niche User,5,I took most of my classes online because of COVID-19 this year and I've loved it so far! The professors always made sure to keep in touch if I had an issue and they were all very lenient because of COVID-19. If you take Ethics take it with prof Moriarty!!
Niche User,5,St. Petersburg College is small but the professors are great! I'm currently a dual enrollment student attending SPC and everything is super organized and the professors make sure to show their passion for their work. The classes are a perfect size and the campus is extremely clean as well.
Senior,5,if the course requires Pearson you'll definitely get an A. or at least a B. Pearson is teaching you the teachers rarely do anything they just basically give you a heads up and teach you hints of things. you dont need the teachers tbh!!
Sophomore,5,This school is amazing they have the most seamless process ever.  The administration staff and professors are very helpful.  The financial aid office answers all questions and explains everything in detail.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience is great!  I get assistance whenever I need it.  The professors are very helpful and available to answer all questions.
Freshman,5,The online learning seems quite easy so far and the professors and advisors are helpful. I am excited to continue here.
Sophomore,5,"I took several courses online during my time at SPC, a few of which were due to Covid, and I was able to learn quite well given the circumstances. Having a decent computer that you can rely on is especially important with any online class, but so is your teacher. My professors were all able to explain what I had to do and how in enough detail that I passed with A's to A+'s in all of my classes."
Sophomore,5,"I was able to obtain my AA degree this summer, and find my passion for a future career - Graphic Design! This school has some of the best professors and academic advisors I've had. SPC offers classes at an affordable, more reasonable, price. It's especially helpful when you are first getting your AA or AS degree, because you're taking core classes that you can transfer to other universities, while saving a lot of money. There are also many scholarships they offer and other forms of financial aid depending on your needs."
Sophomore,5,I have taken many online courses through SPC and I have loved every one of them! Professors always make course material accessible.
Sophomore,5,Advisors always are helpful in assisting your needs. Classes are always good quality and have very good instructors.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy SPCs environment. Everyone is very friendly and are always down to help. There are many resources online to help students with anything and the advisors are amazing!
Junior,5,The staff and the advisors are incredibly helpful in the application process as well as scheduling classes. The professors are good and helpful and I've had good experiences with all of them so far. The class sizes are small which allows for better engagement and a more hands on experience when it comes to education.
Junior,5,I have taken both online classes and classes that had been transferred online and I've had a positive experience with both of them. Professors were incredibly patient and accomodating in the process.
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman I don't start into Fall of 2020 but my advisor was very nice she walked me through my process of signing up for classes .  I set appointment with my advisor 2 times . Both times she was very helpful very nice.
Freshman,5,I don't start classes into fall 2020 so I wouldn't no yet. But I did have a zoom meeting tell me about the course.
Senior,5,SPC has prepared me for my dream job of Nursing. They have also made the path to obtaining my Bachelors very easy to navigate.
Senior,5,Online learning  has been an easy transition. We had to do it during Nursing school for one of the hurricanes. It went off without a hitch. I have now been doing the Bachelors program online and it as well has gone very well. SPC has been doing very well with online education and keeping us up to date on all that needs to be learned.
Senior,5,"I took 4 classes online throughout my two years at SPC and passed them all. They all had a structure that was easy to understand I received As in all 4 classes. For Spring 2020 all classes had to go online because of Covid-19, and I found the transition to be as smooth as possible. Many of my instructors were extremely accommodating and all of the necessary resources were still easily accessible."

Senior,5,I love online classes. At first when I went back to college after so many year it was difficult for me to learn in a class room. I am more relax doing the school work from the lessor of my domain. Every Professor has a different style of teaching so I trying to know about them before I get in the class.
Senior,5,"SPC is a Phenomenal college. The professors and staff are kind, loving and caring. All of them wants to see there students succeed. They take there time to break down the work for students to understand the work. They all want to see that students excel."
Sophomore,5,"This year there was a shift to online learning that was due to Covid-19. While this change was something no one was prepared for, SPC did a great job of ensuring the students an shift to online learning. Personally I feel that SPC did so much to provide the resources and understanding to make this shift. In online classes SPC made sure our ability to reach the same amount of support remains constant. Professors and advisors did a great job in staying connected and making sure that the learning content was informative and easy to navigate. Taking an online class while not everyone’s first choice was enjoyable and dare I say fun!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at St. Petersburg College was an amazing experience! Everywhere I turned I was faced with instructors and advisors who wanted to see the success of their students. The college went above and beyond to provide support and countless opportunities. My personal favorite was the learning center, where we could meet one on one with tutors to help us through even our toughest courses. Most importantly the school went above and beyond to make us feel connected! Overall, St. Petersburg College is a great place to grow and learn while having the college experience!"
Junior,5,Had some great professors and I love having a flexible schedule. I really have learned a lot and I should be able to get my aa over summer
Senior,5,SPC has some of the best professors and great student life. A lot of activities on all campuses and the college makes sure you're well informed on all the newest events and news.
Freshman,5,The administration is friendly and the advisors are always helpful. Everyone is always ready to help and they provide us with a lot of different career and skill building opportunities. As well as having outstanding faculty.
Freshman,5,All of the admin and staff at St. Petersburg college is always willing to help the students achieve their short term and long term goal. I am very thankful for all the opportunities that they have provided me. The staff is well at communicating with their students.
Freshman,5,I love this school. All the professors I have had are very knowledgeable in their subject and are very happy to assist if a student needs help. I actually was amazed my advisor knows what she is doing and has not let me down in guiding me as I prepare to get into the nursing program.
Freshman,5,"It is a extremely underrated college. The sheer quality of everything is simply amazing, everything from their facilities to their online courses. They are really just out here to help you get your degree and finding a job, and boy are they effective."
Niche User,5,I am in the Early college program. This school does so many fun events with free food. They really are there if you need anything. Advisers are always open to talk.
Niche User,5,I am an Early College Student here do my experience is a little different but it is still a great School filled with wonderful teachers and professors.
Sophomore,5,"St. Petersburg College is an excellent college and I have had such a great experience here. The professors are amazing and you can tell they are so passionate about what they teach. I have never been denied help here and there are so many resources for students. The advisers are also amazing and are always super helpful with anything a student may need. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to attend this college for 2 years, and I recommend it to any student who is considering St. Petersburg College."
Alum,5,Nursing graduate.  Wonderful college experience.  Rewarding career.  And now my son is a SPC student!
Freshman,5,"I honestly love this community college. They really make you feel valued as a student whether it's hiring events or school activities and clubs, the staff are really helpful. SPC's resources are great, you can get tutored and your work looked over just for being a student. It's been a good experience so far."
Freshman,5,"I love how helpful the staff is, and the welcoming feeling of stepping on campus everyday ready to learn!"
Senior,5,I like that the college has great advisers for the online program that are really helpful. I also like online classes and professors.
Junior,5,I think the school is very convenient with the multiple campus's around the Tampa Bay area including Tarpon Springs as well as Palm Harbor and online. I would not be able to be enrolled in college classes if it was not for the online class option. SPC also offers express classes which is amazing and in my opinion so much easier than full term classes! I have not run into an issue with SPC. I do wish they would offer ASL classes online but it is understandable as to why they do not. I do also wish the advisers would help out a little more than what they do. I went there a few times to get help and guidance but did not receive much help at all due to the adviser not really knowing anything about the courses i needed to take and the easiest order to take them in. However all the other advisers i have dealt with were very helpful.
Freshman,5,I enjoyed the online classes that I took and being able to work at home on my time.  I had a teacher from out of state and two that were in state for my online classes. I also took a class on campus for my degree and had an awesome professor who was deaf and I learned a lot from that teacher.
Sophomore,5,I loved most of my teachers at SPC. The class sizes are small and most teachers are willing to sit with you outside of class time to help you better understand a subject if you are having trouble. I would like to see more diversity on classes offered.
Sophomore,5,Teachers are understanding and most want you to succeed. The campus is small and simple in the best way.
Junior,5,"This college offers four year online degrees.  I am a distance learner, as St. Petersburg College is located in Clearwater and I live on the east coast of Florida.  The convenience of an online degree is the only way I would be able to obtain my bachelor's degree, and my local college does not offer bachelor's degrees entirely online."
Sophomore,5,"St. Petersburg College is an extremely accessible and stress-free school. With multiple accessible campuses, clubs, volunteer events, and Bachelor's programs, SPC has the comfortable atmosphere of a community college with all the benefits and legitimacy of a four-year institution. The students tend to be incredibly amicable and engaged. Professors are enthusiastic and kind while advisors and administrators are helpful and patient. It truly is a beautiful school with an abundance of advantages to offer."
Freshman,5,"With multiple ways to get help to achieve you'r goals St. Petersburg College help by having free tutors in every subject, having a student center that provides computers, whiteboards to do math problems, studying rooms, and a printing machine. In Addition the staff is incredible they help you in any way shape or form as long as you apply yourself they will help you along the way."
Sophomore,5,Great 4 year college. Would not change anything about it. The professors are willing to work with you one on one
Freshman,5,My experience at SPC has been great. The college always has fun activities through out the week. It really gets you motivated to got to class.
Freshman,5,"So far, St. Pete College had given me all the information and help I needed to apply, enroll, and pay for classes. Honestly, the process has been painless."
Freshman,5,Advisors are very helpful and prompt to reply. They boast a beautiful campus located close to a lot of local hot spots. They have plenty of diverse courses to choose from and cover as much about your major as possible to prepare you for the bright future ahead.
Junior,5,The teachers were incredible and they made my learning experience one to remember and tell my kids about!
Sophomore,5,I have been going to this college for 2.5 years now and I love it. The staff is very helpful to get a student on the correct path for success.
Sophomore,5,"I love the career and academic advisors they really helped me to find my way when I was having trouble finding It on my own. My department head has helped me to network with the right professionals so that I can further my career while I am still earning my degree. St Petersburg College is an amazing school and well priced. The locations are great and it very easy to get into the classes that you need, the only drawback that I am facing is that many of the courses in my field are online. Not many face to face classes in my chosen degree path. There is something for everyone at SPC. IF you are serious about your education and proactive the opportunities are there to be taken advantage of. Doors have been opening left and right for me since enrolling here"
Freshman,5,Everyone is really responsive and on top of their stuff. Even during the first week of school. I emailed and they responded to me promptly. That means a lot to an online student. I like this school because I still feel connected even though I am remote.
Sophomore,5,"I am a new student, but so far every interaction with staff and teachers has been super helpful. Especially being an older student going back to school, the attention and willingness to help navigate this transition has been so relieving."
Niche User,5,This is a great college! Even better if you work full time or have children or a hectic and busy schedule! The classes are very flexible and they make getting your degree possible! Great school!
Freshman,5,My Advisor was awesome she had a welcoming energy and walk me through the enrollment process step by step making my decision to go to school so much easier and exciting !!!
Freshman,5,I personally think that this is a great community college to go to if you don't want to pay for a 4-year University. I know many who have attended here and all have said the same things.
Sophomore,5,"Great nursing program. Really prepares you for your NCLEX and sets you up for success. The instructors are experiences nurses and very knowledgeable, who bring a wide variety of experience to the table including intensive care, labor and delivery, pediatrics, psych, med surg. The exams are difficult but made to ensure you pass boards. The staff throughout the college are also very helpful and serve as great guidance for students. The programs are well structured and organized. I strongly recommend this college. The only thing is the location, the Health Science building is not in the greatest area of town, however there is security on campus."
Junior,5,I have had nothing but a great experience since coming to St. Petersburg College. Going back to school as a single parent is difficult enough.  But to have the teachers understand the obstacles you are facing makes the goal of graduation more attainable.
Niche User,5,I started attending SPC through a dual enrollment program when I was a junior in high school. I have had such an amazing experience at this college. The staff members are so friendly and helpful. All of my professors are knowledgeable and easily accessible. The Tarpon Springs campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. I am attending SPC full time in my senior year through an early admission program.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience has been okay. The professors have been helping and trying their best to make us succeed. It is an adjustment, but it has been okay so far. The zoom meetings are helpful and reply to emails are okay. Overall, it has been a challenge , but doing my best."
Sophomore,4,"St. Peter’s College is a great school. I have the resources provided and they have done their best during these tough times. They have followed the safety guidelines. Most of the staff is friendly. I have met great people. The thing I would change is helping the students out with paying for all their classes, books, and materials. There should be more opportunities available for students. Overall, I have had a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"Both in person and online classes are both great options depending on one's schedule.  Professor McDonnell, who teaches sociology classes on the Seminole campus is excellent and I recommend taking her Intro to Sociology class in person; it's truly something you have to experience in person. Buddy Farmer, who makes mathematics, is also a wonderful professor. He really knows how to help students who normally struggle with math or intimidated  by it really understand the subject . I have a better understand and more of a positive outlook on mathematics because of him."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken quite a few online classes at SPC. Every class has been very easy to navigate. Most of the professors I had had standard method of class wide communication, which made you know what to expect when you took another online class. Professors also assigned creative projects that took advantage of the online platform, like video recorded presentations."
Freshman,4,This college seems to be very helpful so far and I am very excited to go forward and continue my education here.
Alum,4,Very helpful staff and good class sizes. There are many ways to get involved and be successful. Almost all professors are on ratemyprofessor which makes scheduling classes easy.
Alum,4,Online classes were easy to navigate but were often boring. Most professors were tough to get in contact with but were usually able to help.
Senior,4,"I have only taken one class online. I prefer face-to-face. They have a good tech team. The few problems I ran into they were able to clear it up right away. I know one of the campuses have a geek bar, a place where if you have any physical problems with a computer they can take a look at it."
Senior,4,"SPC is a great little school. It's not big and fancy. I think it is a great school for freshmen. They run many programs like early college and dual enrolment. The have many locations and each has pros and cons. One campus has a huge sports field, domed telescope and community garden.  There are campus that specialize in animals, medical, and marine sciences. There are some amazing professors I have had, you just gotta know how to find them."
Sophomore,4,It depends on the professor but some are very good online others are bad depends on the professor. Almost every class is online right now.
Sophomore,4,Some of the professors are helpful the food is ok it's cheaper than USF it's not bad the tutors are friendly.
Niche User,4,"There are flexible courses and they will work with you if you are working and going back to school. I have had to retake prerequisite classes in order to apply for graduate school so I have been retaking what I need and working. Professors have been understanding and I have been able to do well in the classes I have taken so far. Most have seemed to want you to do well. Do what you can to utilize what they have for you like financial aid, academic advisors, and career counsellors. Everyone I have talked to has steered me in the right direction and helped me to figure out how to establish my time and make the most of my education. Set goals for yourself as well. You can do well if you take the time to invest in it. I can't speak for campus life or athletics because I do not participate in any of that. It is also very affordable, especially if you are in state. A lot of the other schools in the same area are a lot more per credit than SPC."
Sophomore,4,"St. Petersburg College is a school where you should attend if you don’t want to leave home right away after graduation. Although it’s a college, it doesn’t have its own housing which means you will be responsible for the living situation. However, they provide the resources a student needs to successfully get a degree as well as the resources needed to get an internship and/or job as well."
Freshman,4,About to go into Sophomore year. Professors during my freshman year were very helpful and nice. Most of the needed resources are found in the website or campus.
Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been very positive. The campuses are well kept and the professors have been easy to work with. The biggest downfall is there is no student housing.
Sophomore,4,"They have relatively flexible offerings, and span the breadth of a liberal arts education to vocational and skills expansion.  I did receive bad advisement on 2 occasions, where they did not take into account that certain courses were not required for me because I came into the college already holding both an Associate's and a Bachelor's degree. When I found out, it was too late to drop and lighten my load! Overall, great, enthusiastic, knowledgeable instructors and a lot of resources to ensure your success."
Niche User,4,"I have toured it once, it's a great campus w/ lots of nice people. I'd recommend coming here for your AS or AA degrees."
Niche User,4,"Professors care about students. Classes easy to enroll in. Great for any age looking to complete a degree, start their college education, or find new interests."
Sophomore,4,St Petersberg college is a good place to get your college credits in more of a communal environment. The People and most professors are friendly and will help you. If anything could change at that college I would say it would need to be the communication with the students to the higher ups of the college.
Senior,4,"I believe I have had a great experience at St. Petersburg College. I first started here in the Summer of 2015 in the Summer of Success Program on the Tarpon Springs Campus. I found it very helpful for me to have a head start, that way I would not be lost during the fall semester. I have completed my general AA degree here and I am now pursuing my bachelor’s degree here in Sustainability Management. I have been very fortunate to meet welcoming and helpful people here at the college. This college has given me all of the tools I needed in order to be successful in my classes. The professors and tutors are professional have great knowledge within their field of expertise and will be there to help guide you. Some changes that could be done are more flexible class times and fewer online classes. Online classes take away that professor and student relationship and having a better understanding of the professor's work experience."
Freshman,4,I think the small classroom environments allow me to communicate more effectively with my professors and classmates. I feel like I learn more and absorb all the information that is being instilled into me instead of just regurgitating it onto the paper and forgetting it immediately after. I think SPC's small campus is beautiful and encourages me to come to class more.
Niche User,4,"The environment was friendly and most of the professors were very wonderful, but there were a few that really seemed very unprofessional. Overall very great school though :)"
Senior,4,SPC’s online classes are fantastic for my schedule and are really user friendly. I have had no serious issues using their website to take online classes. Best of all SPC does not break the bank.
Sophomore,4,I enrolled in St. Petersburg College when I was 16 years old through the Early Admissions Program. The staff was very friendly and willing to guide the students through everything that a college student should know. Their advisors are very friendly and ready to help students in many aspects.
Graduate Student,4,"Each program offered at the SPC Health Center has an outstanding reputation. Although the medical programs are difficult, students are well prepared upon graduation to be successful in their respective careers. There are many services offered by the college to ensure student success. In my opinion, SPC is the best ""bang for your buck."" Compared to private institutions around the area, SPC is a bargain."
Sophomore,4,"It’s a good school with professors who care about your future. If you want to save money, I highly recommend you go here."
Freshman,4,"When I first started school I was really nervous, I thought it was going to be like high school. But once I started going to my classes I liked the experience and the teachers. The teachers really seem to care if you graduate and there are many tutors at the library that are willing to help you with your school work. I highly recommend going to SPC for your associates degree."
Niche User,4,It's the perfect size college and the distance is super close with many campuses around the only thing that could improve would be the login system sometimes it can be difficult to get logged in.
Sophomore,4,It's a pretty great college for having converted from a junior college to a full college. Not much for campus' though as those are still pretty unchanged from before the larger accreditation.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at St. Petersburg, I think campus life is very comforting. Being that it is my first semester, my transition from high school to college has been pretty smooth. My professors have been good to me and teach very well. The faculty and staff show up to work ready to work and are enthusiastic to make everyday a better day. Although the vibes are very chill, which is not a problem, I wish there was a little more student activity for all groups during the day for everyone."
Freshman,4,"Very Friendly staff, Professors Are Very Helpful, School Is Clean And Neat. Before I Came They Gave Me A Tour Of The School. They are very professional"
Sophomore,4,St Pete college is a great college full of fun and of course educational experience. The professors really care about not just you passing the class but giving you everything you need to make sure you understand. The advising staff is also amazing. They’re always helping me with anything I need.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed going to this school as an Early College Student, I felt it excelled my learning for university and truly made me the person I am. Thank you SPC, titans forever."
Freshman,4,St. Petersburg College does a good job trying to give the students a sense of community. There are always events and things going on for students to feel connected with the college. The return on investment is great when compared to similar colleges in the state.
Sophomore,4,"I spent a lot of time at SPC.  I've been to a few different campus under the SPC umbrella but I mainly attended the Gibbs campus. At times it felt like the most forgotten campus. The other campuses were newer and most of the teaching spots were sent to those newer campus'. However I can't recall a professor that I didn't enjoy, especially for math."
Freshman,4,I really like the school due to it's low tuition career help and over all outstanding help this school is also very easy for me to get to from home to that's a plus for me. this school also offers a lot of great opportunities to advance in life and they also have a bunch of amazing programs that make it even better I really believe spc is a great college for students who can't afford high end tuitions
Freshman,4,"I haven't been enrolled at St. Petersburg College for too long. I first attended in the summer after junior year of high school since I was a dual enrollment student. I've had 7 classes since then and I'm currently in 2 classes over the summer. Thus far, it's been a good experience for me. It's a very small school with small classes and so it's easy to grasp concepts and get one on one time with teachers. The school system isn't complicated and the environment is pretty easy going. That being said, the classes are helpful in teaching information and aren't always an easy A. I'm hoping to transfer to a university to finish my degree but I would highly recommend SPC to anyone who wants to ease in to college and get the hard courses over with instead of going straight for the 4-year university."
Niche User,4,Saint Petersburg College has a vast diversity of students and they really want you to succeed. The evening classes have many older students and many subjects can be taken in a classroom or online. I am a returning student in my 40's and they have many free services available to their students.
Junior,4,"My years at SPC were great--super professors(minus  few), clean campus and convenience as there are lots of campuses that you can choose from to make your commute short and there are soo many classes online!"
Junior,4,SPC has been nothing short of an amazing experience. All the support you need is provided and more. It is a great place to go to school!
Freshman,4,"I came to St. Petersburg College, for the Collegiate High School program. This is where I can take college classes with actual other college students for two years while I am still in my junior and senior years. It was a good experience for me because I didn't know what to expect, yet everything has worked out in the end. There are a variety of professors at the campus I go to. I have gone to other branches and each has a different yet familiar feeling to each one of them. It's all a matter of which one has the classes you're looking for. I think it's a good place to start."
Freshman,4,"Professors go the extra mile to help you understand the material. The social events are smaller because the college is a community one, but everyone there is extremely friendly. This college is definitely a great education especially for how little you pay."
Niche User,4,This school has various professors who will help you achieve your goals. They also have a lot of opportunities for students to be involved and take part in extracurricular activities throughout each semester.
Alum,4,I am a alum of St. Petersburg college and in my A.A. I was very involved in clubs.  Coming back to finish my B.S. I decided to just focus on my academics. There is alot to offer new students coming in.
Works Here,4,what i personally liked about this campus is the student body and the staff. the people on this campus are excellent and deserve  the world because they care about everyone and anyone. the  best thing about the school is the bookstore to be honest
Sophomore,4,"St. Petersburg College is a two-year and four-year community college.  Abbreviated as SPC, SPC has 11 campus buildings and online classes so that students are able to attend efficiently. Though, it is a community college, there are plenty of events and activities for students to engage in. Some student's feel that their services aren't properly met at the college, but the SPC faculty members are professional and they are able to kindly meet the needs of the students."
Freshman,4,"I attend the Seminole branch and I just love it here. The professors so far have all been pretty great, the buildings and equipment are all fairly new. There are LOTS of computers in every classroom and in the ""commons"" - study area, like a library, as well as computers and iPads available in the cafe for students to use. There is free, walk-in tutoring all day, every day but Sunday! The campus is small enough to be able to walk to all of the buildings easily and surrounded by acreage to give it a peaceful setting."
Freshman,4,"There could be more tutors available , IT tech support. The computers are running slow in the learning common area, and in library. Myself, and others have lost work due to computers not working properly.
Make more accessible parking for students closer to campus. Allowing a student a warning before getting a ticket on their care. Make the parking color coded signs, bigger and easier to understang. Could possibly put more signs in parking lot to show student and visitors the proper spaces.
Give student more discount on food/snacks, some student are on strict budget. More security presents in the evening hours."
Junior,4,The college offers plenty of different opportunity for your career path. The professors are nice and helpful in wanting you to learn and pass the class.
Alum,4,"St. Petersburg college offers free tutoring to its students, and a place for students who may be struggling financially at the time, whatever their situation, to get at least an associate's degree, which makes it easier for students to transfer into a four-year university and complete a bachelor's degree. The college also offers certificates for those who already have a professional job to make themselves more marketable."
Freshman,4,"St. Petersburg College has been a wonderful experience. This is my first term, but i have not been more happier to be enrolled at this school. I am working on my associates degree for business management. the professors here are very helpful in many ways. They spend extra time with you and address all concerns for every student on campus here at St. Petersburg College."
Freshman,4,"I love the environment of SPC. It offers wonderful classes along with different types of professors available. The times for classes are flexible and always work around what you need to do. The students there are like any other students, learning everyday and peaceful. I feel super safe on SPC campus, and I know that they worry about me being safe as well."
Sophomore,4,It’s a school. You can earn a degree. Some professors care. Most don’t care at all. It’s cheap and you can earn a degree pretty quickly.
Sophomore,4,"Saint Petersburg College has a very diverse course catalog. Although this is a junior college, it creates a great stepping stone for new students and working families to springboard off of."
Niche User,4,I am cur renting attending SPC as a Early Admissions student and I am heavily enjoying my experience. SPC is located in the heart of Pinellas and offers plenty of incredible programs to students from all walks of life.
Sophomore,4,I take my classes 100% online. I like the availability of programs they have to offer. A great school to attend if you are an adult learner and want to work around a full-time work schedule.
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience has been great at Spc, the only thing I would change is the way advisors approach different situations."
Sophomore,4,I've had some issues with advising but overall it is a wonderful school. I have even been elected as President on an executive board on campus!
Sophomore,4,I live that the classes are very flexible for students. They have great resources and food varieties. I’d like to see more clubs and student events that Tina of kids would actually attend or apply to be in!!!
Graduate Student,4,"A Junior college that transitioned to offer 4 year degrees along with a great number of excellent 8 week courses, that allow students a fast track to excel through courses."
Sophomore,2,"The transition wasn’t the smoothest and it’s a bit harder to interact with teachers, and there were some technical difficulties."
Sophomore,2,"The advisors do not really help the students with what they have questions with, and the professors i have had for two years now are all very unqualified for their job. I have had maybe one teacher that I have actually learned from."
College Sophomore,2,"Haven't gotten into my major program yet, but Rosen College of Hospitality in Orlando is much more in depth and hands-on I have not seen that here at SPC"
College Senior,2,"I am trying to get into a sub major of finance, but it has been taking a while to hear back from the school. The business program I am in now is okay. Basic, but without the opportunity for more financial aid I can't take classes over the summer so I'm pretty bummed. Hoping attending a university will be more exciting for me."
College Senior,2,"I never noticed employers recruiting on campus at all. The quality of the career center makes you feel like they are doing something to help, but really I have gotten no where at all with their help."
College Senior,2,Online classes are not my favorite.  The online portions of classes in my program are more demanding than attending class and are not user friendly.
Recent Alumnus,2,No assistance with job or intern placement.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no value in the degree I obtained from this school as I wasn't given the hands-on training required by most employers. There are no job prospects using my degree as all jobs want me to have experience.
College Senior,2,some of the professors don't need to be there.
College Freshman,2,They threaten to drop my classes three times last semester because something didn't go through correctly.
College Junior,2,Honestly we had to pay out of pocket for the first semester because the Financial Aid system is very slow and we had very little help with it. Spent many days in the Financial Aid Office to get help and it was still very difficult. A tip that I would give is to do your taxes early and start the process for financial aid early as well.
College Senior,2,There isn't any of that at my college
College Freshman,2,i haven't even recieved anything yet
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't know of many resources available to students. I feel like they are not properly discussed or made known.
Recent Alumnus,2,I personally dislike online courses and try to avoid them at all costs. The format of the online course operating system is AWFUL and incompatible with many browsers and not mobile friendly whatsoever.
College Junior,2,The campus and the classroom are pretty old.
College Sophomore,2,Registration is stressful and tedious. Every class requires a prerequisite that is easy to test out of but difficult to find the professor in charge of giving said test.  Some professors are brilliant but have no teaching skills and there's not much selection between professors as classes fill up as soon as their availability is shown.
College Sophomore,2,"Spc doesn't deny acceptance to any Floridian so a lot of morons get accepted. A lot of trashy, loud and arrogant men and women go to spc as well as a lot of middle aged to older people."
College Sophomore,2,They don't have a program or major for what I'm studying (physician assistant) here at spc so I haven't had any opportunities to network or gain any extra knowledge. Their main medical programs are nursing and physical therapist assistant.
College Sophomore,2,Lack of multiple professors or classes. If you want a different professor you have to travel 3 cities away. Some staff is rude. Advisors do not know anything more than basic knowledge and google your questions.
College Sophomore,2,long waiting list for the AS in Nursing. to many student and not enough staff!!!
College Junior,2,There are special study abroad programs to Ireland and Spain! Also we have Clubs to join and a excellent Arts Program
College Senior,2,I should of taken Early College and focus on school instead of making new friends.
College Student,2,There is nothing involved with careers at my school. I have never heard from an alumni either.
College Sophomore,2,"I have no tips on how to possibly get financial aid at SPC. Probably if you lie, that's the only way. My household income is very low. Only one person is employed, and even so, the income is low. I know of students who get paid for their tuition and books and they get money left over. If I was granted that opportunity, I would appreciate it much more than others.  "
College Student,2,"I've found that I have to travel to different campuses for the coming semester. I'm very disappointed, but this way my classes are more organized than they have been as of late. My previous semester was riddled with hours in between classes and both early morning classes and evening classes. A few of the breaks were helpful in joining on campus clubs, but overall it was a major nuisance. "
College Junior,2,I had previously done bad in my classes about 2 years ago. This previous fall semester was my first semester back and I got a 4.0 GPA. Since I did not bring my cumulative GPA the amount needed my financial aid gets revoked from me. I do not have money to pay for college and the only advise they gave me was to apply for scholarships. After working so hard this past semester it didn't even make a difference.  
College Junior,2,"I really wish SPC had better Athletic Centers or gyms that students could go to on campus. There is a Rec Center on the Seminole SPC campus, but I live all the way in Clearwater. The ""Gym"" at the Clearwater campus is kind of pathetic and I most certainly wish they would expand on it as well as maybe get some upgraded equipment. I think by doing that it might help out students who would like to get a good work out between classes and would also promote a better lifestyle for their students. "
College Sophomore,2,"This place is not very flexible with classes if you are someone that works fulltime, forget it because it is hard to fit your classes with the limited classes offered. For a student like myself, to get all the classes that will be available for my time, I have to drive to 3 different campuses and rush from one to the other and it is a chore, especially if your professor does not let you out of class on time. "
College Sophomore,2,The school is not very helpful to reinforce students are accepted to the right schools of their choice. With this school you have to be your own motivator and if you are transferring to another school.. you have to keep checking your  schools deadline and information on the future school as this college would not care whichever way nor if you graduate. 
College Sophomore,2,They have enough computers but the school network is slow. You can spend 10 mins booting up the computers and then the internet connection is sluggish..slower than the ones in the public library.  But they do have enough computers to go around. 
College Sophomore,2,"It's been alright, most people are here just for an education, not for a school spirit or university feel. "
College Freshman,2,I prefer going to actual classrooms.
College Senior,2,We need more up to date learning centers and a bigger library.
College Senior,2,"I find the hours of the library an absolute joke. They would be alright for an average public library, but not for an academic one. While they open early enough (7:30 am) they close at 9pm Monday through Thursday. Friday they close at 4, and they are open for a short time on Saturday. A coworker who goes to a nearby school can utilize her school library through midnight. I think SPC is doing a disservice to their students by not extending the library hours, especially since they advertise to returning students, part-time students, and non-traditional students, many of whom have uncommon schedules and working hours 

The ""wellness centers"" are laughable. they are small rooms on the campuses.Their hours are much worse than the libraries', and also seem to fluctuate regularly. The most standard opening times I've seen are 10:00- 4:00 which is much more restricted than any local gym.  

Athletics is not a strong interest of mine, so I cannot offer insight to SPC's athletic centers past the general wellness centers.

While there does seem to be an effort to arrange campus activities, there are not many diverse options. SPC has been expanding their theater program, which I commend, but they are not regularly attended due to poor advertisement and promotion from the school. 

The campuses themselves are well maintained in both landscape and janitorial aspects, and the staff have always been polite and respectful if there is a late night class occurring during a cleaning rota. 

Full disclosure:  The above is only a reflection on the Clearwater and Gibbs campuses; I do not have experience with the other campuses"
College Senior,2,The nursing program is incredibly disorganized. The clinical sites and half of the instructors are great. There are 7 instructors to one class which makes it really difficult to get everyone on the same page. The instructors are often frustrated at each other and it seems to be taken out on the students at times.
College Sophomore,2,I have gone to the financial aid department and they didn't seem to have the answers to the questions I asked. I do have to say that they do a great job with financial aid options. Example: they offer a payment plan for students to pay for classes to help who can't get financial help such as grants and student loans.
College Sophomore,2,The speed of the internet in the computer class are either slow or sometimes have a bad connection. This happened a couple of times during my Intro to Technology Lab class. We couldn't do our work in class at the time.
College Sophomore,2,This school caters to many different types of students from Early College to Adult Learners.
College Freshman,2,Various age groups with early college students and adult education along with your regular college student post-high school.  Absolutely no student life.
College Sophomore,2,"Computers that are accessible to most students are older versions of windows. The speed could be faster and the portal used to connect with classes has several limitations and doesn't always work efficiently. Wireless access is not available or is out of reach in certain parts of the campus and classrooms. Although, resources are much better in my music classes, where there are mac-pros and high-end technical equipment needed for the program."
College Junior,2,"The library is great and has many resources for school projects. We have free access to the gym at the Seminole rec center, and that's a big plus for me."
College Senior,2,"The online classes are extremely tedious. There is a lot of reading, a lot of supplemental materials, and many videos.  The classes are very time consuming and I honestly do not know how students who work can fit in the time required to complete all the weekly requirements and get good grades. Unless the facilitator is a full-time employee of the college, they are not really professors. They are part-time employees who have other jobs, so they do not have  much time to spend on students. Many question go unanswered, and mistakes on the part of the creator of the class go unfixed."
College Sophomore,2,"There are occasional problems with the computer network, angel.  Sometimes the professors are confused as to what we have access to on the network and it can result in difficulty.  Also, sometimes the quiz questions are difficult to see completely on the screen.  I think that things like this could be easily adjusted so that its not a stress to taking a quiz or test."
College Freshman,2,St petersburg college is better than not going to school at all. They keep they're campus quite clean too.
College Junior,2,"We Have a Career Center? quite frankly, our career center provides little to no help to our students. Some people might not even be aware than we have one. The main object it seems is to provide career testing and pamphlets to new students."
College Junior,2,"Technical Review – The wireless network on campus is very reliable and my personal laptop performs at top speed.  However, the computers available in the labs and libraries have very poor internet speeds.  Logging in to print out an assignment during the fifteen minutes between classes is not recommended due to the fact that you will be late to your next class."
College Junior,2,"Could Be Better – They help you out, but they could be doing a better job at it"
College Junior,2,"Simple but Somewhat Hectic – Based on what I've seen, the online course solely depends on the teacher. Some teachers will overwork you and others are very helpful, so I give the online courses a C as in Neutral."
College Freshman,2,"Often, the computers have crashed on me. It is not very fun."
College Senior,2,"I Don't Think They Have Any. What career services?  I have seen some links on line, but I haven't actually seen anything in the way of services offered here.  I don't think they have any."
College Junior,2,"Very Disconnected – I didn't like that the online class was just a once a week, here's the work and reading - do it and then wait for the next assignment. I really liked the professor and would of loved to take the class in person with him. I just felt extremely disconnected with the online course."
College Student,2,The Obvious – some of the teachers are helpful while others don't seem to care whether you pass or flunk.
College Freshman,2,"Adminitration Is Non-Existent – I enjoy my school and when I am able to coordinate my schedule properly, I excel in all of my classes. However, I have on more than one occasion needed to speak to a counselor or maybe even financial aid and it seems to be frowned upon if you don't get all of your answers online. I do agree that being able to do most of your school business online is a major help, but there are times when you need an actual person to talk to. The internet does not solve all problems. It seems to me that some schools have transitioned from the telephone ""Press 1 Press 2- Hold Please..."" to ""Please visit our website."" Thank you for listening. jdr~"
College Junior,2,They should really work on this. The Advisers their really just follow the book and sometimes don't know exactly how to answer some career based questions besides what to follow if you know what degree type you want in your intended field. Though alumni services are great and are always posted around campus.
College Freshman,2,"Academic Flexibility – I take 4 classes per semester and have a full time job to fund them. Flexibility of the classes is hard because all of the Math, History, philosophy and science classes in each category all have specific start times so that they can plan for the Final Exams better. It is inconveniant because I cannot group all of my classes together and soemtimes have to go back to school multiple times in one day."
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much of anything about SPC's post-grad services, if they even have any."
College Sophomore,2,"Very Nice Year – So far it has been good. I haven't had any classes that doesn't relate to my major. The work is pretty good, it's work. The teachers do work with the students and it's nice. Im looking forward to my next semsters at SPC"
College Freshman,2,"I believe the tuition is at a good rate, the books we pay for are extremely overpriced and sometimes not worth the money at all."
College Freshman,2,Computer Network – Only had to deal with it a few times.  Once the network was down for hours which was a big inconvinience.
Junior,1,"My on line experience was poor, it's way to difficult to get set up for the first class.  Directions are poorly written and confusing.....way to many steps to get access to my class....frustrating and terrible for whast students are paying gor."
Junior,1,"On line class set up instructions are terrible
Beyond difficult to get set up for on line classes.
Directions are poorly written and confusing.
Hard to believe a professional educator wrote these directions"
College Student,1,I am the type of person that has to be in a classroom so i personally hate online classes.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The financial aid process is the worst I've ever encountered. I'm finishing my prerequisite classes while I'm enrolled in the program and have been penalized for it. I have been denied any sort of financial aid, even loans, because I've attempted more than the credit hours needed for the program which makes absolutely no sense considering the ""extra"" courses I""m attempting are mandatory for the program."
College Student,1,I detest online courses very much. I find that they're not helpful and only suffice in giving me a headache when I have more work to finish for my lecture classes. I don't feel like I learn enough online and I'm more at ease listening and taking notes than I am taking notes from a computer screen for hours every day. 
College Sophomore,1,the Financial aid only gives you aid if you don't fail the class or get anything less than a C.The sad part is they are not flexible with you if you enroll in classes but cant get FAFSA to send them the money on time. They dropped all my classes even though I called them in advance multiple times to give an extension for the money to be received. They told me over the phone that my only option to keep my classes is to pay out of pocket because they can't wait 3 to 5 business days for FAFSA even though the classes I signed up for do not start till January and I asked them in November and beginning of December. They are the worst Financial aid team I have ever dealt with and they don't care for the students that actually want to go to school. It's all about what they can get from the student. 
College Sophomore,1,"As stated earlier class registration is easy. getting the classes after the deadline is the horrible part. They don't care if you have applied for financial aid. They will drop your classes without a notice. I have not checked into other programs the school may offer so it is hard for me to speak on that aspect. They also don't have enough tutors in the labs. Last time I was in 2 different campuses I had to wait for 1 tutor to talk to 5 students and he kept having to answer one question from each class, which took 2 hours for him to answer 5 of my questions (Not exaggerating). "
College Sophomore,1,I only took 1 online class and I regretted it. Though I maintained a good grade in the class. I was very upset that the professor did not respond to my emails or calls when I had a question about a course work and never even bothered to reply. yet I received a message 2 days later that she is about to go on vacation and wont be reached. I prefer the traditional classes because I can ask questions and interact with the teachers. I would not take an online class. It could just be my one bad experience/luck but once bitten twice shy.
College Sophomore,1,"As  I stated earlier, The school also hires anybody with a degree to teach the classes and they don't care if the person is a teacher or not. Not every one with a degree has a passion for teaching.Some professors can't speak the English language and can't teach or have bad time management skills or don't bother to know who the students are nor check to see if they do the homework or if they are understanding the material.It leaves the students to fail  several classes  and end up repeating the classes over and over. Then we take a survey about the professor and nothing gets done. Next semester the professor is doing the same to the next student. I think this has been their redundant trick so that students don't graduate and the school makes more money off of them.. I think it is unfortunate. The rate I have seen professors come and go is bad and I am talking about on several campuses. Once we had a drunk professor and he was always late to class, kinda glad they got rid of him. The school has a lot of improving to do. They need to hire the right types of professors and not someone just looking to get a pay check.  Financial aid need to work with helping the students want to go to school..not dropping their classes because FaFSA has not released the funds in a few days. That is unfair to the students who are working hard to ensure they get good grades...paying out of pocket is not what anyone can do easily. "
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid Center is the worst.  They drop your classes when FaFSA give them the money on time even if you ask for an extension or a  few days before the due date of payment. They are not willing to work with you and for 3 semesters I have had to pay out of pocket while they keep the money from FAFSA. 

The school also hires anybody with a degree to teach the classes and they don't care if the person is a teacher or not. Not every one with a degree has a passion for teaching.Some professors can't speak the English language and can't teach or have bad time management skills.It leaves the students to fail several classes and end up repeating the classes. I think this has been their redundant trick so that students don't graduate and the school makes more money off of them.. I think it is unfortunate."
College Junior,1,I have not had a good experience at this school
College Junior,1,They need to fire everyone in the Tuition and Financial Aid divisions
College Junior,1,They need to hire more fluent and gracious teachers.  The ones they have now are not qualified for their jobs.
College Junior,1,I dont like the online classes here or anywhere.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have an athletic center, i haven't seen any student centers, and there aren't many campus activities. "
College Sophomore,1,"It's not a traditional university, so there's no real school spirit. "
College Freshman,1,It was a huge hassle to get my financial aid. 
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid process I went through was horrible. It would never go through in time, so I had to pay for my classes right out of pocket. When it finally did go through, they gave me enough to not even cover half of the costs because I had already paid for most of it with money I had to borrow. I would suggest applying for financial aid as soon as  possible so they can't mess anything up in the process."
College Junior,1,Im am not to sure yet I have yet to start I start Aug 19
College Junior,1,"Computers are extremely slow, and the Wifi is horrible. I bring my own labtop to class because it takes 15 mins for the computer to log you in and by that time you are so far behind, its hard to catch up. Also the discussion boards and quizzes often screw up causing you to fail because the link froze up and the timer ran out or the discussion board wont let you post. hopefully your teacher is nice and understands."

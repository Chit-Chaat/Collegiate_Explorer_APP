Sophomore,5,"Faculty and staff are personable and there is a real sense of community.
The program is rigorous and I feel like I am learning so much."
Freshman,5,The staff at Multnomah University has been extremely accommodating and helpful to me! I'm excited to start my education with a staff that cares so much about my education.
Niche User,5,"Multnomah has such a positive environment, and it feels like everybody is family. Centered around Christ, this university is especially full of love and hope."
Freshman,5,"Multnomah is a great Christian University where I can grow both spiritually and grow as a man. I took my visit as a student athlete to go meet the basketball coaches as well as the players. I loved everything about Multnomah from the start. The coaches and players were great, the community and support from was promising and being surrounded with people that want to be successful like you makes things a lot easier."
Niche User,5,"It was amazing. The people there were so kind. The professors were personal and taught their subjects very well. The campus was beautiful, great athletics. The christian atmosphere was awesome."
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at Multnomah. The staff, not just the professors, care so much about my wellbeing. They check in on how I'm doing in classes, sure, but their concern for my emotional wellbeing helps keep me from going crazy trying to balance school, volunteering, and social life. I have been so impacted by the staff."
Alum,5,"Multnomah is a very enriching place to learn. The professors are experts in their field, especially those for the Bible and Theology degree and the English degree.  The campus is gorgeous but the surrounding neighborhood is a bit rough. There is a strong Christian community and I made some very good friends there.
The school is becoming more diverse and has recently developed more programs and athletic opportunities."
Freshman,5,"If you are looking for a home with the perfect mixture of life and relationship with Christ, well look no more for Multnomah is the place for you! With a wide variety of classes and majors to choose from no matter what classroom you find yourself seated in you will always feel like you are getting the perfect balance of education and Christ in your life while still enjoying the daily pleasures of college life. Never will you feel out of place or as if you do not belong for Multnomah staff and students are always willing to talk or hang out. The campus has many events to offer from Swing Dancing to Worship nights were students are encouraged to lead these events or even sit back and enjoy the discussion. Wherever you find yourself on campus, it'll be having a blast while praising the Lord."
Sophomore,5,"The professors and staff are all excellent, helpful, and caring. The other students are friendly and diverse. It feels like a family."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Multnomah University has so far met all my expectations.   All of the professors I have had the privilege of learning from have been incredible.  They sincerely care about their students and make themselves available for counseling.    The campus itself is beautiful and well taken care of.   My only criticism is that the campus is in a part of town that is seeing some decay.    Safety on campus has never been a concern, but as in any city, crime surrounds us."
College Sophomore,5,The education team on campus is all about helping education major students fulfill their goals and have a place to work once graduated.
College Junior,5,I personally feel safe on campus. The security is always walking or driving around making sure students are safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,"""parties"" can consist of Christian fellowship, listening to music, discussion, eating all kinds of foods, having a comedy show and watching Netflix."
College Junior,5,"The food is all homemade, very reasonably priced, and tastes great. It feels comfortable and homely in the dining hall during all meals, and the coffee shop is lively, and has some great snack options, and even a nice, cheap, to-go lunch option."
College Junior,5,"Professors are very accepting of opposing views, and seek to build upon current academia. They are also considerate of the other programs on campus, and tailor their coursework and rigor to suit them. If you ever have a problem, question, or simply want to talk, all the professors will make time for you out of their schedule."
College Junior,5,"Since we are all Christians on campus, and want to keep the best interactions, we are given school guidelines which are intended to best fit it. These would include no drinking or drug use, and respecting one another."
College Junior,5,"I feel comfortable wherever I go, and even trust people who I have little to no interaction with to watch my stuff while I'm gone for a minute. There's a safe and loving community here, and I always feel comfortable on campus."
College Junior,5,The best and worst times in life have been here
College Junior,5,We have a great admin who care deeply for students
College Junior,5,We have the most credits which = greater knowledge
College Freshman,5,For a school of its size the athletic department is wonderful
College Freshman,5,The men and women on campus are generally very attractive and have beautiful personalities. The styles are very varied and unique as well as the different hobbies and interests of students.
College Freshman,5,The people at the school are all very welcoming and kind and care about you and the coaches and teachers are genuine and care about all of you and not JUST your academics or athletics
College Freshman,5,My dad visited the campus with me and couldn't believe the high quality of food on a college campus!
College Freshman,5,They really want  the best for you
College Sophomore,5,There is never and drug/alcohol use on campus. There is no drug/alcohol abuse on/off campus.
College Sophomore,5,Classes are great and varied. Most professors also have other full-time jobs which adds a level of humility and understanding when it comes to the workload.
College Sophomore,5,I have a common major and it makes it easier to discuss with other people their experiences on classes they've taken. Study groups that you form at the beginning of your program will likely be the same people you study with for your four years.
College Sophomore,5,I transferred schools and my previous school dragged their feet on sending information. Other than that it is a straight forward application with an essay and references.
College Sophomore,5,I love the program I am in. There is some difficulty sometimes in trying to plan long term on classes you will take. Workload is comparable to most schools. There are few job opportunities at the school but the staff is amazing so it evens out.
College Sophomore,5,"We have a computer lab and also a computer in the library. Printing is free and the network is fast. I would say for convenience sake owning a computer/laptop would be helpful in order to write papers and do research. It would depends on how much time you are willing to stay in the computer lab. I know some students do not own computers, but the majority does."
College Sophomore,5,if you are a student you do not pay to park and there are always spots
College Sophomore,5,there is no drug or alcohol from students. Love it.
College Sophomore,5,"Its Portland- ethnic food carts, foodie restaurants, affordable"
College Sophomore,5,"Its great, there is none!"
College Sophomore,5,We are in a horrible part of town yet there is next to no crime on campus. We as students are kept very safe
College Freshman,5,Movie nights and dance parties.. the best.
College Senior,5,"The students at Multnomah are great people. Everyone majors in Bible/Theology, so we are all coming to the school with similar interests. It's easy to make friends, and it isn't joked about as Multnomah Bridal College for no reason. Honestly, to keep up with two majors or a few minors, as many students at MU do, you have to be a pretty hard working individual, but you can always find time to run down to the artisan coffee shop for a latte or the local park to do some studying. Most of the students are typical Portland style dressers, if you don't know what I mean, watch Portlandia."
College Senior,5,"Portland is an amazing city to go to college in! With plenty of things going on at all hours of the day, there is always something to do. As a college student, I am always searching for cheap or free entertainment and with cheap theaters, McMenamins, and street fairs, I stay busy without spending much money. There is something in Portland for everyone! Dancing, happy hours, breakfast, cultural fairs, art museums, concerts, and other city events."
College Senior,5,"The places around campus are abundant, varied, and excellent. They are all quick and easily accessible."
Sophomore,4,"Multnomah University is a wonderful place to receive an education. However, unfortunately, both the student body and the faculty lack diversity of both ethnicity and thought."
Junior,4,"The professors and faculty really know their stuff when it comes to teaching their subject and challenge their students well. If you're looking for a solid faith based school to attend for college or a solid seminary program I highly recommend it. It is still a very conservatively Bible believing Christian based campus and culture, so be thinking about that when making your decision, but they are starting to develop more of their sports departments and start up some exciting developments in their music and the arts, and worship ministry degree programs in the coming years as well."
Freshman,4,"The staff and faculty are overall pretty great. The professors are great, they generally cater to the needs of students, and you are able to get help if needed. Resources are ample, the campus is beautiful, and they're trying to create a new culture."
Freshman,4,"I love that it's much like my High School, so I didn't feel too out of place, which is small. And the fact that it's in Portland, so there's unlimited opportunities for careers, and internships, that come with growing up"
Graduate Student,4,"The location is excellent, just a few blocks from the freeway exit. Off campus parking available; great teachers always available to meet with students and to refer students to important services; small-size classes; campus is safe and clean."
Sophomore,4,"multnomah univeristy is a great college to get your bible degree! It also offers other degrees, but it focuses a lot on the bible! Teachers, staff, alumni, etc. are very supportive with everything! A small school, so small classes to get a relationship with your professors. A great, safe, warming environment. Everyone at the school, all the way down to the students are very supportive! The dorm rooms are very nice and welcoming! A good dorm room size. Diversity lacks a little, but as a community, we are all working together to make a diverse community! A small school, so you will know pretty much everyone on campus!"
Sophomore,4,"Multnomah is a Christian based bible college that features a variety of majoring opportunities, campus activities, and a diverse student base. Class sizes are smaller, paving the way for one on one time with professors. Stimulating  personal relationships is easy and campus life is involved and exciting on a daily basis. They give opportunities for scholarships for simply visiting campus, and attending certain events. All in all, MU is a slice of Portland that is all it's own. It's a place in which one can develop their relationship with Christ, and enjoy fellowship regularly with quality people."
Senior,4,"It’s a place where students tap their talents in every area, explore God’s creation through multiple lenses, forge ties with the greater community and develop the character traits they need to serve Jesus in any career they choose."
Graduate Student,4,"The university is small, therefore the class size and student: prof ratio is terrific. The schedule is rigorous. I would highly recommend Multnomah University."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors don't just care about the work you turn in, they genuinely care about their students as people."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is very homie  and in close proximity. Anything I need is right outside my dorm.
College Sophomore,4,"This school provides the feeling of a home away from home. The students and faculty are all about how to get each other where we need and want to be. I love it at Multnomah University,  chosing to go there was the best decision I have ever made."
College Junior,4,The career center is really good. It is quite sufficient.
College Junior,4,"Depending on what class is taken depends on the workload. However, there is always a nice amount of work needed to be done. probably no different than any other college. There are quite a few study areas on campus: the library, Cafe, and a few quiet areas that are set apart just for studying."
College Junior,4,The diversity on campus is really good. Ther are people that are from all over the world.It is predominantly concussion individuals.
College Junior,4,There is always someone to hang out with. It can get boring cause there is not much that goes on. The atmosphere is quiet and peaceful. The cost is a little high. The housing possesses it really smooth and easy.
College Junior,4,"I personally feel very safe when on campus. There is security around twenty-four hours a day. They will even escort you to your car or dorm room from your class if it is late at night, you just simply call them. They have keys to most of the buildings so if there was ever an emergency they could get into anywhere."
College Junior,4,"There is practically no drug scene on campus. There is little peer pressure when it comes to drugs or drinking. Often individuals from the homeless community might be seen doing drugs on campus. However, security usually escorts them off campus."
College Junior,4,"The cost is affordable! Multnomah has great activities going on in campus so living close to school is always a win, win."
College Junior,4,The Masters in counseling program at Multnomah is developing and becoming stronger with each year. The cohorts are small and engaging. Students get to strengthen their faith as well practice their skills with each other. Rae Chresfield is one of the best instructor Multnomah has! Her experience and teaching style allows for all students to become strongly engaged and motived to start working the real world!
College Junior,4,The faculty at Multnomah are always encouraging.
College Freshman,4,We live in Portland. The food here is great.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy living on the dorms, however I really hate the amount of rules we have. Though sharing a bathroom with twenty other women isn't my favorite, it is still kept clean."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are a ton of places to eat at off-campus. They can be pricey but there are a lot of choices and options to eat off-campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,Strictness is needed in schools. So the strictness required here is to keep our focus on what we are striving for.
College Junior,4,"Getting great grades in high school and community college made me eligible for quite a bit of scholarships. They also have some smaller ones for meeting deadlines, or filling out paperwork. No college-given scholarship will cover full tuition though, so either supplementary scholarships and grants, work-study money, personal funds, or loans are needed to meet tuition."
College Junior,4,"This is a conservative Christian college, so within those parameters, there is quite a bit of ethnic and ideological diversity. No student on campus may be LGBT, but we do strive to maintain good relationships with, and build up, those around our campus who are."
College Junior,4,"The campus supports each team, and there's always good involvement in them. There's not a major push to be in athletics, so it's more recreational than varsity. The teams are also all focused on serving the community, so will go out as a group and do work projects."
College Junior,4,"Most food within a mile radius of the campus is pretty good; there's a lot of fast food places and a few restaurants. It's not too much further though to get to Mall 205, or a little ways to get to Airport Way, where there are a lot more fine dining options, and shopping."
College Junior,4,"While the area directly surrounding the campus is primarily residential, it's not too bad of a distance to find a lot of fun things to do in Portland, and especially in NE Portland. There's a lot of restaurants nearby, and public transit brings a lot of the city together."
College Junior,4,Campus housing is great and fosters relationships
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of different types of dining options which are near the school: Thai, Mexican, American, Chinese, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"we have a very active campus security. and the doors are card coded. the surrounding area is a bit sketchy, but as long as you take a friend or a group its not a problem."
College Sophomore,4,"Good academics, the language program is great and well known for being so. Not a ton of options in the science and math realms but a place for Bible/Theology, language, music, and education degrees. The work load is reasonable and you get out as much as you give."
College Sophomore,4,"Good dorms with plenty of space, great janitorial service, and an excellent amount of dorm activities to get everyone involved. the cost feel high for the quality, community bathrooms make life interesting and limited storage space in the them make hauling soaps and shampoos to the bathroom a chore everyday. security is very well done.  over all not a bad set up but for the price could be better."
College Sophomore,4,"policies positively impact students, good atmosphere"
College Sophomore,4,very popular but could be better.
College Sophomore,4,In a city there are always options
College Freshman,4,Some places are old but they have remodeled and kept it up nice
College Freshman,4,talking to admissions workers are really helpful and want you to save money however you can.
College Sophomore,4,"Reno can often have all four seasons in one day. Usually the weather does not effect the school, but occasionally during the winter some night classes may be cancelled due to snow/ice."
College Sophomore,4,I give a four out of five because there are some really extreme and different opinions on homosexuality at this school. It depends on the denomination how one feels on this subjects. All other differences I feel are a moot point.
College Sophomore,4,"Financial aid is always a pain, and that is no fault of the school. With that being said, Multnomah really strives to make the process as painless as possible. They are always willing to work with you and are very understanding when your government grant checks  (FAFSA related) don't come in on time."
College Sophomore,4,"No permit costs. I've never had a ticket or fine. I think there is a need for a car to travel to the campus because there is no school housing; however, there is a bus stop in front of the school and many people ride their bikes. You will never struggle to find a parking spot."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is located pretty close to our Midtown area which is hipster central. Great food, coffee, and art. Local museums offer student discounts. A large ministry opportunity with the vast gambling found in Reno. Ever expanding malls in town offer great shopping, and again, always bring your student ID in case of a discount."
College Sophomore,4,I have a car so do not know that much
College Sophomore,4,"rainy, but mild. able to go the beach/hike/mountain easily and the weather varies in those places"
College Junior,4,"They are strict about Alcohol and drugs, but other wise not too bad."
College Junior,4,"Drugs are not even thought about on campus. They are not allowed, but no one cares about that rule, since no one ever uses them."
College Junior,4,Can take some time to log in to computers... But they work great and you can print directly from your own computer with out wires.
College Junior,4,Excellent School with high quality professors who are certainly experts in what they teach! And the community of people on campus is amazing!
College Junior,4,The campus housing is really great. Good buildings and decently sized rooms.
College Junior,4,"It stays pretty safe on campus. We live in a high crime area, which leads to a few minor thefts."
College Senior,4,"Mulntomah Athletics has a lot of fan support. I am not in the Athletics program, but I know they all really enjoy each other and Multnomah students love our school!"
College Senior,4,"Even for those who don't play, sports are fun at MU! The school is very supportive of all our teams and encourages the players to do their best and uphold high standards."
College Senior,4,"You get all types at Multnomah, and it makes for a great environment. There is so pressure to find a date, but it seems to be easy for those who want to. My favorite part is the low key atmosphere that allows lots of guys and girls to just be friends in a meaningful way."
College Senior,4,On campus people are creative in the fun and community activities we choose. Its always safe and never leaves you feeling gross in the morning. The frequented places don't ever grow old.
College Junior,4,"While there are a few sports offered and lots of students will participate, the finances do not allow for many other organized teams to be formed. There is boys basketball, girls volleyball, and recently a soccer team formed through the Montavilla Community has decided to play together, but not through the school. Other than that, students come up with their own sports from spikeball, frizbee, and running."
College Sophomore,4,"There is occasional difficulty in finding a parking spot when there are a lot of classes, but even the farthest parking spots still are not more than a few minutes walk from classes. Parking on the street is also available, which can make it difficult to drive down those streets as space is tight. Otherwise, parking is well enforced and permits are easy to get. Freshmen and seniors have the same access to parking."
College Freshman,2,We need a bigger weight room and even another gym.
College Sophomore,2,pretty low. But they try and take really good care of us
College Sophomore,2,"not very diverse, you are accepted easily there just is not a ton of diversity"
College Junior,2,"Our on-campus housing and alcohol policies are strictly enforced. You must be 21 to live off-campus or in the apartments, and there are hardly any exceptions made even if you are in your third year of school. This policy is difficult for myself as well as others who are ready to move out and start life on our own. The consequences for drinking are also strictly enforced. That one is pretty understandable, though, in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't had much luck with finding financial aid from the school. I have received financial aid based on my grades, but other than that I haven't even heard of much scholarships that Multnomah offers."
College Junior,2,"Sports Aren't Our Strength – Sports isn't Multnomah's strong point, but to be honest, people don't come to MU to play sports. They come here to study the Bible. The sports that we do have at Multnomah are super great, even if they aren't a big part of campus life."
College Junior,1,There are little to no parties. There is practically no night life.
College Junior,1,There are very few parties and unless one has theirs on a form of transportation it will be hard getting there.
College Junior,1,There are no fraternitys or sororitys within the school.
College Freshman,1,We dont have a greek life so...
College Sophomore,1,The weather in Portland is pretty miserable during the majority of the school year. It is overcast and rainy for most of the school months with the exception of the first month of the fall semester and the last month of spring semester. When the sun does shine through it is usually cold and windy.
College Sophomore,1,We only have two sports teams at our school. Those are woman's volleyball and men's basketball. The fan support isn't very big at any sporting events.
College Junior,1,"Can't Even Compare! Coming from a big state school where I did my undergrad, the athletics at multnomah seem almost nonexistent.  it's kindof like going to a high school game, doesn't quite inspire a huge amount of school spirit."

Freshman,5,"I have had a good experience at St. Bonaventure. Going into college I have always heard that the food is bad, but so far the food has been good and there are days in which the dining hall holds special events with special food options. The class sizes are small which allow for a better learning experience and more attention from teachers."
Alum,5,"I took about three online courses at St. Bonaventure University and they all felt cohesive and effective, despite not being in the classroom. I didn't think my experience was hindered in any way."
Alum,5,"I love St. Bonaventure University. I'm incredibly grateful for every opportunity and experience I had during my time there, and I would go back if I could."
Freshman,5,Yesterday was the day that we were able see you at first I thought it would help me get a good one and I have tried a few times and it is still not working so I’m not sure what it was going on and then I’m leaving now I have a good day I just have tried it to go to get a good night out and then go to the shop to see what I have done I don’t want you going on a day like I have tried and it is a little crazy.
Alum,5,Phenomenal university. The best four years if my life were spent at this fantastic university. Worthy investment.
Graduate Student,5,The staff are so welcoming and are very helpful. They really care about making sure you have all the information you need and are completely ready for your classes. I'm so glad I chose to come here.
Freshman,5,I like that the professors really care about your learning experience.The campus is really a safe place to be.  I feel that class size really matter to me.  The campus is set on a really beautiful surrounding.  The school really make every effort to try to make the school affordable to you.  I would like to see more diversity at the campus though.
Senior,5,I love the family that I’ve made and the feeling of a second home it brings. There are plenty of majors to choose from and the teachers are more than helpful in reaching your goal to graduate. There are many clubs and sports to join. Going to the basketball games is always fun and having the religious aspect to this amazing Franciscan institution is great!I would recommend anyone to take a tour because you won’t regret it!
Sophomore,5,I am a student athlete at St. Bonaventure and I couldn't see myself anywhere else. Just a tight knit community with amazing people and professors. The students always come first.
Freshman,5,"I love the small campus, and everyone there is so nice and helpful with the admissions process. I have not heard anything bad about the campus."
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere and community at St. Bonaventure. I felt at home as soon as I arrived. The staff really care about their students and provide a healthy and motivational learning environment.
Junior,5,"I love that St. Bonaventure is a small school so I'm able to know all my peers and my professors. Also, I love the fact that it is D1 school (small school with big time athletics!). Also, the campus is beautiful and all of the professors have been very knowledgeable in their fields and willing to help students succeed."
Niche User,5,"It was a small campus and everyone was involved. They have multiple clubs for anything you could think of. The community was very involved and it was a great place to meet new people. Once a Bonnie, always a Bonnie."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small campus and family feel.  Everyone is so friendly, the professors are very helpful.  I love that there is emphasis on growing not just academically but also spiritually."
Niche User,5,"I loved the friendly and welcoming environment at st. Bonaventure. There is a clear comradery between all the students and alumni. I've never felt unsafe during the time I spent there and I would highly recommend checking it out! the attention and help you will receive far surpasses that of any other school I've seen. The teachers are extremely invested in each and every student and the students are always trying to help one another. It's a D1 school so sports games are a must and the athletic facilities are outstanding. The campus is small but has a very beautiful view and well kept look, not at all institutional like many other schools which I have visited. Their ability to meet students need as far as tuition is out of this world especially for a private school. I hope this Helps anyone who's looking here. Bonnas is definitely worth your time!"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at St. Bonaventure and have already fallen in love with the school in my short time here.  The atmosphere provides a strong sense of community and the students are generally very kind to one another. The sporting events, especially basketball games, are what makes the school so great. Bonaventure fans are definitely one of a kind! Great party scene too!"
Freshman,5,"I love Bonas so much,walking on campus is beautiful and its a second home for me. The staff and professor's are amazing and anytime I need help I know I can receive it."
Niche User,5,"Great town , small class sizes where you get to know your instructors . Here you are not just a number or dollar sign . Great campus too"
Sophomore,5,"I have not spent much time at St Bonaventure yet due to the fact that I am transferring to the school in the fall of 2018. With that being said, I have already developed a very good opinion of the school. I have two cousins that are now alumni of the school and constantly express to me how much they enjoyed it there and that even though it is a more expensive school, that it is very much worth the extra money."
Sophomore,5,Great school with awesome opportunities and close community. The professors are great and since they cap classes at a very small number there is great one on one contact with professors.
Freshman,5,"Overall, the college is great! It is centered around family and Franciscan values that more people should live by. People are USUALLY friendly. 
DOWNSIDES that I notice are the occasional talk about drinking and partying. If you are a student that does not party or drink, then you might feel uncomfortable and may find it hard to relate to these peers but if you are able to focus on yourself and don't give in to peer pressure, you should be fine and l. There are soo many clubs you can take part in such as the Laugh Pack, plays, sports, Mountain Community Leaders, and much more. The campus is big on Sustainability and Environmental education. Another Downside I notice is that if you are an environmental Science major, there is only one professor that teaches most of the related and required courses that you need to take so if you don't like that professor, you are stuck with him."
Graduate Student,5,I received my Master's here and all my professors were amazing! The class sizes were smaller so if you are the kind of student who needs more one-on-one attention this is perfect. The professors were also very caring and understanding which is sometimes hard to find.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Bonaventure has been amazing so far, and I have only completed one semester. In the first semester, I have met people from all over the world who I consider lifelong friends, I have been pushed academically by my professors to strive for the best, and I have grown as a person, especially growing spiritually. Some of my favorite things I have had the opportunities to do through Bonaventure were going to Mount Irenaeus and even the baseball games in the Reilly Center. Within the first few weeks of the semester, Bonas became my second home. Bonas is and will always be home. I feel I am in the right place when I walk across campus or when I interact with other students, professors, and alumni.  I could not imagine being anywhere else and being able to say that ""I am a Bonnie"" is such a special feeling."
Freshman,5,St. Bonaventure is a small town university that has D1 athletics in the Atlantic 10. St. Bonaventure really caught my eye because I enjoy small classes with more one on one time with teachers who can help me achieve my best potential in the classroom.
Alum,5,I love St. Bonaventure!! It is such a warm inviting atmosphere and everyone is like a huge family there. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. If I could keep going back I would!
Freshman,5,"friendly and extremely helpful professors, beautiful scenery, diverse, easy living, easy to find jobs in area"
Alum,5,"SBU is the ideal school. Unmatched spirit. Beautifully scenic environment. Historic buildings. Close to skiing, hiking, biking, and boating. This school is an an active outdoorsman's dream. 

The alumni are outstanding in there support of students. Every job I've ever had I have obtained through my alumni connections. Now that I am in a hiring position for a large (100k+) multinational company, I go out of my way to hire alumni. 

Athletics, especially basketball, are thrilling and will keep you engaged with the school for the rest of your life. 

At many schools, you could be just a number. At Bona's you matter."
Sophomore,5,This is a great school. I can't wait to get back in a few weeks. I miss everyone. I will be a sophomore and loved my freshman year. All of my friends are coming back.
College Sophomore,5,I will have no trouble. I landed a great internship this summer.
College Sophomore,5,I made the right choice in so many ways. Our school is great and can't wait to get back in a few weeks. I miss everyone. Any negative reviews of this school are the exception. Some kids don't get involved and don't put any effort into the social aspect of college. This school is amazing once you get involved.
College Sophomore,5,"People care, no issues I can think of. Honestly, I can't think of anyone being a victim of anything."
College Sophomore,5,"We have incredible teams for a school this size. Both basketball teams were ranked in the top 30 last year and were in and out of the top 25 all year. We are a rugby power nationally. We have a very strong swim team.  Sports are a big deal here. This school is wild during basketball season, I mean wild. Crazy wild. Often on national TV."
College Sophomore,5,"Bonaventure is small but has big school benefits. A top basketball team, excellent facilities, lots of school spirit. It really feels like home. Bonaventure also has one of the top school newspapers and radio stations. Dorm life is fun and students are close-knit."
College Freshman,5,There is a nurse practitioner always around. People really care about your well being.
College Freshman,5,I already have job offers after graduation.
College Freshman,5,I am really well prepared academically. The core requirements are extensive but really worthwhile. You learn to write and think.
College Freshman,5,Both ladies' and mens' basketball were in the top 30 nationally and on national TV several times. We should have even better season next year. Rugby we are ranked 6th in the nation and its a growing sport. Baseball is fun to watch. We are a power in Swimming. Division 1 in the Atlantic 10.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school because it feels like a family. The atmosphere is amazing, especially during basketball games. I really feel as if the adults here all want us to succeed and become good people who can go and help the world, as the Franciscan tradition encourages. Even though it is a religious based school, it is a very open and accepting atmosphere. The administration does everything in its power to educate us about diversity and inclusivity. The school is unique because it doesn't just educate us, it provides us with an experience and opportunities to grow as people. It's because of this and the atmosphere that I would choose my school over and over again. I knew when I walked on campus and felt like I belonged."
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are pretty small making the students to have a good connection with the professor.
College Freshman,5,Safety and security makes sure that every student feels safe
College Senior,5,Professors really care about their students
College Senior,5,As a Junior already looking at job offers
College Senior,5,The excitement of college basketball games on campus is awesome
College Freshman,5,"Love the class size, the program and campus life"
College Freshman,5,The teachers and the program have given me a great experiences
College Student,5,"Its just a great place. I loved the people, the campus, the sports and the friends I have made."
College Sophomore,5,I feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I am madly and completely in love with my school. i would absolutely never choose another school if i had to go back and do it all over again. I love the fact that i can walk into a room and know my opinion matters. i love the positive and encouraging energy around campus. i love the friends i have met and and will meet in the future.  i love the amount of leniency they give up. I would not want to be at any other school than St. Bonaventure University.
College Sophomore,5,I think the work load for my major is very fair and reasonable.
College Sophomore,5,the professor are incredible. they are always helpful and ready to answer questions. The registration process is frustrating and stressful but your advisor does their best to make it go as smooth and easy for you.
College Sophomore,5,The facilities on campus are great. the Richter center which is our campus gym and recreational center is all new and great for exercise and friendly sports games.
College Sophomore,5,"i feel like our school is unique in the way that it truly is like a family. When something drastic happens on campus, the school as a whole deals with it and comforts each other. The professors generally care about the success of their students and that is what stuck out for me the most when i was college searching."
College Junior,5,"The education program at SBU is one of the top 25 in the nation; however, it is a rigorous and time consuming program. There are many opportunities to learn within the classroom. The faculty is great and cares about the students' success. It is easy to be hired with a degree in education from SBU."
College Junior,5,"The registration process is all done on-line. The professors care about the students' success. The curriculum in rigorous and there is a somewhat heavy workload for most majors. There are many study abroad options. The most popular schools are Journalism and Mass Communications, Business, Arts and Sciences, and Education. There is a core curriculum, the Clare College, which connects all of the students with a similar background of knowledge and experiences. St. Bonaventure University is a Franciscan university."
College Junior,5,"As a student of the School of Education, I am required to spend multiple hours in the classroom. The faculty at SBU makes it very easy for students to be connected with teachers and schools. Education students spend two semesters learning and working in the schools under as part of their credit hours, and a third semester student teaching. I am not worried about finding a student teaching position because I know that the faculty at SBU will match me to the perfect teacher and class."
College Junior,5,I love the education program at SBU. The faculty truly cares about the students' success. I am planning on becoming an Early Childhood or Elementary teacher for about three years and then returning to SBU for a graduate degree in Educational Leadership. I then plan to go into school administration and receive a Doctorate in Education. I would love to retire from the educational system and complete the circle as a professor of education at St. Bonaventure University.
College Junior,5,"The Campus Activities Board (CAB) provides many fun opportunities for students. There are trips to professional sporting events, New York City, and they hold an annual Spring Weekend festival. There is a beautiful library that is open until 1 AM, and a coffee shop that is open until 2 AM. There is a state-of-the-art athletic center open for student use, as well as a paved path along the Alleganey River. SBU has the most amount of green spaces than any other univeristy in the nation. The students at SBU participate in many traditions including the candel light ceremonies for freshman induction and senior graduation, and Blessing of the Brains and Late Night Breakfast before each finals week."
College Junior,5,"St. Bonaventure University is the first Franciscan univeristy in the United States, and is full of Franciscan tradition. It holds the largest collection of Franciscan manuscripts next to Assisi. The buildings on campus were designed to create an atmosphere similar to that of Assisi. SBU has pre-doctoral programs, business programs, and journalism programs, just to name a few. Their School of Education is one of the top 25 in the nation, and is nationally certified. All students participate in a core curriculum, the Clare College, which connects the students with a common set of knowledge and background."
College Junior,5,"I have to say, I live on the most beautiful campus that ever there was. The architecture is magic and it's gorgeous year round. We're surrounded by mountains. Our athletic centers are top notch. We don't really have a student center...

Our library is straight out of Hogwarts; it is the most magical and beautiful place. Someone told me once that we are in a record book for having the longest uninterrupted lawn on any campus in the nation. I don't know if that's true, but we have two very big lawns that are great for laying out, kan jam, and just about anything a lawn can be used for. We host a ton of events on campus and they're always great.

We have a museum on campus, and a wonderful chapel. There's also a friary that's very welcoming- a golden retriever lives there."
College Junior,5,"I'd have to repeat a lot of what I said in the previous question. Our campus is gorgeous. It is filled with history.

After a summer or month away at Christmas, coming back to campus is my favorite feeling. I always want to cry.

We are a family. There is no other way to put it.

Once a Bonnie, always a Bonnie."
Junior,4,Because of the COVID-19 pandemic I had the opportunity to take some of my classes online at the end of the semester. The professors were very patient with me and the class and figuring out how we would finish off the semester. Overall pleased with their quick transition to online learning.
Junior,4,This university has a very tight-nit community that everyone can feel a part of. The professors are very kind and helpful in almost every way!
Graduate Student,4,"I am a incoming Graduate Student. I have not experienced any of the major aspects of the university as if I was located there. But I know some things about the University. Still, from what I have  been told by my Success Coach and my Entrance Councilor, this school is private, but has the things I'll need to be successful in the real world. 
That's important. All I have to do is do what is expected of me and move forward towards a better life and future."
Alum,4,"Community and lifelong friendships. Just a few words I use to describe my years at Bonas. I made amazing friends there and still keep in touch with them daily years later. It's a small school in the middle of nowhere, the closest metro areas are Buffalo and Rochester, so if you're coming from a large city this is something to keep in mind. A few of my peers from NYC had a tough time adjusting to this and eventually left or transferred out. Academics are average, not much different than what you would receive at a good community college. Although I greatly enjoyed my 4 years there and received a great scholarship package, I would not recommend taking out loans to finance your way through this college especially if your major is teaching, etc- you can receive the same education at a SUNY college. There is also no Greek life or football. That said, basketball games were always fun and they are doing really well now (they weren't in 2003-2007 when I went there)."
Niche User,4,"St. Bonaventure University is a decent university. Depending on what major you choose you will either be in debt or make a good living.  I am enjoying my time here but things are changing.

Social Life- Social life is what you make of it. Parties do get shut down and the local law enforcement is taking extreme measures at trying to prevent gatherings of people off-campus. Including extreme fines and tickets. People still go out though because the weekends are their time off.

Sports- Sports games are usually well attended, Basketball is probably the best time of the year and the time where kids show their true school spirit. 

Student Body - Students first, and everything else second. Execpet basketball season. Most people are nice, very sociable, like having fun.

Academics- Some teachers are amazing, while others just try to push liberal ideas to you."
Junior,4,"It’s a small school with a huge personality. You’ll find that everyone is very welcoming and being a Bonnie is like no other. You’ll make friendships that last you a lifetime  and leave with a very well known and appreciated degree. I gave St. Bonaventure 4 stars because it is in a small town and you have to make your own fun, which isn’t that hard to do."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people I have met at St. Bonaventure and the feeling of a small community. It is great to be able to make friends so easily and walk around campus and actually recognize the people that you are passing. I also love the beauty of the campus itself and all of the dorms/class buildings are very close to each other. If I had to change something about St. Bonaventure it would be the food and the housing/parking situation. Their food could definitely improve and the should switch up their variety. There needs to be more housing and parking on campus because there is a growing amount of students and some are being forced to live in places they don't want to. Overall, St. Bonaventure University is a great school to go to."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love it here and even though the winters may be brutal they are worth it when you see the campus in the spring!
Alum,4,"Caring faculty -- My advisor remembered me 10 years after I graduated and offered to write letters of recommendation for me for grad school.

Location isn't great. It's a small town, isolated from major cities, so internships weren't readily available."
Niche User,4,"It is a very small university, which is not for everyone, but that is what I preferred. Very good experience."
Alum,4,"Great college experience can be put into one term: Bona Bubble. When you're inside St. Bonaventure, you are immediately wrapped in a bubble of family, no exclusions. Through the tough winters and seemingly quiet town, students and teachers become extended family. Teachers are not only academic resources, but great mentors and counselors. The cold does bring people together because the Bonaventure Bond is unbreakable even when you graduate."
Senior,4,"The university is a small school, which provides great opportunities to get to know both students and professors well. The professors, especially in the biology department, really do care about the needs of the students and are always willing to take time to meet with them as necessary. However, the small school environment does make finding some opportunities difficult, such as more niche clubs or classes. However, overall, the student population is very helpful and kind and it is a great place to be."
Freshman,4,"I feel that the Saint Bonaventure community itself is a very welcoming environment. The professors and upperclassman are very inviting and eager to help you in any way that they can. The academics are rigorous but I do learn a lot in class. Its always good to be able to unwind at the end of  a long week at a basketball game, the atmosphere there is always electric!"
Freshman,4,I think Saint Bonaventure University has a great atmosphere with different cultures. The life you have there will be great. You will have fun and will be a successful individual.
Alum,4,"Close fit school everyone knew everyone , very friendly people rarely there was a problem between each other even roommates, most that were roommates became best friends. most professors were quick answering back and had time to talk whatever concern there was"
College Freshman,4,There is a broad variety of classes . Also the class sizes aren't intimidatingly huge.
College Freshman,4,I feel like Bonas goes the mile on everything they do. There are plenty of options for internships are career related programs.
College Freshman,4,Before and during school the amount of services and support is outstanding. Administration has made it clear the importance of taking a stand and that they are here to help.
College Freshman,4,I feel the rooms are spacious enough. They aren't extremely drag and the bathrooms are clean
College Freshman,4,"There are great opportunities for competitive athletes , non competitive athletes and just those who like to stay fit ."
College Freshman,4,So far St Bonaventure has been the best thing to happen to me. Those horrible a days in high school don't exist anymore. People care and life becomes what you make it.
College Sophomore,4,It is at its peak during basketball season.
College Sophomore,4,Freshman have a great program to adjust to college level work. People work hard here and in groups. Profs are very friendly and we have no teaching assistants. Upperclassmen mentor as well.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms for freshman are legacy dorms but have recently been renovated and they are spotless. Upper class students have more choices. The social scene is fantastic.
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt in any real danger on campus. People are very friendly to one another. If an issue ever arose, bystanders would quickly help and resolve the issue."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms here are dated, but they are nice. They're bigger than a lot of other school's dorms. The RA's are normally pretty relaxed. As long as you're not being too loud, you can have people over and pregame in the dorms before going out."
College Sophomore,4,"Bona's basketball is like a religion here. Most of the student body and alums follow it with a passion. Overall, our athletics are good and the facilities reflect that. All sports are having good success right now and many of the students come out to watch many of the sports."
College Sophomore,4,The school is small which is a blessing and a curse
College Freshman,4,The dorms are not as fancy as other schools but the social atmosphere is friendly and close. They are very clean just dated.
College Freshman,4,"I have no real complaints but nothing gets a perfect score. I love this school. The location, the people are warm and authentic. This school has crazy, I mean crazy school spirit. The alumni are always here and lots of kids have siblings here. Lots of legacy students. The campus is lovely, I mean achingly beautiful. There is a river behind campus, fields are everywhere and the area has Allegheny State Park, Letchworth State Park and a great ski area 30 mins from campus. I play golf a lot. There is a nice 9 hole course on campus with carts and a clubhouse. Crazy!!!!!!  I have been fishing many times at Kinzua Dam.

Classes are small and profs friendly. Love it. The new business building is totally state of the art. Kids are jocky here and very social, well dressed and rarely smoke."
College Sophomore,4,"My teachers are great, internships are helpful, everything is great!"
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,"I don't participate in any sports, but I love going to basketball games. You can really tell that the school is a family that supports each other there. I do take advantage of the gym occasionally and know that it's equipment is updated every few years."
College Freshman,4,The career center is very good with preparing you (i.e resume) but not necessarily that helpful when finding a job/internship.
College Student,4,"The basketball teams, men and women, are great and doing well. Last year the men's team beat 3 Top 25 schools and the campus was on fire with spirit. Two years ago both teams went to the NCAA's.  The swim team is fantastic. The rugby team is also great and lots of people attend."
College Student,4,It is very rare to hear about anything bad. The school has an excellent facility if you feel sick.
College Student,4,I have had great summer jobs in my field and I am quite confident I will be employed before graduation.
College Student,4,"St. Bonaventure was a mid-tier choice for me but I am so happy I chose it. The school is so friendly, cohesive and I really feel at home here."
College Freshman,4,sports at the school involve students in many ways
College Freshman,4,For the most part the campus is safe
College Freshman,4,All teachers were helpful and classes were not too intimidating
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere is friendly and cozy basically the campus is a second family
College Freshman,4,Student involvement at basketball games is big
College Freshman,4,"Great atmosphere, everyone gets along well"
College Sophomore,4,St. Bonaventure is a great school for people who like to get out and be something in a school. You really get to know people and make a difference form the star of your freshmen yes
College Sophomore,4,I would choose my school again because my experience so far has been amazing. I realize that my school is small and that it may lack some of the opportunities that bigger schools offer but for me and what i want to do in the future St. Bonaventure is perfect for me.
College Sophomore,4,Dont have much to say about this.
College Sophomore,4,"I'am still in need of more financial help, I'am try to get scholarship to pay for school"
College Sophomore,4,I really like it but it can get cold up there.
College Freshman,4,The main reason I chose this school was the abundance of scholarships I got. I studied hard in high school and had good grades with good SAT scores but it's not like I was Ivy league material.
College Senior,4,"hands on law firm, working as a secretary"
College Junior,4,Not too strict. Everyone drinks every week and you won't get caught if you are smart about it. The problem is a lot of people at this school are retarded
College Junior,4,Course sizes are great and the teachers do a great job of integrating students in class discussions.
College Sophomore,4,The professors cater to your needs and interests
College Sophomore,4,The professors cater to your needs and interests.
College Sophomore,4,"I think the party scene gives everyone a chance to interact, especially when they do not get a chance to meet certain people on campus due to different schedules.  St. Bonaventure is a relatively small school but still not every student gets a chance to know every person. This gives students an opportunity to meet different people from different crowds outside of their classes and close friend group."
College Senior,4,there are many parties on campus literally every day
College Senior,4,security is all over an work together for any kind out of place situation
College Senior,4,alumni network is very useful to the students and value the degrees
College Senior,4,i enjoy the international studies program but to do it in a study abroad not many are offered for that program.
Graduate Student,2,"The first year of graduate school was good, but then they some professors who were so full of themselves that the communication was at zero. The whole cohort felt that we were just teaching ourselves."
Works Here,2,This school will be out of business in the near future. There is no benefit of attending this college. High tuition and poor education. I’m not sure why anyone would attend???
College Student,2,It's a place to live
College Sophomore,2,"Hilariously, most Bonas students think they're going to make it big one day. The list of successful people (not involved in sports) who have been to this school can be counted on your fingers and toes, despite that the school has been open for over 150 years."
College Sophomore,2,"Fairly awful. 

The housing at Bonaventure is without hyperbole worse than Army Barracks. 

The rooms are tight and cramped, with Doyle being the exception The desks vary in quality and size. 

Until just two years ago, freshmen had to shower in adjoining stalls in the same room as toilets. 

Doyle still has shower stalls as does Francis and Dev.

Garden apartments are OK, it is almost impossible to cook without setting off a fire alarm.  

There are tons of houses off campus, but the school is becoming agressively more authoritarian. 

Two years ago, they stopped sophomores from living off campus

This year, they changed the rules to stop juniors from living off campus. 

That means, as of the 2016-2017 school year, you can only live on Campus unless you're a senior."
College Freshman,2,All the students do on the weekends is party and if you don't party then you are left out.
College Freshman,2,"There is pretty much nothing to do in town. Trips out include walmart and a ""mall"". For the best dining out options, look at Applebees."
College Junior,2,"My university is located in a very small town in New York. It's a gorgeous place, and there are a lot of things to do within an hour and half drive. There's a state park near by. We recently got an activities center in town with a bowling alley/ put-put/ batting cages/ an arcade/ a bar and some more stuff. We have a walmart. That's a pretty big to do when the bus is running- it's actually a thing that students go when they're bored. Other than that, we have bars."
College Junior,2,they need to organize better
College Junior,2,The safety and security guards are very lazy. They are supposed to be here to help but they are very unreasonable and give out parking tickets with abandon. They are supposed to give students rides if they have to go across campus by themselves at night but i have heard of instances where they refused to do so because the student calling was a male.
College Sophomore,2,"Saint Bonaventure is very strict with parking, if a student is parked in a spot for too long they are fined. The student parking is located in the back along with the visitors parking and a lot of people don't know that, so they end up being fined for not having a permit."
College Sophomore,2,They do provide a shuttle bus but honestly it would be better if it ran during the day.
College Sophomore,2,Its not very diverse so it would be really nice if there was more diversity.
College Sophomore,2,they're very expensive. There is no way to escape that
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking is very popular here, most of the student body takes part throughout the week, not just on weekends. Many people smoke, a lot of people take adderall, mostly by snorting it. Molly is becoming more popular among the students, but most of the hard drugs are not on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Boring, nothing to do except go to the movies which people rarely do"
College Freshman,2,There are options but I am a picky eater so it is not very easy for me to have variety.
College Freshman,2,On campus it is very strict about alcohol policies and drug policies.
College Sophomore,2,Need More – There's only one bus and it only stops at a few places. Adding stops/another bus would be great.
College Junior,2,"Small Town – St. Bonaventure is located between two very small cities in New York. Olean is one of the cities, it has a small population with few diverse stores. Both Olean and the other city Alleghany are small cities, but the residents are family friendly. Everyone is welcoming to the students which is a plus that come with being a small town school."
Graduate Student,1,"You get what you pay for. If you can stand the bad teaching and being treated like a kid in 1950's Catholic middle school, then you might be okay here."
Graduate Student,1,"This place is cheaper than most online grad schools, but you get what you pay for. Professors treat graduate students like badly behaved children. Franciscans are not supposed to be like the Opus Dei, but this place seems pretty old school Catholic. Very non-diverse. And where there is diversity among the faculty, it is clear that the school has chosen -people who reinforced structural racism and sexism. Very hierarchical. Some professors are okay, but most should not be teaching. I would stay away."
Graduate Student,1,Great idea get your education from a catholic priest. This school is so out of touch with how the real world works. Do your self a favor and attend a real school.
Niche User,1,The students here are some of the most uniformed ever. This education here is a waste of time. This is your typical catholic school that will sell you anything you are willing to pay for.
Alum,1,"This school is an extension of high school. Little to do, overpriced, no diversity. At least I got out of the house."
Alum,1,Waste of money!  100k to become a teacher???  This college is not for professionals or anyone looking to be a leader in the private sector.
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek. Ignore the responses above.
College Sophomore,1,"Although there are more than a dozen houses, they are almost all the same. A bunch of sweat people, paranoid about the police coming into the house standing around; sipping beer and listening to music. 

If somehow that sounds fun to you, then you're in the right place, because on any given weekend night you can do this at 4-7 houses."
College Sophomore,1,"I will never understand how people find these parties entertaining. 

Most of them end up with a house packed full of people, everyone sweating, while music is blasting so loud that you can't talk to the person next to you. In fact, most of the parties consist either of chatting to random class mates, playing pong, grinding, or (most popular) standing in one spot until its time to leave. The average student walks 1.1 miles from their dorm room (each way) to go to 4 houses with this type of atmosphere 2 times a week. 

The bars are almost all dives with 4-5 of them packed on a single street. They're mostly the same inside."
College Sophomore,1,"Other than a special ""no drugs"" dorm, its almost impossible to find people who aren't constantly either drunk or high. Students regularly show up to class buzzed, even in the middle of the week. 

If you're aspiring to be a drunken street urchin, this is the place to start."
College Sophomore,1,"Wellness center staff have no idea what their doing and screw up constantly. 

They are insanely lucky they haven't been slammed with a lawsuit, yet. 

Security mostly messes with students, going out of their way to be intimidating and break up gatherings. 

Also, Bonas has possibly the worst alchohol policy imaginable. If you are in a room with 6 other people and security finds 1 empty beer can, you are liable to be penalized with a fine. Even if you aren't aware of there being drinking going on around you, you can still be held liable. Also, a group of more than 8 people in one room is considered a party that can (will) be broken up by security."
College Sophomore,1,"Hate it. Hate every last student insulting minute of it. Save your money and your time. 

Classes are almost all power-point oriented lectures

A number of professors have an extreme liberal bias and you need to act like a communist to pass the class. 

Courses offered are generally terrible and are only the most broad strokes overview of any given topic, with no depth or specialization."
College Sophomore,1,"Although it looks nice on the exterior and they have the so called ""Bona Bubble"", coming here is by far the worst mistake I've ever made. The food and surrounding town are awful, the classes are boring, the student government is self-destructing, enrollment is way down and they've had to close several dorm buildings. There's a large number of clubs, but they're generally a pain to join and hilariously, most of the clubs focus on trips to get as far away from the school as possible. 

Now, there's one thing I need to make very clear. At other schools, you might get general education courses like nutrition, meteorology, and other classes that will have some impact on your life outside of college. Not at Bonas. Bonas has a huge number of general education courses. A total of 12 classes. All most all of these are religious education about Franciscians and Catholicism. By the way, students are encouraged to get these CLAR courses out of the way as soon as possible. Here's the catch though. These credits are non-transferable and any school that you're attempting to transfer to reserves the right to reject these and any other classes outright. Ironic that they have a billboard outside of town that says ""Transfer to Bonas and finish strong"" when if you're an actual student they make it impossible to transfer out after your first year. 

I could go on and on for hours and hours about what a horrible decision you'd be making by going here, but I'll just say this: Its a fine school to go to if you want to waste 4 years of your life and end up $112k in debt for 30 years. Its fine if you want to be a journalist or a business major. Its fine if you want to be a drunk and snort several lines of cocaine every single day. But if you're looking for value, community, friendship, intelligence, culture, morality, honor, ambition, and dignity... then keep looking because you'll find none of it here."
College Senior,1,Glad we don't have greek life
College Junior,1,"Town is in the middle of no where. Its cold, ugly, and depressing but a lot of the students seem to like it for some reason."
College Sophomore,1,I think the dining hall needs a lot of improvements. The food it not very good. There are very minimal healthy options and simple things like a working toaster are hard to come by.
College Sophomore,1,Saint Bonaventure doesnt have greek life. there are no fraternities or sororities.
College Sophomore,1,the houses tend to be ragged. They are unkempt and the landlords charge an arm and a leg. The houses are too far from campus and people are constantly walking into the houses on the weekends because they think there will be a party.
College Freshman,1,Sucks the hickey makes me sick everytime i eat there
College Sophomore,1,The food is grose you don't know what it is your eating. No vegan foods. No space to sit when the rush hits.

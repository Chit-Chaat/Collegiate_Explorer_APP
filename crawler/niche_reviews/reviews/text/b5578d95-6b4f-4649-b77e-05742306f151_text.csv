Junior,5,"Every course I took online, the professors were always willing to help at anytime and the material was easily accessible and able to be followed along."

Junior,5,Both online and on campus classes are great. The teachers help you and email you back very fast. the food and housing are wonderful.
Junior,5,I love this school! I have never went to a school that cared about its students so much. They want you to pass and want to help you along the way.
Freshman,5,I love the people there and the professors. Everyone always wants to make you feel at home. I also loved how TMU is at the edge of the mountains.
Niche User,5,TMU was amazing at communication! They were always quick to respond to emails and to set up meetings. Their professors were always willing to help and very nice.
Sophomore,5,The community is like a family and the foundation of TMU is christian. Every professor truly cares about each and every one of their students. They want to pray for us and they do pray before each class begins.
Sophomore,5,I like how it is a small campus and you get to know everyone. We are all growing in our faith while attending Truett McConnell University and it is a beautiful campus.
Freshman,5,"So far, I have only taken online classes at TMU and recently visited their campus but I love everything about it and the professors have all been so helpful and encouraging throughout even the hardest and most challenging classes.  They are Christian iniversity and take great pride in instilling that into each and every student that they enroll.  The facility is relaxing and I instantly felt at home.  The faculty is also so kind and receptive and make you feel like family. I am attending in the fall and view it as a great opportunity and experience!"
Senior,5,TMU is an excellent school with professors who actually care about you. The campus is beautiful and after visiting several colleges I could honestly say TMU has the best food!
Alum,5,"This is an excellent college for learning and earnings your degree in nursing. This college is located in one of georgia
most beautiful mountain in North Georgia. The professors in the nursing department are people who wants to work with their students. They make it known they are there to teach and help the students to obtain his/her goals in nursing. I highly recommend this college to all students pursuing a degree in nursing."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere Truett offers. All the staff here are very friendly and are always willing to help when a student needs it. The Christian aspect is my favorite part about the school. The freshman housing could use some update but the newer dorms are very nice.

The community here is amazing, with so many encouraging people. I love the professors because they really care deeply about their students and their well being.

Freshman,5,Truett McConnell has been very welcoming. Everyone who works there is very happy and supportive of the students.
Niche User,5,Truett McConnell has a wonderful environment and it is a school that wants you to succeed in the classroom and outside of it!
Junior,5,"Truett McConnell is a great Christian school! It is everything a Christian would want it to be, good professors, good classes, and amazing chapel. The academics are up to par with other universities and students who graduate from there have about the same opportunities that other graduates from different schools have regarding jobs. It is exactly the school I was looking for when i transferred from my first college. I definitely recommend everybody to go there, whether you're a athlete, musician, future preacher, or just going for academics it is a great school for all."
Freshman,5,"Truett McConnell University is an excellent school. Throughout my time there I enjoyed it thoroughly. Some of the dorms are older, but the newer ones are very nice. The teachers are very willing to help and the students rally around you to make sure you're welcome."
Sophomore,5,I transferred to this university from another private Christian college and was surprised at the difference. Truett professors and staff really make an effort to help you in any way they can as well as take the time to just pray with you if thats what you need.
Junior,5,"I have very much enjoyed being a part of this university for the past three years. I love the environment, and the small class sizes. The uplifting and encouraging faculty and staff have truly made this place a second home. I am going to be a very proud alumni and ambassador for Truett McConnell University."
Sophomore,5,"The  school is Ana amazing school, the  staff is amazing , always so helpful and willing to help, amazing professors are the best part of it all (to my experience), and beautiful campus won’t even mention it. I’m located out of state, but I have had the opportunity to be at the campus before and it’s absolutky beautiful."
Niche User,5,Will be attending in the fall. Chapel meets every Tuesday Morning . I meet with several professors  that were very nice. Baseball Coaches are super cool! Dorms are a little dated. But the  NEW student life center is amazing!!!
Junior,5,"I love Truett because of the Christian environment. The Professors do not only teach well and in the right way, but they go out of their way to build relationships with each student. They want to be more than a teacher in your life. The school offers so many opportunities to serve within the community and a local church. The academics are amazing and I can not wait to have a degree from this school."
Freshman,5,"I love truett and the education I am getting here. If you are looking for a biblically based college in every aspect, Truett is the place to come."
Freshman,5,I really like that Truett is a friendly place to be and you never feel left out. What needs to be fixed though is the food.
College Sophomore,5,They are experts in their field
College Junior,5,Professors care about academic as well as spiritual
College Junior,5,Challenges me and teaches me greatly
College Junior,5,Love everything about this school
College Freshman,5,Psychology major is no easy task but the professors make it fun to learn. If you right down all of your assignments down and complete them you will have a great semester!
College Freshman,5,Truett-McConnell College has an atmosphere that makes everyone feel welcome. It is absolutely uplifting. The professor do nothing but encourage you. They understand you. They stop throughput the lesson to make sure you understand or need to ask any questions. Truett has a wonderful vibe to it. It is the ideal college
College Junior,5,The encouragement in Christ is the prime importance
College Freshman,5,"Truett McConnell is a small school, so everything is easy to walk to.  The cafeteria has reasonable hours, and reasonable food.  Even though I don't always like the food, there are a lot of options.  The weather, and location are okay, even though there is not much for college students to do around town."
College Sophomore,5,"I would absolutely choose the school again if I had the option. I had a lot of trouble picking a school initially, but now that I have been attending for a few years, I am so pleased with my decision! God led me to the right place, for sure. All academics aside, I have learned and grown so much in my personal and spiritual life. I have made some wonderful friends here, and we have our own Bible studies weekly that really help our friend group grow closer together."
College Sophomore,5,"The classes are a comfortable size for me. I prefer smaller classes and a more personal setting where I can get to know the professors, and that is one thing I always have at Truett. The courses are enjoyable, especially because the professors are so kind, and the small sizes of the classes means that they are more personal. It really is like meeting with a group of friends, sometimes."
College Sophomore,5,"As previously stated, the professors at Truett are incredibly helpful and kind. The registration process for classes is a bit stressful, because class sizes are small most of the time, so it can be hard to get into all the ones you want. However, most of the time the professors and departments will work with you if you ask them, so it ends up being okay in the end."
College Sophomore,5,"It really is great. I am an Early Childhood Education major at Truett, but I feel like if I were any other major at the same school, I would still be treated wonderfully. Some of my professors or the other staff at the school have become almost like family to me, and I even miss some of them over breaks and know things about them and their personal lives. The opportunity to know the professors so well is wonderful. Especially because I tend to ask a lot of questions. Most of my teachers are very kind and considerate, always ready to help and explain things when I am unsure. It really is lovely."
College Junior,5,We have added several programs like nursing this year to handle the growth of the college.  I'd like to see even more added in future years.
College Junior,5,"Our History professors take up a lot of time with us, and are knowledgeable and helpful."
College Junior,5,The online classes are more directed towards one's self. There is not as much room for discussion and the work can be done and is self explanatory.  However the teachers are there if you need to ask questions. It is a pretty good amount of work especially if you are taking more than one class.
College Junior,5,"The professors really help students at Truett. They help get us involved in class and help us understand what is being taught.  Our school is very helpful and understanding in any area. some students create their own majors however we have nursing, business, sports management, christian studies, missions, theology, biology, teaching, english, and a few more i believe"
College Junior,5,Our school helps students find jobs in their field; however it is up to the students to pursue the career and apply for the jobs. At truett I am more than just a number
College Junior,5,I love Truett. I am in the nursing program at Truett and it is going to be great. I really enjoy that we get a minor in missions. There are a good number of majors now at that truett is expanding and and some can even be achieved online. the nursing program is new and i will be in the first graduating class. you can choose your workload for the first two years but once into nursing you take a lot of hours. No less than 15 but we are also working in the hospitals for around 8 hours if not more. Im so excited. We have a beautiful campus. Everyone is nice and its like our own family within a college. The teachers are helpful and there are lots of opportunities to get involved in clubs and sports.
College Sophomore,5,"Truett McConnell is small. I think this is it's greatest feature. It is extremely loving and caring! Everyone knows each other and helps each other. I feel a part of a school who cares about me. The professors all seem approachable and caring when I have quesitons. I am not afraid to seek out help. Help is always there. I love my classes where professors share their faith and how they became a part of the faculty.
I also had a personal expereince where my truck window was broken. The school paid for all damages. They went out of their way to make sure the problem was addressed."
College Sophomore,5,We have a great campus. The campus activities programs offers special celebrations days for students to particpate in throughout the year. We have movie night outside several times a semester. They offer special Exam Treat Boxes that are sent out to students. They offer special dorm activities/competitions for everyone to get involved in throughout the year. We have bible studies with groups in our dorms. Each room has a special locations for students to communicate with one another. We also have chapel each week which we are reqiured to attend and dress for where special guest speakers speak. I love my school!
College Sophomore,5,"Truett offers a computer lab which offers printing opportunities for the student.
The level of network services at Truett are great. I never had a problem using my computer with the wifi services.
Plus my college dorm room had great cable services.
I always felt connected with the internet. I never had a problem getting anything copied."
College Sophomore,5,"The truth is it is very, very expensive to attend this college.However, they were straight forward with the factor that the college was expensive. The entire process was very easy to follow and I would say they were very organized in every part of the process. There were NO problems throughout my first year. I want to be a pastor. It is a small college and that may be why the cost are high. But, at the same time I believe it is the place God wants me to be. I need to be prepared by a Baptist Colllege because one day I would like to be a Baptist pastor. 
I do find the college to have the very best professors who are involved with students in the classroom, which may be why again, the cost are high. I love everything about the college and I am trying to be proactive by appplying for any type of scholarship that I can in order to go back for my sophmore year. I would like to obtain my degree from this school. I feel it is my responsbility to apply for any type of federal student loans, private school loans or even scholarships. Lastly, and most importantly my parents are employed as a teacher and state probabtion officer, yet we qualify for NO finiancial aide. They make too much money which is a joke because it is NOT that much. It is like we are penalized because we do make some money which is considered too much. It seems unfair.I am trying to do this to help them because they are doing everything they can to help me!"
College Sophomore,5,They are having a masters program starting up in 2 years which will be great!
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is GREAT on campus. The gym, student center, library are great. There are many campus activities and everything is wonderful on Truett's campus!"
College Sophomore,5,"First of all, it is a Christian college where our leaders (President and Vice Presidents) serve The Lord in everything that they do, think, and say. I believe that this makes my school different from EVERY other school because of how God's Presence is evident on our campus. The academic programs are incredible and it is literally just like a family!"
College Sophomore,5,"The education that I am getting at Truett McConnell college is well worth the money that is being paid. Also, the financial aid office is incredibly helpful and sweet and reliable."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a history major, and I love the small size of our classes. The material is interesting, and one of my professors likes class discussions on the history topics we're covering. We're kinda like a little family."
College Sophomore,5,"The school mainly consists college-age students mixed in with a few older commuter students. We're diverse considering our nature, and we have many international students on campus there for sports. Also, we live in the Georgia Mountains, so conservative Christian families is what the population outside the school mainly consists of."
College Sophomore,5,"I receive exactly the kind of education I came to Truett for-learning with a basis on Scripture. If you don't know anything about the Bible or Christianity before coming here, you'll be immersed in it, so get ready! Teachers are kind and usually merciful when you struggle, and are there to help you understand the material."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors Very Involved and Helpful. The classes are usually very organized, workload depends on your class.
Most professors really cared about me and would offer assistance in any area of school and even life. I was not just a number, they genuinely cared about us."
College Senior,5,Professors Are Involved – Our professors are very involved. Our professors most of the time even eat lunch with the students. They are very freindly and talk to any one. It is a small campus and all of the professors have most of the same religous beliefs as the students o it helps out to know that we can go and ask them questions and will recieve honest answers.
College Senior,5,Campus Life – Campus life is open to everyone. Each dorm makes up different teams at the very beginning of the school year. Throughout the year there will be gains and which ever team win gets prizes for the school or their team. This is used to get everyone involved and get the freshmen involved and out of their dorm rooms.
Junior,4,"I am currently transferring to TMU, but from taking Duel enrollment courses and from what I have seen and heard it is a great school! the staff is so kind and the students who I have spoken to are very welcoming!"
Niche User,4,"I absolutely love Truett McConnell.  I first discovered the college through dual enrollment online in high school.  However, from the first time I visited the campus in person, I knew I wanted to attend college there.  The campus is lovely, nestled cozily in Cleveland, Georgia.  There is a 10:1 student-teacher ratio, so the people there are very invested in one another.  I'm so glad to have been introduced to this university!"
Freshman,4,"Truett McConnnell is an amazing university. Like any establishment it has it's downfalls, and places where they can use improvement, but overall the environment is a place where you feel welcomed and loved. The professors and students go out of their way to make you feel apart of the TMU family. On the flip side because it is such a small university being a student that is not living on campus it can get pretty hard to integrate yourself into campus life. It is not impossible though, you just have to make a conscious effort to make yourself known."
Freshman,4,"Truett is an amazing college. I did my first year online and I toured the campus several times, but I knew it was the place that I wanted for me. It is an amazing school with an atmosphere that is to die for."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the class sizes that are small. The classes are not very difficult. I also enjoy that classes are not to spread apart so you do not have to get a certain parking spot or try to fight for a parking spot because most classes are walking-distance. The professors always offer a one-on-one, and it is easy to get help. The only disadvantage is the price. It is pretty pricey, so that is why I am not in their meal-plan nor a resident."
Sophomore,4,It is small so everyone knows each other and its like having a big family. The professors are super understanding and truly care about their students.
Niche User,4,"Truett McConnell University is a very good school. I enjoyed the rigorous academic courses they provide, and the workload was manageable most of the time. The professors really cared and were available for one-on-one tutoring."
College Student,4,Being a nursing major is exciting at this school. Other nursing majors become your very good friends. The classes are very interesting and have a good amount of work but when you manage your time the work is not hard to get done. The nursing curriculum gives you the opportunity to learn so many new things about the human body.
College Student,4,"Truett McConnell makes you feel like you can be yourself. Some people go to college and try to act like someone their not just to make friends The unique thing about Truett is that you can act yourself and no one judges you, they support you and are very friendly to you. People here encourage you to become closer to God which another great thing that goes on here if you are willing to give your life to God. I wouldn't want to change my choice of colleges if I had the chance because this college fits my education and christian needs I need in my life."
College Student,4,I can't wait to see what else God has for me here.
College Student,4,It's been really good so far.
College Student,4,It has worked very well for me so far.
College Student,4,Very personal and comfortable experience here.
College Student,4,I will receive a degree with a biblical foundation
College Student,4,It's great. Can't wait to see what is next.
College Student,4,I have been taking online classes through Truett and I can't wait until I can enjoy the campus life.
College Sophomore,4,The classes are smaller so it is easier to have one on one learning with the professor.
College Sophomore,4,It is a great school and the people are friendly. If you want a place to grow closer to God and form relationships with people this is the place for you. I wouldn't go back to this school just because it is too small for me. I love the atmosphere but I like bigger schools.
College Freshman,4,I only had a minor issue with transferring credits but an email quickly resolved it. My classes allow for lunch and dinner times which is convenient. If something is not working out then the professors will work with each student to fix the issue.
College Freshman,4,"My favorite thing about the education program are the Christ-centered professors and the small proportion of student to teacher. The courses are all challenging; however, the professors are available to help during convenient office hours. Most of them are friendly and approachable for questions or simply to discuss. While not all styles are conducive to learning, the majority of professors try to have a variety of methods to allow for students' optimal learning."
College Freshman,4,One aspect of Truett-McConnell that stands out the most is the community developed here. No other college will foster such a sense of Christian family and encourage you daily in Christ. I would definitely choose this school again every single time simply because it's home.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part Truett-McConnell is great. Two bad experiences are the business office and the cafe hours. The business office is my least favorite part about Truett. They are usually rude, unhelpful, and unorganized. They messed up in their books and now I have to pay an extra $100. The cafe for the most part is great, but frustratingly during finals they closed up early for supper without notice, thus causing me and my friends to have to go out to eat for supper two different times."
College Sophomore,4,This is a good school for anyone looking to further their education and learn more about our Lord.
College Sophomore,4,I have been very blessed by the scholarships I have been able to acquire. I have received more than I expected but it would still be great to be able to find some more.
College Sophomore,4,I have not yet reached the point where I have needed this resource. I have heard good things about it from other students though.
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity within the student body is pretty impressive considering the nature of the institution. Being that it is a Southern Baptist college, the majority of students are of that religion, or very close to it, and generally have the moral convictions of that view. This is not always the case, of course. There are often people of other nationalities enrolled, mostly due to the sports teams."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not going to lie about it; Truett is expensive. It would be much cheaper to go elsewhere; however, if I chose to go somewhere else, I would most likely not get the Spiritual impact I have had because of going to Truett. The college is very expensive and it is difficult to handle sometimes, especially if a student is paying their own way like I am, but I am happy with my decision to go to Truett because the Spiritual enrichment is worth it to me."
College Freshman,4,All the teachers and staff are very kind.
College Sophomore,4,"From what I have experienced these two years, the Academic staff is as flexible as they can be with you."
College Sophomore,4,"I do love the small environment, where almost everyone knows each other and you are not just a number."
College Sophomore,4,They have a very good psychology program here and I do enjoy it.
College Sophomore,4,All the professors I have had have been great and very interested in the students.
College Sophomore,4,"I've never taken any online courses, but from what I hear they can be just as helpful as classroom courses."
College Junior,4,"Everyone knows each other on the small campus.  The teachers take up time to get to know you, and even the college president interacts with us on a regular basis."
College Junior,4,The school does not have a lot of academic programs. They just have the major ones that everyone chooses. I find the instructors very helpful. They are always willing to help when needed.
College Junior,4,Truett McConnell College is a Christian Baptist College. The college has a lot of young adults who is not afraid of their faith.
College Junior,4,I enjoy going to Truett McConnell. I did a few online classes. Although my course load was very heavy I was still able to maintain my GPA. The instructors were also easy to work with.
College Sophomore,4,"We have several resources at truett for students inbetween or after classes. The gym is new, nice, and has a fairly good sized workout center for anyone who wishes to enter. The student center is a fair-sized building with computers, televisions, and a game room of which I am particularly fond. We have two campus stores, one for shirts and supplies, and another for coffee and food. The library is an awful walk up the hill, and only really necessary for writing assignments and if the printers everywhere else are broken.
The Chapel is a tiny building we use for music students, but hardly anyone ever goes to their recitals, so...yeah...
Overall, the campus looks pretty nice if a tad old."
College Sophomore,4,I think you get when you paid for. It is a private institution after all. You will get great financial aid helpers that are there to explain and help you.
College Sophomore,4,"Truett will work with you and your schedule, even with their limited classes and hours."
College Junior,2,"There is not much diversity, or respect for creative culture here. I like the niceness, but as an artist I want to surround myself with other artists."
College Freshman,2,"one word. Boring! There is like nothing to do...at all. Well, if you like just going out to eat with friends or maybe going hiking then fine, but this is no place for parties."
College Freshman,2,"The school is not a bad school at all its in a very peaceful envviorment. The main reason i dont approve of the school for my self is because they focus to much on certian students persuing particular goals and not enough on everyone else, Transfering is a hassel to do from this school and the students are very divided on the campus. Classes are great though the teachers are wondeful they really teach you always their for help or questions after class."
Freshman,1,"We have never  ever left a bad review for any  university nor business but felt we should 'speak' our feelings about this university.  First of all,  I will start with the fact, there is very little going on at the university for the students.  Mostly  the staff starting from the president down, are extremely  unprofessional including the professors.  Our daughter attended her first year at TMU, made good grades ,  and left to go to another church based University.  It was the best move we ever made as we have never seen such incompetent on behalf of a president  or staff of a university .  Our children attended private universities over the years including both my husband and me.   Aside from being incompetent,  we unfortunately  found some of the staff to be dishonest.  It is truly sad such a president can lead a university such as TMU."
Freshman,1,"Our daughter only took online starting mid March.  Online has nothing to do with this review.  Some of the professors we found to be  very unprofessional . We have never  ever left a bad review for any  university nor business but felt we should 'speak' our feelings about this university.  First of all,  I will start with the fact, there is very little going on at the university for the students."

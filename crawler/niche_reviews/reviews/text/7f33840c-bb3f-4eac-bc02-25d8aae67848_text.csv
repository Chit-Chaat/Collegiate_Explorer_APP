Graduate Student,5,"Union county college was a amazing experience  for me. While i went through many trials and struggled in classes, my teachers and advisors was always there to help me."
Junior,5,"I'm glad I'd made the choice of attending Union County College. The environment there was so welcoming during my freshmen and encourage me to participate in my classes more. The professors, while strict, also look after the well-being of their students and always reminding us of their office hours in case any of want to discuss about their grades with them. There are always events plans such as Halloween parties or galleries to lighten  up people's mood when school work is getting to them. They not only provide students with education and food, but also plenty of tutoring at the library form the ALC. I like that they allow students to help out in ALC, allowing them to help their fellow students, making it a perfect opportunity to connect more. Union County College is the perfect place if you're starting college."
Junior,5,"For my 2020 spring semester, all my classes were converted to online and now for I'm taking all online classes for my 2020 fall semester. The transfer from physical classes to online wasn't the easy one, but Union County College managed quite. It help that they already have Canvas which is where students would submit work online if their professors required them too. Despite not being able to meet my professors face to face, I still feel connected to them. The professors had adjusted quite well and office hours for their students to chat with them if their students need too. Some of the professors had even offer us to have a conference outside of class hours for students that need help with the course. The ALC is still up and running, offering up tutoring online. Union County College had adjusted greatly."
Alum,5,One of my best decisions was attending to Union County College. Going to Union County College helped my transition from high school to college. The tuition was good and having small sizes classes help to study better
Alum,5,I took some of my classes online at Union County College and there were many reasons why I took online classes. I was able to have an experience how online classes work. I had the best professor for my online classes which let me as a student have the best experience of online class.
Freshman,5,apply for ucc was not hard but the stuff was able to help me with my finical aid and help me apply to some scholarships
Sophomore,5,The thing I like the most about Union County College is the comradery the students develop when given school tasks.  The professors also play a major role in extending their help whenever needed. This is the best feature this school has to offer aside from great curriculums.  It also provides a sense of community within an academic environment.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience at Union County College was very well organized and well structured. It provided the same sense of classroom environment without the morning drive-in traffic on the way to school. The professors were just as informative and helpful throughout the whole online experience.
Sophomore,5,"I took no online classes, I have friends that told me they were pretty easy though. However the online aspect sort of took away from the actual professor to student learning experience."
Sophomore,5,"Very good, handled really well.  The online classes were very easy to access and use and the professors knew what they were doing and made the classes insightful."
Sophomore,5,Learning online was quite easy. All the assignments were left for you to complete. You can finish on your own time. Teachers are open to emailing if you have any questions.
Sophomore,5,Union County College gives you the tools necessary to succeed. This includes a tutoring center that is included in your tuition.
Sophomore,5,Union County College has prepared me to transfer to my dream school. The American Honors program has given me the resources I needed to transfer. Union County College was there to help me when I needed them and their resources are fantastic. The education and full-time professors add to the success of my journey. I would highly suggest considering Union County College because it allowed me to figure out what I wanted to do and who I am as a person.
Freshman,5,I loooooooove Union County College! They have given me the opportunity to achieve my academic goals while working with me on payment since I support myself.
Alum,5,"Union County College is an excellent place to learn. As a nursing major, I was offered support in cases of tutoring, access to library, and etc. Although I spent much time, I was able to move quickly in my program. Advisors often contacted individuals to meet up from time to time to make sure they are headed in the right direction. If there was a question with anything regarding your program, they were able to answer it and fix it within the appropriate time. Overall, a great place to learn!"
Sophomore,5,"Union county college has given me the opportunity to advance in my career. I have connected with professors that love what they do and wish to enrich the lives of their students. I have received a lot of support from my advisors, financial aid, and professors. They motivate me everyday to keep pushing for success. This led to my decision to further pursue my bachelors degree in Kean University this fall."
Alum,5,Union County College was so much more than I had expected. I had the opportunity of being in the American Honors Program and Phi Theta Kappa. The entire campus community made me feel welcomed and the staff/faculty truly were helpful throughout my time at UCC. There are so many more clubs and organizations for students to join and new ones are always encouraged too.
Sophomore,5,It has such a great diversity of students and teachers. There are so many different places to work on homework and study. They have free tutoring and it is an overall friendly environment!
Freshman,5,"The price of tuition is one of the most affordable out there, great support to the community, if you have low income and have a hard time getting food they have a program called pantry were you can go and they provide you with food so you can make it through out the day, totally free, confidential and no questions ask.UCC has many workshops from for HIV prevention, college support, financial aid, those are vents were you can learn many important things, meet new people and connect more with the community."
Sophomore,5,"The faculty and staff are very kind and helpful. The campus offers many opportunities for students on campus, and everyone is very nice and helpful when you ask them something. :)"
Freshman,5,Am a freshman at Union County College and so far I'd say it a great school that help most of students success on their careers.
Freshman,5,"I really appreciated when I went in for questions regarding classes, financial aid, and books everyone working was willing to help me. The staff are always pleasant and approachable. I have never had any bad experience at Union County College and I look forward to my learning experience there."
Freshman,5,"So far I have no complaints, all are accessible online via services provided by the school. Teachers are reasonable and classes are quite easy for the most part."
Junior,5,Union County College has a lot to offer to its students. They offer a wide variety of subjects to major in and have resources to help you succeed in your academic career.
Freshman,5,"I chose community college for the affordable cost and while cheap I got my money's worth of education. I'm not even a psychology major and it has given me a better psychology class and professor than Kean gave my boyfriend (former psychology major). While UCC offers alot of assistance beyond your tuition such as long hours of free top notch tutoring, or high quality tech such as lending out laptops I don't use those but just offering those things to students give them an A+ especially the quality I have seen from it's alc and tech. While it was a struggle to get financial aid it was very worth it and learning how to do it on my own at the age of 18. With UCC you have three separate campus around Union County and you can take classes in each of them in a semester, while I believe Cranford has a bit of a monopoly fine arts classes, it's still worth the trip."
Sophomore,5,Being a student at the college and had classes on all the campuses it is safe learning environment. staff are outstanding. many professors will assist in helping you. they are there for you the student
Sophomore,5,"The college was very diverse which I loved.thr advising team at Union County College are amazing, they care about the students and their future. Their professors however, are horrible! They don’t care about the students ..most of them set you up to fail! I had such terrible experiences with Adjunk professors at union county college! They need to hire people who cares about teaching and not just a pay check!"
Freshman,5,"Teachers were understandable and helped me thru anything. This was my first semester but it didn’t go really too great. I lost my grandmother, and my teachers sent me their condolences and helped me with missing work."
Freshman,5,"My experience at UCC so far had been excellent. The administration staff is very helpful and friendly, Professors I have taken classes with had been extremely amazing."
Sophomore,5,The class sizes aren’t that big which is perfect. Your professor knows you by name and really wants you to succeed.
Senior,5,"I started this college back in 2009. I was new to the whole college experience but counselors and other college workers made the whole experience positive. In 2018 I went back to finish my degree after taking 5 years of break. A lot of people that I knew in the past, do not work there anymore but  new counselors are very helpful as well."
Freshman,5,"Union County College is a great school. They are very supportive and for me, it is close to home. I love this school so far.."
Sophomore,5,"I aam currently having an amazing experience at ucc. The professors help out every student, as well as the student service center. Everyone at the school is very friendly, and they have your back whether they know you or not."
Sophomore,5,"Union County College is okay. Was okay to school to go to the school, and help the way of help you. That is the help to college students. The way for the way of"
Junior,5,"I really loves how they the expanded the campus, and they have a great criminal justice professor he goes by the name of Arrezi he did teach me a lot and made me want to continue my major. They also do have a lot of metting for certain majors and activity’s."
Freshman,5,the college is a great way to see what kind of things you want to do for the rest of your life. the professors and workers in the students center are really helpful
Senior,5,It’s amazing. The students are willing to help each other succeed in the classes. Some of the professors are kind and is willing to help
Freshman,5,Union County College has been a great experience during my first semester. there had been many opportunities that has been given to all types of students and UCC has much to offer to everyone of us. It is exciting to start my spring semester soon due to all the great teachers and programs that I see everyday. Everyone at UCC are friendly and helpful through studies and outside of classes.
Sophomore,5,Excellent College for those starting off and wanting to know who they want to be and what they want to study. Excellent advisors that are always willing to assist and determined professors as well.
Alum,5,Attending UCC was one of the best decisions of my life! It's a great school! Good education! Amazing staff! Definitely got my money's worth!
Sophomore,5,I love everything about this college. Its a 2-year college with a 4-year institution feel. The staff is all about the students and they do their very best to make sure we receive the best education possible.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a student at Union County College. The staff that I have encountered thus far, are very nice and respectful. I enjoy the school very much. There are a lot events that take place at the school. They really like to involve everyone. I'm glad to be part of this college."
Sophomore,5,Great. I love everything about this amazing school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sophomore,5,"So I transferred here from Kean University because Kean was getting expensive.  Anyways lots of friendly and welcoming classmates, really nice and helpful Professors.  I definitely got my money's worth!"
Senior,5,"My experience at Union County College has been a wonderful one. Although their were some ups an downs and were times when I did not agree with the professor, it all was a learning experience. I would not trade it for anything. I feel that I received a great education from the professors there. And believe that it will help me achieve my goals in the future."
Freshman,5,"Overall, Union County College is a good school. There is a good curriculum and the professors know what they are doing. I would recommend UCC to someone because they help you find your path and they are passionate about helping you succeed. Union County College cares about its students. I feel that i have learned alot studying there. It is affordable and i like that it isn't too far from home. This school has a good balance of diversity and it does not discriminate against anyone. That being said, students feel welcomed and safe. UCC also has a variety of clubs and organizations for its students to join. If you want a good college experience, then UCC is for you."
Freshman,5,"Although is a two year college it is very nice. They make sure that students receive the best resources they can get and they make their students the priority. They always have a tutoring center, ALC, that is filled with really smart people to help you with difficulties in different courses."
Junior,5,I haven't been eligible for any scholarships .. I've logged on several times and I'm always redirected to some other page
Sophomore,5,It's a great community college so far I've had a great experience. The professors are great and the nursing program it's outstanding . Right now I don't think anything needs to change.
College Senior,5,"I feel as though through my two first semesters at union county college, I have gotten lucky and have had the opportunity to have great professors. Professors that are willing to help me with anything. Professors that thoroughly explain things and have no problem having office hours that fit my needs as well."
College Senior,5,"small community of students for architecture, very close knot and friendlt and all very supportive of each other"
College Junior,5,"My experience at my school has been pretty great. I cannot complain. My classes are set around my schedule, I have the ability to balance work, school, and loved ones. Sometimes there are hassles with studying, financial problems, and personal issues but there are people to help in ever aspect that you need help, advice, or just a shoulder to cry on."
College Senior,5,wonderful people here at union county college willing to help everyone.
College Junior,5,the advisor have been very helpful
College Senior,5,"Union County College is amazing, because it's extremely affordable. Financial aid is easily available, a majority of the professors at Ucc are very caring and truly help their students succeed for the future. Extremely friendly atmosphere with friendly staff, and students. Campus is very average size. Only downfall is that parking is horrible, absolutely horrible. Also, the network is terrible. It is hard getting any connection anywhere on the campus. Overall, excellent community college with plenty of programs, clubs, and other extra curricular activities."
College Senior,5,"The school and the professors are great. Whenever I need help, they are there for me."
College Senior,5,My degree will be very valuable. This field that i will be going into is very in demand and will be for a very long time. I have many options of what exactly in the field i want to do. NURSING is the best and most versatile job field. ;)
College Junior,5,They are very organized and they keep you posted.
College Junior,5,Able to meet a lot of new people.
College Junior,5,Very excited about online classes. I am self motivated and it gives me the opportunity to spend time with my children.
Freshman,4,"I love how Union County College is in my hometown, in other words, a great college is in my hometown. It is a great investment for my future and they let me know how far my future could go after I graduate."
Graduate Student,4,I must say online classes at union county college was not that bad but it is a struggle if you are use to hands on learning.
Alum,4,Definetely a very comfortable college. Not too big or too small. Classes are just the right size. They always have something going on and they do club fairs to get students involved in clubs or activities. Beautiful environment. My professors were very knowledgeable and kept the class interesting.
Alum,4,Only had two online classes because unfortunately they were not available on-campus. I don't like taking online classes but there was no bad experiences when I had to. It was easy to manage my work and navigate the website. Professors were quick to reply to any concerns I had. Online class experience was great for me
Senior,4,Some professors engaged in every session and had extra accomodating work hours to cope with the online workload. Others mainly assigned work and did not have video sessions but were available when emailed.
Senior,4,The campus is very convenient and has great opportunities to study and collaborate with others with lots of study and extra help options. Overall professors are engaging and caring.
Freshman,4,I was a student when COVID 19 hit.  We immediately transferred all our in person classes online which was a challenging transition.  It was difficult but my teachers all did such a wonderful job and went above and beyond to make sure that they worked with us and we got what we needed.  Was very happy with my experience.
Freshman,4,I think this is a fantastic option for students interested in getting a Nursing Degree.  Their RN associates program is quick in time nature but very challenging to where you feel like you are being thoroughly prepared for your future.
Sophomore,4,"* Great Professors 
* Helpful Environment 
* Interesting Events 
* Great scenery 
My changes for Union County College would be:
* Prices of food"
Sophomore,4,"My experience with online classes were confusing at first as there are different applications needed to finish assignments but overall a very good way to earn credits 

The Professors are helpful and are easy to access when needed of assistance

Challenging but helpful classes and also a good environment"
Sophomore,4,"I have attended this school for 3 semesters and each semester has taught me something different. My first semester taught me balance. I learned how to balance school life with work and my social life. My second semester taught me how to study. My third semester taught me to not let your professor determine how much effort you put towards learning a subject. The school itself is a very simple and welcoming school. The workers are nice, the students are pretty cool, and the classes don't give you so much work to the point where you can't do anything but study all day. The cafeteria is well maintained and not dirty at all. The library is never empty and the computers all work. One of the best features of the college is that they offer free tutoring at the library for anyone who is struggling or needs help with a course. Over all it has been a successful 3 semesters for me."
Freshman,4,"Covid-19 caused an unrepresented change. However, the teachers were quick to learn the online ways of teaching."
Freshman,4,Nice and very relaxing environment . Very diverse as well which adds different kinds of culture to the school life. The teachers are also excellent.
Junior,4,"Not a dull moment,  I am usually in and out due to work and my children's schooling. I would recommend the school to anyone."
Sophomore,4,A lot of online classes. Classes done on campus provided a good mix of student life as well as providing a good education.
Sophomore,4,"It was a great experience, schedules were very flexible and i was able to make a lot more friends and the one main thing that the colleges should change is when people are helping with their students like financial aid, creating their schedule etc. they should be more organized and more clear on what they are trying to explain"
Graduate Student,4,"Union County College exceeded my expectations in a way I would have never expected. The experience over all was great because it allows students to transition slowly into the ""college life"" which can most times be over whelming.  It is not small  where people feel crowded, but it is also not big to the point where  you get lost. I have visited four year schools before and noticed quite often that the amount of students surpass the amount  of  personel working. However, in Union County College I always felt safe because both educators and security were always around. There was always  communication going on in the commons where students got together, and there still is via  online because  of the  great staff working to keep their students connected. One downside however are the advisors. While some are amazing, others will make you feel like you failed before you even  get the chance to do so. It is important to know the difference between being realistic and being pessimist."
Sophomore,4,"I love taking classes here. It is close to where I live, so it is easy to get to. I love the majority of my professors and they are clearly intelligent individuals who care about their students and the subjects they teach. We are currently taking online classes, but if we were back on campus the only negative thing I have to say is about the parking. If you want a good spot, you need to get there early. Parking is very limited on campus."
Freshman,4,For a community college this one has a surprising amount of students and programs. The professors are very helpful and want to see you succeed. There is a big diversity of students here as well.
Graduate Student,4,"Good and affordable.
Union County College has 3 locations, which I only know 2. which are the Cranford and Elizabeth campus, they are small but well equipped. the professor are very friendly and approachable. They have many activities throughout the semester. The campus food is really good!!!"
Sophomore,4,"Hi my name is Divine, i like the fact that the school professors and environments are friendly. Majority of students relate very well with their professors. The school administration prioritize student learning they equally offer free tutoring."
Sophomore,4,It is a great school to get an education. The professor’s really care about the students. The nursing program the professor’s/director should become more invested in the students and the school would be perfect. The students fee they are only interested in the money they bring in and the bottom line not the students. That should change.
Niche User,4,"From the moment I walked into the school I had a great experience. I was greeted by friendly staff at the welcome center where I went to meet with an advisor. The advisor I spoke with help me gain a better understanding of how I would go about completing certain requirements. After I registered I felt a great relief being lifted off of my shoulders. Weeks later, once I had started class I realized that parking was a bit of an issue. But that aside I couldn't complain because I had great professors. My professors truly cared about what they taught and the students interest in the subject."
Freshman,4,"Union County College offers many certificate programs that other community colleges do not offer. I am in the physical therapist assistant program and it is very challenging, which I enjoy, but also very welcoming. I have a great relationship with all of my teachers and classmates. The financial aid department is also very involved when it comes to keeping you on track during the semester."
Alum,4,I like how involved the professors were and their connectedness to the students. UCC is also very diverse.
Sophomore,4,Union County College is comfortable to say the very least. It has groomed me to began my college experience at a university but it has also left me missing much more. The student life here is non existent. Sure there are many clubs but none are particularly active or intriguing. It has somewhat of a reminiscent high school feel because of the fact that its's so quaint and you see familiar faces. If given the choice again I'd come here because the faculty is exceptional. I've learned so much and had a better learning experience due to the small class sizes.
Freshman,4,What I like about Union County College is that there are so many different opportunities and the staff that is there is very helpful.
Freshman,4,I am currently a student on the Elizabeth campus and I overall like the environment. The setting is calm and I enjoy seeing the diversity on a day to day basis. Professors are helpful and really want their students to achieve. There are many great opportunities at the college and tons of events that'll push you closer to success.
Sophomore,4,"Staff are pretty attentive and helpful, the college provide free tutoring which is amazing! Especially when your in a rather difficult major eg. nursing the free Tutoring comes in pretty handy. Also the financial aid office will go above and beyond in order to figure ways to pay for classes."
Alum,4,"Union County College, like many places, is what you make of it. Despite the negative connotations it faces as a 2 year school, the opportunities for growth, excellence, and connections are boundless. Whether it be through Phi Theta Kappa, our honor society, tutoring at the Academic Learning Center, or engaging in the plethora of clubs and on-campus activities offered, UCC allows anyone searching for community and opportunity to find it. 

It took me two semesters to realize this, and yet during my last year, I was still able to make lifelong friendships and find unique career opportunities through my professors, mentors, peers, and anyone else who was willing to help.

UCC is a great school, and the only complaint I truly have is the miscommunication about financial aid, and the mediocre food. Otherwise, attending this college is a great way to learn about what you want to do in life, and to find a community that truly supports, inspires, and pushes you to be your best self."
Freshman,4,So far my experience has been great. It's only my second week but the I feel very comfortable and I think my experience at Union County will be a great one.
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far in Union County College was great. I met people who had the same goals as I did, and who encouraged me to do better in my studies. I also met great professors who helped me academically. If it wasn't for these professors and the Academic Learning Center, I would not have been able to be the good student I am today. If there is anything that could be changed, I'd say better parking, but otherwise the school itself is a great school, especially for those who want to start off at a community college."
Freshman,4,i like Union County College because every member is committed to help the student to succeed. I always have no problem in finding people willing to help me. They are up to date with technology which makes college experience fun. They also provide with different classes to accommodate my busy schedule and also offer online courses which i am pretty sure it helps not only me but several other students across campus.
Sophomore,4,Union County College is an amazing college. It contains many things for students. Students have the opportunity to get tutored in the academic learning center. I love being part of many clubs and having leadership opportunities. I am grateful for many things. I am the president of the Model UN club and history club. I got invited to the United Nations and I met ambassadors from different countries. It was a rewarding experience and I love meeting new people and connecting with others. I am part of the EOF program and I love my advisor Jennifer Pena she is the best. I am in two honor societies and I feel like I keep learning experiences and being the best I can be everyday.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the accessibility that Union County College provides, the affordable price. Additionally, I benefit from the Academic Learning center, which is free , and provide comprehensive tutoring services."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed attended Union County College. The professors I had were amazing and really cared about their students. The only thing is the parking sucks
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the instructors at this school. They want the best, and are willing to help. The Academic Learning Center has amazing tutors who are patient and explain carefully how problems are solved."
Sophomore,4,The professors always have office hours and are flexible. Also the work laid is usually pretty light. They are very understanding when it comes to family emergencies of jobs. The bookstore and the cafeteria are overpriced.
Freshman,4,"Most of the faculty and staffs are amazing. They tend to communicate a lot with the students and put a lot of effort into making the school great and better. Academically, the school has a great transfer program. There are many clubs that you can get involved in. All of my professors were great, they always try to communicate with the students and help their students at all times."
Freshman,4,I like how concerned professors are regarding and their student and how they encourage you and always willing to help students in need.
Freshman,4,"The school is fairly inexpensive, especially with scholarships. The facilities are generally good. Some good teachers, some bad teachers."
Sophomore,4,"Ucc offers free tutoring in all subjects. So if I am struggling in a particular class, I can go to the ALC and get help. All of the tutors are students, so they know exactly what's it like to not understand particular topics. They are always looking to hire new tutors, so this is a great way to make easy money. The library rents out textbooks for 2 hours, so you don't necessarily have to waste your money buying textbooks. You can also print out an unlimited amount of papers and rent laptops in the library. There is only 3 main buildings, so it's not hard to find your way around campus. The only con that I can think of is that even though there are many classes available at many different times, there aren't many professors to choose from. So if you don't like a particular professor, you might need to take a very early or late class just so that you won't have to have that professor. With all that being said, if Ucc seems very appealing to you than you should definitely attend!"
Sophomore,4,"I attended Union County College for 4 years, that was longer than I planned. I took a year off and resumed again. It was a good school, great teachers and developed great friendships there. Financial Aid was a hassle but things have gotten better and the construction is looking great! I like how they expanded and it became more diverse."
Sophomore,4,"Union county was a great experience for me! The campus wasn't too big for a community college and it was a lot more affordable that all these universities. It was pretty much diverse and the staff and faculty are very nice. From the athletic department to the financial office they are all very loving people who really are helpful and always looking for the students best interest. The advisors try their best to ensure to keep the students on track and get them out as soon as possible to continue their academic careers. One this I would say I personally felt like the food was a bit pricey, going to school everyday made if very hard to purchase a meal at school because how much I would spend on a weekly base so I would always bring food from home! Other than that I would say it's a great school with caring professors and staff and would encourage any student who lives in the county and didn't have the money for a 4 year to start off with the OWLS!!"
Freshman,4,I think that Union County College has a beautiful small campus. It wasn't very hard to get used to the area. It is a safe are being that it is near a residential area and a park across the street makes it a place that has people around at all times of the day.
Freshman,4,"It's alright for a community college. Some corners are cut due to budgets, I suppose. The parking situation could use some work."
Sophomore,4,"Union county college is a great way to meet new people, to network and to actually figure out what it is that you want to do with you major. There is a handful of professors that really do want you to do great in college an de push you forward. It would be great to see ALL the professor have the same energy and enthusiasm."
Sophomore,4,"Union County College is a great community college. I had some great courses and professors there. Of course, some classes were average, but others were astonishing!"
College Junior,4,UCC has offered great class times so that I may fulfill both my academic and family needs.
College Senior,4,I've only taken one course so far but it's been pretty good so far
College Senior,4,"Teachers are pretty good honestly, I only had one teacher that wasn't great"
College Senior,4,"I am currently a liberal studies major, the reason why I declared that major was due to the fact I honestly have no clue what career I wait to pursue yet when I am done with college. What is so unique about this major is the fact that one can take many electives to help them figure out what career they might want to pursue after college."
College Sophomore,4,"The whole system that UCC works on is pretty convenient. The classes fill up quick but if you do them sooner than later, you get to have a schedule that works around you job or activities outside of school. I was able to commit to only 2 days of school and I was able to work all the other days so it was not too bad. Most professors also respond to their email and the ones that don't are always willing to hear you out during class. The convinence of the scheduling helped me a lot with work and my time out."
College Junior,4,"My major is very hard, a lot of science, maths and science! So far, so good. There are some research jobs available that are great for getting experience."
College Junior,4,The professors are great. They really care about their students and motivate us a lot. They offer a lot of tutoring for the students.
College Freshman,4,Depending on the professors and courses you have you're experience might vary. For the most part i really enjoyed the professors I've had as of yet. There was one professor who i had issues understanding at first but once i understood his way of speaking the class was easier for me.
College Freshman,4,"Overall the school is good, for it being a community school and all."
College Junior,4,Online courses are best for people who have to go to school at home. I have not taken any online courses.
College Junior,4,"This campus has countless opportunities. They vary from internships, connecting with other schools, and career opportunities on campus also. It isn't hard, and you have the right people helping all throughout your activities."
College Junior,4,"I am a liberal arts major because to transfer to one of my preferred schools, it is the best bet so all of my credits will transfer and there will be no mishaps. Its a set plan and because of my advisor it has been amazing. I meet with her weekly and also do tutoring weekly."
Sophomore,2,"The school has some issues to work on. The parking is terrible and the parking reinforcement loves giving out tickets knowing students have issues finding parking in the first place. The college could also work on their wifi services as some of the buildings have minimal to zero internet connection. The advising is little to no help. It is really hard to navigate through their suggested major curriculum, which gives conflicting information on classes on their website and canvas. It is safe to say I will be transferring the upcoming semester. It is a community college after all."
College Junior,2,There aren't a lot of helpful alumni.
College Freshman,2,it depends on the person but i'm a more interactive kind of person so online classes aren't for me.
College Senior,2,"the amount of classes available is low and frustratingly difficult to schedule around. there is basically one main campus, so if you plan to travel to one of the other campuses you will be stuck driving ridiculous amounts"
College Senior,2,Hate it very indifferent and you dont learn anything!
College Senior,2,They really need to work on post graduate opportunties.
College Junior,2,"Honestly, College has not been the best experience"
College Senior,2,I am not a fan of online classes because sometimes it can be hard to keep up with assignments. When you attend classes you get reminders of when assignments are due but in an online class you have to keep up with what is posted. I prefer physically going into the classroom compared to the online class. In online classes you have to basically teach yourself.
College Junior,2,No place to do this on the Plainfield campus
College Junior,2,"No real student activities

 Horrible parking

Some teachers after willing to help"
College Senior,2,I am not familiar with the post grad services of the school. I feel that there should be more ways to communicate with people at the higher institutions.
College Freshman,2,there's not enough computers and the network is really slow
Recent Alumnus,2,"Haven't received financial aid yet and the individuals who work in the financial aid office aren't always the nicest people. I have to constantly check online for financial aid in order to expedite the process. Ended up paying for school out of pocket, books, supplies, and etc. I am currently unemployed and have any more financial means to cover upcoming expenses."
College Freshman,2,It's complicated. You have to go back and forth to different offices for minor problems. The lines are always long.
College Senior,2,"I notice more people goofing off and not taking things seriously at my school.  MOST of the professors are great; a few do not belong teaching anymore, especially at the college level.  Overall, it's mediocre community college, that I attended so I could gain an associates degree at a more affordable price."
Recent Alumnus,2,I dont really know it that much cause im still getting use  to UCC but i feel its decent.
Recent Alumnus,2,This school is pretty much like every community college around. There's nothing special about it except it is very affordable.
College Junior,2,"The class curriculum was clear and efficient , he printed out everything and let us know everything ahead of time. Some things were too related in Math but the frustration is the fact that you cannot do a semester until you pay your fee! That's frustrating because now I feel as if I being held back when I can start in January!"
College Junior,2,"The Academics at the school was highly favored. There was always a lot going on and games almost every week! They would post the outcomes on the school website every single time to keep us updated. The class registration process was a little frustrating because it took a whole process, they told us what to do but , it was not as easy. For example, financial aid was a whole process and I still have not received anything although all three of my sisters including myself are going to school this year. So i owe money i have to pay myself for Fall!"
College Senior,2,My initial impression of the school was '13th grade'. It kind of seemed to just carry over from high school. The majority of the students seem to still live with their parents and aren't exactly the smartest group of kids.
Senior,1,"You can't get a start answer from anyone. I got 5 different answer from 5 different people. Also, accusers advisors do not help."
College Junior,1,"No student center. Over crowded loud library used for study groups,."
College Freshman,1,The computer system is really slow. It's hard to get tasks done when you have free time in between classes because you're waiting for the computers to load.
College Sophomore,1,at night time there are many people who dont care just are late. there are also the few who wants to learn and focus on their future.
College Senior,1,"The education I'm getting doesn't seem to be worth what I'm paying. I mostly feel like I'm paying to get a piece of paper that will get my foot in the door as opposed to getting knowledge that will help me spur my career. It's difficult at times to get financial aid from the university itself, despite having one of the highest GPAs at the school. The time schedules for registration and payment seems to be at random as opposed to being based on when classes will actually start. You also end up paying high-end fees for things that don't seem to actually affect or apply to you. For instance you could be paying a $100 'media' fee while being an arts major that never uses a computer on campus. A common problem is paying $65 for a parking pass and then having to park off campus because there is insufficient parking available, etc."
College Junior,1,this year was the baddes for me thay have a financial aid date line i went to school and ask them if my paper work was in order and they toll me yes don't worry when i come back from my vacation all my credit were drop and they say that i need to bring more paperwork for the financial aid. when i finalice the paoer work that state grant me money for the semester the school cut me half of that money because they said i wasnt full time. i couldnt be full time becuase they drop all my classes and when i wanted to registred again all the classe were close .is has benn a nightmare none care and none know how to make it better for the student
College Sophomore,1,"The County College All Around – I feel like they really don't help you and when you need help its like your waiting for hours to be told to come back tomorrow, when it comes to transferring its even more of a headache there more about taking your money and not helping to to further there education."
College Sophomore,1,Facilities Are Bad – The facilities are what you would expect from a Community college. They were pretty bad and wasn't kept in a good manner
College Freshman,1,"Its Okay. its not much to do. people are not really friendly. teachers are cool. its pretty much feels like high school all over again, but a little worst."

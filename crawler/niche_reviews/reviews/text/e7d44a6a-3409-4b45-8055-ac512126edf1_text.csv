Senior,5,"My online experience with Rowan University has been great. I have done several classes online prior to COVID, so I know a great deal about how online classes work. Teachers have been extremely attentive to answering emails and zoom calls. After sending an email, I usually receive a response within 24 hours. I think the teachers are definitely doing their best to make this semester go smoothly for everyone."
Sophomore,5,rowan is a great school. i love everything about it. its  very good. they make you fell very at home.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience is a great experience. It is a very good experience its not hard at all and very interactive.
Freshman,5,I haven't had the chance to take online courses but I know fellow students who have. These students have explained to me hat the online courses are great for those who are looking to graduate faster.
Freshman,5,it is a very great school with a great campus and excellent staff. The campus is big enough to where you feel that you're at a huge school but the classes are small enough to where you can really get the attention you need form each teacher.
Alum,5,"Rowan has been convenient, cheap, easy, and attainable! I loved every second at Rowan and im sure ill love it even more the second time."
Alum,5,My online experience with rowan has been super easy and i love the CANVAS program that is used to do work and keep track of all assignments!
Alum,5,Rowan University is a diverse college that gave me many opportunities. I had a lot of positive experiences and learned a lot during my time there. The professors made attending classes enjoyable while also teaching us everything we needed to know to feel comfortable in our fields.
Alum,5,I had a positive experience with online learning at Rowan University. The teachers were always willing to offer more time to help and go over any topics I needed clarification on.
Freshman,5,Rowan University is a great school to attend and they have great advisors and mentors. There’s lots of different courses to take and the advisors are within your major so there’s always someone to help you with anything. Students and staff are friendly. All around great school.
Senior,5,Rowan was very adaptive to remote learning. The professors were extremely understanding and helpful if there were issues or complaints.
Senior,5,"As being a transfer from another university, Rowan has made the transfer worth it. The educators, staff, and students are reliable and extremely intelligent."
Senior,5,The online experience was good. I liked how we can communicate with our professors better. I also liked how the professor understood our situations and worked with us.
Junior,5,"Online learning is never going to be as good as in-class learning, but I think many professors do the best they can with what they can."
Sophomore,5,"During the coronavirus hiatus, the university shifted all classes online. Despite this, I felt that the transition was seamless and my teachers were doing the best job that they could. As a matter of fact, during this period, my professors were even more open to communication at more points throughout the day. The course material was well-organized using different online platforms, and my professors taught as they would in-person, to make the setting as comfortable as possible. The university maintained a professional manner in making constant addresses and updates (via email), to students and faculty,  as the semester progressed, and they continue to."
Junior,5,"My professors were very understanding and kind due to the COVID outbreak. Despite the fast changes, they were able to hold class over Zoom, WebEx, or Google Meet. I enjoyed all platforms. My professors were able to assist and still help us in any way, and I liked that they were here for us even from a social distancing format."
Junior,5,"Going to a comfortable-sized school gave me endless possibilities. I was able to go to class, and actually have the professor get to know me! I enjoyed getting to talk with my classmates and be in environment where we all could help each other learn. I was able to start a Pre PA organization, and be apart of confounding SASA eboard. At a bigger school, I don't think I would've had the same experience I had so far. I've met so many amazing people and wouldn't want to spend my 4 years anywhere else!"
Junior,5,"Rowan has small class size so I can have a more interactive classroom and learning experience. Rowan fosters a culture of growth, diversity and inclusion. I have met so many amazing people and have enhanced my learning experience because of the amazing and welcoming staff."
Junior,5,Rowan has a great online platform. It is easy to see your assignment and contacts your classmates and teachers. It gives you ways to be more organized and ways to have time management. Great experience.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely loved my online classes the past two semesters I have been at Rowan. I took around 4 or 5 online classes and I had great experiences in all of them. I liked my own time during each week to do my assignments and quizzes. I also like the discussion question basis of online courses. I do have a lot of anxiety when it comes to talking in class so having online classes and feeling like I can properly be apart of the class discussions is a great thing for me. Most, if not all, of my professors used Youtube clips, outside websites and other online learning tools to help enhance our learning and knowledge around the subject areas. I mostly loved to work with the interactive learning tools in my classes and it always helped me learn quicker and more efficiently than reading off a textbook, PowerPoint presentation or listening to an in-class lecture. I know for sure I will be continuing to take online classes throughout my time at college and I love how they were taught at Rowan."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Rowan from Temple and I’m not going to lie I was a little nervous. Overall, Rowan was very welcoming and I had no problem adjusting there. I was able to become very active on campus and in just the short time I’ve been there I’ve made memories and friends that will last a lifetime. I love Rowan University, go Profs!"
Sophomore,5,"My Freshman year has been a very memorable one in which I will cherish forever. The openness and community that is formed throughout the campus is astonishing and I felt right at home the moment I got there. The transition to college was hard for me, however, being on campus I learned quickly what was expected of me, and with paying for college without the help of my parents, I learned to stay focused and there are so many opportunities available to do that. The library at Rowan was where I spent a lot of and the resources available are incredible. I joined a sorority, which was something I never would have thought I would do, and I established a good foundation for myself within my first year. I can't wait for more to come and to see what I can accomplish."
Alum,5,Rowan felt like family. It was close to home and a very welcoming environment. My favorite part about attending Rowan University was meeting all of the great professors that I still keep in touch with to this day. In fact I just reached out to one of my favorite professors today for a letter of recommendation. Overall I had a great experience.
Junior,5,"Rowan has a great education program. If you ever want to be a teacher, greatly consider Rowan! Teachers are amazing at preparing you for you field and clinical practice. Along with preparing you for your praxis exam!"
Niche User,5,I will be transferring to Rowan in the fall the location is nice and so far the advisors are attentive the campus is beautiful too
Junior,5,"I'm a junior transfer student at Rowan University and so far my experience has been great. The transferring process was very easy, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the classes are very well structured."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I have had a great time at Rowan University because of its great academics, large community, and small scale campus. Academically, I find myself with excellent teachers and a very thought out curriculum that takes me out of my comfort zone without making me struggle or feel lost. No teacher seemed to fail my expectations or ignore me when I needed help the most. The university also helped me with my learning disabilities and made sure I was well compensated for the year. It has really helped me when I needed the extra support or time. I really enjoy the small campus and the town of Glassboro. One thing that Rowan University needs to fix are the mental health institutions. While I do not feel that I need them, there have been incidents where it was needed at the start and I hope the change comes soon. Overall, I recommend the University for its education system, people, community, and its open and brimming campus."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Rowan University. I absolutely love the campus, it is not to big or not to small! Rowan Boulevard has so many small shops and food places to offer for visitors. It is the perfect distance from my home town, not too far but defiantly not too close. The food on campus is not the best. There are two choices The Holly Pointe Commons dining hall or the market place. Jersey Mikes in the bottom of the student center is my fav! Make sure to check rate my professor before choosing your professors, it will be important for your grades."
Junior,5,Rowan University is an excellent University. I am currently in my Junior year pursuing my Civil Engineering degree. The program is great and the staff is beyond helpful.
Freshman,5,"I love Rowan University, the atmosphere is just like home for me personally. Transitioning to Rowan University was a piece of cake, making friends was easy because almost everyone attending is from the same state.  Each person at this school is very chill and focused on the same thing, doing well in school and making great memories.  Luckily being apart of a student body mostly from New Jersey when going home you are never away from your friends from school. You can always find a fellow prof anywhere you go. This school offers an extreme number of classes for all different majors, with a numerous amount of colleges within the University. The university also offers a crazy amount of clubs, sports (both club and Division III), and greek life organizations. These opportunities allow students to both get involved and build great friendships. Going to Rowan University is the best decision anyone can make, a great campus, interesting students, and amazing education."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the people I have met so far, and all of the professors are so kind and willing to provide any help that a student needs. The housing and financial aid offices are also efficient and fast with making necessary changes! I also recently changed my major, and the University and my advisor made the process smooth and quick, with a simple email and confirmation response from the University."
Senior,5,"Rowan has provided me with a successful four years. As my undergrad is coming to an end, I definitely see myself continuing at Rowan for my master's degree. The professors have been supportive and my advisor was absolutely amazing. I have taken more than expected courses in a semester and she was nothing but supportive. The only change that I would like to see is taking away unnecessary classes for Education majors for it is now almost a five-year program."
Senior,5,"I am currently attending Rowan University as a Senior in the 3+1 Program from RCBC in Burlington County. What I love about this is that it creates an opportunity for those who may not have had a thought of furthering their education past an Associate's degree, but now they can for a cheaper cost. Also, my academic advisor is amazing and extremely helpful in every single way."
Junior,5,I transferred here after obtaining my Associates Degree at a Community College. I couldn't be happier. The environment is so warm and welcoming. I take pride in my education.
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman and I am very enthusiastic about attending. The learning environment present, and the staff seem so nice and dedicated. I am in love with the school."
Sophomore,5,Best college! I am so happy I decided to attend Rowan University. I visited other colleges such as Rutgers and West Chester and fell in love with Rowan. Truly feels like home and is growing larger each year.
Freshman,5,"I am only beginning my freshman year at Rowan, but so far I love it. The University seems to be filled with options and tools to make my experience both fun and valuable. The academic options were exactly what I wanted, which was a fear I had since my choice of major is rather a niche one. And in regards to clubs, they have more then I could have imagined. They also seem to offer tools that will allow me to succeed in my life moving forward past my stay at University. I couldn't be happier with my choice to attend Rowan."
Junior,5,Rowan University is a friendly environment and they care about the students that attend their University.
Freshman,5,"Love the professors and small campus. Everyone knows everyone, which is more family oriented.  Lots to eat around the local area.  Lots of housing in the neighborhood.    Parking spaces could be better :-)"
Graduate Student,5,Rowan is an amazing university. It has expanded to include many different career areas. Rowan's education program is amazing in that they place you in school districts with your classes to allow you on-site experience to see if you wan to pursue that career path. All of the professors are trained in the field they are teaching and are willing to take the time to help you achieve your goals.
Sophomore,5,So far it’s been great. It’s a different experience from community college and everyone is friendly.
Freshman,5,Im going to be a freshman this fall and I cant wait! I had a blast at orientation and the campus was beautiful. I have never encountered more friendly staff.
Sophomore,5,"I love Rowan University and I am looking forward to moving on campus in August. The atmosphere, campus, and people are all so amazing. I've had great professors and have had a great experience so far."
Freshman,5,"Fall 2019 start, I have not been to school yet.  But everything seems very positive.  Campus seems nice.  seem to have a lot of weekend activities.  Food seems good with many choices."
Junior,5,"I will be a Transfer student this fall at Rowan University. I recently graduated from Rowan College at Gloucester County during May 2019. With an associates degree in Health Science. I look forward in transferred to Rowan University to further my career in  Psychology. I’ve heard a lot of great things about this University as far as the professors caring about their students, great living  environment, a rec center for students ,and even good cafe food. Those all seem to interest me and is the reason why I chose to go to Rowan University this fall to purse my career. I am thrilled to see what the future has in place."
Senior,5,I loved my experience at Rowan University. I have had great mentorship in my major that is preparing me for life beyond Rowan. The people that I have met at Rowan are great and so helpful! Rowan is undergoing a lot of changes for the better with the campus and surrounding area. I cannot wait to see what Rowan becomes after I have graduated.
Niche User,5,Rowan is the fastest growing university in NJ and #6 in the nation for a good reason. The university and the town of Glassboro are always evolving for the better. The entire area is devoted to Rowan and is college friendly. The athletics are a powerhouse. You get a private school class size for public school costs. Rowan is by far the best value university in NJ.
Junior,5,Rowan university is one of the best colleges that I have been too. the professors are very helpful and friendly. the workload is not all that bad. the college is somewhat affordable.
Freshman,5,Love the campus! So glad I decided to come here. Studying computer science and the program is challenging but worth it. The community of the school really is great.
Freshman,5,"So far I have only attended Rowan for one semester, but I am already in love! The atmosphere here is great, the professors are amazing, and the clubs/ organizations on campus are approachable. I am so glad I made the decision to come here as it already feels like home and I would not want to be attending anywhere else. I feel there is great opportunity here and wonderful resources for anyone looking to prepare and better their future."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Rowan this year and I love every bit of it. The dorms are mostly very nice compared to other schools, and it isn't hard to get a single/apartment after freshmen year. Some freshmen dorms are a little rough but word is they're tearing down older dorms for new ones. The food is eh, but once you get an apartment its not a big deal at all because you can cook.  Glassboro itself isn't dangerous but isn't the best.
       Rowan has sort of been starting a reputation of a party school, mainly because it is very easy to go out wed-sat nights, more if you're in a sorority or fraternity. A lot of partying. Without a doubt #2 in jersey next to Rugters.  I have also yet to have a professor I have not enjoyed.The school is rapidly growing and expanding and probably will become a bigger well known name in the next 10 years. Definitely recommend Rowan, you will not regret it."
Freshman,5,"Very nice campus, nice professors, I feel my education is the best it's ever been while attending here. They have great programs, its an overall fantastic state school. I would not change a thing about it."
Freshman,5,"All the professors and staff are very supportive and they want you to succeed. You have to put in the work to get a great outcome. The staff are very kind, understanding, and generous."
Sophomore,5,"I don't think I can boast my love for Rowan University enough. I have been able to find a new home here, and my career so far here has been excellent. I have made great friends, had fantastic teachers, and been given so many opportunities to grow as not only a professional but as a person as well. The campus is gorgeous and always being kept up with, the faculty and staff are always there to assist you, and there are so many great resources and programs to help make your college experience the best that it can be. Seriously, the only drawback to Rowan is the parking- there is a limited amount of it, but you truly don't even need one. There are so many things to do on campus to keep you busy and having fun, you really won't miss the car."
Niche User,5,"Thinking about starting college soon can be a difficult process. For me, when I would think about my transition, I would get nervous and anxious about going to a new place. Recently, I visited Rowan for a sports medicine class I am enrolled in through Delsea. Our visit was to shadow the athletic training program. All staff members of this department were very welcoming and made the environment of the college seem comfortable and open. The classes that we were able to visit were filled with  welcoming students. This was overall a great experience for me because I was able to see the college life through the day as well as work hands on in some of the classes. This trip made me feel much better about a transition to college in general and I am very well considering attending Rowan after this experience."
Sophomore,5,"Rowan University is an amazing school. It has all you ever need in an university; sports, inclusivity, friendliness, greek life, everything! I love Rowan because its the RU of South Jersey, it's not too big and it's also not too small."
Junior,5,"rowan university is one of the most diverse university city where I get to see students from all over the country with different ethnicity. Rowan University has so many interactive activities to engage students. Recently, Rowan University was recognized in the top 10 engineering program. my most favorite thing about Rowan University is the resources that are open to all the students all day long such as the library, professor, writing center and the advisors. Rowan University could give their students more opportunity to get hands-on training on campus so that students don't have to go out of campus to get experience in their desired major."
Sophomore,5,"The school campus is the perfect size, I feel at home. You really get to connect with your professors one on one."
Junior,5,"I love the rural area and the people at Rowan. It is different from my usual busy urban lifestyle, it is refreshing. The classes are challenging and it's reputation is steadily increasing. Rowan reminds me of my high school so essentially it is home away from home."
Senior,4,"My overall experience with Rowan I would rate four stars out of five. I would say that in all four years attending this school, my teachers have been excellent. They are not only attentive to all of a student's needs, but they are pleasant to be around every single day. Not only are they great at teaching and helping students, but they all are super personable. When it comes to how the school is kept, everything is always clean. I feel very safe at this school and all of my friends would agree with me. I think the party scene is great at this school, even though I choose not to be a part of it. There are always frat parties and Landmark is the place to be on a weekend. The dorms are very small but doable  for the price. I would say the student life is not that great. In every class I have ever attended, students do the bare minimum to participate and/or interact with each other.  I wish people were more friendly here."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed my experience at Rowan so far.  I came in as a transfer student and Rowan has been a big adjustment but a good one.  The professors are nice and very helpful when you need it.
Senior,4,I have taken online classes especially with COVID-19.  The online classes are easily accessible.  The accommodation is a lot easier especially when working full time.
Freshman,4,"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, classes were moved online. The transition was difficult for everyone at first but it eventually moved along smoothly. Professors were very understanding and classes were easy to follow along with."
Senior,4,It is a really good school academically. I like that we have a lot of resources. I like the clubs and all the activities that they have for us.
Junior,4,"The student to teacher ratio is nice, there are plenty of fun labs, and the counselors try to set you up for success. However, the ""guidance counselors"" (I believe that that is what they are called) are terrible. They are terribly understaffed and it can take months, if not years, to make it to them. Many people attribute the concerning amount of student suicides to this."
Freshman,4,I didn't take any classes online until COVID-19. I personally didn't like it but all the professors made class entertaining and kept us up to speed with the syllabus.
Freshman,4,Professors really care about you and the class sizes are very small and personal. The party scene is pretty good but it seems to take priority over academics.
Sophomore,4,"I'd like to start with saying that the engineering courses at this school are of quality and is in and of itself a reason to consider coming to Rowan, in conjunction with the comparably inexpensive tuition to that of other engineering schools. Rowan offers a course called ""engineering clinic"" which is taken every semester of all four years. This course assigns students an engineering project (of their choice, if in the later years) which they will spend entire the semester working on with other engineers of diversified disciplines (e.g. 2 electrical and 2 civil engineers working as a group). No other school offers this, and thus is a unique aspect to Rowan and its curriculum. Some of the housing at Rowan is brand new (but expensive) and many students prefer it to the much more second rate and almost unbearable housing among other parts of the campus. At first, the food seemed decent, but eventually I realized how little love they put into the food and I got tired of it."
Freshman,4,"Rowan University is a great education environment and I adjusted very well into my first semester of college and only advanced from there. They give their students many opportunities to immerse themselves on campus and into their many clubs, offerings and activities. The campus has a welcoming and friendly atmosphere and I have highly recommended it to others that are interested in attending. If there was anything that I would like to see changed or improved upon, is the process and guidelines for food and housing and housing and meal plan accommodations."
Freshman,4,I switched to an online learning experience due to COVID-19 and the shut down of Rowan University's face-to-face learning experiences with the concerns of our health and safety. I feel like the transition to online in such a short and sudden period of time was very well adapted and professors where transplant and understanding of the conditions we all had to adjust to. The online experience worked very well.
Junior,4,I love Rowan for the campus life and student involvement. The education is great and the professors really help you to succeed
Junior,4,We had online zoom classes which were very effective because it was more discussion based then lectured.
Sophomore,4,"Fortunately, before this pandemic I did not have to take any online classes. I am a very hands on leaner and prefer in classroom meetings. However, with the pandemic as we all know, all classes had to transfer to online courses. I believe my professors did a great job at transitioning, and if you’re the type of person that prefers working at your own pace then no one classes would be great!"
Senior,4,I made a lot of friends and fun memories at Rowan.  The environment is very relaxing and it is a place for people to be themselves.
Alum,4,"At first it was hard to understand, but once you get into the swing of things it becomes very easy to access. The online professors are very helpful and are always answering questions. I even took a lab online which was very fun."
Alum,4,"I liked the overall campus and the small type of college feeling it had. You run into people that you know a lot, but also meet new people everyday. The professors are mostly very helpful and nice to work with."
Freshman,4,"Overall, Rowan University is a great school with many opportunities. Classrooms consist of only 20-30 students which allow for more in-depth learning and conversations. Professors are able to know all of their students' names and will go out of their way to help students if they are willing to learn. Rowan is also right next to Philadelphia which gives students the opportunity to have fun with friends in the city. The dorms are very nice and all come with air conditioning and heating. The only downfall of Rowan is the parking. It is very difficult to find a place to park and the parking lots are very far from the buildings. Besides that, Rowan is a great place to make new friends and learn about your major."
Alum,4,"The campus is nice, but isolated. There isn't much to do off campus. It can be a commuter school, however, parking is limited and expensive."
Niche User,4,I like the campus life and how easy it is to get around. One thing that I would change is adding AC to some of the residence/housing halls. Other than that my experience with Rowan is pretty good. I will be an incoming freshman this year. I am very excited to start my college experience with them.
Junior,4,"Rowan is definitely an awesome community school to attend.  The resources and opportunities offered here are endless, and there are so many that are underutilized.  Academics, sports programs, music programs, special needs programs, etc., are all a highlight to the school. I would say the one negative side is the academic advising.  I am a Health and Physical Education major and there is only one advisor for the school.  I just feel I have had more issues while dealing with him than anything else.  He didn't give me a voice or a chance to say what I wanted out of my education.  He simply told me ""this is what you are going to do"", and if I hadn't stood up for myself nothing would have been completed the correct way.  Dealing with advising will definitely require patience. Overall, this college is the place to be for everything else though.  The rest of the campus staff I have communicated with have always been a huge help!"
Freshman,4,Online classes are good. Some professors are nice. On campus food is pretty good. Traveling is fine but sometimes the parking is full.
Freshman,4,So far as a college student here i love it! The campus is very open and friendly and makes everyone feel welcomed
Niche User,4,"I am not a student here, but I did go visit for a school event that involved students from at least 5 different schools, including mine. The ones involved with the event were students enrolled within Rowan Univ and they were excellent throughout the event. If only I could have experienced more (sigh)"
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed how the University is big but not too big. It is easily accessible and everything is within walking distance. The professors are great and are never unreasonable.
Sophomore,4,"Rowan has been overall very good. It is easy to navigate to class, I have met some very amazing professors, made new friends, and joined a club. I would love to see Rowan become more diverse and be more clear and open about safety issues."
Freshman,4,Rowan University is a great school with a good education for a great price. They have great programs and professors that wish to help the students.
Niche User,4,"I loved this college when I went to visit it for school. I can't wait to attend here in the fall. I met with the professors and head of the department in what I plan to study, everyone seemed so incredibly nice and knowledgable. I can't wait to spend my next four years."
Sophomore,4,"I love the academic structure of Rowan and its professors. The advisers are great and are actually passionate about helping their students. Rowan also provides various resources on campus for diverse populations. However. Rowan could do better by offering more mental health resources and resources in general at the Wellness Center. Furthermore, Rowan is not as diverse as Admissions and the administration make it seem like. It is clearly divided in many different ways."
Freshman,4,"All of the professors that I have had thus far at Rowan are primarily concerned with making sure their students are understanding the material and learning; a focus that should be of the utmost importance at any college or university. Rowan also has a strong community feeling, welcoming of students of different backgrounds, cultures, etc. One of my favorite things about Rowan is the constant effort to be accepting of all students, despite gender, race, orientation, etc."
Junior,4,"Being a transfer from Rowan College of South Jersey, this is my first semester at Rowan University. While it was my most difficult, I have enjoyed my first semester here. All of my professors, with the exception of one, were extremely helpful and taught lessons that I felt were valuable. As for campus life, I only get a taste of it during the day. I am a commuter so I am only on campus during the day Monday through Thursday. Rowan has been built up so much and has many lounges and places to grab food that makes commuting so much easier. My first semester at Rowan was a sucess and I am looking forward to next semester and the rest of my academic career here at Rowan."
Sophomore,4,"Rowan has great programs, all the teachers are really nice, and the dorms are pretty good too. The experience of being on campus and taking classes is great. The bad thing though is that they will get every single dime out of you they can. You think a student loan has paid off your current debts, then check your account and see $300 that apparently wasn't covered so now you have to pay out of pocket. Get EVERY scholarship you can, trust me."
Sophomore,4,"Rowan University is what you'd expect from a standard university experience. The classes and people are for the most part friendly and there are always opportunities to help you in classwork. Although some buildings have seen better days, the general area of the campus can be lovely to walk around. The local food places are quite delicious and make spending time with friends even more enjoyable."
Junior,4,"I am really happy that I picked Rowan as my place of higher education. Studying business here has really opened my eyes to the ways that the world works. I love how involved that a person can get at this school and how welcomed you feel. Since I am a commuter, I am not able to get involved as much as I would like due to school and work."
Junior,4,The learning facilities are good. Some of the staff have been extremely helpful in preparing me for my future career.
Junior,4,"The parking is a huge problem, but otherwise it is pretty good. A fair amount of campus activities, very high speed reliable wifi almost everywhere. Relatively inexpensive and definitely still a good education."
Sophomore,4,"I have no real issues with Rowan University. The campus is nice, as well as the surrounding neighborhood. The engineering program at Rowan is...questionable at times, but still very good regardless. The only thing I have to say about Rowan is that it needs to be more friendly to the environment and can definitely improve."
Freshman,4,"Rowan is a good school for engineering, especially looking at monetary aspects. They are continually adding new buildings like engineering and the new technology campus. Overall, depending on what your interests are, I think Rowan is a good school. College is what you make of it!"
Senior,4,"After transferring to Rowan University from Cumberland County College, I found the transition very smooth. All the teachers that I have had at the University have been very informative and will go the extra mile to ensure that you grasp the concepts. The only negative thing that I will say about Rowan is the lack of parking areas for commuters, there are numerous cars swarming around the parking areas looking for spots making it very difficult to find parking. So if you are commuting give yourself plenty of time."
Senior,4,"Rowan University has a beautiful campus and everything is in walking distance. It is growing each year and new buildings are being made to accommodate the size. The classes are mostly good with good professors, but you are getting what you are paying for. It is really up to the student to make the best out of the college. Being involved and finding clubs/organizations can greatly improve social life and having connections."
Sophomore,4,"I like the friendly environment of the campus. I love that different restaurants to try out are in a close vicinity. I am in the journalism program, and I feel like they do a good job at teaching students new things and giving them opportunities that will help them in the future."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus and the way the classes are set up, my classes aren't like lecture halls even though this school has many students who attend. The teachers try their best to help each student and offer their advice whenever it is needed and are understanding. The one thing I would like to see change is the food options to be more healthy."
Junior,4,"I personally have enjoyed my time at Rowan.  I like that I am able to commute easily from home.  Rowan could use some more parking closer to the main academic buildings.  It's great that they are adding new buildings, but they keep taking away student parking to do so. I often arrive a half-hour to an hour early, just to get parking.  Also, it would be nice if Rowan would let students know about campus events more than a day or two ahead of time.  As a commuter, it is very hard to stay up-to-date with the events on campus and same-day notice for an event causes me to miss a lot of them because I already have plans."
Niche User,4,They always are looking to improve things in and around the campus. They also look to work with the surrounding community.
Sophomore,4,"Rowan University is an amazing school that offers a wide range of opportunities to full time and part time students alike. If you live in NJ you can definitely confidently come to Rowan confident that you'll get all of the bang for your buck. With a rapidly growing campus and student base the new experiences keep on rolling in. I work here as well and can confirm that the FWS program is amazing and helps people who want to live on campus and still work! There are a couple of things that I wouldn't mind they got rid of, but overall a great school. Sometimes the campus hosts events and they don't feel welcoming to all backgrounds... Overall a great school with a decent party scene and an excellent engineering program."
Senior,4,"Rowan in my opinion is a very good school that continues to grow each year. Every year I have been a student they have opened a new building for student housing for both upper and lower class men. Also, the business and engineering buildings are beautiful and brand new."
Freshman,4,"I have had nothing but good experiences so far at Rowan. The campus is beautiful, and there are so many clubs and activities to get involved in. Rowan has something for everyone, even specific majors that most schools do not offer."
Freshman,4,Rowan has recently implemented tremendous funding for projects and is now experiencing huge growth in it's business school and arts and music programs. It's campus is safe and clean and is equipped with new safety and communication technology.
Junior,4,Rowan University is a very clean and up-incoming campus. It also provides students with a lot of opportunity.
Senior,4,"It is a enjoyable experience, and has great professor's. My issues are with the food, and the how some of the student body are not very considerate of others due to how much partying goes on. However if you find decent roommates that you get along with it is breeze as well if you have a good friend group to study with."
Senior,4,Great professors that are very helpful in making sure that you understand the content of the lectures.
Junior,4,I am junior at Rowan University and I am highly satisfied with my experience! I am an Environmental Studies major and the Professors are the best I have ever worked with. They are extremely helpful and understanding. The workload is just enough but I am still challenged.
Graduate Student,4,Very good school  professors are knowledgeable close to things many opportunities for practical options
Freshman,4,I like the fact that Rowan University has numerous activities and clubs that anyone can get involved with. There are some great professors as well and most staff are really helpful. Two things that need to be improved at Rowan is the freshman dorms and food plans should be cheaper.
Freshman,4,"Professors are great at Rowan University. They show dedication to their students, and if they see that the student shows effort, they will most definitely help out."
Freshman,4,One of the best schools you can go to for the low price. If you are studying engineering there is almost no reason to go to another school over Rowan.
Junior,4,"It's good academically, especially in the computer science department, though I did have a couple more scatterbrained professors last semester. My major concerns are the lack of variety in foods on campus, and that the local police/community can be racist, to the point of triggering a serious controversy last year. Something to consider if that affects you."
Senior,4,"I love attending Rowan University. I've worked very hard and maintained excellent grades. I am currently an Engineering Senior on the Deans List with a 4.0 GPA. The huge disappointment is the lack of scholarship money. I have received $0 scholarship and I have paid every cent to attend resulting in over $30k a year including tuition, housing and food. I almost left Rowan to move back home and attend Rutgers so I could save money."
Junior,4,"Rowan is making a lot of changes to campus and to its education. They are quickly becoming a more prestigious school and I enjoy my time and education at Rowan. The fast growth has caused some problems like lack of parking, and staff to deal with problems like housing, financial aid, and health and welness. I believe Rowan will become a very popular school but not without its fair share of growing pains."
Sophomore,4,"Rowan has come a long way from where it was five or ten years ago. It has expanded and there's a lot of new buildings. Honestly, you're experience is a result of what you do on campus. If you don't go out and do thing, then you'll think that it sucks. But if you go out and explore campus and get involved it's actually pretty cool here. Academically the professors are not the best, but I like the small class size. Your professor actually knows your name. Which makes it easier to network, need be."
Sophomore,2,It's hard cause I can't focus. My girls help me out.i know I'll do better when I can date my professor lol jk  but imma try.
Alum,2,"Waste of time, money and effort.  Graduated with honors seven years ago and I still have not found meaningful employment.  The college has done nothing to help me find employment and the counselor no longer returns my messages.  My last job was working in food service and I know other graduates who are working in a warehouse.  School president likes to spend tuition money to create his legacy instead of helping graduates find employment."
Senior,2,"I honestly loved my classes at Rowan, but I transferred to the school after 2 years at another university and NOTHING about the process was ever easy. During my entire time at Rowan I was NEVER able to register for my own classes because they never integrated my credits correctly into the system. Every semester was a battle to get registered for the classes I wanted, which often ended up in having to jump more hurdles if the class filled up quickly or the administrators were unable to help me before normal add/drop times were over. This made my experience at Rowan so much more stressful than it had to be, which is a shame, because otherwise I had great experiences at Rowan."
Freshman,2,"It’s so large that no one cares about you. The food is awful. All the freshman dorms except holly suck. Unless you’re an athlete, they literally don’t care about you. EVERYTHING is broken at some point in time. I don’t know why. There’s mold in my dorm. The ceiling keeps leaking in the bathroom. Everyone is very cliquey. The academics are so poor; I had better classes in high school. On campus there’s these exhaust pipes that just fling out smoke. It smells awful half the time. Glassboro SUCKS. Nothing to do. Genuinely nothing. Food is awful 110%."
Freshman,2,"My time here thus far has been mediocre. Luckily, I have the opportunity to transfer in the Fall of 2017. For the love of God, make sure you visit your school and know everything there in and out before you enroll!  My mistake, I didn't know much about Rowan - only that my sister goes here and it's reasonably priced. I decided to go to Rowan because I felt that it was appropriate. My sister goes there, so then the move-in day will be easier for my parents, from a cost perspective Rowan is a great investment, it all sort of made sense. I am not fond of the Southern Jersey atmosphere at all. To get to the point, I never toured the campus whatsoever. Was it my fault that I decided to enroll at a university before checking it out? Yes, I wouldn't contend that at all. It is my fault, and I wasted so much time and money.  Let me make this clear, Rowan is definitely not the worst school in the world. They offer a good deal if it is the right school for YOU."
College Freshman,2,"The system made to give students their housing is awful. The buildings with the communal bathrooms are unsanitary and they should be done away with. No building has air at all, so in the summer you practically die of heat."
College Junior,2,I do not feel confident about my job opportunities after I graduate.
College Junior,2,"I don't really like Greek Life to begin with, but the members can be very annoying about their sororities/fraternities. The events are often loud and I personally would want to participate in one."
College Freshman,2,"Wellness center is okay, easy to get an appt. Mental health/sexual assault counseling is a long wait (I waited for 6 hours and had to miss class, can't make appts only walk in) Def need to staff more counselors"
College Freshman,2,The courses aren't terrible. I've mostly been bored. I've never really been excited to go to class. The professors are mostly nice and are available to help students.
College Freshman,2,"I have not connected well with my roommates or pretty much anyone that lives around me. I do not like to take part in the common party experience that most colleges present which makes it hard for me to find people who are similar to me. The people who live around me, including my roommates, all seem like the same people with the same interests."
College Sophomore,2,I live off campus but hear on campus is bad.
College Freshman,2,"Greeks are only known for the parties they throw, which aren't even fun. They're just the only option. They are widely disliked otherwise and known for sexual assaults."
College Freshman,2,Rowan sports are average. It's a D3 school. The facilities are pretty outdated.
College Junior,2,"Upper-classmen apartments are not the best here at Rowan. The only nice apartments (Robo, 220, Whitney, Townhouses) are all the most expensive. The reasonable housing (Triad and Edgewood) are either very far, not that clean, or is over-crowded. Rowan has a lot of options for housing for Freshmen, but needs more options for upperclassmen."
College Freshman,2,"Part of the campus is viewed as safe and the other part is scary, especially at night."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, good luck. You have to make all your own opportunities."
College Freshman,2,Nobody goes to any of the sporting events besides the football games.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the professors are bad at this school. Prepare to learn everything on your own. The school is extremely uncoordinated. The other students are nice, if you're in the honors program."
College Senior,2,"The racial groups are very split, particularly between black and white. Racism is a problem on campus, usually it's indirect, but it's definitely there. Religious intolerance is less of an issue but still prevalent."
College Senior,2,There is virtually no recruitment. The career center is not helpful.
College Sophomore,2,Rowan is an alright school but everyone here does not care about school
College Junior,2,"The places downstairs in the student center aren't horrible if you need something quick. The cafeteria has a bunch to choose from but you have to be careful when you go because they have times where there's pretty much nothing out in between ""meal times"" and that can last for awhile."
College Freshman,2,"Most of it is straight-up gross. If you are a vegetarian, like me, it will be hard to eat anything other than pizza and ice cream. No matter what, if you are trying to eat healthfully, it will be extremely difficult. There are simply not enough healthy options."
College Freshman,2,I won't receive any financial aid from my understanding since I'm out-of-state. The only transfer scholarships are for in-state and there's nothing else I can apply for except for external scholarships and grants.
College Freshman,2,I dealt with financial aid all summer in order to get some help with paying for school. I am still dealing with them today.
College Junior,2,"I know multiple people who have experienced sexual assault, the university needs to step up and really start paying more attention and punishing people"
College Junior,2,"Rowan has a problem I have often seen in classes. I have only recieved loans. Loans from Rowan did not actually pay for the whole tuition so I had to apply elsewhere for more money. Meanwhile, sudents in classes that recieve financial aid do not care about classes nor their education the way I and other struggling students do. Multiple time I have witnessed as students that receive financial aid walk out of class or just never show up becuase they are not actually paying for them to be there."
College Freshman,2,"The food is bad. You're forced to get a meal plan freshman year, but after that, skip it or get a small one and cook for yourself. Your money is better spent on groceries...or boro bucks to buy Chinese food and pizza"
College Freshman,2,"Not a very diverse school in many ways. Racially, the school is very segregated. White people hang out with white people. Black people hang out with black people. Other groups aren't as segregated. Those are the main two I notice. Most people are not prejudiced, but there are definitely some racist, homophobic, and especially transphobic people here."
College Freshman,2,"Barely any options, and definitely scarce amount of ethnic food. Too many places close early for being near a college. Hardly any vegetarian/vegan options. The o nly good thing is that most places take boro bucks"
College Freshman,2,My mom had such issue with financial aid and she was always on the phone with them. She finally got everything solved about two weeks ago because I was not going to be able to register for next semester if it was not taken care of.
College Freshman,2,I am personally not a fan of the sorority girls and frat guys on campus. The girls are very stuck up and the guys are completely obnoxious.
College Sophomore,2,"The office would not answer phone calls, so many times I had to drive to campus and ask for information and help. Even after everything was processed I did not receive the aid I needed."
College Junior,2,"Alcohol violations are given like candy. I had a friend have a beer can in the hallway of her dorm, no one claimed it, so the whole hall was written a violation."
College Freshman,2,"It is either all or nothing, there is no in between. Apply as early as possible to get the most help"
College Junior,2,"We are not very diverse in my eyes, but my school wants to claim that we are."
College Freshman,2,If you choose the nicer dorms price is too high. If you choose the cheaper dorms the quality is too low. Housing is never guaranteed either.
College Freshman,2,It's a D3 school so athletics are nearly nonexistent and pretty useless. The gym is kind of nice though.
College Freshman,2,"It's college. There are drugs, alcohol, and parties. Rowan doesn't really seem to be trying to stop them though."
College Freshman,2,"Work load is to be expected. The professors are next to incompetent. The Electrical and Computer Engineering program, for some odd reason, puts a lot of focus on subjects you wont be using at all like Chemistry. Also, did I mention the professors are next to incompetent?"
College Freshman,2,"The professors so far have no idea what they're doing. Any learning I've done has been on my own time rather than in class. I somehow still managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA, though I cannot say the same about others."
College Sophomore,2,I am confused by it.
College Sophomore,2,"Rowan's campus is not diverse at all. The student population is overwhelmingly white, straight and Christian. We need more diversity!"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't often go to sports events, but when I went to one of our men's basketball games, I was appalled. They were playing in a gym that was worse than my high school's gym, and they didn't even have a cheerleading team of university students."
College Sophomore,2,No one helps me! I am so lost and have reached out to so many people.
College Freshman,2,"Anywhere within 10 miles is farm land or a decaying town. There is nothing to to on campus or off campus that is walking distance. The only chance of having fun is going to Philadelphia, which is a 25 minuets drive. Only way to be entertained during your stay on campus is to join a club or sport. Locals are neutral to students."
College Freshman,2,"The campus itself is like a wind tunnel. The area itself has a lot of rainfall and the past winter has been abundant with snow, ,eaning cancelled classes and slippery, ice-covered walkways"
College Sophomore,2,There is a lot of rain all year and the campus tends to flood 
College Sophomore,2,Several students were caught not long ago with a lot of drugs and several on campus housing buildings are known for drugs
College Freshman,2,It was the worst . It took me month to get any information about my application and financial aid award. I was so stressed out about this and was worried because it was my top school 
College Sophomore,2,"While the food isn't that bad, and there about 5 main food places, availability is extremely aggravating. All meal plan options end everyday, indefinitely from 1am-7am. After 5pm on friday the only healthy/vegetarian/vegan directly on campus and that takes meal plan closes until Monday afternoon. The food in the cafe usually has a variety of cultural meals depending on the day/week/month and sometimes it's really good. Prof's Place which is an overpriced fast food place that sells cheesteaks, burgers, pancakes, subs, cold sandwiches, and the such, but most full meals exceed available meal plan options and often you go over and have to use the boro bucks(monopoly money used around Glassboro) or dining dollars which can be used on campus dining. There a lot of fast food and order out places around Glassboro that take Rowan Card and accept boro bucks. "
College Sophomore,2,"It's not the worst, but it's frustrating. "
College Sophomore,2,"Rowan is a good school academically. has a lot of cool people, and there are fun things to do on campus. But, from the terrible drug policy, lame party scene, to the very obvious social/racial segregation, and the subpar food,  if I had a choice, I might have picked another school. Equally cool experiences as lame ones."
College Sophomore,2,"In terms of availability of computer labs, and printing, there are a number of Computer labs situated around campus for printing, crunching, or just getting papers done. It's included in the tuition, so you never have to worry about paying for printing.  Rowan Wireless Network however, is absolutely atrocious. It goes in and out a lot, as is completely unreliable in every sense of the word. Whether it's streaming Netflix or sending homework blackboard. It is a merciless chaos creator that has no sympathy or discrimination for students, professors, or administrators. Everyone hates it. Everyone. The campus offers free labtop and phone repair, and they're pretty good/on-time. "
College Sophomore,2,"Glassboro is pretty boring. If there isn't a cool student organization activity, party, or if you're not in Philly, there will be nothing to do. At all. Cool for getting work done, but on the drier weekends, it can be a total pain in the ass."
College Sophomore,2,"Rowan provides a wide selection, but most of the provided on-campus dining is subpar."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I haven't seen any internship opportunities for English majors. I would love to have one, but if they exist, I haven't seen any."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't really pay much attention to athletic teams and things like that. But I have tried to use their rec center before, and found that it was too highly geared toward athletes for me. I'd love to be able to just go in there, show my ID, and work out, but it isn't that easy."
College Freshman,2,"not enough school spirit, not much to do "
Graduate Student,1,Was here for a one year certificate and glad it was only a year. Administration and Departments are run so haphazardly and without care. Takes forever to hear from anyone or for them to actually do their duties. Good riddance. If you are local go to Stockton or maybe just cross over to a Philly school.
Graduate Student,1,Covid transition was so-so. There were some good teachers and some poor teachers. There was a lot of busy work regardless.
Alum,1,"I wrote this review on another site, but I'm being censored. I wonder who could possibly be the culprit behind that?? Anyway, here's a poem I wrote about this school:

10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT ROWAN

I hate the constant parking tickets,
And those fire alarms that go off at night,
I hate paying for books we don't use,
I hate all the professors that can’t tell left from right.

I hate the constant partying,
I didn’t pay tuition to get day drunk,
I hate I drank water with lead in it,
I hope those new filters aren’t complete junk.

I hate that students seek help,
But they’re put on a semester-long waitlist,
As the President reaps a fortune,
While making hot sauce that you just can’t miss.

I hate the way those doors slam shut,
The day after you graduate.
As I apply for job after job after job,
Rowan sends me letters, asking me to donate."
College Freshman,1,"I do not want to attend this school any longer. I would like to transfer next semester. I never really wanted to come to this school in the first place; it is not really for me. They do not offer many unique majors here and the school is located in a little New Jersey town with not much to do around. It feels like a closed-in community, secluded from the rest of the world."
College Freshman,1,The campus and area is unsafe and rapes aren't taken seriously.
College Freshman,1,An example of Rowan's bad career placement: one of my adjunct professor's was a 25-30 year old Rowan alumnus. He said he hasn't been able to land a good job with the degree and that he wants us to do well so that perhaps we can offer him a job someday.
College Freshman,1,The dorms are overcrowded and old. Two person rooms are currently accommodating three people each.
College Freshman,1,"My first semester at Rowan University was also my last because of how mediocre it was. Between the campus itself and the unhelpful professors, my time at Rowan was a colossal waste of time, energy, and money. Most of the communal spaces at Rowan, such as the Student Center and the freshmen halls are outdated. The 80%+ of the freshmen dorms that were built to accommodate only two students are now at triple occupancy, which is a huge problem for many students as far as living space and course work. Campus safety isn't great. While thefts, vandalism, racist hate crimes, and even a rape occurred, they campus police didn't solve anything. Instead, they were known for heavy ticketing of cars and jaywalkers. The food on campus is worse than summer camp food! Also, the hours are ridiculous. The food company workers, ironically named Gourmet Dining, are rude and incompetent. The town of Glassboro is not, I repeat, not student friendly. I would ride my bike into town for non-campus food and I never felt safe. Office workers I came across while trying to navigate leaving the school for a semester internship were unhelpful and uninformed. I can't count how many different offices I was bounced between or false information I was given. Also, they billed me incorrectly multiple times. Furthermore, they tried to tell me I had to repay my loan and complete exit counseling. After calling my loan servicer, I found out that was bogus information. Rowan is a wannabe party school. While there are a few good staff members, professors, and students, notably almost all involved in the Honors program, most kids are there to party and hookup. I did not feel that the school cared about myself or any students as individuals and I was disappointed with my classes and campus life in general. I am currently away at an internship and transferring elsewhere for the rest of my college career."
College Freshman,1,The teachers at this school are terrible. Absolutely terrible.
College Freshman,1,"I don't feel at home, no friends, small campus"
College Student,1,Only reason why I have a meal plan is because my parents made me and so did the school (it's required for residents). You're better off eating out at Wawa every night.
College Freshman,1,"Glassboro, or as most people call it, Assboro, sucks. Nothing to do, food places are sub par, and the town is generally gross-looking. The only thing saving it is its proximity to Philly, and it's not really thaaat close."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus police are very strict. Tickets are given out for jaywalking. Students are in constant worry about the punishments. A highlight though, is the helpfulness if students are intoxicated."
College Sophomore,1,"Last year I went to Rutgers in Camden, they really worked well with me on financial aid. So far this year at Rowan, it's been a complete headache. They do not answer their phones, emails and when you go to them, they tell you they are too busy to deal with you. I'm still short $3000 for this semester and hoping that they can evaluation my financial aid status soon. I sent it in, faxed it in, and both times was told that they received it and will deal with it. Finally after weeks of no information from them at all, I went there, demanded to see someone because they told me that no one was available. I told the person at the front desk I wanted to see her supervisor then magically, someone became available to see me. They told me that they did not have any of the financial aid papers that I sent to them so she took them that day, entered them into the system and to date, I still have not heard from anyone. I was given the name of my financial aid advisor, but she never returns calls or emails, ever. It's been a complete nightmare. I hate to see what happens next year.  They really need to hire people that know what they are doing."
College Freshman,1,It's sad that people look into schools just for their parties. Well if you want to party and not to learn then Rowan's your place to be. There's ton of underage drinking and a myriad of illegal substance abuse. The bar often let in underage kids too.
College Sophomore,1,"Old computers, except one mac lab."
College Sophomore,1,There is no where to go!!!
College Freshman,1,"For freshmen you will experience the worst of the worst. I have three older siblings that went through college already and had their share of awful dorms but when they saw mine they even pitted me. My shower pipe was held together by duck tape and a plastic bag for the first semester. The area per person is uncomfortable even for one. The dorms are almost 60 years old. The bathrooms are supposed to be maintained by the students themselves, so of course it is never cleaned and continues to build in residue and stench everyday. One shower and toilet is shared per 7 students. You will be tripled in an area meant for one person because the university is trying to make money and accepting way more students then is can handle (which caused the 600+ upperclassmen denied housing next semester compared to last years 74). I have seen prison cells with better living arrangements. The upperclassmen are supposed to get newer housing that is apparently nice."
College Sophomore,1,Because my parents make money I am unable to get aid from the school but my parents are not helping me to pay. I am paying for everything myself and I need help
College Sophomore,1,I avoid it at all possible times 
College Sophomore,1,I sit in my room
College Sophomore,1,I didn't receive any money from Rowan 
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is awful, it's so expensive and far away from the buildings "
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus sucks. End of story. Nobody likes it, it's a big problem for commuter students."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus strictness is very annoying on campus, that kind of just puts a nice fat wet blanket on the Rowan experience sometimes. Police always seems be breaking up parties, even when they're aren't out of hand or very loud. The drug policy is very hypocritical. Drug offenders are usually kicked out of housing, suspended, and academic probation while alcohol offenders have to pay a fine and take a drug class, but rarely lose housing/academic standing. It's so easy to get a parking ticket with without the proper sticker, it's ridiculous. Protests/Demonstrations are literally limited to one area in front of the student center. It's a free speech zone. Anything outside of the patio in front of the student center is in danger of violating the campus policy and will likely be shut down. Campus art is also greatly discouraged. The Rowan Arts Collective, drew chalk in the Gazebo near the freshmen dorms, and in front of student center(free speech zone) and where asked to remove the beautifully drawn art and not to do it ever again. The RA's can range anywhere from very laid back or disgustingly anal/to the code. "
College Sophomore,1,"Thirsty Thursdays, F***ed Up Fridays, Savage Saturdays. The drinking on Rowan is pretty noticeable, most students can be seen stumbling back early on in the semester from parties. Most freshmen engage in underage drinking, and the RoPo(Rowan Police) are always out in the force Wednesday-Saturday Nights making sure students don't make poor decisions. There is a good amount of date rape that takes place at Rowan, and it's definitely a problem at the bigger Frat parties. However, after freshmen year, most respectable young  gentlemen and ladies limit their goings to such places significantly and prefer to get inebriated with close friends in small gatherings, where the entrance fee isn't $1. A good amount of students are ""trippy"" and enjoy partaking in psychedelic experiences such as Shrooms, Acid, Molly, and the occassional Ketamine. There's also a large influx of research chemicals that pass as LSD, that can be found too if one knows the right people. And of course, like any other college campuses, Rowan University has a large stoner community. Almost as many people smoke weed as much as they drink, and in some social circles, cannabis is the preferred intoxicant of choice. Unfortunately Rowan has a terrible drug policy that kicks out or suspends students caught with or under the influence of marijuana or other drugs/paraphernalia. While at the same time handing out slaps on the wrist to those doing the same thing with Alcohol. Pretty annoying. Getting caught with weed or drugs on campus is a guarantee to losing housing THAT day, and a call to your parents."
College Freshman,1,i was recruited for football. took the first year off to work out and get grades up. Attended the football games stood on the side line. After 3 games i quit the team and dropped my scholarship. NO ONE GOES TO THE GAMES and it was worst then a sub par high school atmosphere 
College Freshman,1,"There is only one bar that is strict about age. The few houses that throw parties are not meant to be party houses, and are in family communities"
College Junior,1,The food has good and bad days but..usually more bad than good.
College Junior,1,I didn't receive any financial aid even though my grades in high school were the top 20% of 500 kids and in college I've been on the Dean's list every semester.  It's very annoying to see how many scholarships are given to the athletes especially when their grades aren't as good as mine.
Recent Alumnus,1,Permit costs are expensive. There are NO spots. Make sure you get to campus early because you will be fishing for spots for awhile.
College Sophomore,1,There is definitley not enough parking spaces of campus.  Freshmen aren't even allowed to bring their cars on campus because there isn't enough.  I feel that we should have our cars because then we wouldn't feel so trapped.  I notice the cops only really give out tickets when it's the beginning of each semester.
College Junior,1,Parking is rather expensive ($120 a year) and there is no guarantee of a spot within reasonable walking distance. One of the larger lots is unpaved and floods with unpleasant regularity.
College Sophomore,1,"HORRIBLE FOOD DO NOT EAT – I heard from many people about how terrible the food was on this campus. I didn't believe it at first; I had gone to freshman orientation and thought the food was pretty good for a cafeteria. However, once the school year starts up, you get the reality that is Rowan food. It is incredibly fatty, greasy, and distasteful. In fact, I literally cannot eat it anymore. The last half of my stay at Rowan was a slew of hospital visits due to horrible stomach pains and nausea due to my intolerance for the food they provide here. They desperately need to do something about the quality of their food because it is quite simply inedible. "
College Sophomore,1,"Unnecessarily Severe Punishments for College Behavior – I had heard about Rowan's policies about drugs and alcohol but I put it off as rumors that rowdy students spread and got surprised that they got caught doing stupid stuff. However, I know honors students who have gotten kicked off campus for being caught smoking pot ONE time. No warnings, just kicked off campus causing them to be homeless for the rest of the year. And no that isn't an exaggeration. I've also had friends be arrested for under aged drinking. I mean, I understand these things are illegal and there definitely should be consequences, but I think the severity is utterly ridiculous. We're in college. People are going to do stupid things. There should be a more understanding policy in regards to normal college behavior."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Department Communication – The parking department issued me a permit to park in all residential lots. I asked about which lots were considered such and obeyed and only parked there. I called again and asked the parking staff if two lots were considered residential. They told me I could park there, so I started doing so regularly since it was extremely convenient for me. To my dismay, I received three tickets for parking in unpermitted lots. No one told me it was wrong until I got a ticket."
College Junior,1,Fines are really ridiculous for first time offense. They charge students a 150 fine for drinking on campus and place them on probation for a couple months. This is unfair because this punishment for a 1st time offense should be a warning.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is terrible. There is absolutely no parking off campus for visitors unless someone wants there car towed. On campus parking is way to expensive.
College Freshman,1,Social Atmosphere – All frat parties get busted by the cops anyway and you'll end up paying a fee for underage drinking because Rowan cops have nothing better to do.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Guys Are Dumb – Most of the guys are more concerned with drinking, partying and acting stupid!!!"
College Senior,1,"Rowan University has TERRIBLE parking. They say they try to accommodate everyone, but in fact, it is more of a hassle to try to find parking. I was lucky enough to live close to campus, however, i feel bad for the commuters. They probably need to get to campus at least 30 minutes earlier just to find a decent spot!"
College Freshman,1,"RoPo Sucks! I understand that the Rowan Police are trying to keep campus safe. However, I have been stopped for no reason on numerous occasions, walking back to my dorm from Walgreens. In addition, they love to raid frat parties rather than keeping the campus safe (I heard locals love to mug college students). They mean well, but are strict and ineffective."
College Sophomore,1,"Glassboro Sucks – The town that Rowan is located is terrible. There is a lot of crime and almost nothing to do. Anything fun is at least a fifteen minute drive from campus, so if you're a freshman and don't have a car, good luck with that. Sports aren't big here and there isn't a lot of school pride."
College Sophomore,1,Not and Easy Gain – Struggling to pay for school i applied for financial aid and was surprised when i was denied. This made me see that it is difficult to receive financial support from school. Paperwork was done properly but it was said that no matter what i would not receive any aid from Rowan University.
College Junior,1,"One Word: Horrible – Campus parking is absolutely horrible, especially if you are commuter. The commuter lot is not big enough for the students. The parking passes are like $200 or more. The fines are ridiculously high. I've never gotten a ticket but my friends have, and I think it was about $150 for parking in a handicapped spot for like two minutes. It's crazy!"
College Junior,1,"Almost None. The school claims that though there is no nearby public transportation, there are shuttles to take students off campus. However, the trips are only once a week or less, and they go to the nearby mall. Though there are some trips to NYC, they only happen twice a year."
College Freshman,1,The food is really bad at Rowan.
Niche User,1,"Parking is horrible. We get charged every year for parking permits, but there is no parking. Also, if students do not park in the parking lots, they get tickets."
Niche User,1,"Parking is like musical chairs: finders keepers, losers, weepers!"
Niche User,1,I always have to fight for a spot – It sucks. I always have to fight for a spot. There actually was a fight over a parking spot not too long ago.
Niche User,1,Parking is terrible. They need to get more parking lots and garages around here.
Niche User,1,"Parking sucks, there is no easy parking!"
Niche User,1,There is barely any place to park on the campus. It is a huge problem. Ugh!
Niche User,1,Don't violate any laws here – They are very strict. You will get arrested ASAP for violating any laws here. 
Niche User,1,It is very noticeable – It is very noticeable. I've seen people get high right in their dorm room.
Niche User,1,"Noticeable drug activity – There definitely is drug activity on campus, and it is noticeable."
Niche User,1,Alcohol and weed – Alcoholism is definitely the main problem then comes weed. It is very noticeable.
Niche User,1,The school is not very diverse – The school is not as diverse as far as ethnicity goes because the minority percentage is extremely low.
Niche User,1,Oh my God! It sucks! Oh my God! It sucks! Something is always wrong with the Rowan computer systems. And they are always crowded. Students should have their own computers because it is always too far of a walk to a lab. 
Niche User,1,Nothing to do in Glassboro – There are some racists here. There is nothing to do in Glassboro at all.

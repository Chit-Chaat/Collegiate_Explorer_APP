College Freshman,5,computers are well maintained and in working order and readily open for use
College Student,5,"Even though Western New Mexico University is small it is the most diverse place to go in town. There are suprisingly people that are from all over the world; from California, Alaska, and even a few that I've met from Georgia. As far as I've seen everyone gets along great and there is tons of diversity in ones intrests; for example music, food, sexuality, study habits, pretty much anything you would find in any college setting. But it is great because this is such a small town that its like going to a bigger city."
College Freshman,5,I Could Spend Days in the Library Alone Not to Mention the Museum – Two areas of interest no visit to campus would be complete without.
College Student,5,Smooth Ride – Western made everything with my financial aid easy. All I had to do was submit the application and they took care of the rest.

College Senior,5,"Safety First – I read the crime report for the campus and there is no assaults of any kind. The  campus police are very active patrolling all of  campus and they are very quick to respond to anything that would put anyone into danger. All student information is safeguarded in special departments, Dorms have strict rules that have to be follower by everyone in order to avoid any burglaries, there are direction on how to be safe in case of  any disaster, buildings have evacuation plans and exits marked down  and every student has to have an ID for identifications."
College Senior,5,"Beautiful Silver – The city is very free laid back small in size and has very energetic people.It's a little hilly and full of breathtaking scenery. There are a lot of activities that are always going on in the small city. Someone is either hiking, biking, jogging or just touring the downtown area, where there are so many art stores and small cafes to visit. The University is up atop a hill where it is the first sight you see when you are driving from the south. University students are out and about everyday around campus."

College Freshman,5,Nice People – most of the people in western are very nice one can get help from any body and there is no trace of racism
Junior,4,Western New Mexico University is a wonderful school with a great campus and tons of programs to choose from. I wish they had more locations throughout New Mexico so more people could experience the campus and its entirety.
Senior,4,"Close knit campus and staff, the professors care about us as students and want us to succeed. They have one of the best zoology departments in the stat of New Mexico."
Graduate Student,4,Overall WNMU is great. I would like to see the online learning system (Canvas) to be improved or replaced to be more stream line and user friendly. Currently it is cumbersome and over complicated.
Junior,4,"Western New Mexico University is a small campus, so everything is relatively easy to find. The cafeteria food is better then what i had heard, though it could be because i am not a picky eater. The dorms are either larger or smaller then I would like, based on which dorm I stayed at. My roommates have not been the best, but when you are the only one in the dorm suite that does not play or, in their case, breathe football or sports and enjoys silence, you are in for a rough time. Sports is emphasized in the same amount at this college as it was for my high school, which is sickening. You go to college for a higher education, yet most of the football players seem to be notorious for being the laziest group of students on campus and have said they are there just for football, yet THEY are the ones with the full-ride scholarships while the students that are actually there for an education struggle to make ends meet each semester. The faculty is fantastic."
Freshman,4,I am currently on my second semester at Western New Mexico University. I am enjoying all my classes the professors are helpful and they make sure I understand what I need.
Junior,4,"This school is incredibly diverse. It is relatively small, but the people are so kind and the classroom sizes allow for one on one learning and real help from your professors. The administration is supportive and understanding, and they will do everything they can to help you. They celebrate their students and have so many options for students to expand their hobbies and skills."
Sophomore,4,Although this university is very divers within the cultures it bring it would be nice for them to offer more opportunity in scholarships and giving back to its students. It tends to seem they like to get more money out of us.
Freshman,4,"Western New Mexico University is a really nice college. It is not very big so you really get to know all of the students and faculty. The class sizes are small so you can really create a relationship with the professors. Silver City is a really cute and artistic little town with a lot of character. It has a lot of beautiful hiking trials and the views are gorgeous. There always seems to be something going on on campus which is very nice for the students that live in the dorms. Overall, I am very happy with my choice to attend WNMU."
Niche User,4,"Overall good experience, I am enrolled in dual credit classes. The professors and others there are very helpful and polite. The environment is good and the library is amazing. They helped me with filling my fasfa extremely quickly and in learning as well as earning college credits. They have interesting career fairs as well."
Graduate Student,4,Western is a good school. Overall happy with my time here. I have joined different organizations. These have gave me resources for my future. My biggest issue with western is that it's not as accessible to graduate students as I would prefer.
Freshman,4,"As a student at Western New Mexico University, there are some things that need improvement. The school lacks organization and there is a lot of confusion as to which offices handle which business as well as the Canvas website that is meant to be used for teachers and students to communicate and see current grades. There are some good parts as the environment is very open and friendly and there is easy access to other students for tutoring, joining clubs, and getting involved in the community with activities and such."
Senior,4,The school offers many unique programs and classes. The class sizes are typically small which allows instructors to work one on one with students. All of the professors I have worked with have been complete professionals who are very knowledgeable  in the subjects they teach. The administration is very organized with the exception of a few changes needing to made to the financial aid department.
Senior,4,"I enjoy attending Western New Mexico University because the courses are realistic for my education needs as well as still providing a challenge and new learning opportunities. The school is smaller than most, but the intimate class sizes call for a better relationship with both students and professors. The students all have a great relationship with one another, due to the fact that all of us have been brought together in this small pond."
Alum,4,I attended the WNMU Police Academy and had a great experience. I graduated valedictorian of my class and learned a lot. I was hired with an agency upon graduating.
Alum,4,"Diverse in both student body and faculty. Even if being this far off the beaten path is too much for four years, it's economical to start here. Silver city is also a great, eclectic little town and close to the Gila national forest."
Niche User,4,"At Western New Mexico University I enjoyed how I was treated the same as any student, even being 14 years old."
Sophomore,4,My experience at western new Mexico university was and still an awesome experience. Im from California so coming here was great because not only is the faculty very helpful the people in the town is very friendly. Its like a home away from home so going to this school is one of the best choices i have ever made.
Graduate Student,4,I take online classes for my graduate program here and it is a wonderful environment to be in. I never thought I would enjoy online school so much and I have met the most wonderful students and teachers that really care about helping you succeed.
College Senior,4,"Overall, I have had little to no conflict with my professors.  As a normal student, I have had trouble with a couple course, but searched and got the help I needed thanks to the resources at my school!"
College Senior,4,The campus police are so friendly and make sure everything is okay with everyone.  One time a campus police escorted me to my car at night so I would feel safe.
College Senior,4,"The athletics at this school is involved.  The school gives you several options to choose from when it comes to sports.  What I like about this school is every out of town game, the school provides a ""spirit bus"" for individuals that would like to go and support our school.  This school is strong when it comes to school spirit."
Sophomore,4,"I love how the campus is very open and everyone is super friendly and helpful. When i went to visit, the first thing i noticed is that everyone smiled when you walked by or said hi. The resources that the school has to offer are also very incredible and there are a lot of opportunities for success "
College Freshman,4,All the athletes and athletics are very involved.
College Freshman,4,We have alot of activities to keep the students involved at our school
College Junior,4,The school is good when it comes to internships and the university has a career center on campus that can help you. If you needed further assistance they give you a pamphlet with easy instructions for either online or to go to an unemployment office near by if you want to work outside the school.
College Junior,4,"The professors really care about your education whether young or old. Education is important here and if you need help, you can see help from the professors whether in class or out of class. Class sizes are not too big so learning and staying focused isn't really a problem."
College Senior,4,I have really enjoyed my experience at Western .I like that it is a smaller campus and that there is more chances for one on one with the professors . I wish I would have looked at more schools though because there are colleges that offer more than Western does. Also because I think it would have been better for me to get experience out of my hometown.
College Senior,4,"I really like this school because I came from a big University where they treat you like a number instead of a person. I get a lot of help when I need it and answers are always easy to find. I also like that I am not being taught by student aids, but actual professors."
College Junior,4,"Good school overall, I'm from here and its good to be back home. Professors seem to care what the students are learning"
College Freshman,4,Parties that i have been to have been more then fun. The quality of the parties are not too wild but there is always people having a good time. The best parties are off campus because there is a little bit more freedom. Part of the college expereance are parties and going out on the weekend.
College Junior,4,It is a great school to attend because almost everyone is friendly and can get along with each other especially the Professors.
College Freshman,4,school spirit can be improved
College Sophomore,4,It is good from what i hear
College Sophomore,4,I found my own place without the campus help as its fairly easy to do.
College Sophomore,4,There are no problems in this catagory
College Sophomore,4,I had no problems everything when fine.
College Freshman,4,"The Master's program in counseling is applying this year for accreditation and the professors take their work seriously. My courses are filled with pertinent information to the counseling profession and contains rigorous course work. 

The undergraduate degrees are somewhat lacking in professionalism and rigor from what I've heard from students, including the women's athletic team that I coach."
College Junior,4,"It is cheaper to live off-campus than to live on-campus, plus you have a stove to cook whatever you want, so you dont have to eat what they have in the cafeteria everyday."
College Sophomore,4,"Since I have been an online student for the past three semesters and have also been at the satellite branches , I really can't respond to this question.  The little I know about the athletics at Western is what I read on our school website and from a couple of friends who do attend the main college in Silver City, NM."
College Junior,4,My friends and I have been able to find the housing we need at a very good reasonable rent.
College Junior,4,"I like to eat veggies, gluten free sandwiches."
College Junior,4,I feel greatly safe on my campus.  There is always a security guard that will assist an individual should they need to be walked to class or their car.
College Junior,4,"The Mustangs are a big name, there is much support from the fans, a lot of school spirit, and a very good athletic facilities."
College Junior,4,"As an individual attending the University and one who has a learning disability of ADD, and Dyslexia.  I have received the most respected help from the University."
College Sophomore,4,"The weather is perfect here, it's not to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter. The snow storms in the winter are rarely bad enough to cancel school. But the only concern is lack of rain, which has caused droughts which led to a few bad fires. Besides that, the weather here is almost perfect."
College Sophomore,4,"The school really works with you every step up the way. I really have no complaints about  the staff, advisers, etc.  because they are always willing to work with you and help you accomplish your academic goals. But it is a very hard program to get into because they want students with a 4.0 grade average, and sometimes might consider someone with a 3.5 GPA. I am not in the program yet, but since my major is nursing I see an adviser through the program."
College Student,4,I came from a small town so i love it and i couldn't go anywhere else
College Student,4,the only thing that sucks is that when you want something late at night you have to go to McDonald's
College Student,4,Nothing really happens on campus so there is no reason for strictness
College Student,4,I love being in the residential hall everyone get to know everyone else
College Student,4,I love meeting new students from all over the world

College Student,4,"there are a wide variety of computes on campus. if you need one, you can find it"
College Student,4,"many of the students are minorities, and this leads to great diversity."
College Student,4,there is a lot of spirit in the Mustang sports. even if the school is div.2 there is always fans
College Freshman,4,The teachers are very willing to work with you and around your schedule. And many professors see great graduation rates within my major
College Freshman,4,There is a nice range of majors you can choose from
College Freshman,4,The computer labs are hardly ever full amd are open till a great time
College Sophomore,4,The off campus dinning in Silver City NM are good when they are open. Most of the restaurants are locally owned and serve wonderful homemade food. A lot of the restaurants located off campus do not stay open past 5:00 P.M  and are hardly open on the weekends.
College Sophomore,4,"The Weather at Western New Mexico is wonderful. I absolutely love the weather here, it never gets too hot or too cold. The summers never get to humid or to hot. Summer night are the finest I have ever experienced. Toward the end of the summer we get the Monsoon season.Where it rains and rains, everywhere suddenly turns green. The winters never get too cold but yet we get snow. Its wonderful weather."
College Senior,2,Bad school don't go here. Try ur luck and transfer somewhere else. A nice community college is way better
College Senior,2,Everyone is basically the same if you don't like ur roommate you are screwed. The resident assistants are useless they only care about themselves and their little clique.
College Senior,2,I lived on campus and hated it. Really tiny and depressing town. Nothing to do nowhere to go. Everyone likes the same stuff. Not many clubs and the club members are not motivated. The school has nothing going for it except for the athletic program so if you are an athlete ur good. Everyone else is just a body. Try ur luck and transfer to a real college.
College Senior,2,I lived on campus and hated it. Really tiny depressing town nowhere to go nothing to do. Everyone is the same and likes the same stuff. Try your luck and transfer to a real college.
College Student,2,we don't have Greek life
College Freshman,2,I get the meal plan where i don't have swipes and all i have is 400 flex dollars so i can go eat at the deli. After eating at the caf i have to use the restroom right away and it really isn't worth the feeling after.
College Junior,2,"It is the same places over and over again. McDonalds, Burger King, Sonics (we have 2 Sonics with in a 2 minute drive) I feel like the community is trying to slow down progress when building fast food restaurants."
College Freshman,2,Get it done early! I applied but I did not receive any financial aide.
College Freshman,2,"I've been a coach at three different colleges in the same sport. This is the worst college I've worked at in regards to my pay and my job responsibilities, gym space, equipment relative to the sport I coach, weight room equipment, uniform and travel budgets. Coaches drive buses for an average of over 15 hours per trip, it's laughable..."
College Student,2,Never eat in the Cafeteria it's not okay. The deli is the best place to eat just dont spend money all on the deli
College Student,2,You don't know where the pick ups are
College Student,2,"Fair, could be better could be worse, some difficulty with situational things, keeps me on my toes to self manage."
College Sophomore,2,"Bars are kind of far from the college. Not within walking distance to the school. There is one restaurant/bar just down the street however, but the majority of the bars are 2-5 miles away."
College Sophomore,2,Its hard to find one that is close to campus and cheap. One of the big apartments here doesnt rent to students and alot of houses are the same. if you take the time and effert you will find one no problem but dont have to high of standards.
College Sophomore,2,"The food takes time to get use to. Most of it is good, but some of it is just a waste of money. Its only open 3 times a day and twice on the weekends.  always enough for everybody but if you come it can be cold. i wouldnt invest in the larger plan because if you dont use them you lose them."
Recent Alumnus,2,HOUSING IS LIMITED AND EXPENSIVE – There are not many houses near the campus and the few that are available are high in rent.
Sophomore,1,Worst school I attended! Regret every minute to be in this campus Financial aid is a joke ... Professors are not helping and some of my online classes are lacking technology!
Sophomore,1,Seems like my issue keeps happening over and over. They request you to buy books they don't use during class or to buy books with access cards that are unnecessary and never used. When you complain they answer that books recommended by your instructor are useful for your career no matter what. It's just too bad the money to buy those expensive books doesn't come out of their pockets. I'm sure if it did their answer would be different. If you go through the same experience make sure you complain about it and don't stop at the first careless response you get. Follow the chain of command. They will tell you that they will let everyone know so that it won't happen again. It's a lie and just a way of keeping you quiet. Persist.
College Senior,1,No Greek life what so ever.
College Sophomore,1,"My first year I was on a football ""scholarship"" but I am still paying a lot of money out of pocket and have taken out loans. Staff seems very disorganized. I was charged a ridiculous amount of money because they did not drop a class that I had dropped before school even started and they refused to remove the charge. The town it is located in is very dull and there is not much to do whatsoever."
College Student,1,I hate dealing with financial aid especially being a first year student
College Student,1,"there is no greek life, not that i am aware of at least."
College Student,1,I don't think this is a strong for by any means. This is a small town so those transportation extras don't exist.
College Student,1,minimal relevant to college life a western. This is not a focus of the school.  
College Senior,1,There is only one vendor on campus and the deli on campus is owned by them. there is only one option and that is sodexo.
College Junior,1,"At Western New Mexico University, there really isn't Greek Life as you would find at other schools.  The extent of it is honor societies for academic majors but not necessarily just social groups."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The process involved disorganized business offices such as the admissions, financial aid, registrar's office, etc.

Processing my application was constantly duplicated by multiple departments and individuals.  Know one knew who was on first base and who was on second base.  Total chaos!"
Recent Alumnus,1,No information provided and no scholarships for graduate students
College Freshman,1,"I Dont Party. I'm underage and I have never been into drinking or partying. I spend my free nights with my boyfriend and friends. We hangout on campus, play video games in our M.E.Ch.A. building, and watch movies. We also go to school in a small town, the biggest town is an hour away and if your broke, you dont have the gas money to drive all the down there. There isn't much to do here after the sun goes down."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Food on Campus – The food is not worth the price at $1,600 for 240 meals. The menu does not provide a variety of different foods."
College Freshman,1,Thank Goodness for Corre Caminos – Silver City is a small town so there aren't any city buses or traveling buses available here. However we do have Corre Caminos which is a shuttle that has scheduled times and places they set up for those who do not have access to a car. The only problem is trying to work around both your schedule and theirs. It gets frustrating at times but students learn to take advantage of it because a portion of our student funds go to pay for those services.
College Freshman,1,"The parking situation is one of the biggest problems here at Western. There are very few parking lots not to mention the size of them aren't as large as they need to be. I constantly see students or faculty car pool, walk or even ride a bike to school because they simply cannot find a spot to park."

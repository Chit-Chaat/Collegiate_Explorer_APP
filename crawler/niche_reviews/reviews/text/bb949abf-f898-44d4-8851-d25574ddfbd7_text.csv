Sophomore,5,The university is very diverse and suitable environment. At the University the professors see are willing to work along with you to ensure that you will succeed whiles here. Eventhough there are some on and off the day my freshman year experience awesome and I love the Ozarks.
Alum,5,"The core values of U of O pull you in to the community and get you active in both personal growth and as a whole student body. The discussion based classes allow for you to gain new insights as well as voice your own. Overall, my experience with the University of the Ozarks was excellent because of its impact on my character and who I’ll continue to grow into through taking the tools and skills I gained at this university."
Alum,5,"During my online courses with U of O, it really allowed for me to tap into my ability to time manage because many of the classes aren’t during a set time like in person classes. When I had questions or concerns, the public forum in the class allowed for me and others to ask questions and either have them answered by the professor or other students. I must say however, I do prefer on campus classes because I’m more of a tactile and visual learner which you don’t always get online."
Alum,5,Wonderful! I got a great education that prepared me for the next steps after graduation. The faculty were amazing and always encouraged and supported me when I needed it the most.
Junior,5,"Here I found a second family. Ozarks gave me the opportunity to meet people from all around the world and allowed me to make great connections with them. Faculty, Staff, and students are very friendly and help you grow."
Senior,5,"University of the Ozarks was my first college visit ever... and my last. I knew the moment I was on campus, this was my next home. Everything needs to change, and Ozarks is easy to overlook... but, dig down and Ozarks will welcome you with arms wide open."
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity on our campus! Ozarks has become my home away from home as an International student, I have met people from all around the world, which has open many doors for future opportunities. Also, people from the local area have given me the opportunity to get to know this small town better."
Freshman,5,I love how diverse the campus is. Everyday I am meeting someone new from somewhere in the world. I also like how I am able to have 1 on 1 with my professors.
Freshman,5,Ozarks is a amazing university! Great diversity and amazing professors all around. Students at the university are extremely nice and classes are really great
Junior,5,"Here at the Ozarks, I have been able to grow and learn so much about my studies but even more than that about myself. College is such a huge decision and I am so thankful that I ended up here. The professors are honestly some of the best people I’ve ever met. People ask me how I describe the Ozarks in one word.. this is an easy one: family. We all care about each other inside and outside of the classroom."
Senior,5,"I have take advantage of everything I could. 
I enjoy being part of differen student organozations. I like to be a participant of events and make my word notice. I wish there will be more school spirit. I wish that caf would improve. I wish that students were asked more often what we like and what we dont."
Sophomore,5,"The university is very engaged with the students and Community. Moreover, everybody is friends with everybody regardless your position at this great university."
Junior,5,This campus is very diverse and they really encourage a strong community. The faculty and staff are nice and they work hard to ensure that students are learning the material. I’ve had nothing but great experiences at this university.
Sophomore,5,University of the Ozarks is an amazing College. Great people and great environment. I love it here. The campus is great. The food is good and an amazing basketball team. I have learned so much since I started college. My professors are great as well and I can actually understand what's going on in class.
Sophomore,5,"The professors, staff, and chaplain are all awesome people who are always willing to help. I’m a Business Administration major and if I ever have a question of what I should do next, there’s always someone there that knows what to do (or who I should ask). I don’t live on campus but the housing on campus is nice. Food is nice with vegetarian options available."
Freshman,5,It is such a welcoming place with open-minded people. The campus is absolutely beautiful and very well kept. The students and faculty are always open for conversation and point you in the right direction.
Freshman,5,"Amazing! I would recommend this private university. Its a small family that looks out for each other. The community and teachers are great and can connect with each student. Hosting events like Ozark fest, Superbowl parties, and many other fun year round events."
Junior,5,University of the Ozarks is perfect if you're looking for a small school. It has a nice community feel and the professors are friendly. Because the school is so small I believe that you get more hands on experience and the professors are easier to reach.
Sophomore,5,"Ozarks may be a small university, but it’s also a small university. The most incredible thing about Ozarks is community that you find around campus, not just between students and other students, but between students, faculty, staff and every part of campus. When I see my professors around town and campus we always stop and talk, just to catch up; the college president will eat lunch in the cafeteria. I’ve missed class before and then got coffee with my professor to cover that lecture material. That’s something I think can’t be matched almost anywhere else. There’s always room to improve connections between faculty, administration, students, and staff, but that’s something to work for moving forward."
Senior,5,"University of the Ozarks provides endless opportunities. I’m a senior here and have had so many amazing adventures at this University. You’re not just a number here. The class size is perfect and allows you to really get to know majority of the student body and all of the professors. We have a voice here. When we have ideas or complaints, they listen to us and address them.  The LENS program is amazing and allows students to easily double major and get two minors because they don’t make you take all the basic unnecessary classes that many do. Plus, the new iPad movement is awesome. All incoming students will get an iPad and get to keep it when they graduate. I love it here. We’re all family."
Senior,5,"The University of the Ozarks provides a quiet and peaceful learning atmosphere. I am currently a senior there and have grown from both my time in the classroom, campus organizations, and friendships made. In my time spent I have improved my academic writing skills and have made valuable friendships with my professors, whom will help me to fund my future. I don't have a negative word to speak against the University. It is the best small town atmosphere you could ask for."
Freshman,5,The faculty was very welcoming. I also fell in love with the diversity. They make you feel that they're  really interested  in you.
Sophomore,5,I love the University of the Ozarks. It's size sometimes causes petty campus politics but you can't beat the fact that everyone knows you!
Niche User,5,U of O is one of the most beautiful colleges I have ever seen. When I went to preview the campus the atmosphere was just so friendly. It made me feel like I was at home.
College Sophomore,5,I really love the classes and that class sizes that we have. There is a broad range of classes to choose from.
College Freshman,5,"Even though we do not have a football team, we have everything else. It's not hard for even the less active people to find a sport they belong in (for me it was shooting sports), and everyone here gets involved by either being on a team or going out and supporting one another. It's not that we really care about the sport if we don't participate, but that we care about our fellow students and seeing them do well. Sports help us all to get involved and become closer as a class."
College Freshman,5,"This university is amazing! I wasn't entirely sure what field I wanted to go into but luckily there is something for everyone here and due to the required courses I get a chance to expand my thinking in order to get involved with so many different groups of people to find my niche. It has so many different programs and organizations on campus and is so involved with the community that it is not difficult to form bonds with people, and the faculty and staff are alwahs so accommodating and helpful because they want to see us succeed. I would choose this university a thousand times over if given the option because I feel as though I really belong here and everyone is so nice and the environment is amazing around here it's not difficult to de-stress when the workload gets overwhelming."
College Sophomore,5,I love the college that I attend. I have met some of the most amazing people and the professors work with the students if there are any issues at all.
College Sophomore,5,There is no big drug addiction at clarksville. There is a bit of a drinking problem but that it.
College Sophomore,5,At the university of the Ozarks it is like a small family and there is a ton of different races and religions. There is a great comprise and has a wonderful mood about the place.
College Junior,5,"The professors are great.  Some are harder than others but at a school like Ozarks when you are encouraged to push past your comfort zone and do the best you can, it's nice having a professor that is also a good friend.  They have a great open door policy and are truly dedicated to the students success inside and outside of the classroom."
College Junior,5,The campus isn't too big so there is always a spot somewhere within decent distance to any building.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The campus takes pride in being a very safe place to live, and I've never once felt unsafe here. Security is available 24/7, and the protocols for campus emergencies are widely publicized."
College Sophomore,5,"The climate in Arkansas is pretty mild. Sometimes it snows in the winter, and every now and then it rains pretty heavily, but for the most part, it's sunny and a bit humid. The weather hardly ever affects classes, unless it snows a lot. The dorms are close to the class buildings so even when it's raining, traversing campus isn't a big deal. Just make sure you buy an umbrella."
College Freshman,5,"Pre-Med Biology – I attend college at the University of the Ozarks, it is one of the best schools around. To be a student majoring in pre-medical Biology is very tough. At the beginning there's a lot of student they may decide to do pre-medical, but they seem to wearier down to very few because this major takes a lot of work and means a lot of business. At the University of the Ozarks unlike most schools they make you work for your grade they are not there to hand it to you, they wont to make sure their students are ready for medical school. They have a very high rate of students getting accepted into UAMS. This is a very good college with great professors, the workload is manageable, and they have many opportunities for internships."
College Freshman,5,Safety and Security – The safety and security at this school is phenomenal!!! I was so impressed with the way they handle situations and how fast they are to react when need be.
College Freshman,5,"Verry Much. The weather here in Clarksville affects us students a lot because due to the fact there is not many things to do here, and when it rains for example the day gets even worse."
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of Places to Work – Every building has a computer lab and I have never had a problem finding a place to work. Between the computer labs and wifi access, there is always a chance to get work done, even during finals and midterms."
College Sophomore,5,Always Safe – I have never felt unsafe on campus. I have never heard of theft on campus and I always feel safe leaving my door unlocked.
College Sophomore,5,"Our campus is about as diverse as they come. We have people that are Christian, Jewish, and Islamic. Plus we have students from approximately 30 countries and all over the U.S. This is especially surprising considering we have less than 700 students enrolled here at our school."
Freshman,4,Due to the pandemic most of my classes were online. The professors were very helpful and understanding of our current situation.
Sophomore,4,"My online work experience started of pretty difficult, but as time progress my professors work alongside me and every other  international student to ensure that we was on om board with everything."
Alum,4,I did not take many classes online but have the utmost respect for faculty and their navigating online tools
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment, it’s like one big family! We are always there to support and cheer each other on."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Ozarks has been wonderful! I came here to play soccer but also get an education. I have made so many new friends here that I know I’ll be friends with for a life time. The professors here are fantastic. Since I am an athlete I travel during the week and many of my professors have worked with me on my school work. They are understanding and they also support you and the sport you play.
Sophomore,4,The Ozarks overall has a great community on campus. The professors are great and really help you in class to understand what’s going on in class and to be able to pass those classes. The relationships between students is also amazing. Everyone seems to have a great relationship on campus.
Senior,4,I have a a great experience here at the Ozarks. Being a collegiate athlete and still getting to get my degree In the area I want has always been my dream. I love to hike and I think the Ozarks could have been placed more perfectly in Arkansas for hikers.
Sophomore,4,"Ozarks is my family. I have loved my experience at the campus. Occasionally, a class is pretty easy, but the professors work hard to be engaging and to reward students for their efforts."
Junior,4,Ozarks is a great school! Lots of diversity and passionate professors. The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming.
Sophomore,4,Here at the university of the Ozarks it is a small community. Everyone knows everyone or at least has seen their face before. It is a very comfortable environment to be in and a safe campus. Something is would change is the communication. I feel like sometimes people get confused on advising plan and when things are due such as when you need to change your meal plan and things like that.
Junior,4,"Ozarks is very diverse, and has an amazing community that welcomes you with open arms! The faculty and staff here are incredibly helpful, and wish you nothing but success and will be sure to help you in any way possible. As a student-athlete this is very important in the fact that I am able to freely speak to my professors, and they know who I am, and what I am working towards."
Senior,4,I love that the university is very diverse. The staff & faculty welcome you & treat you just like family.
Junior,4,"I love that the University of the Ozarks builds genuine connections with professors. However, the facilities at the University of the Ozarks are a bit outdated."
Senior,4,"I loved the intimate environment of a relatively small university. Small classrooms where your professor knows your name and works closely with you; the close relationships that you can build with students from over 20 countries, and the opportunity to step into the president’s office and talk about anything. The technology that they have been incorporating as part of their academics is amazing as well with 3-D printers now available as well as the Compass program where students now receive an iPad to reinforce their studies. I gave it a rating of 4 stars because I believe there is still ground to dig in terms of curriculum and faculty pedagogy."
Niche User,4,"I haven't gotten to go on my visit yet but the people are very nice over the phone. If I have a question about college I can shoot them a text and they will answer me very fast! Even if the questions aren't about their school, they are still willing to help to make sure I find the right school that fits me."
Niche User,4,So I visited for a highschool trip and the tour was great the people were nice and welcoming the professor's were well spoken and helpful
Alum,4,I had a good experience and I hope that the Student Life aspect of the college has changed for the better.
Junior,4,"Ozarks is a good school for people who are more introverted. It doesn’t have a ton of stuff going on, but you can find something."
Sophomore,4,The whole campus is great. Everyone knows everyone because of how small the campus is. The people are friendly and are fun to be around.
Freshman,4,My experience have been amazing so far. The professors here are surprisingly nice. The staff are friendly. Overall my time here has been nothing but great.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my two years here at Ozarks. From the moment I stepped foot onto campus I felt a sense of community. I feel as though everyone wants me to grow! There are quirks that drop Ozarks below a perfect score but you won’t be able to find a more perfect place to spend four years of your life. If you are looking for a small liberal arts school that was founded on growth and success, Ozarks is the right place for you!"
Sophomore,4,"When I first got here, everything was different from where I came from, the food, people, the language, and culture.  The thing I liked the most, is how I was well received when I got here, I felt welcomed. I like the diverse environment that we live in, I like the fact that the university does not focus on education only, but on the six core values: discipline, Sabbath, hospitality, growth, honesty, and service. The university takes care of student in providing places/offices with qualified staff like student affairs, outdoor office, public safety, student success center, library, all these places make life at Ozarks easy and more enjoyable. I would university of the Ozarks to open more scholarships to all students, to organize research programs, to organize more competitions other than athletics with other universities; for example, to expand the poet project that we do here, with other universities."
Freshman,4,"To me, the University of the Ozarks will make any student that comes here feel like family. Since the school is small, everybody knows each other. There's never a time on campus that I feel lonely because I have people around me that make feel apart of the school. The faculty is also very supportive of the students and intellectually challenge us to get the most out of our education."
Junior,4,"I love U of O; it's a fairly small liberal arts college with a friendly community surrounding it. The campus is very diverse, with tons of students from Central America and Africa, as well as a few from France, Germany, and Japan.  The professors are excellent, but there isn't enough of them really. The biggest issue with the school is the fact that it is trying to recruit more and more students without expanding faculty or housing. On top of that, the school has made the GPA and ACT requirements obsolete, so students apply that are wildly underqualified for the level of university education U of O has. It's a great school that I'd recommend to students with GPA of 3.0 and ACT of at least 25."
Freshman,4,"It’s a nice small campus with beautiful scenery, the faculty is very hands on and always open to help if you have any questions, the overall campus is just a pleasant experience"
Sophomore,4,"It's a great small school, the education is amazing here. The only thing bad about Clarksville is that there is nothing to do within 20 minutes. "
College Sophomore,4,Our public safety team is literally one of the best there is. They do not take anything lightly and will enforce whatever rules they need. They even put in new security systems that is accessed only by our id's to prevent break ins.
College Sophomore,4,We have a job fair on campus every year that is very helpful with graduating seniors. We also get a career corner email every week about the internships that are in arkansas and surronding states that help. It is really great.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics here are phenomenal. The students always get so pumped going to any of the games, the entire school supports each sports team. So they have plenty of fan support and school spirit. The facilities are great too they recently remodeled the gym and it is a very adaquate enviroment."
College Sophomore,4,"The university is a fantasic university. The classes are challenging but not so hard you want to cry, but the students that go here are not that great."
College Freshman,4,"Due to the increase in the class size there has been limited housing available but they are working on adding new apartments so this will be resolved. I live in the King dorm and while the rooms aren't very large, they are very well constructed and convenient for getting to classes and anywhere else on campus. A cleaning crew cleans at least twice a week so it's never very messy and the resident assistants do a very good job of making sure everyone is satisfied and following the rules. It's a great place to live especially for the freshmen."
College Junior,4,"It's pretty good, security is always working and crime isn't a big issue"
College Junior,4,"I like the professors here, they are helpful and informative"
College Freshman,4,Our public safety office makes sure that the University of the Ozarks is safe for everyone
College Freshman,4,My professors and teachers are among the best that I have ever had.
College Freshman,4,The chances that the value of this degree will get me a job are very high indeed.
College Freshman,4,The housing is very convenient for someone who has lived in a room about the same size for his life.
College Freshman,4,"The athletes at the University of the Ozarks are truly some of he best there are in the states of Arkansas, and indeed in the entire South."
College Freshman,4,"The University of the Ozarks is ranked as one of the top colleges in the South, and it deserves the rating."
College Freshman,4,"There isn't really a typical student look. Student's are really diverse. It's not hard to find someone with similar interests as yours, similar dressing styles."
College Freshman,4,"The library is totally amazing. The mall, or the green space, is really well kept. There are lobbies in every dorm for hanging out. There are study rooms and the gym seems to be nice."
College Freshman,4,It's pretty good. I'd say business is a very popular study area.
College Freshman,4,There are emails constantly for internship opportunities. Workload is fairly average I'd say. The professors are always available to help.
College Freshman,4,Security is amazing. I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus is strict against drugs and underage drinking. U of O is a alcohol free campus and first time offenders gets a letter sent home and a warning. Second time offenders get fined and third timers get sent home. It is serious if you get caught, so in other words just don't do it."
College Junior,4,"If you are interested in attending a small, private university with excellent academics and a great support network, this is the place!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"There has always been plenty of parking available on campus, though it may not be in the most convenient spot (you may have walk across campus or up a hill to get to class)."
College Freshman,4,They are good for doing simple papers but closer to finals alot of the computer seem slow and not many are open to use.
College Freshman,4,"Average Town – There's really not much to do here unless you go looking for things to do. There's a walking trail, several restaurants with several ethnicies to choose from, all the basic discount stores (Fred's, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Dollar Tree), Wal-Mart, Stage, Factory Connection, Hibbett Sports, and a decent movie theater if you're bored. You just have to go looking for things to do."
College Freshman,4,Personal Computer a Must! A personal computer is a must but that's a plus because you're not stuck n a packed library or student center with a bunch of noise when you're trying to study.
College Student,4,Everyone is so helpful and willing to show were to find books you need. They never make you wait. Love it.
College Freshman,4,I personally really like the school because of the small town atmosphere which is how i grew up. Nice and kind people almost everywhere you go. And you get more one on one when it comes to school and class. I would come here again because its small not to big and a very good college to attend with nice facilities to get whatever you need done.
College Freshman,4,"Different but Similar – There are many different types of peoples at the Ozarks. But when it comes to social life and looks there seems to be a lot of similarities between these differences. These similarities bring everyone together from mexican, central american, black, white,brazilian, and many others. Everyone is very inviting and dress anywhere from laid back to formal, no outcast here."
College Freshman,4,"This is a very great place, everyone welcomes you and makes you feel right at home. Students are kind and pretty considerate of others.I do not have a hard time doing almost anything because of my race at this campus!There are many different races and religons here, however the ost prominant is white. But from what i have observed everyone gets along fine."
College Freshman,4,"At the Ozarks we have okay parking. They should of made the top parking lot a lot bigger than what it is. People get tickets all the time for parking up there in a spot that isn't a parking spot because they don't feel like walking up the hill to go to class for maybe forty minutes. The parking could get a whole lot better, it would be nice for everybody on campus even the employ's."
College Freshman,4,"There are a bunch of academic programs available, more than any school that I know of. Even though there is much diversity here on campus, everyone gets along. Not only are the students nice, but the faculty is nice as well. The president, Dr. Niece, and his wife are the nicest people that I have met on this campus and the professors are all so friendly and willing to help the students succeed. The campus is close to all the buildings, the dorms, and the athletic fields. It's very convenient to walk around. The cafeteria food is not the best, but we have another place we can get food at the Eagles Nest. The Seay Student Center is the place where a lot of students hang out and where we can get out mail. Our bookstore is located here, too."
College Freshman,4,"The only thing available to students after dark is hanging around the campus. However, if you are 21, you can go to the one bar/club here that is a few minutes away from town. The student center is a great place to hang out during the weeknights though. And on Friday and Saturday nights, if you know someone who lives off campus, they might be throwing a party. The parties are not very big but they stay small so the group of people attending are really fun and friendly. Here in Clarksville, though, there is not much to do."
College Senior,4,"Race diversity can be summed up into three groups Caucasians, Malaysians, and Latin Americans. There are only a few people in other race groups. We have a very friendly campus. I do not feel that it is difficult to be accepted here. I don't personally notice a big gap in economic backgrounds, People are fairly equal. We have groups such as C.H.A.G.E. the deal with ethnic diversity topics. and Ozarks Alliance that fosters the gay community. I don't feel like anyone on our campus is particularly judgmental of anyone else. Everyone is fairly accepting."
Recent Alumnus,4,Always Felt Safe – I always felt safe in the dorms. We even left our door unlocked every once in a while and never had anything stolen.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great When I Studied There, Now It's Better – Campus was small but very complete when I was a student 15 years ago. Now it is much better.
The Walton Fine Arts Center was state of the art. The Seay Theater is fully equipped and perfect for all artistic events. The dorms were nice, as well as the cafeteria. Library was good, and so were the classrooms."
Alum,2,"umm its just not good you know. There's just so many things wrong with this school that it overshadows the few good ones it has. All in all its not for everybody, you either love it and stay, hate it and transfer, or hate it and cope with it."
Sophomore,2,"Beautiful campus, although admissions is absolutely terrible. It is a very good academic school but it is very pricey."
Freshman,2,"The professors are knowledgeable, hard working, decidaated and passionate about what they do. However, the food, dorms, and party scene is AWFUL!"
College Junior,2,"If you don't live in the apartments, you probably won't like it."
College Freshman,2,"The food is not very good. There should be more options, and meal plans are too expensive for the little amount of food we actually eat. Instead of weekly meals, every card swipe should be charged to their account which, I think, would be saving money for most people."
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus isn't awful, unless you live in King or Smith. McLean is okay, but still not very clean. King and Smith have so many problems, including cleanliness, utilities, and efficiency of rooming, especially with space. Space is an issue, too. With the amount of students living on campus, fitting everyone on campus is a big issue, especially when houses and apartements are being taken away and reserved for coaches. I think, if you are a coach, then you should be able to have your own apartement, instead of taking upperclassmen's space of living, forcing them to live off campus, considering they are the ones paying to go to school here. Pushing them away from campus and having them pay for a house, or apartment is asking a little too much of some students, who cannot afford the school as it is; plus, the majority of the students enrolled are athletes, and focus all of their time on their studies and sport, it gives hardly any time left to work. It is more expensive to live on campus, added with total amount of going to school here, than it is to live off campus, but what makes it worse is, we spend more money on living on campus in worse conditions."
College Junior,2,"Daily Grub – The food on campus is not very appealing, some of the cooks who serve our food when we ask what it is they cannot even tell us. The selection is minor but a vegetarian dish is always present, a salad bar and a pizza station. There is a cereal area where milk is kept stocked, occasionally. The food is not what one would expect of such a prestigious college. Many students are disappointed daily from the food we are served, that we pay a lot of money for. The variety is skeptical. We have an Eagles Nest that determining the meal plan you chose gives you money to use down in the Eagles Nest, however there food is very greasy. But it stays open later than the cafeteria so if you miss the cafe hours and you still have money on your Eagles Nest card at least you still have somewhere to eat."
College Junior,2,The dorms have community bathrooms with are the worst. They should be kept clean and should be checked regularly for any problems.
College Freshman,2,"There are parties, but nightlife is very limited. This is a dry county."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Town Is What You Make of It – Clarksville is a small town, but the community likes having college kids around.  There is a movie theater and a bowling alley.  More places to eat are needed, but its getting better (5 new places in the last 6-8 months).  The surroundings are is beautiful and has lots of outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking.  The campus is the cultural hub for the area, so most events are just a few steps away."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much Middle Ground – The people around here are either very good looking, or not so much. There are no alright looking people. You're either extremely good looking or extrememly ugly"
College Junior,2,"The nightlife at school isn't the type that has parties every single night, parties do happen, but I haven't heard of any on campus (they are just near campus). If you want to go anywhere that has anything going on you generally have to drive to get there because it is a small town. The campus does put on dance parties to get students together (those generally turn out good) and various plays and different theatrical events (athletics are another option for students to go to)."
College Junior,2,"Ozarks is a dry campus within a dry community, but students always find a way to drink. There is at least one off-campus party that involves alcohol and possibly smoking drugs every two weeks. In my past four years at this school I've had several people inform me that they know of students, even students with leadership positions, that drink in their dorm room.
There is a zero tolerancy policy concerning the use of drugs and alcohol on campus, and those students who have been caught have been addequately disciplined."
College Senior,2,"Clarksville, AR – Clarksville is old and small, so there is a hometown feel that brings comfort. However, there isn't much to do besides go out to eat and maybe go see a movie. There is not a lot for college students to do."
College Junior,2,"Small Town – Where we are located there is not much of a night life for legal and underage students. One of the student organizations puts on shows, dances, and other activities for students on the weekend such as a dance, free movie weekend, and free bowling. Although this is the case, these activities end somewhat early. There is one bar in town and it's usually fun on a Thursday night as it is college night. Other than that there are a few house parties. Night life is not usually happening where our school is located but it is easy to get out of town and hit up the city."
College Sophomore,1,"The dorm hall i live in was built during the great depression and has only been remodeled once. Most people try to take clothes from the laundry room that is not theirs, the kitchen is not good and all. It is too expensive to live on campus, but it is very convenient. The people here are okay but not the nicest."
College Freshman,1,The University of he Ozarks does not have Greek Life on campus.
College Junior,1,What school-provided transportation that exists is usually used only for taking the Latino students to Walmart.
College Sophomore,1,"The food here is not great. It used to be worse but it has improved a bit. There is a lot to choose from but it's not great and sometimes it's really terrible. There is a on-campus cafe that's open when the caf is not, but it's really expensive. So if you're broke and you miss dinner, better go mooch off your roommate. That or starve."
College Sophomore,1,"I think there is one bar. Just one. And it's 21 and up. There are a couple guys that throw parties on a regular basis and they're alright if you're interested in drinking, but it's ""bring your own beer"" so if you're underage, good luck. That's about it. Not even the fast food restaurants stay open late. It sucks!"
College Junior,1,Food Sucks Variety Lacking – Foods usually not good and most meals turn out to be pizza and fries.

College Junior,1,"Not So Hot – Ozarks athletics are far from extraordinary. Most of out teams lose on a regular basis, so school spirit isn't great when it comes to sports. The only team that is actually worth being somewhat proud of is the men's soccer team."
College Sophomore,1,Computers in every lab are underpowered. They are slow and still use Windows XP. Computers are old sime are the Dell Optiplex 320. The school bandwidth is still lacking even after the upgrade. Networking is hard and slow between two computers. Computers are s***.

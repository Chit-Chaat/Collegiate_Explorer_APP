Freshman,5,I have not attended school yet but my college advisor has been doing everything in her power to make sure I and the other students from the class of 2024 are ready to move in and ready to make our mark on the campus.
Freshman,5,I haven't done any online learning as of yet. my school will be doing online and on-campus learning (in-class learning) when the semester starts back up. I don't think it would be much different from high school because this is similar to how are classes were.
Junior,5,"I personally like online classes. I know for some students it may be a struggle and difficult to adjust to but here at Coppin State our administration make it easy to get help. Not only are they available over the phone but also on social media such as Instagram. For me, I never really had a problem with online classes or couldn’t get the help that I needed."
Freshman,5,"I am not at the university yet, but I will be this Fall. Coppin has great communication with  everyone. Coopin first year experience program is fantastic."
Freshman,5,"it offers a multigenerational learning environment, nationally recognized for community engagement serving Baltimore residents as well as students from around the world. offering 32 undergraduate degrees along with nine certificate programs and one doctoral degree. Coppin prepares its students to be competitive in regional and global markets through its commitment to quality programs in teacher education, criminal justice, business, social and behavioral sciences, information management, STEM and liberal arts and is also ranked among the most innovative small college businesses departments."
Freshman,5,"I love Coppin State University ! It may not be the most popular HBCU in everyone else's eyes, but to me it is the greatest. It is small and you know everybody. Everyone is so friendly it is such a family atmosphere are very family oriented. Of course families have their ups and downs, but that the end of the day we can all come together and make a great experience for our community. I know deep down in my heart Fanny Coppin would be proud !"
Freshman,5,"I like the environment. It’s really peaceful and it’s always something for the students to do , so you’ll never get bored."
Freshman,5,"So far my experience with Coppin has been amazing, I’ve cake across some nice and helpful people and cannot wait too meet more."
Freshman,5,Coppin State is very efficient on admission and getting paper work situation for students. They communicate very well and do well as a small university. Food needs to improve and more access to quad activity. Overall great and cheap school.
Junior,5,"The campus is located in West Baltimore City and the residents in the area, respect the institution and those who attend. The staff is encouraging and want scholars to reach their goal of graduating. It is absolutely a learning environment. You might even say Coppin State University is a Diamond in the rough."
Sophomore,5,My experience with Coppin State University has been amazing so far. The professors are extremely hands on. They offer to help their students in anyway they can. The students are warm and welcoming. What I really like about the school is that it isn't a party school. Coppin is more so from students who really just want to focus on there sports and education.
Freshman,5,I love this school so much. I originally chose this school because of all the stories my mom would tell me of her experiences at Coppin. I fell in love with Coppin immediately. The food is great but a little pricey but that's at any college campus. They always have fun events for students to participate in like going to Kings Dominions during fright week and Uno tournaments. The staff is amazing. Just a great school overall.
Freshman,5,that are really welcomin staff  and the food is really good and it is a really clean place the dorms are nice and clean thr staff memebers are reslly understanding
Freshman,5,"I am planning on applying at Coppin state university. I fell in love with the college during orientation. The campus is jaw-dropping, the academics are even better. I am planning on majoring in sports management, and very few colleges offer that as a major. Coppin State University does though, I can not wait to start my 4-year journey and obtain my degree!"
Junior,5,I currently attend coppin have been blessed to see some amazing opportunities and even got to experience them. I do love this school.
Senior,5,It is a great school to be apart. The HBCU experience is incredible and the have flexible hours for people who work and go to school
Niche User,5,I absolutely love the campus experience and the teachers. the teachers invest in the students education and a very good experience.
Niche User,5,"Everyone at Coppin State is very friendly and approachable. Along with the friendly aspects of the university, the campus's safety is actually incredible considering the location. However an improvement could be made in regards with the university's website and troubleshooting issues."
Senior,5,My overall experience at Coppin State University has been  great. They have truly prepared me for the real world. They only critique is that more students should know of the resources avalible to them around the campus .
Sophomore,5,"This is my first year at Coppin State University. I transferred over after three years of being out of college. The admissions staff and advisement team for my major made the transition back into high education smooth and painless. Now preparing to conclude my first semester as a Coppinite, I am happy I made the decision. The integrity of my professors, the content usednin my classes and the camaraderie of the entire campus makes this a great institution of higher learning. This semester I was taking all online courses and for the most part my courses ha e gone without incident. The o ly thing that I would suggest for the future is that Coppin require the instructors to take some kind of training before becoming an instructor for a online-based course. Aside from that, Coppin has re-ignited the fire that burned in me for deeper understanding of my history, culture and my identity."
Freshman,5,I like that it is a Historical Black College University. It's a small college. Their criminal justice program is top.
Niche User,5,"Coppin State is beautiful, it's a very small school which I like a lot but also has a great academic program. I'm apart of their athletics and it's just a overall great school."
Junior,5,"My experience at Coppin's large and diverse campus is fun and exciting!! The instructors, staff and students are professional, friendly, and supporting."
Senior,5,"Coppin State University is an awesome school for transfer students. It has flexible schedules for working people offering many night classes. It is in the heart of the city which gives access to public transportation to explore the city and the beautiful scenery;despite what many may believe about Baltimore, it is still beautiful. It Is located directly across the street from a mall which is great for college kids. I am a senior and I was a transfer so I don't know much about campus life as I am only there at night but it seems orettt awesome from what I hear from my classmates who live on campus. The staff are great. Should you ever have an issue, they will gladly assist in any way. They want you to succeed. This campus has been and is still being updated and it looks awesome. Nice environment despite being in the heart of the city. Highly recommend others to attend."
Freshman,5,It was very fun but the academics were great .The girls can be. Little catty and sort but everything else was good .My classes were pretty diverse .I had a diversity of different teachers .I enjoy my time at Coppin State .The teachers are great and so are most of the other students .
Freshman,5,"I am truly blessed and grateful to be apart of such an extraordinary HBCU. My experience  here has been nothing short of amazing. The students and staff here do everything in their power so that as a whole , the entire university can be successful. I have grew a bond with several staff and students here at Coppin State University that I would have never expected. The teachers are wonderful and humble, and the classes aren't packed where as though it makes it difficult to get the best learning experience there is for yourself. In my opinion Coppin State University is the best HBCU hands down! We know our history, are true to our legacy, and we are moving nowhere but forward. So in closing, my experience here at Coppin State University has filled me with unexplainable joy and undefining hope for the future."
Sophomore,5,"I love it at Coppin. I am from England on a tennis scholarship so when I went I didn't know what a HBCU was or what to expect from Coppin, but everyone is great and I love it. It was the best decision I've ever made. One thing that I would like to see change is for the tennis team to get more money as a sport as we don't get much support as a team. And for the football team to become a proper division I MEAC team because at the moment, they are a club team and I would love for them to be a proper team and apart of the school. Another thing is that I would like for us to have our own baseball field, currently the team has to use one about 30 minutes away for our 'home' games which no one can get to unless they drive, so having a baseball field would be great."
Freshman,5,I like that the staff and professor actually care and want us students to succeed. I also like that my peers are friendly and open. I was able to make friends the first week on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Coppin don't have every sports team but the ones that they participate in make sure that the student athlete focus on academics before sports, which is a positive."
College Freshman,5,"while touring colleges in my senior year, I came across good and bad but when I toured Coppin State University they treated me differently.  They explained every aspect of being a good student and what they expect from all their students.  They answered all my questions and gave me a new insight of being a good college student."
College Sophomore,5,The Greeks and non Greeks have a great relationship
College Sophomore,5,"I had a great experience , everyone is easy gong and all,help you understand everything"
College Freshman,5,"The professors are great, as far as how they teach and grade. Class size is acceptable and the way it's set up"
College Freshman,5,I've only lived on campus for the SASA program but it was awesome. I will be staying on campus in the fall
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are extremely fair, you will receive what you put out."
College Sophomore,5,Alumni have a large part of involvement on campus they constantly come to support future grads and have a large sense of pride.
College Sophomore,5,If you make safety your top priority you will be fine.
College Sophomore,5,So far I have had a great experience at my school. The admittance process was simple and the academic advisors really care about the success of students.
College Sophomore,5,We have to take sexual assault courses online in order to begin living on campus it is a very important aspect of living on campus. I personally appreciate all their efforts to prevent incidents.
College Sophomore,5,"I am not apart of the Greek life, but, they do amazing things for my community!"
College Freshman,5,The Greek life on campus is very interesting. They are very social with others that aren't into Greek life. They are very helpful to people on campus. They are friendly and they open all their events to those that aren't joined into a sorority or fraternity.
College Freshman,5,I have enjoyed my classes and have learned a lot over the semester.
College Freshman,5,"It has been a great 1st semester, my professors were excellent and i learned a lot."
College Freshman,5,"The athletic facility is very nice, Ive been to a few games here before I became a student. Last semester I met one of the basketball players and he speaks very highly of the basketball coaching staff."
College Freshman,5,So far it is good.
College Sophomore,5,"Because Coppin is such a small campus it is like a small family and everyone is close. Also, Coppin residence halls are very clean compared to other ones."
College Freshman,5,We have the best party throwers in MD
College Junior,5,Off famous there are a wide range of restaurants and places for food that cater to every type of person.
College Junior,5,"The atmosphere of the city is very welcome and live. There are a number of activities and fun things going on all the time especially in the downtown area. There are baseball games, football games, lounges and clubs, amazing restaurants and much more !"
College Junior,5,There are a wide number of academics and majors offered at Coppin State University. Many of the professors that you have for classes are apart of the administrate for the major you take which can be very helpful. The administration is very hands on and gives you exactly what you need to get you where you need to be. They are very supportive and there through the good times and bad. Throughout the years you build a bond and relationship with the staff and administration that gives you a sense of comfort and push to stay strong.
College Junior,5,"Strictness on campus is excellent, they are very attentive to who comes on campus aside from student, drinking, drugs, extra curricular activities, parking and much more."
College Junior,5,"The safety on campus is extraordinary, there's always campus police around and a means to get help if need be. There are blue safety towers throughout campus with safety buttons, if you need any type of help or assistance you push the button and help comes right away. Aside from that, campus police constantly check campus both inside of campus and out."
College Junior,5,"The use of computers on campus is outstanding. There are a number of computer labs in each building which allows ample use for students. They are all up to date with the latest software and technology and compatible with the specific systems used for courses. Printing is also amazing and extremely cost efficient. Each year students are allowed 150 free sheets of paper to be printed after you 150 sheets are gone there is a fee of $.10-$.15 cent per page. Overall, the use of computers and printing on campus is the best !"
College Junior,5,"I personally do not use campus transportation I am a commuting student. Based upon things that I have heard, the campus transportation is very efficient and takes you almost anywhere you need to go. Outside of regular campus shuttling transportation services include, local stores (i.e Target, Walmart, Grocery Stores), events on other college campuses, events in downtown Baltimore, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"if you have any problems, you don't need an appointment you can just go to the adviser and they will help you out. all the class are nicely organized and easy to take. and little to no requirements stopping you from taking them."
College Sophomore,5,the internships are great. and they do pay.
College Sophomore,5,I really don't need a computer but took it anyway. the campus has enough computer labs to take care of all your needs.
College Sophomore,5,I know people do drugs but rarely see them.
College Sophomore,5,no one really pays any attention to people's political beliefs or sexual orientation. that their personal live. it does not affect the life other students
College Sophomore,5,the dorms are actually on campus and the classrooms are within walking distance.
Alum,4,"Attending Coppin State was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The classes are a nice size, so the professors knew who I was and could help me whenever I was in need.  The only thing I would like to see change is the transcript application to be electronic."
Junior,4,"As a result of the pandemic, all of my classes were online. At the beginning of the transition, it took over a week to hear from any of my professors, and longer for some of them. But once we got online, classes were consistent and ran smoothly."
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience at Coppin State has been well enough. I had never intended to attend as a full-time student. The purpose of my going was to complete my freshman course to attend another institution. However, I ended up falling in love with the inviting culture and academic focus of the campus and made it my own. Other than a much-needed reform of the financial aid office, I would recommend Coppin State to everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Coppin is an HBCU founded by Fancy Jackson Coppin. If you want a small sized school, show on parties this is the right choice for you. My major is nursing and it  has a good nursing program."
Sophomore,4,The professors really assist you and appear to care about your success.  Great school but wish we had a band.
Freshman,4,"I love Coppin State University. Born not too far, The university gives me a at home feeling. The students and faculty are very welcoming and supporting."
Sophomore,4,"Coppin State University is a small hbcu that many people do not know about. I first found out about the college my senior year and high school at a college fair. Coppin had onsight admissions and I had all my information and was accepted onsight. I am now a sophmore and I love my school. The campus is beautiful, the staff is very hands on and that is because the school is small, so they are very helpful, and understanding. I recommend Coppin State University to everybody. All the facilities are new and clean , campus life is amazing and I am loving my Coppin State expireince."
Freshman,4,I like the environment being on a HBCU campus. Very affordable. Great Nursing Program. I also believe that I'll be successful coming out of Coppin State.
Graduate Student,4,I'm am satisfied with the content. I am not content with the level of communication between offices. There are too many bottlenecks created because everyone only knows their procedure.
Sophomore,4,Coppin is a very small school. I am a sophomore in college and it is very stressful. My experience at Coppin is good. I met and connected with some many people. Coppin allowed to have the experience of meeting and connecting with people.
Sophomore,4,I really like Coppin. I have learned a lot over the last year just by being apart of the school. I am a sophomore and I really enjoy my experience at Coppin.
Sophomore,4,"Coppin State University is a great school! It's safe, you meet a lot of friendly open people and feel welcomed there! It's wonderful!"
Senior,4,Transferring to Coppin was one of the best decisions I've ever made! I wish I would have chosen to come here instead of my first university when it was time to apply for colleges
Sophomore,4,I love my school & its people. Coppin needs some more upgrading  but it’s getting there . Most Coppin students have pride for their school
Alum,4,I recieved my Bachelors Degree in Applied Psychology May 2017. During my attendee here at CSU it was an amazing college experiences.
Senior,4,"Don’t let the neighborhood fool you, is s beautiful campus and the security is immaculate. Financial aid process is extremely slow so please get it done early not on time!"
Junior,4,"I love how the campus is small, it’s easy to get to my classes. Less than 5 min. The people are friendly but could be a bit more diverse"
Freshman,4,"Coppin state University is an excellent school. Its taught mea lot of things, such as becoming more responsible and staying ahead of my work. It also teaches you to balance out your social life and academic life if you didn't know how to prior to coming to college."
Senior,4,"I would say that overall Coppin was a great school for me to receive my Bachelors degree from. Overall the school is a great school and is very diverse. The sports teams are good and when they have parties , they tend to be nice parties. Overall the school is somewhat organized but you would have to stay on top of the financial aid office to ensure that your bill for a semester gets paid on time.  I enjoyed going to that school and if I could do it all over again I definitely wouldn’t mind ."
Sophomore,4,"I am in LOVE with Coppins campus!!The atmosphere is one that allows to open your mind.The professors and staff are helpful.I would like to see more organization with events and students first days of class.Overall though, Collin is a great college to attend"
Freshman,4,"Coppin State University was all I expected college to be like and more. From staying up late working vigorously to finish assignments. To hanging out and sharing laughs with friends. This year at Coppin State University was one to remember. Thankful for every opportunity that presented itself and for everyone who believed in me who told me, “You can”. Instructors who never gave up on me and friends who never stopped pushing me. At every corner I was met by words of encouragement. I learned more than I ever did this year at Coppin. Not only in a academic sense, but lessons in life as well. Coppin State University is shaping me into the man I strive to become. And I know that at the end of my days at Coppin State University, I’ll be a man of great knowledge, integrity, and compassion."
Senior,4,"Coppin State University is a wonderful place to start college life. The food is amazing and the teachers are even better. Best of all, the mall, a subway station and a bus stop is just up the street. Coppin University has everything you need and more if you ask."
Junior,4,"I enjoy attending Coppin State University. Most of the professors are reliable. If we have an emergency, they can usually be reached through email. They always respond within a timely fashion. The academics are great. We can access all of our course work and grades through an online portal, Blackboard, which is extremely efficient. I love how the campus embraces being a HBCU. The students receive constant emails about scholarships, internships, activities, study tips and internet safety. Sadly, the campus is not in the best part of town. The university does its best to make sure we are up to date on any crime. I love how the campus utilizes technology. One thing I would like to see change is the crime. I would also like to see Coppin be listed as one of the top universities in Maryland. I believe so much in this institution. We achieve so much greatness within the Coppin community, It would delightful for it to be known state-wide."
Junior,4,I like the ease of scheduling classes and advisors who are knowledgeable about the course requirements. I also like the resources available to make student success achievable.
Junior,4,"Coppin State University is a great school to go to especially if you cannot afford a more expensive college. Despite the location, the campus itself is actually very safe. I like the fact that I am around people who have similar interest and had similar experiences as me. The professors are nice and understanding and are willing to work with you to make your experience easier. I would like to see improvements on the inside of the buildings at Coppin rather than the outside appearance."
Freshman,4,Coppin is a good school. I have many teachers who are PHDs. Teachers are smart and helpful. Classes are small so you really get to know students and faculty. Im glad i go to Coppin. Coppin State University has been a blessing to me. I have never attended an academic institution that has a faculty of instructors that really care about their students. The professors genuinely want to see the students succeed and will do whatever they can to help that along.
Freshman,4,My first semester at Coppin State University was okay I had to get use to a new environment and the fact that I am now Independent. What I like about this campus is that the size and that the classes are not that full with students. The campus is very nice and beautiful I love the energy of it. One thing that could change is the food I wish it was better in taste and that it had a bigger selection.
Senior,4,"Overall the staff strives for student achievement. They want to ensure that every student gains an excellent learning experience as well as college-life experience. However, some departments could use some improvements."
College Freshman,4,I had an easy experience moving on campus.
Freshman,4,"This is my freshman year at Coplin State University, and I am proud to be a student at my HBCU. Coppin State University offers so many organizations and majors to decide from. I plan on becoming an Alumni from Coppin State University."
College Freshman,4,"My review will be short as I have only been able to explore the girls' volleyball team thus far. This team is amazing, having qualified for eastern conference and placing fourth in their most recent tournament, with a team of mainly freshmen. Through them I would say that athletics at the school maintains a high standard of excellence and the school pride boosts that excellence with support from persons, who, in some case, don't even play sports themselves."
College Freshman,4,"To rate a school in the simplest form one would need to evaluate three aspects of the college: the academic offerings and teaching, the facilities, and the social atmosphere. The top-rated schools are those which excel in those three departments, however, only the larger schools are taken into consideration for these ratings, which then disadvantages smaller colleges like Coppin State University. Most colleges offer the necessary academics, that goes without saying; if it were anything other than that the college would not be registered and accredited. What we really need to look at are the remaining two aspects- facilities and social atmosphere. To summarize what could be a long explanation as to why some of the higher rated school are actually disadvantaged (as compared to smaller colleges like Coppin) an economist would use the most basic concept of scarcity. Schools like Harvard may be huge and be multi-campus, however, the facilities are still too scarce to accommodate, with the highest efficiency possible, the student population, and one may find the dropout and fail rate of such schools amusing. Classrooms are huge and so student-professor interactions are limited, gyms require scheduling in order to find a space, and clubs and organizations are not concentrated and focused. My experience at Coppin so far has shown me that the smaller classroom setting is the better option, in addition to the smaller school population. Because it is small, there is always the ability to upgrade and modernize facilities as necessary without having to consider too much of the large scale expense, so students at Coppin have the most state of the art equipment at their fingertips and in there classrooms. There is also greater access to the school's resources, both human and material. If I were to give my own subjective opinion at this point, I'd say that students at Coppin and other small colleges have a greater chance of gaining a worthwhile and beneficial experience."
College Freshman,4,The campus from what I've seen its completely safe
College Freshman,4,I haven't seen Greeks in full effect but I'm pretty sure they are respected and it's pretty big around campus
College Freshman,4,Well from what I've so far Coppin supports all of the sports/clubs on campus. It's a very positive and motivational school
College Freshman,4,I went to a summer program at Coppin State University which was called SASA. The program was great and it was very eye opening. I learned more about the University and the people who attend. The professors that I had were great and they gave me great advice for the fall. I cannot wait to start!
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of people that are coming out of state and even the country because they're on a sports scholarship so they're bringing more press to Coppin State University which is awesome but I do not agree that these persons should be treated as ""Gods"" just because they're here on scholarship."
College Junior,4,Great school for my major!
College Freshman,4,Coppin provides a lot of classes for students and it allows people to accept and do what they truly want to do. Professors are very diverse and people are able to switch in and out of classes during the right time period to get the feel of the professors. Many students are able to connect with their professors because the professors take their time out to get to know the students.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of new classrooms and labs that are really amazing. Some building are a little older but over all the school like a very good. We also have a lot of study lounges and professor student lounges.
College Freshman,4,"People have to understand that Coppin is placed in a very dangerous neighborhood but it doesn't stop others from coming here. It is very safe and protects its coppin students. I haven't had an issue with any safety issues on campus, the authorities take it very seriously. They tell us about all the things that happen on campus or near campus that may effect us. They tell us immediately so we wouldn't be oblivious to situations that happened."
College Freshman,4,"Many students interact and do things that are out of their comfort zone to please others, They take on jobs that are either voluntarily or paid for but they always manage to get the job done. You may see a lot of the students working in the books stores, computer labs, financial aid, and in the gyms."
College Freshman,4,"Plenty of my professors take their time out to make sure I'm doing what im suppose to be doing. They don't think of it as if they are getting paid for it no matter how the students are doing, they make sure each student gets something out of the class. Many professors teach more than one class a day or the week so the student is bound to see them and be comfortable with them to talk about their grades and things like that. They aren't hard to talk at all."
College Sophomore,4,"I am personally not a sports advocate. Although, the majority of my on campus school population are in some form apart of a sports team."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, my university is a very outstanding university. The university offers a great deal of opportunities. Although I am a fairly shy person the university is very open to everyone. Now, yes the school is a HBCU ( historically black college and university), but, we accept everyone equally and there are a variety of different ethnicity throughout our campus. Coppin proud is what I am."
College Freshman,4,"Since our school is a small school the athletes are very confident in being friends with everyone on campus. Most of the school attends their games when at home or at our rivals schools. For example, homecoming was just last week and the boys and girls basketball team had their last game of the season and the amount of school spirit we had was amazing; a lot of  our alumni's came to support and it was very fun to watch."
College Freshman,4,"Since I go to a small school, it was easy for me to find people to interact with and be able to get help from. I was able to get extremely close with my royal court here at Coppin State. I feel as if Coppin is home for me."
College Freshman,4,Campus police presence is strong.
College Freshman,4,"So far the school is wonderful.  The school has a calm setting, great people and everyone get's along well."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus and classes are great, but some methods and rules should be altered or looked over."
College Freshman,4,"I am a second semester freshman, and I loved my first semester.  I am learning more this second semester.  Overall, I love my experience, and I am happy for my choice in the school I chose.  If I had one complaint, it would be the dorms could be updated, and we could have better internet service, the WiFi signal is very weak,"
College Student,4,I never ate the food but i heard its great
College Freshman,4,We're across the street from a mall and major transit line. How much easier can it get?
College Freshman,4,It's a great space to live in.
College Sophomore,4,The school has a great support team.
College Freshman,4,"We need more of our club sports to be in a division, since our division sports aren't really that good"
College Senior,4,Better to live off campus
College Freshman,4,"Honestly, you could have something new everyday of the week if you wanted to! Great food, I just wish these places were a little closer but they are still accessible."
College Freshman,4,"Of course, Coppin is a HBCU so typically you're going to see more black students on campus, but in the surrounding areas you see a mix of different people because of the tourists."
College Freshman,4,"Whenever there was a party going on off-campus, there was always transportation."
Freshman,2,Coppin is really a good school I like how much support that you receive from everyone there especially your professors I was really shocked when I first came because everyone was very nice and very helpful
College Sophomore,2,The application fee is expensive and then the enrollment fee is an addition price so it average to about 95 dollars
College Sophomore,2,They need more dorm building so the dorms wouldn't be such a hassle to get in
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife on campus can be fun if you're doing the right thing as far as socializing and dancing and hanging out with friends but a lot of students take advantage of the term ""Dry Campus"" and bring alcohol and drugs to campus and give them to people who are underage. When these things happen, the parties begin to become out of control to the point where I have to leave because the parties always ends up in a brawl."
College Sophomore,2,"I believe the drug use and distribution at Coppin State University needs to get under control because anyone can lose their lives being careless. I do not participate in these activities but I believe this school community should be more strict on who they hire because there are a lot of Coppin employees that openly sell and use drugs and Coppin State University is a ""Dry Campus"" so there shouldn't be any drug or alcohol use on our campus."
College Freshman,2,I do not appreciate the professors that talk down to students who attend Coppin by saying that we will go nowhere in life with a Coppin Degree and talking down to students who are born and raised in Baltimore.
College Freshman,2,"I could write an entire essay on why this school is such a mess. From the unhelpful administrators, to the unenthusiastic professors, someone is doing a terrible job at overseeing staff. Website and Eaglelinks are horribly updated. Living on campus is distracting, and more than what it's worth. Dorms are bedbug and mice infected, people host outdoor parties with live DJs at all hours of the night on weekdays. The elevators are always broke. The noise levels are way too loud and never controlled. The shuttle service is unreliable and rarely follows schedule. Because of the location of the school, many members of the community come here to loiter. There is little to no support at sport's events. Many of the tutors available on campus aren't reliable either. Majority of the student tutors sell exam questions instead of actually tutoring you. The math and reading labs are understaffed. On campus dining selections are a hit and miss. You may get a good meal in the cafeteria, you may not. There are some very rude staff in there as well. Many of the people who work in the library or labs are ignorant to technology. These are just some of things I've noted from MY experience. I could say more, but I don't feel like it."
College Sophomore,2,"If you know about West Baltimore, then you know about off-campus housing : )."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything in Baltimore closes so early, all you are left with is carry-out."
College Sophomore,2,"Administration is a joke, they chose to enforce the things that have the smallest effect on campus life."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities aren't to bad but it is the upkeep of them where Coppin falls. Elevators are constantly breaking, theres always a problem with a/c and heating, and lastly our water pipes burst EVERY winter."
College Freshman,2,"As a commuter student, I sometimes eat in the cafe between classes. The food is second best and overpriced! $8 dollars for food with hair in it?? EWWWWW!!!"
College Freshman,2,"Some days it's good, other days nothing at all"
College Freshman,2,Food at Coppin is not the greatest. It seems that we only have a good option maybe once a week. I must say that the cafe is always clean and the workers are always pleasant. The food is sub par and there is never much variety. The cafe also closes a little early for my tastes and when it does you are left with ordering food or eagles nest. We can use flex dollars at grill works and eagles nest but when they are done you have no other options.
College Freshman,2,I had to constantly contact and visit the financial aid office
College Freshman,2,"We need more variety or even more food places on campus, our cafe need to be open longer or even a 24 hour store on campus."
College Senior,2,"The hazing here is ridiculous. I mean like people getting beat up, not showering for weeks crazy. But it sounds like that is apparently normal for the pledging process. Perhaps its normal, but it absolutely still is not a good thing."
College Senior,2,"There are police walking around and there is a police office on campus, but be aware, there is no security or police who is posted at the dorms 100% of the time. That means desk staff( students who work at the front desk) are the dorms' first line of defense. Yes, this is terrifying. if something happens, they call the police rather than one already being there. This needs to change now.

Also, Coppin is surrounded by gang activity and violence. You wont see much during day, but it is not uncommon for students to get mugged while walking around campus at night. I even know people who were robbed at gun point. So basically unless you have a car, it is a terrible idea to leave campus at night. There is not too much that happens on campus itself though."
College Senior,2,"I only didn't give it 1 star because at least there is carpet in the rooms. That's good. But I hate the housing here. Sound level is not monitored. It's not just that people are playing loud music in their rooms; outside the frats and sororities will hire a DJ to come and play music, and it is so loud you will hear it loud and clear in your room. And this wont be at like 2pm. No, they will begin at 9:00pm and go through till 2am. What make matters worse is the library is closed during the week after 11pm and on the weekends after 5pm I believe. So you are stuck listening to this music rather than sleeping or studying. I have complained about it before and was basically told that Resident Life office cannot do something about the noise every night. I say, why not! We are at school, not the club. As I said, loud music from a room is tolerable, but window shaking parties at 2am is unacceptable."
College Senior,2,"The administration likes to baby students. As in, rather than letting us make adult decisions, they make rules to dictate our actions."
College Freshman,2,"College kids drinking and parting everyday of the week. Not something that I'm into, personally I prefer to be around people who are mentally stimulating."
College Freshman,2,"Maryland is known to have the most outrageous weather. The weatherman will say one thing but the exact opposite will happen; its very unpredictable. If the weather was too bad, then it would cause for some events to be cancelled."
College Freshman,2,"Parking is very limited, so limited that freshmen can't have their cars on campus and if you're not a freshman, it's usually first come first serve."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs and alcohol is definitely an issue, but that's with most colleges. We've had some cases where students were kicked off campus for drugs but that just goes to show that drugs and alcohol are not tolerated whatsoever."
College Junior,2,Wireless networks are really weak.
College Junior,2,"In a urban city near a lot of things downtown. However, the school does not really provide much transportation or promotion of local events."
College Sophomore,2,"First off, this school has no spirit.  People barely go to the basketball games or football games.  The workers in the cafeteria and library act like they do not want to do their job; they always have an attitude and act bothered.  The school has a lot of events, but people rarely show, because once again, this school has no spirit."
College Sophomore,2,"Okayyyy, so campus security is only around AFTER a situation happened on campus, or if there is an event on campus.  We have these post around campus, and if you feel like you're in danger you press the button on the post, but if campus police is never really close to campus, how exactly are these post going to help us????  This school is located on North Avenue, which is not the safest place in the world; therefore, we should have campus police located near the HHSB and near open spaces that lead to the streets (which is basically everywhere on campus). I get a ""crime alert"" email too often from the school saying that a fellow Coppinite has been in harms way.  Oh not to mention that everytime I walk past a motion light after class at night, it goes off instead off staying on.  I can't deal!!!"
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office at my school is very slow, although they will help you with any of your needs. Their process of receiving financial aid takes very long, and most students that receive a refund check gets them during the 2nd semester."
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes its good and sometimes its not 
I've had about three allergic reactions here (This has never happened before college)
No variety for non meat eaters"
College Senior,2,"It's typically hard for evening students to find evening placement in the Social Work field, simply because there needs to be supervision from a social worker and not too many work in the evenings.  The expectation from the professors are ridiculous because some actually suggest people quit their jobs knowing that majority of the students are returning students.  I have to have 450 intership hours before I can graduate and we all work for free and sometimes the experiences some evening students have with their placements are ridiculous."
College Senior,2,I'm not too sure about Greek life except that it exists.  I am a student in the evening and unfortunately don't know much about what goes on at Coppin during normal school hours.
College Freshman,2,"It rains, snows, and gets really cold during the winter. But, the classes are rarely canceled. So, that may affect your attendance to classes a lot."
College Freshman,2,"The cafe has nasty food. The only thing I like to eat from there are their chicken patties, fries, fried chicken, macaroni, and stir fry."
College Freshman,2,"I feel the rooms are too small, the elevators are always breaking down (Daley) and the staircase is always dirty."
College Freshman,2,mostly fast food which i dont like so i would stick to the cafe food
College Sophomore,2,I feel they could have better service when helping students.
College Sophomore,2,I Barely See Them – The greek life to me could be pretty fun especialy when you go to the parties and step shows. But when Im on campus I rarely see them. I dont see them wearing their colors or jackets. I think they should be more social and more out there. More into the college scenery.
College Sophomore,2,Punishments Are Fair but Severe – The strictness at Coppin State University can be lenient and sometimes to harsh. I say this because some of the rules at the University should always be followed and most of the people on campus should be old enough to know better and follow the rules with a mannerly conduct. The rules at the campus  also teaches students to be proffessional and dress appropriately. But sometimes I feel as though the rules are a little bit too much and I think college is a way of getting a little bit of freedom and we sometimes dont get that at all. We get some but still get treated like we're in grade school.
College Junior,2,"Dirty People – the people in your sweet might not be as clean as you are. you have to  remind yourself not everybody is as clean as you and, they are just getting their freedom"
College Junior,2,Have Better Organization Skills – WIsh there were more activities involving SGA and student activities involving greek
College Sophomore,2,Me Me – I've stayed off campus and i dont like it. maybe it was where i stayed but it sucked. and from what i've seen thats the way it is around here.
College Sophomore,2,Me Me – I dont think any one cares really i mean it's college
College Sophomore,2,Me Me – it's good for me but at the same time there is nothing to do there no where to eat or go to have fun and the neighborhood is not the safest of places.
College Freshman,2,"Not So Exciting, but Its Suffices. When the weather is bad, there really isn't much to do but to go the the PHEC and stay in the dorms. While in the SASA program, females and males are separated so a group of my guy and girl friends can't really hang out if the weather is bad. 
However, I can say that the power does stay on (even through the craziest of storms)."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Campus does not have a lot of resturant options (Subway, Austin Grill)get tired of eating the same foor all the time thats campus accessible."
College Junior,2,Coppin to Me – Since i have been here on campus it has been a good experience. The cafe options could be vass but  we work with what we have. A negative that i have is that our campus is too open to the public/ non student citizens.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Over Strict – All depends on your RA some are cool and laid back, but others tend to take their job WAY to seriously.."
College Sophomore,2,"Its okay, its only a sub way,the Austin grill sucks and the service is way too long, and the dinning hall is pricey for the quality of the food."
College Junior,2,GOO COPPIN – Athletics will be more wild if people when with their friends. I had a great time freshmen and sophmore yr at the basketball games. But other sports such as volleyball are not advertised. As a result there is a lack of fan support and school spirit. Hopefully it all will change with the new basketball team.
College Sophomore,2,"DC/PG, NY, Bmore, & Jersey – Coppins population is majority from four differents places. Guys from Baltimore wear shell toes, foam posites, and polo everything else. With either a boosie fade or gangsta braids. Baltimore females tend to be very colorful in the hair department."
College Senior,2,you have to look around baltimore to find something to do
College Senior,2,At Coppin State I would say that the athletic teams are very good but once people are on a team some of them start to act as though they are in charge of the entire school which makes people not want to support them.
College Senior,2,Somewhat Safe – Coppin State Police's presence on campus could be much greater on campus especially considering the area we live in. Some of the officers are friendly while others seem very lazy.
College Freshman,2,Campus Is Better – The surrounding areas off campus are pretty rough so it's safer to live on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek My Life – Greek life is there for parties and some other events, but it doesn't dominate. If you are in a fraternity or sorority it is not a big deal. It's nice because you can go to frat parties which are fun."
College Senior,2,"Drug and Alcohol Presence – there is a prevalence of alcohol and marijuana on campus. it is a norm, though, so the cops dont say much unless you make it very obvious. we have a alcohol free and drug free campus though. sometimes students go off campus to do any drugs and alcohol stays confined to rooms."
College Senior,2,"Safety on Campus – Despite the high crime rate of the surrounding area, the on campus environment is relatively safe. However, we are an open, ungated community campus so anyone can walk in. Within the confines of our university and its buildings, not much goes on, simple petty thefts of maybe phones or laptops left unattended. But just several feet away lies the open neighborhood and that is very unsafe."
College Sophomore,2,"Night Life – on this campus, as a commuter, I rarely know of any activities to go OR participate in them. the few that i attended were okay but way below average for a university event &amp; setting."
College Sophomore,2,Printing on Campus &Amp; Computer Labs – printing on campus sucks and could use some upgrading and we are only allowed to little for free before they charge you 15 cents a page. the computer labs are always loud and i HATE sitting in them because you cant focus or hear yourself think.
Niche User,1,"Coppin State needs to consider revamping their Department of Human Resources practices. I applied for a position at the school, had an initial interview by phone and was then asked to attend an in-person interview on a particular date set by the school. I could not participate on that sole date because of a major conflict and asked for another time. Coppin set another date for the interview, then canceled, did not reschedule and never called or emailed to follow-up or explain. Completely unprofessional. I even sent a follow-up email that was never responded to by the school’s HR Department. Do better Coppin."
Senior,1,"First, they offered me a Transfer scholarship as a prospective Junior transferring from a PG Community College. Not only did I not received it, but I had to pay out of pocket, even despite having a high GPA 4.0+. I still owed a balance and they immediately send you to Maryland Comptroller for balancing owing. They have endowment scholarship that in the STEM program and they do not even utilize it help their own students in need. No STEM tutoring resources. Horrible resources for Career service center and lack of funding in many areas."
Junior,1,I love Coppin State University due to the fact that it is an HBCU. I wish the dorms and the cafeteria food was better. The campus also needs to be closed off from the surrounding community for safety reasons. I feel like they should treat us more like adults.
Freshman,1,Extremely unsafe area. The people there are terrible. The only thing i can compliment is the science department
College Sophomore,1,"Easily one of the worst cafe's I have ever witnessed. The kitchen staff is lazy, the cooking is average at best, and for a good 2 months they had us eating with plastic ware. (plastic plates, cups, utensils, etc.) When you pay that much for a meal plan you expect better."
College Freshman,1,If you are a commuter just stay at home with your parents! Housing is expensive! Especially out of pocket. If you can find a great location at a affordable price then grab it and run. Otherwise stay home and save up!!
College Freshman,1,The neighborhood is VERY bad. Students get robbed when they come off campus at night
College Freshman,1,There's no place in a safe walking distance
College Senior,1,"If you are planning on going to medical school, flee from this school! People who go to Coppin have an incredibly difficult time getting in. Aside from the fact that the academics in the science department are so terrible you will struggle (beyond what is obviously normal) with the mcat, support for those other areas medical schools look for in applicants is nonexistant. Or rather, let me say it is beyond disastrous. I say this because  there are professors here who will give you advice about medical school, speaking as though they know what it takes, when in fact they have no idea. For instance, once I once had to explain to a professor, who makes it a point to give me advice regarding medical school, what the AAMC is. That is like explaining to a supposed basketball aficionado what the NBA is. I have been given the advice that there is no need to study for the MCAT as long as you have taken the courses that show up on the MCAT. If you have ever taken an MCAT before, you know that exam tests far beyond content alone. And even if it was a test of content, Coppin would fail you abysmally there as well.

I will include a note, there are 2 professors I can think of on the whole campus who seem to know what they are talking about when it comes to medical school. They also happen to be physicians, so that makes sense. But the most sound advice I can give anyone coming to Coppin who would like to go to medical school is: don't come here. If you have no choice (e.g. finances), be aware that you will struggle. Perhaps consider hiring a private pre-health adviser because, be aware, CSU does not have a pre-health adviser or pre-health committee.

If you do not believe me on this, please go ahead and call Coppin's admissions office, science department, whatever, and ask them how many of their students a year go to medical school. I only know of one and a few honest professors have told me that was the only person to attend right after graduating from CSU in the last 20 years."
College Senior,1,"Barely any majors. And be careful, because what is accredited today at Coppin may not be accredited tomorrow. And the admin is not very open with students about the status of their program. 

The science department is quite simply trash. My middle school had a better curriculum than this. The simple fact that  currently, and for the past few years, an environmental scientist teaches anatomy and physiology speaks volumes. I have also caught profs teaching incorrect material. There is a very tiny group of like 3 professors who are good and qualified for the subject they teach. But aside from that, please go to community college and transfer somewhere else later on. Do not waste your time and money on this terrible department."
College Senior,1,"FYI, I actually never applied to Coppin. I showed them my GPA and SAT score (3.3 and 1810 respectively) and was admitted on the spot. So the application was as easy as it can possibly get. But it is also testament to how hungry Coppin is for even AVERAGE students. Though I do not think of myself as an idiot, I know my stats were not amazing. So I found the fact that they were so excited to have me pretty sad."
College Freshman,1,"It's like they don't want to give you money for school. The staff in the financial aid office are very rude and not professional at all, and very unorganized."
College Freshman,1,"The location isn't so great. There are lots of shootings, and even fights on and around campus. It is not safe at all, people walk off the streets onto our campus from the surrounding and very dangerous neighborhood. Downtown Baltimore is very nice and the transportation such as shuttle buses are great for the students but it's still quite a distance from school. I feel as though the staff, including teachers/professors, are just here because they are paid and generally don't care about the students or their grades. It's harder to keep your grades up because of the lack of support. The overall local atmosphere is very poor."
College Freshman,1,I hate the food here
College Sophomore,1,they are so slow and give to much attiude
College Junior,1,"Barely no scholarships! Very hard for out-of-state students; its double the tuition and no scholarships to accommodate. However, the small scholarships they have are geared to in-state students."
College Sophomore,1,"FINANCIAL AID AT COPPIN STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST.  I GUARANTEE THAT EVERY STUDENT HERE HAS A DIFFERENT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE PEOPLE, SO EXPLAINING WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH THAT DEPARTMENT WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE YOU THE SLIGHTEST CLUE OF WHAT FUTURE STUDENTS WILL DEAL WITH.  ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS LACK OF COMMUNICATION.  EVERY TIME I GO TO THAT OFFICE ITS ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW THAT POPS UP"
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't anything unique about this campus.  The only may be that we have a high school on campus, but thats about it."
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible. We pay for parking passes and STILL there is nowhere to park. I feel like I have been HOODWINKED, BAMBOOZLED...SCAMMED!"
College Junior,1,My reasoning for this grade is because off-campus housing does not exist at Coppin.
College Sophomore,1,"Where do I begin? The people here at Coppin State are so closed-minded about everything.  Most of the people here are cliqued-up and seem uninterested to meet new people once they've already made their ""friends"".  Financial Aid is the absolute worst!!!! I did the Sallie Mae tuition payment plan, but somehow it did not show up in coppin's system, nor did MDCaps money come through, but they are so quick to put a fee on my account for a lost ID card. All this school wants is our money.  We're paying for construction fees thats going towards the new building that I wont be here to see.  I also personally feel like this school is mainly for nursing and education majors, all other majors need to go some place else.  School Spirit...there is none.  Homecoming last year was so dry and week. For crying out loud we had Yo Gotti (a baltimore favorite) Melonie Fiona, and TCB (a DC/PG favorite) come out, but barely any of our students came out, and tickets were only $35!  Also at our rival basketball game against Morgan State, there were more people at our school from Morgan than there were Coppin people. Our homecoming game was dry and weak too.  Food sucks on campus and off campus.  Its better to go down to the Harbor to grab something to eat.  Some teachers here do NOT even know what they are talking about. Campus security barely exists on this campus...this school and neighborhood has too much crime for campus security to be slacking on their job.  Coppin State University is just not the school to go to for a great college experience."
College Junior,1,"The experience at Coppin is one horrible one to remember. I tried to support HBCU's since I'm an African American but the unorganization at these schools are ridiculous. Coppin is by far the worst. The financial aid office doesnt really want to help students. They have attitudes like they're not supposed to do their jobs. I overheard a staff member saying ""I do not want to see ANY STUDENTS TODAY!""  It's the third week of school and my book voucher still hasnt processed. I asked why and they do not know. The lady tells me I need to wait another three business days while it continues to process. Its already been 10 business days! Still no valid explanantion. In addition to this, the school book store advertises GoBank which is a mobile bank account. The sign in front of the book store says that you can direct deposit your financial aid and tuition refunds. Financial aid knows nothing about this and directs me to the business office. The business office says they do not know anything about GoBank and you cannot direct deposit your refund. ????? So who knows then? I demanded to speak to someone who knows. No success. So i head to the bookstore and ask them about the sign and guess what? The lady in the bookstore doesnt know either and tries to tell me how to join and contact GoBank! I'm fed up with the run arounds, unknowledgeable staff, unorganization, attitudes, and the unwillingness to help students. I will do my ultimate best to transfer to another school immediately. Please future students, DO NOT go to Coppin unless you want to deal with  staff and administration that doesn't care about your well being and success as a student!! I could go on about some of the teachers that teach courses they don't have expertise in but I could go all day! Do not come to Coppin! I'm leaving ASAP!"
College Senior,1,We have very limited computer labs available on campus. If you have your own computer than Wifi is the way to go.
College Senior,1,"I am a commuter student and I do not have a lot of insight on student nightlife. However, I can say that there is absolutely nothing going on at night for students in the surrounding area. I know that the students who stay on campus are very involved in soror and feternities and they do have social events and parties for on campus students."
College Junior,1,There is nothing on campus to do for fun. Coppin is known as a commute campus.
College Freshman,1,"No surrounding activities, but you a small mall around the corner from the school"
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms at Coppin State University are pretty fair, the location of Coppin State isn't great, it's in a terrible neighborhood and many kids are robbed of their belongings. Their is no ease to Coppin housing or financial aid or anything for that matter, coppin has terrible customer service in all areas. It's a very small campus so a lot of things aren't offered like at other universities."
College Freshman,1,"When I first applied to Coppin, I was informed that since my mom didn't have a job she didn't need to file taxes. In October of my first year, I was told that she needed to file. Tax season was already over, which means I may not be able to attend school next semester. The people in the office were rude and unprofessional."
College Freshman,1,"North Avenue Dangers – North Avenue is simply not safe. Students that currently attend this University inform me of the dangers of walking around by yourself outside of the school campus. There are plenty of dilipidated buildings, which doesn't exactly scream ""SAFE!"" The campus security is pretty on- point, so I feel secure on campus. However, I don't think I'd ever leave onto North Avenue alone. Also, the only thing to do by this campus is to go to Mondawmn Mall. That's the only attraction around. The campus has a lot of activities, so I can't complain."
College Senior,1,Its a Mess – They get you by providing a great deal of funding for your freshman year then they drastically cut it and give you deadlines on when to pay or you cant register for classes. then they also withdraw you if you haven't had your payment in full.
College Senior,1,"Its Reduiculous – There are not enough parking spaces. if you buy a pass its not guaranteed parking. The majority of the lots are for faculty and the furthest lots from the school are for students. Also, it forces us students to park on the street where there is a high incidence of crime and vandalism to vehicles."
College Junior,1,We do not do anything that sets us apart from other schools. it would be nice to have a presence in the community so that I would be more proud that I go to Coppin.
College Junior,1,Dont See Any – The time I do spend on campus the presence of greeks are not known or seen.
College Senior,1,I Hate the Cafe – The Food on campus sucks to me. They serve the same things over and over again and they just don't know how to cater to the needs of the students
College Junior,1,Very little on campus parking.  All students must have a permit to park on campus
College Junior,1,"There isn't a great amount off parking available.  Tuition is high but, you are still required to get a parking pass.  Many students park off campus and there is little visible security in the evening."
College Sophomore,1,"Our campus is really small, but its growing.. Housing has made single rooms into double rooms just to have more people stay on campus"
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid is obviously very helpful. The only thing that is annoying with the whole process is going to the financial aid office. They basically give you the run around and it gets annoying.
College Sophomore,1,I feel that there is no diversity on campus . You see a few people from different races besides african american. I feel that students can be themselves while here.
College Senior,1,"This atmosphere is not safe. We are located on North Ave in Baltimore, MD."

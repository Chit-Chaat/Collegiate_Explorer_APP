Alum,5,It was easy to take online because some classes had a media site video of what the in class session talked about.
Alum,5,I like that the class sizes were small so that the teachers were able to help us one on one if wee needed it.
Senior,5,"I like the diversity of students and that there are on campus and online options. The campus is well taken care of. The staff is really respectful and helpful. Students life seems really peaceful and productive, for the most part."
Senior,5,Professors are easy to contact online for the most part. Online classes are great because they are recorded but you can also watch them live and interact.
Sophomore,5,"Plenty of one on one time with professors, along with staff that genuinely cares. the campus is beautiful, and actually participates in green living.  Walking around campus you see a wide variety of people, and the university welcomes the differences. I've never ran out of activities to do, and have had the best time here."
Alum,5,"I completed an online distance education program through ENMU. The experience was smooth, support was available and the education thorough."
Alum,5,"Great value for the money. support was available, collaboration existed with students and teachers. realistic timelines for assignments, community projects were flexible."
Alum,5,Utilization of zoom allows for the students to be involved in class discussions as if we were in person! Faculty keeps students involved in lectures and I had very little complaints finishing undergraduate in the social work program
Alum,5,I loved the Social Work program! The Social Work program helped prep me for an advanced Masters in Social Work that I will be starting soon! Despite running into issues due to the COVID 19 faculty remained consistent and I finished on time and prepped correctly!
Freshman,5,I believe this is a good school for me it’s really nothing to do in Portales but you find something to do at the school while you there. It’s a very nice school with nice dorms and classrooms and everyone there is very nice
Sophomore,5,"I was a freshman at Eastern New Mexico Unitversity. I love the campus so much! It is a very friendly campus, and not to mention a small school. The teachers care about you and help you with late assignments. Plus ENMU is affordable they will work with you money wise which is pretty incredible. I was really when i first started going, but i made friends pretty easy. ENMU is the top campus in New Mexico that is safe. Everyone on that campus cares about you. I am very glad i made the decision to go there. I highly recommend ENMU it is a great school to get a degree."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the opening atmosphere at Eastern. There is a place for everyone. I found it very easy to make friends with my fellow students. I play a sport at the school and I have to say that the coaches are so kind and make sure that you maintain grades. My major is animal and dairy science so I have worked around a lot of science and ag teachers. Every single professor that I have met I have loved and adored. they have helped me so much and I can not wait to finish off the remainder of my college at Eastern New Mexico.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the fact that were a small campus.  Compared to other colleges, were extremely small but that's not a bad thing.  Being a small campus helps people like me with a learning disability to be in smaller classes.  The professors do a good job of meeting with students one on one and replying quickly to students emails.  The campus is very nice with a mix of old and new buildings, but they're all in good condition.  I love the library and cafeteria as my study spots.  I enjoy the background noise the buffet as well.  There's a cafe in the library but you have to use flex dollars. 

Overall, the campus is very well organized and the professors are definitely trying their best to help students achieve what they came here to do-learn."
Freshman,5,The people there are very friendly and you can easily get help with schoolwork whenever you need it. The campus is beautiful and located in a small cozy town where most things are within walking distance.
Senior,5,The aviation program has great instructors with many experience. It has been a great experience and would like to see the program grow.
Freshman,5,I’ve had great experiences at Eastern New Mexico. Everyone so kind and sweet special around campus and the town. The teachers are so understanding and actually care for you.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy Eastern New Mexico University. I am currently a Sophomore studying Forensics. Eastern is a very bright school with lost of opportunity and wonderful people. I will say this; some professors are strict, while other are just bad at teaching in general. If I could change things, I would add Blue Light (the emergency towers) to the campus, especially for the late night classes. The campus is in a safe location, but that doesn’t stop the possibility of an event occurring. I would also advise that you know who your lab teacher is in your science classes since some of them are GA’s making it very hard to understand What they are saying."
Freshman,5,"I am starting ENMU in January of 2020, but I can already say that the level of assistance given by each staff member (including student workers) is phenomenal. I can not address any situations pertaining to on-campus living, or classroom experiences since I have yet to begin. From admissions to registration you are welcomed and taught by people who care about your future. I am thrilled to be an ENMU Greyhound. They have their own ENMU Police Department, not campus security, the small town community is quite and quaint, and you have everything you need from church to food to recreation right around the corner."
Sophomore,5,I love Eastern. I love the family feel and the great professors! Eastern has a wonderful program for future educators. Eastern is also one of the most affordable universities. I am a not traditional student and have returned to school after 22 years. I have been welcomed and accepted by all.
Sophomore,5,"It's a very welcoming place, with great student environment. Along with the resources to help students, and the help of great professors."
Sophomore,5,Eastern New Mexico University is a great school! The professors are incredible and the campus is gorgeous! Wouldn't change anything about it!
Freshman,5,"The professors are interact well with each student and they have great connections that students can relate to. They make it easy to understand. As for the campus as a whole, the environment is amazing and it is so easy to get along with other students. The staff is also friendly and helpful in every way possible."
Sophomore,5,My experience at ENMU has been the best college experience I’ve ever had. There are so many things to do and activities going on throughout the year it’s impossible to not have something to do.
Junior,5,The university itself is small but that isn't a bad thing! The smaller class sizes really help when you need to communicate with you instructors. The university offers many ways for academic help.
Junior,5,"It is very small. I like small. The programs and teachers are very engaged and interesting. The facilities are nice, also."
Freshman,5,"I have not attended yet but have heard great things about enmu and am anxious to attend in the fall, I am looking forward to starting my career path, I have chose to become a speech pathologist and I am ready to start helping people"
Sophomore,5,Small college so you get a lot of help from the professors. They care about you and your success. The town is just very small with not much to do but it is perfect if you don't want distractions.
Junior,5,ENMU is a great place to be. It is very cultural and very lively. There is always something happening on campus and everyone is very involved.
Freshman,5,"Eastern New Mexico University may be located in Portales, a tiny town on the edge of the state, but it's atmosphere is very welcoming. Most of the class sizes are small which makes it easier to learn the course material."
Niche User,5,I’ve been there for multiple thing. Such as band and choir and I feel this college will be perfect for me!
Sophomore,5,"Great environment, staff, and professor! People were really nice and my experience was great. My roommates and friends loved their professors. However, my favorite place was the library. Their new library is big, has food, and a great place to study."
Freshman,5,Very diverse and very willing to help you succeeed. All professors are there to help and make you feel like a student not just a number.
Freshman,5,"I've had an excellent experience with ENMU! Their staff is incredibly caring and very knowledgeable. Their campus is thoughtfully laid out. Their changes to the old library is very useful and provides a great place to study, mingle, etc. Go Hounds!"
Niche User,5,Eastern New Mexico is a very good looking college. Ive heard from many others and also seen it on videos how the surroundings and how the student culture are around the area. It seems like when i step foot on campus its going to be a great feeling the reason i say that is because the education is good and the graduation rate is high. If i feel like if i step on campus and off the first feeling (the feeling like home) have me feeling awesome then that's the move for me.
Junior,5,It's very personal. The staff is the most helpful staff. The teachers are looking out for you and your personal growth. They want to see you graduate and become educated people.
Senior,5,"I love it at Eastern! I love how the town of Portales is a small college based town, so it is easy to live here and go to school.  You have small sized classes which help and the professors get to know each of their students, this has helped me do well in classes and be comfortable getting help when I need it.  Not only is the classroom environment great, the administration and students are very friendly and welcoming.  I would change how unhelpful advisors are."
Niche User,5,I met with a college representative a few weeks ago and he was so kind! He made me want to study in this universitg
Sophomore,5,Very supportive and professional environment for learning and furthering an individuals career and provide resources to students who request them.
Senior,5,Beautiful campus. Smaller classes. Portales community really supports the school. Very easy to get around and professors work with student athletes to ensure their success
Senior,5,"Eastern New Mexico has been a great experience for me it has been easy to apply and the administrative staff is knowledgeable and outgoing.  I have been to Liberty U, the University of Virginia, and applied at Western New Mexico; Liberty and Western were a complete waste of time for me. Liberty had great instructor but I was unable to get a set scheudle and regieter for my classes with out major delays from the advisors who were not knowledgeable.  Eastern has been a breath of fresh air for my Mr. Lucero got me what I needed and did it without delay; everytime I need something he is always there and gives me immediate assistance. Great school very affordable and knowledgable staff."
Sophomore,5,"Love it!!  People are great, professional, and loving! I would not chose anywhere else to be! This is such a great place to be! Go Hounds!!!"
Freshman,5,They are so helpful and friendly. Always able to get the right answer to your questions and willing to help.
Sophomore,5,"I love ENMU, they have been so understanding and flexible with my situation. About a month before school started I found out I was pregnant and decided staying home would be best, but I still wanted to attend ENMU. They were able to switch all my classes to online and were more than willing to work with me. It has been a great experience, and am looking forward to finishing my degree there."
Graduate Student,5,"ENMU offers a wide variety of accredited programs available at a distance, aligning exactly with on-campus courses and programs. Accredited by the ACBSP, their business programs offer generalist managerial scope coursework led by experienced and engaging faculty. The distance courses are maintained using industry leading software, and the school has an organized and diverse set of resources available for research."
Graduate Student,5,"Located in eastern New Mexico, ENMU is a beautiful campus, with a diverse student body. The faculty and staff are very attentive and have always been available to help me when I contacted them.  I am currently working towards completing a Masters in Education of  Administration and have found everyone to be extremely helpful.  If you are looking for an excellent four year university with a low tuition, located in a small town with a low crime rate, ENMU is for you!"
Sophomore,5,It's a very diverse community and the people do as much as they can to make everyone feel right at home.
Sophomore,5,"Eastern New Mexico University is a great campus. The campus is fairly small, which makes getting around much easier and faster. The professors are all great and most are very easy to reach whenever. The classes are mostly specific so that definitely helps for the degree you're trying to achieve."
Junior,5,"I am currently a music student enrolled at Eastern New Mexico University. The campus is beautiful. The town is small, but the college could not be more lively. There is always an event going on somewhere."
Niche User,5,I like that Eastern New Mexico always keeps you up to date on what you need for college and what you can do to get in the school. You
Senior,5,"I love the campus, the entire thing is beautiful. I also love how small it is and being able to have a lot of one-on-one time with teachers without having to make a plan weeks in advance. The campus has many things to enjoy like a gym and a pool and all the dorms are lovely to stay in. Teachers remember you after you pass their class and are always willing to help you in future classes."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the easy accessibility of the faculty. They are so easy to reach, even for online students. Teachers get back to students via phone calls or emails super quick and walk ins to talk to your advisor are very common. Small classroom groups also make proximity easier and encourage in-class interaction and discussion."
Freshman,5,It was amazing! Small classrooms that aren't overwhelming to you and your professors. They also give you the opportunity to have one on one time with your professors in case you need help on your assignments.
Freshman,5,"Eastern New Mexico University is fantastic.  The faculty is generally amazing, and their clubs and organizations are great.  The only issue I have with ENMU is that not a lot of help or information was given to me about financial aid.  I found out about scholarships that are available only to incoming freshman when I was registering for my second semester and no longer eligible for them."
Freshman,5,Everyone is their to help you and fun activities and is a really good school you get to meet new people from different back grounds the teachers are nice and students and teachers help you with anything you need
Senior,5,"Eastern New Mexico University is the perfect combination between a small town college and a large university. I fully feel I was able to have a healthy and fun college experience, while still being close enough to home to see my family, but far enough away to find my footing as an adult and easily pursue my career and education goals."
Alum,5,I was awarded a full ride scholarship to play football at ENMU. I was hesitant at first coming from a big city to a small town but the charm and friendly people make it inviting and it grows on you. I miss it now and intend on going back at some point and potentially retiring out there and opening up my own business.
Sophomore,5,"I am so glad I choose to attend Eastern New Mexico University for my bachelors degree in social work. ENMU staff is very helpful whenever needing help or I was confused about something my freshmen year they helped me out as much as they could. I love the enivorment on campus it is very welcoming, very good environment for students who may be home sick. I highly recommend this university to every future college student especially ones who like that one on one with their teachers."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the friendly atmosphere of Eastern New Mexico University. It is a small school, therefore, you connect more personally with the professors. I myself have connected with many of the professors, and when you connect with a professor the information that they are providing begins to just flow through your mind, it becomes very easily retainable, and makes the entire college experience just that much more awesome. I have learned a vast amount of knowledge from Eastern New Mexico University, and it doesn't show any signs of letting up. I love this school."
Freshman,5,"Right away I knew that ENMU was the right school for me; from the moment I first stepped foot on the campus I felt welcome. It's a good sized school that as a home-like feel to it, much like the feel of the town I went to high school in. I am definitely looking forward to making tons of great memories at my new school."
Junior,5,Eastern New Mexico University is composed of a diverse student body in an easily accessible area. I have found that it provides all of the opportunities needed to be a successful student and ultimately a successful human.
Senior,4,"Due to COVID-19, everyone is required to take online classes. Overall, some professors are doing well and some aren't; it really depends on the class and professor. 

But the online learning experience is pretty decent"
Senior,4,"It's a good school to get your undergraduate degree at. This university is pretty laid back, providing a really nice environment for freshmen and sophomores. This is not to say that ENMU is not good for juniors and seniors, but just to reinforce that this school is perfect for new students."
Senior,4,"For the most part, I loved the people here at ENMU. During my time here I was blessed to have built lifelong friendships and connections. Additionally, I enjoyed the fact that the professors here are more than willing to work with their student. That was at least the case for me."
Sophomore,4,"when switching to online classes there were some difficulties, especially when it came to classes that relied heavily on in person assignments. While many of my professors may not have been prepared for the switch, there were some who took it in stride and were fully prepared."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern New Mexico University is a beautiful campus, the school is a great school and offers a variety of programs. The culture of Portales and lack of things to do, takes getting used to, great school if you want to focus solely on academics."
Senior,4,"As an online student, the course curriculum and learning objectives have helped me on my way to becoming a licensed social worker.  However, the online accessibility can be hard to work with sometimes, through both Blackboard and other sites and functions."
Freshman,4,Eastern New Mexico is in a small town so it is easy to get to know your peers. The campus is easy to get around. Great learning experience.
Freshman,4,"ENMU is a small campus full of friendly and supportive. The town is small, but the school host many events for students entertainment. Lots of school spirit."
Senior,4,"I have loved my experience with ENMU thus far. I have learned so much as a long distance student and most professors are great at responding and assisting with anything I have needed. I gave them 4 stars only because I have had one teacher that made my experience a bit rough. She was too unorganized to be teaching an online class. These type of classes require the professor to be very organized, otherwise it makes it difficult for the student to get anything out of the class or follow along."
Freshman,4,"Eastern New Mexico is very inviting, the teachers are great at their jobs, and has a good atmosphere."
Freshman,4,Well from my stand point I can't say I would change anything because I am going to be attending Eastern New Mexico University in the fall. But after a visit and talks with the coaches and staff I can say that this campus is very welcoming. It feels just like home.
Sophomore,4,"Enmu has a beautiful campus with a very active student life, in my 2 years here I have really enjoyed all it has to offer, the only reason it hasn't gotten 5 stars is because most of the roads have large pot holes."
Senior,4,I would recommend ENMU to any student looking to pursue a higher degree. My entire Bachelors program was made available online. Most of the instructors taught multiple classes so it was helpful to see familiar names. The workload was manageable while maintaining a full time job and taking classes online. Very satisfied with the overall cost of the program. I did not ever physically step onto campus and my degree was mailed within one month.
Freshman,4,"The campus is perfectly suited for people that do not prefer the large, crowded, party scene. ENMU has many courses that you normally wouldn't be able to find   in larger colleges"
Senior,4,The online classes are amazing and convenient and the advisors work with you quite well. The campus is beautiful and overall visually appealing. I would definitely recommend people to look into this college.
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, good professors, affordable, friendly atmosphere. I have enjoyed attending here. All departments,I have had contact have been helpful."
Graduate Student,4,"The price of tuition should have this school with more enrolled students that it does at the moment. I am in a graduate school program, which is harder (in a good way) than most big name school; however, low professor numbers keep classes from being offered every semester."
Freshman,4,"I recently finished my freshman year of college here and I love it. The professors are understanding and are willing to work with you if you need. The campus is beautiful, and there are tons of activities on campus to do each week. I love my college experience thus far, and I highly recommend you attend!"
Senior,4,Eastern New Mexico is the perfect small campus school.  Everyone here in Portales is so friendly and very welcoming to all the students in town.  It is easy to find where your classes are located and all of the classes don't have many students in each.  This provides a more one on one connection with the teachers as well as the other students in the class.  The teachers are more than willing to help you do your best and can help you get on track to finishing your degree.
Freshman,4,"At Eastern New Mexico University, the professers are very kind and helpful. The class sizes are typically small, making it easy to communicate with your instructors and receive help. They have some really great online courses as well and the school full of friendly people. What I would like to see change is a more helpful experience from the advising center as it is kind of difficult to schedule out your major plan as they make this seem more difficult than it should be."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy this college very much. I feel safe here, the academics are excellent, and everyone in this town is very kind. The campus is very beautiful, green grass and trees are everywhere. Families walk their dogs and children ride their bikes around campus daily. It’s a very family friendly school. There is always activities going on around campus, it’s a very pleasant place to be."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the setting. The campus is often very quiet and the community is very respectful. Due to the small campus it is more than likely that one has seen the majority of students. In addition, professors are very understanding and will often try to help you the most that they can. The one thing I would like to see change is the food options. While the food that is offered mediocre, there is always room for improvement."
Senior,4,"I first was an employee at the college in the health services department. The staff on campus are friendly and helpful. The student body is very diverse, as this university is one of a handful that welcome students from many different countries. It is rated high in the nation on the Anthropology program, only miles away from where the ""Clovis Man"" was discovered. The Allied Health Services have also received very high reviews. The Speech Language Pathology program is exceptional. I am currently working towards completing a Bachelor's in Nursing (BSN) degree.  The university has built the BSN and MSN program from the ground up, and have improved each year. If you're looking for a 4 year university with a home town feel, low crime rate, and very attractive tuition, this is the place for you."
Senior,4,"Overall, I am absolutely enjoying my time at ENMU. The teachers are very attentive and have always been available to help me when I contacted them. Also, the campus is beautiful! I wholeheartedly recommend ENMU because it has everything I was looking for in a college experience."
Freshman,4,"Overall, ENMU is a fun, small campus. For the price you get a safe campus, a strong education, and a tight nit community. If you're looking for a small, safe campus to focus on your education, this is your ticket to it."
Sophomore,4,"The university itself is great, but the surrounding town can be a downfall for those who aren't used to small towns. Many degrees and programs to choose from, and the professors are great."
Niche User,4,"I love the staff they are full of excitement and are really motivational. There can be improvement in the dorms. The RA's need to be more demanding, alot of stuff gets returned damaged."
Junior,4,"Great university! A sort of hidden gem. Fantastic anthropology program, the entire department is virtually flawless. The campus is well maintained with some beautiful buildings. It's difficult to come by an unfriendly person in the entire town. Only complaints are that it's in middle-of-nowhere, bible-belt New Mexico, and the campus food could due with some improvements. I'm so happy I chose Eastern! The small campus and welcoming atmosphere are perfect if that's what you're looking for!"
Freshman,4,It is an amazing college. They are so friendly and the college helps you with anything that you are having trouble with. They have been helping get through most of my toughest times.
Niche User,4,"very clean campus with lots of activities for the students and help centers. Great place to learn. I would have changed some of the policies for the dorm rooms about having kitchen supplies, forks, knifes, etc... to be allowed."
Alum,4,"I loved the class sizes and the relationships you could build with your professors. The school emphasized learning, and the music program was especially amazing. One thing they could improve on is their work to retain professors. All of my best and favorite professors stopped working there either during my three and a half years or soon after. They were amazing professors who moved on to greater things, and I think Eastern needs to try to realize what they have before letting such wonderful mentors and educators leave their midst."
Senior,4,"I love Eastern, small classes and great over all atmosphere. The teachers work close with you. In result you have a better chance of being sucessful!"
Freshman,4,"My first year of college and I felt more than welcomed. I felt like I was visiting family! The professors and faculty in every building and encounter were more than helpful and very kind. They helped me with any question or any confusion. Though some classes were harder than others, I could ask any questions at given times and be granted with a sense of comfort and understanding. I really loved the feel of campus and the helpful hands of the people around me, faculty or friend."
Freshman,4,"I have to say I really enjoy Eastern New Mexico University, being that they do care about student success and doing everything they can to help them achieve that goal. The campus is well taken care of and the people are all very helpful and respectful. The only downfall of this university is that it does not offer a variety of fields to pursue careers."
Junior,4,I love the friendly atmosphere here at Eastern. The only thing I would like to see change is some new things being brought to the campus. It is very traditional and a lot of people don't want to see it change. Also needs more restaurants. Other than that I love it!
College Sophomore,4,I am very confident on getting a degree from ENMU
College Sophomore,4,I have been having a few struggles with a few classes but the professors are great.
College Sophomore,4,"School spirit is a huge part on campus! everyone collaborates with the student activities specially is they involved sports, sororities or fraternities!"
College Sophomore,4,I would definitely choose my school again. not only because everyone is so friendly and welcoming but because the academics are great and there is just so much to do. School keeps me busy and its what I love to do.
Recent Alumnus,4,A variety of sports and facilities are offered to students.
Recent Alumnus,4,My experience at this school has been a positive one overall. My school is unique because they have partnered with the Roswell Independent School District in an effort to certify more teachers and fill the many empty positions in the district. They have opted to discount courses for students who enter the program as RISD employees.
College Junior,4,I have never have any problems with the security.
College Junior,4,I believe this is a great school because it is in such a small town
College Junior,4,So far I really like this school. I believe it will be a great school to graduate with my BBA with. I am a little nervous because it is a little expensive and probably will be more difficult because it is higher level classes.
College Freshman,4,Excited for what I am studying
College Junior,4,Campus has great resources for this.
College Freshman,4,"Eastern is great, it just is difficult going to school in your home town."
College Freshman,4,The CDIS program is great. They offer sign language!
College Freshman,4,I lived in Curry for a semester before living in my sorority house. It was good. The key is getting to know people on your floor and you'll never be lonely.
College Freshman,4,The teachers I've encountered care about their work and the campus is beautiful. I was a little skeptical when none of my friends came here and it seemed so big but I was able to join a women's fraternity and that has got to be the best thing I've done besides exceptional grades here at ENMU.
College Sophomore,4,Campus is too dark at night and feels unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors have been great, some do not connect with students as much."
College Sophomore,4,I have heard that dorms are not the best. Guad is good
College Sophomore,4,We do not have a lot of variety.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not involved in any, but this is sport oriented school."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors, classes and the school is all great."
College Freshman,4,"Living in Guadalupe hall, I have made a lot of friends and enjoyed my roommate. The RA's host a lot of events to keep the residents entertained, and tend to our needs or requests to the best of their abilities."
College Freshman,4,Small town school with fun and challenging academics
College Senior,4,"As a non-greek I can see how Greek life on campus adds to the lives of those who enjoy a Greek life atmosphere, but the Greeks do not push themselves on non-greeks. Overall, I'd say that our Greek culture on campus is very positive for all concerned."
Recent Alumnus,4,Very few dedicated number of students who attend the games. Would be great if there was more involvement from the students to attend games.
Graduate Student,2,"I started off very successful and able to manage my two classes very well.  I scored high and everything was fine.  For the following 4 classes after that everything changed.  I had teachers that were not willing to answer questions in a timely manner, one teacher who claimed I never took a Test - when I certainly did, technical glitches, and was forced to fight my way through unfair grading through appeals that were denied.  Absolutely no help when you need it.  If you're comfortable with online school and need no help at all, then this is for you.  If you rely on teachers to teach and knowledge to be shared, then I would go somewhere else. I've wasted money on this school and cannot get that back.  They have ZERO understanding and will NOT work with you AT ALL."
Niche User,2,"Great food and school spirit, had an English professor that told us one thing and gave an F for following directions, good resources, super small town in the middle of nowhere."
College Junior,2,I haven't seen anything regarding student career prospects. My degree doesn't seem extremely valuable because no one has explained to me what jobs I can get from it.
College Freshman,2,"Blue light is a program that needs to be implemented on campus right away. Look it up.    While the police drive around campus a lot, they generally only bother the kids who are just playing around and aren't actually doing anything wrong. The police are more worried about speeding than anything else. The cops are kind of a joke. They mostly only mess with the black population, which is just disgusting that police are still so racist."
College Junior,2,We live in a town completely devoured by fast food chains and greasy spoons. It's easier to get processed meat on a bun than it is a salad.
College Junior,2,"It's a long, painful process with weak results."
College Freshman,2,Needs a revamp. There needs to be more food added into rotation. Dinner on the weekend have terrible food. Hours are not the best they need to be open longer.
College Sophomore,2,The cops here bust you for the most stupidest thing ever...
College Sophomore,2,the parties use to be good but not anymore. Not much options for parties here
College Senior,2,Not too many options to choose from. Choices get boring after awhile.
College Sophomore,2,I don't qualify for financial aid even though i need it
College Sophomore,2,"The biology department sucks when you are starting out. There are student teachers for the labs, and they are not taken care of. equipment is broken, and its hard to learn."
College Freshman,2,There is hardly any good looking girls on campus. There are more guys than girls as well.
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do here unless you drive to Lubbock or alb.
College Senior,2,When weather like snow happens most the time campus is closed because they don't have the proper way to clear snow in a timely manner in order to stay on schedule.
College Senior,2,"When I started at Eastern health services was always open and can usually help you out, now they are non-existent and that forces you to go off campus."
College Senior,2,"Cost is higher than most, and selection is limited!"
College Freshman,2,the interactions i have had with the security is i fell like they hurias me and my family
College Freshman,2,half of the computers in the libary where not hooked up to the printer. the wifi is slower than the computer
College Freshman,2,i have to take out both of my loans so that i could go to school and its just the long process. now my student account says that i owe mony to the school
College Sophomore,2,"Portales is a very small community and there is a military base near with not enough housing, so the options for college students in this area are pretty limited"
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is a very beautiful. Some teachers can be snobby at times, and so can many students. The police on campus are some what not helpful. Example of my freind needing help and as he was approching the police car, he just drop off. Some cops think they are to good for anyone. When the case needs to be them helping, not judge on who to help?"
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are very few choices for restaurants in Portales, you have your typical fast food places (burger king, McDonald's, Subway, Sonic) and a few national chain sit down places (Cattle Baron, Pizza Hut) and mostly locally owned places. The variety is decent and many offer student discounts  but most places close fairly early. If you want more recognizable national chains (Applebees, Chili's etc) its a half hour drive north to Clovis."
College Freshman,2,"There is an okay choice of off-campus dining in Portales, but the pricing isn't very good unless it's fast food. The best priced restaurants in town are the Chinese buffets."
College Senior,2,"Portales is a tiny town, so it doesn't have a lot to offer. Nightlife is pretty limited."
College Senior,2,"Rodeo is big here. Football team isn't any good, but neither are NMSU or UNM."
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms at Eastern were horrible the first semester because we lived in Bernallio but after the new dorms were built it has been the best dorms that i have seen at all the campuses i have been to. The only reason why i gave a C was because the dorms were supposed to be finished a long time ago but instead we had to suffer a semester in Bernie
College Freshman,2,"There are only two professors teaching for the political science degree. I have taken a class with both professors. Dr. Acheson-Brown is helpful to anyone, who takes the time to talk to him. I do not like the amount of content, which is being graded on. In Political Science 101 Intro to Political Science only has 3 test and 1 paper on your choice on a political leader. Dr. Acheson-Brown is quite opinionated. The other Political Science professor is Dr. Strickler. Dr. Strickler has boring lectures in American Government, and the accompanying text book is not interesting either. Dr. Strickler is anything but ecstatic in helping here students. The assignments for American Government class is tedious. Also, the class requires in class essays, which are hard to write about. The classes for my major are not always offered every semester, and some classes are only offered ever even year during the spring. The workload for the class are rather spread out. I was not really concerned at any point about time management. I would not recommend anyone in obtaining a degree in political science."
College Sophomore,2,The dorm room in the upper classmen dorm are rediculously tiny. Not having the option to choose meal plans really messes with some peoples income that may not be able to utilize it as they should do to work and other issues. Things would be much easier if students that lived on campus could still choose to have the meal plan or not.
College Student,2,"The school is great, and if you find the fraternity that matches your style (the two are very different) you can have fun. However, Portales is a small town, and unless you don't mind going about a half-hour to Clovis, you won't find much entertainment."
College Freshman,2,"Portales does not have much housing available and especially to students. With a limited budget, it can be hard to find something suitable to your living needs."
College Junior,2,The off-campus dining is very close and cheap but the choices are less than plentiful. You have BurgerKing and McDonalds and than a few other similar choices across town.
College Sophomore,2,"Eastern New Mexico is situated in the middle of the New Mexican desert, hours away from any other form of civilization; But with that in mind, it's not too bad. The campus is constantly watered, even in winter, in order to maintain a light texture of green in the grass. There is little to no social life, so you need to stick with people you know in order to stay socially involved. Greek life is poor from what I hear, as everyone complains about their parties.  There are few hangouts in ENMU apart from the dorms and cafeteria."
College Freshman,2,"Not a Great Greek Place – Portales is a religious community. The Greek life is a pretty wild scene in the area and often distracts students from their religious studies. Plus, there is not that many houses to pledge so no one cares if you are in one."
College Sophomore,2,"Hot, Windy, Dry – In general, the weather in New Mexico sucks. I can say so much because I've lived here my whole life. In the winter, the temps are typically in the 50s during the day and sometimes will reach below freezing at night. Snow is a rarity, as is rain. The summers are terrible if you don't like 100 degree weather and no rain. Not to mention the dirt storms that can completely cover you up-- remake of the dust bowl anyone? However, if you enjoy such weather, this place is perfect for you."
College Sophomore,2,"It Depends on What You Are Expecting – Just so long as you're not expecting much; I would qualify 99% of the eating joints in the area are definitely a ""C"" average."
College Sophomore,2,There are lot of computers available and they are pretty fast.
College Sophomore,2,Night life is better for people 21+. Hard to find parties unless it's rush week
College Senior,2,Dorms Are on Campus – The dorms are limited and I did not have great experience first semester of Jr year in them
College Freshman,2,"Good but Not Amazing – The food at the campus dining is good, but not that amazing. The food is usually not greasy or old, but it isn't as good as I think it could be. I like eating there but not all the time because the food gets old fast."
Graduate Student,1,There is no experience.  Nothing gained.  I was an A+ student until I ran into the wrong teachers and everything went south for me.  Very odd that I was mistreated like that ALL OF A SUDDEN.
College Junior,1,I believe we do not have one.
College Sophomore,1,"They mess up your paperwork, don't give you time to fix the paperwork before awarding the scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing opens up before 9 and nothing stays open past 8. We have 1 bar and a walmart. The only reason the town has anything going on is because of the college.
College Sophomore,1,New Mexico Is super windy. Walking across campus in 30 mile an hour winds is super hard.
College Freshman,1,the RA's in our hall try to write people for every little misteak
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is fine, but not for me at all."
College Freshman,1,"I wanted to be in the Greek life, but it would have cost me $1,000 just for the first semester I entered in. that would have made it more of a financial burden just to be in something that should have been fun"
College Freshman,1,there is only two bars and only one local around the campus. other than that is no night life in portales
College Freshman,1,"Portales is a nice small town, but there is nothing here to do unless you drive 4 hours to albq and 1 hour to lubbock"
College Freshman,1,"You could not even tell if there was a gaming going on that night near the campus, unless you were to ask someone that was in the actual sport."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life i feel is only there to throw parties. They seem really snobbing and just act like jerks sometimes. Its not such a big deal  if you dont join, but of you do you will most likely get alchol alot and drugs. It might be for some people but not me."
College Junior,1,You either have your own vehicle or walk.  There is no public transportation in Portales.
College Junior,1,The only public transportation in Portales is the P.A.T. or Portales Area Transit. You have to call to arrange a ride at least 25 hours before you need it. Beyond that students at ENMU can call saferide to return to the college if you get stuck somewhere.
College Junior,1,Social scene/campus life: There are bullies here who enjoy kicking around people who are different. They say hateful things that make people cry. Several students have seriously considered switching schools because of this.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is really small here at ENMU there are two fraternities and two sororities. Both frats offer housing but space is limited. The community looks down at people in Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,"DEAD aka NOTHING to do unless an athletic team wins and you know a player to invite you. One known party house, and if they dont have a party, you are out of luck. Everyone leaves on weekends."
College Freshman,1,"School is HORRIBLE – Going to this school was the WORST decision of my life. There is nothing to do on weekends, everyone goes home. The dorms are dead as well. Most non-athletes are extreemly strange. Town surrounding school is trashy and run down. There is NOTHING to do unless you are willing to drive an hour to Clovis, and even then you will be bored. Their mall has NOTHING and the restaunts are HORRIBLE besides Chilis. If you are looking for a town or school to keep you busy and have fun and party, this is NOT for you. Being a social kid myself i thought small town could grow on me but no, I hate it and will be transfering ASAP."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't a whole lot to do. Frats have parties pretty often and there are a few local bars. ENMU Safe-ride picks you up and takes you where you need to go, safely. It's confidential and always available."
College Sophomore,1,The only night life in Portales are parties. They usually only happen during the weekend and they are really crazy because there isn't a lot else to do so a lot of people drink a lot. There are no clubs and there is one bar. I am under 21 so I don't really no about it but it's called the Doghouse.

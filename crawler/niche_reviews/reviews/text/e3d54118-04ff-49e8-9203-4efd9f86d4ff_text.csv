Junior,5,I love being at LSSU. The professor’s truly care about your success while at the same time not letting you short yourself. I am in the CJ program and love the flexibility to my schedule.
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at Lake Superior State University has been great so far! I have met great friends and the class sizes are small. As a result, I get great one on one time with my professors. The learning is more hands on rather than research based. Great college!"
Alum,5,"Loved the campus view looking over the International bridge.  Great professors, and located in a nice small city!  I made lifelong friends!"
Sophomore,5,"Lake Superior State University is a great choice if you are looking for an affordable campus and tuition! I love this campus not only because it's beautiful, but because it is a close knit community. you know not just faces, but names of almost every individual within your program. There is a lot of one on one interactions with faculty and classmates that make it incredibly easy to acheive your goals and be successful!"
Senior,5,Its great because its small and the teachers are here to help you achieve greatness. I love the ability to walk to a profs office hours and they know who you are.
Freshman,5,I am starting LSSU in the fall. So far my experience has been great. I have been welcomed by the academic advisors and the campus life staff. They have assisted me in picking out my classes and have been happy to answer any questions that I have. I am excited to be a Laker
Freshman,5,"I like the food and overall experience I gain from just being in the campus. The classes are small which is perfect for a person like me/student to professor ratio and how small the campus is. Osborn Hall is cute and small but the bathrooms could be redone compared to how Brady Hall looks, but I don't mind too much."
Freshman,5,"AN INTIMATE UNIVERSITY, STAFF TO STUDENT RATIO IS APPROXIMATELY 1 STAFF PER 17 STUDENTS WHICH CREATES AN OPTIMAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND MORE PROFESSOR AVAILABILITY FOR EACH STUDENT. oFFICE AND ADMISSIONS STAFF ARE VERY HELPFUL AND WELCOMING TO NEW STUDENTS. THE UNIVERSITY HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF ACADEMIC MAJORS."
Sophomore,5,Lake Superior State University has given me the opportunity to make life long friends. Some of the professors go above and beyond to help their students succeed.
Sophomore,5,I love the area. The professors are amazing and very encouraging and want you to succeed.Being so close to Canada opens you up to so many amazing opportunities. I have made s many great friends during my short time here.
Sophomore,5,Just getting out all the time and trying new things really made college a lot more interesting. Need to do the studying and use all the resources that is given to you.
Senior,5,I love the area and the people that attend the university! The overall community allows you to experience the university to the greatest potential. I love the professors and all the people that help make the community better.
Sophomore,5,"Lake State offers a unique and personalized experience. Smaller class size, friendly and willing professors, and the geographic experience - when all combined, create an ideal college environment that not many other universities offer."
Freshman,5,"One thing that I really like about Lake Superior State University is that the people here are quite kind and fun to be around, in addition to the fact that the teachers here are also quite understanding, and are good at teaching their subjects."
Junior,5,"Great school, just has little things, but love the school I’m general, love the city and outdoor life here and all I can do with my degree, the fishing is great. I enjoy the small student population where everyone knows everyone. Some professors aren’t the best but you can’t have 100% of your professors be A+ professors"
Niche User,5,"I'm not currently a student, but will be starting in Fall 2019. My family and I took a tour of the campus and were pleasantly surprised by the small size of the campus. The location is great and I can't wait to start!"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman this year, and I have had such an incredible experience already. The professors are extremely helpful and actually teach both lectures and labs unlike other universities, and therefore, it can give the students one-on-one time with their professors. The Lake State environment is indescribable with how much the professors push their students to success. It is very encouraging as a Lake State student knowing that everyone has the same potential to succeed. In addition, Lake State has many hands-on opportunities, unlike other universities, that helps students understand theories and concepts. The labs really aid students in gasping all the knowledge that they can while providing the students with outstanding hands-on applications."
Sophomore,5,"Lake State Superior University is a close knit school. They community is welcoming and friendly. You can visit us for a week and become very well known with names and faces. They lecture classes are a smaller size compared to most universities, which allows you to have that one on one communication. It's a great university to attend if you want to feel at home at all times."
Sophomore,5,Lake Superior State University has been a wonderful experience for me. I immediately got involved in campus activities and groups which helped make me feel like part of the University. I also was able to meet people which helped with the transition to a school that I knew no one . Getting involved is extremely important for a successful experience.
Senior,5,"LSSU has been a great school to attend so far. The most amazing thing this school has to offer are the personal relationships you will make with the faculty. These relationships open up many opportunities for success. The only thing I would change about LSSU is the requirements to pass basic math classes. The final grade you have acquired in the class does not matter unless you pass the final exam with at least a C average. I do not believe in this because some people, like myself, simply do not test well, but have no issues completing homework and class work. I feel as though the final grade should be a combination of your final grade in the class as well as your final exam score."
Junior,5,"It's a great school. The small class sizes are nice, it makes it easier to get to know classmates and the professors. The campus is also very nice."
Sophomore,5,Lake Superior State University is an amazing college in Michigan if you are looking for a small but helpful school. LSSU allows most of it's undergraduates to work with technology (especially in the science field) that most graduates get to use. Not only that but they ask a senior research projects and allows many opportunities to work with professors to be published!
Freshman,5,lake superior has supportive professors and impressive atheltic facilities. The college is based just below canada and the area has excellent transport links to surrounding areas. the university is cheap and provides a range of outdoor actvities and events. The athletics teams on scholarships are provided by good sports facilities for training and match preperations. the professors and students at lssu are friendly and look out for freshmen and help if anyone has a problems on and off campus.
Niche User,5,I love the campus life at Lake Superior State University. The students and professors are wonderful to talk with. Even the area alone is an experience in and of itself!
Junior,5,At LSSU students have opportunities to learn in many different areas. The classroom sizes are small and you get to know your professors and other students. There are always events going on and it’s just a cool place to get your education.
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed myself for the little bit of time that I have been there. Sault Ste. Marie is a nice town. It does get a lot of snow in the winter time so if you do not like the winters  this may not be the school for you.
Niche User,5,"My experience at Lake Superior State University was incredible, all of the staff are extremely kind as well as the students. LSSU is a place where an incoming freshman can feel welcome and accepted to a new environment. While on campus, I witnessed students having a friendly snowball fight and got to speak with the professors that will be instructing me in the fall. Not only are they all warm hearted people, they took the time to learn my name."
Junior,5,"The Lake State community is so welcoming. I came in as a transfer and from the very start, I knew that this school was where I wanted and needed to be. I recommend this university to anybody that likes the small town and small community feel in the university they desire to apply to."
Junior,5,Small campus that you can walk across in a matter of minutes. Small class sizes and each professor gets to personally know students. Senior project required for each student which helps for research purposes after school. Campus located right next to the St. Mary's River with view of the international bridge.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are small enough that the professors know your name and personality reach out to help you. They make themselves available and care about your experience
College Freshman,5,The health care center is almost completely free and has free counseling services available
College Freshman,5,The small school atmosphere makes it easy to connect with your professors and classmates to get the help you need
College Freshman,5,"It is generally a crime free campus, and seems to be pretty safe."
College Freshman,5,There is virtually no crime on campus and campus security is very quick to respond to anything that does happen.
College Freshman,5,"I don't live in a traditional dormitory, but rather in a house devoted to chemistry and environmental science majors. It's a great community that fosters close friendships and healthy study habits."
College Sophomore,5,Public Safety is great. They have a strong presence on campus and I feel completely safe walking at night from the library.
College Sophomore,5,I am in Environmental Science - Chemistry concentration. All of my professors are super approachable and helpful. They all hold open door hours and are incredibly inviting and always willing to help.
College Freshman,5,"If I could go back and redo it, I'd come back to this school every time."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is just so friendly and open. It's hard to not have a good time there.
College Junior,5,I have done my own financial aid since I've been in school and its an easy process and it doesn't take long at all!
Junior,4,"The school and staff is excellent and the location and experiences it offers are great. The school is underfunded and is constantly finding ways to cut funding from students as well as increase tuition rates. It is widely known as the cheapest state university in Michigan, and it shows."
Freshman,4,"It is a great college for any person seeking a Degree in Natural sciences. Many of the Professors are well known in there fields. the area is great for outdoor activities, with being right next to the St. Marys river there is great fishing for students to participate in, also being close to Canada allows many students to explore to wonders of Canada. The food at LSSU inst the greatest most days but is rapidly improving."
Sophomore,4,The campus life is alot of fun for the outdoor student. The food is terrible and needs to be changed.
Senior,4,"Lake State has an amazing small campus feel. It's possible to get to class from any of the dorms in just five minutes! (If you're determined enough. Ten is more accurate, but speedwalking into class can be really fun!)
 All of the professors are amazing and really know their stuff. They are often available and it's possible to form a really close relationship with them. The professors are also super passionate about what they're teaching, which makes a huge difference when you're trying to learn a hard subject. 
It's also really easy to make friends on campus. There's clubs, sports, Greek life, intramurals, and you get to know your classmates in general! There is no way to walk across campus without running into at least one person you know.
Don't let the snow deter you, this is a great place to go to school and make life-long friends!"
Junior,4,The biggest factor drawing me to LSSU was their professor-to-student ratio. They are one of the smallest public universities and I think this has had the largest positive influence during my time here.  The one-on-one time with my professors has improved my coursework as well as allowing me to create close relationships with these professionals that will last indefinitely!
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the location, the small university feel, and the opportunities I have within my major to succeed."
Freshman,4,Love it here! Classes are small so I am able to speak with my professors whenever needed. Love the community they build here and everyone here is able to help you.
Senior,4,"So far so good. It has your horrid professors like any college, but they are small and have a lot of programs to help you graduate on time.  Its like privet school class size for public school prices."
Freshman,4,"amazing college, with an extremely beautiful campus. When it comes to academics you do need to be scared. The professors here are trying to make sure you pass. They have many study opportunities to help you when you are struggling or even if you would just like some extra practice. Friendly people and located in a gorgeous town."
Niche User,4,Lake Superior State University is a wonderful place to learn and grow. There are many opportunities available to make new friends and share ideas.
Junior,4,"I loved the small campus and getting to know my professors and colleagues! I was given a lot of opportunity for hands on experience and I think that really helped me in my program of study. The area is small, but it is a beautiful place!"
Freshman,4,"The faculty here are very attentive. They make sure you have everything you need to pass the class. Some professors are better than others but they try and accommodate. The campus is nice, not too long of a walk for building to building. The food here is not that great but it is edible."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Lake State is the campus and population size. All of your classes are less than a 10-minute walk. Because of the population size, it made it really easy to make friends. I also like our university's activities. There is usually always something to go do on campus. Such as paint, watch a movie, see a comedian or performer, etc. That is why I really like Lake State."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience at Lake Superior State University has been good, or as good as expected.  The dorm rooms could use some work to or renovations, the professors are great, especially with the small atmosphere and the student body is very supportive."
Freshman,4,"Lake Superior state university was the only college i considered going  to after I visited, the smaller campus size was my favorite thing about it."
Freshman,4,"The professors are very welcoming and helpful.  One of the worst things about the university is the weather, and lack of plowing and deicing at some points.  It seems like a very friendly university with a diverse range of programs to choose from.  There are plenty of programs and evens to go to, from sporting events to movie nights, and craft nights, there is an event for everyone.  Also, there are plenty of resources for students to succeed in their classes, if you're struggling, there's free tutoring and all of the staff are very helpful.  There are also tons of perks from becoming a student, anything from free tickets to sporting events, to free access to the SAC, and discounts to the majority of the businesses in the area."
Sophomore,4,"It’s a great campus and the teachers actually care. The campus is a great environment for learning and bonding with others. The academics are pretty good; and I fell like I’m always learning.  Very glad I picked this school even if the winters are terrible
The dining and dorms could be improved but other than that I enjoy going to LSU; I’ve had a very good experience thus far in my education. And I would recommend the school to many others"
Junior,4,"I love the LSSUs  community.  I believe that most students are passionate about lake state. The students are passionate about hockey, academics, athletics and campus activities as a whole. I enjoy the professors here, I believe they are setting me up for the real world in the best way possible. Lake state gives students plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. There are a lot of clubs and intramural stocks keep students involved."
Freshman,4,"The food has been improving with Fresh fruit.  However, the dorm are lacking in Osborn, not cleaned, lack of supplies, everything is old."
Senior,4,Good educational program. Met some great people. Had some great professors. Enjoyed the hockey and basketball games. Nice area to go adventuring
Junior,4,I like the small community the surrounds and supports the university. Through certain experiences and encounters I have had it has made these 3 years and am excited to make in the following one.
Freshman,4,"Came from a very small town, hoping to have a similar experience in collage was not disappointed. Professors are are always willing to help out and office house have honestly saved some of my class grades."
Junior,4,it is a nice little college where you can get a good hands on education. The human resources department is very well and handles things in the upmost professional manner
Junior,4,Lake Superior State university  is a very good school for academics but the Sault Ste Marie Michigan area is pretty bland with very little to do. Unless you like to do a lot outdoors. On campus there is a good deal to do but the food kind of sucks and the dorms are super sucky.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the small college feel, you feel like you could know everyone if you wanted to. I enjoy watching the hockey games with a great team to root for. There are a few great activities around campus if you know where to look."
Sophomore,4,This campus makes you feel at home. The faculty and staff want to make sure that you succeed in your time here as well as in your future career. They get to know you on a personal level so that they can help you to the best of their ability.
Alum,4,"It's a small university and needs some work on the academic side. Some programs are awesome while others are lacking in opportunity, especially with the advising. Some people have had to stay an extra year or two due to advising problems."
Alum,4,"Great school, teachers go above and beyond and spend hours with students outside of the classroom. it is a wonderful school and has some good student clubs. The downside is don't expect an exciting local community."
Alum,4,"Great student community where the school and professors will take the extra time to help out every student who puts in the effort. I later went on for my master's degree, but it all started at LSSU. I'm very grateful for my experience there and all the great professors in many different departments."
Senior,4,"Grown in this area for years and finally attended the college after completing high school. Large, but not too large campus. Was overwhelming at first, but adjusting was very easy as my advisors and professors and friends I made along the way helped me love this college with all of my heart. There has been major changes to the campus from clubs to a new president. Fun activities to do on campus and sometimes off if you're the drinking age. Being close to Canada helps when you want to go see a movie since it's literally a block away to the International Bridge. I recommend not eating from the cafeteria, but the chefs have learned from past experiences to connect with the students more with suggestions and comments cards. Overall, great university with humble standards."
Alum,4,"The faculty is incredible and so personally involved. The administration has been lacking, but we just got a very promising new president, so here's hoping things improve on that end. Summer courses finally available"
Alum,4,I had good experiences with this University an love the psychology department that is there. This place has helped me grow more than anything else and I would not take back going there for the world. The school does have its flaws (mostly financially and other department issues) but my experience there was good.
Junior,4,"I like how the school is s small school because I am from a small town. it is nice to know people that you see around the school. You are not just another kid at the school. Most people know most people. The professors are very conncted to there students and try to help them in there best ability. I would like to see more diversity on campus, it is good to be around people from all over and diffferent cultures."
Sophomore,4,I'm very happy with my decision to attend Lake State. This small campus gives you a more one-on-one relationship between students and faculty. I've made some amazing friends while attending this school.
Junior,4,"I love that Lake State is a small campus. You don't have to travel the whole city for classes and since there are less students you can work with professors one-on-one more easily. I've had my share of annoyances with the way some professors are or how the university my have handled certain situations, but overall I wouldn't want to have gone to college anywhere else."
Junior,4,Great professors! They truly get to know you and help you throughout college life.  The school is small so it is easy to make friends and find clubs. It offers a lot of help for all classes.
Senior,4,"Overall I have had a great experience at LSSU, the only complaint I have is it’s so expensive and finical aid won’t help you very easy. I can see things are changing though. I enjoyed my time at LSSU and wish it wasn’t over, but will always remember everyone I met and will be back to visit."
Junior,4,"The campus is small and great. The people are very friendly, specially our Canadian neighbors. We have a wonderful town that has many resources in it."
Senior,4,"Lake superior is a small campus, very easy to get around. But this means you'll meet more people and connect with the professors more. The town is small too so it's not too bad finding somewhere to go, especially bring right on the border!"
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshmen here at Lake Superior State. In my short time here I have had a tremendous experience. There is so many resources on campus that are created for student success.
Junior,4,"Overall it's a good school. I just wish there was more to do on campus; I have been here for three years and nothing has really changed. Other then that I like it, classes are small and professor will know you by name. There is a lot of services that they offer for students that may be struggling."
Freshman,4,Lake Superior State University is a school that is great for studying science and mathematics. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and the faculty is extremely committed to helping the students. 
College Senior,4,"With all of the recent gun violence, it's sometimes difficult to really feel safe on any campus. That being said, I feel that LSSU has really gone the extra mile to ensure that their campus is safe for all students. I was especially impressed by the school's decision to create a mandatory online course regarding sexual assault/safety hazards. I've never been to a college that has openly addressed these serious issues before."
College Senior,4,"Overall, I have had a very positive experience at Lake Superior State University. Even before I was accepted into the program, the staff was very welcoming and helpful. Since joining the program, I have greatly enjoyed the diverse teaching styles of the educators and the wealth of knowledge they are eager to share."
College Senior,4,"I have not spent enough time at the main campus to make a definitive statement, but I did enjoy the time I was able to spend there. The staff and student body are courteous and welcoming."
College Senior,4,"As a student who has attended the university through a sister college, I have had limited experience with the athletic facilities on this campus. I have heard from other students, however, that they are exceptional in quality."
College Senior,4,"As a non traditional student with chronic health issues I have found LSSU to be more than accommodating to my needs. The teachers are friendly, educated and honestly invested in the well being of their students."
College Junior,4,I used the main gym every morning before breakfast. The morning crowd was very encouraging and accepting of all forms of dedicated fitness newcomers.
College Junior,4,"I love the nature that surrounds the campus. Even though the metropolis of Sault, Canada makes it seem like an industrial area, if you drive even 10 minutes away you're met with waterfalls and animals of all sorts. The teachers care about the students opinions and drive for education. The school is getting older, but the old military feel makes it quite cozy."
Recent Alumnus,4,Everything went very smooth. Small school. Everyone is an individual!
Recent Alumnus,4,Great school! Professors care for you even after you graduate!
College Freshman,4,Lake state has a diverse major program with many available careers in the area especially for fisheries and wildlife and fire science which both have a huge impact in the community
College Freshman,4,I'm not too familiar but I hear they are always doing fun things!
College Freshman,4,The gym is great with a full sized Olympic pool open for laps
College Freshman,4,The cost low comparatively speaking
College Freshman,4,It's a small campus to easy to maneuver and find your classes! Small class sizes are helpful!
College Freshman,4,"It's not a bad school, all depends on when you are looking for."
College Freshman,4,"They are recognized for their highly respected nursing programs, and mostly science based program.s"
College Freshman,4,"before we could sign up for classes we need to take a safety corse about drugs, alcohol and peer pressure"
College Freshman,4,i am fully comfortable with walking around alone
Freshman,2,"I like how small the campus is, everyone knows everyone. But it’s not worth what you are paying for."
Niche User,2,"I was fond of the class sizes, the teachers, and the students. I was, however, not thrilled with the atmosphere or the location. Yes, the location is favorable for wildlife research, but the school itself was not impressive. It is built from the skeleton of a military base, but that is exactly what it feels like. The buildings are all brick and square. As soon as I visited other colleges, I immediately was enchanted with their buildings and grounds compared to LSSU. My moral of this review is to apply if it has your specific major, but don't put it as your priority. "
College Senior,2,"Aside from Rush Week, there is little indication that Greek life exists on campus.  The occasional bake sale is about the only reminder that fraternities/sororities exist.  Non-Greek students are indifferent towards Greek students, as the Greek organizations are low-key.  There is no Greek housing at the university."
College Senior,2,There just there for a paycheck very few actually care about the students
College Senior,2,There's not much to do. School blows money on useless things and students always seem like a last priority
College Senior,2,Not a high enough attendance
College Freshman,2,"From what I have heard from other students, the cost is pretty expensive."
College Sophomore,2,Your insides will hate you after eating quarterdeck food
College Freshman,2,Greek life is seen like a joke to most students at our school who aren't in greek life themselves. There is no dedicated Greek housing and there isn't much heard of what the greek groups even do.
Recent Alumnus,2,Everyone drinks and sleeps around
College Freshman,2,"There are a two main parking lots for off campus livers to park, but without a pass you're better off walking. The main lot fills up fast, and the second lot is a tad bit of a walk, but if you keep looking you can usually find a decent spot"
College Freshman,2,"Don't live off campus, but those that I know that do say the choices are limited and the cost reflects that. There are a few complexes/buildings but most are a short distance from campus so a car is a must"
College Freshman,2,"Only a couple of full access (allows all students) computer labs. Most cater to students of a specific degree program and will not allow others. Limited number of computers in library, but the printing is best. Unlimited pages, although they hate when it's not double sided and squeezed as much as possible onto each side. Signs say ""show ID"" but nobody ever enforces it"
College Freshman,2,"Not a wide diversity. Stereotypical white college in a white town. If you're anything but the heterosexual Caucasian, you may struggle to fit in with everyone"
College Freshman,2,"Few ""clubs"" but most people just go to Canada because they can drink at 19"
College Sophomore,2,Living in the row houses. The house of falling appart and mold growing all over. Its far cheeper to live off campus. The rules are some times inforced but to get some one (like an RA) to solve a problem… well goodluck.
College Junior,2,The network is horrible and goes out a lot. The labs also have a hard time with the internet. The computers never seem to be connected to the printers.
College Freshman,2,This is a small school in a very small town. A lot of the students were born and raised here. And because it is in the upper peninsula of Michigan there is very little diversity.
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of clubs that let in 18 year old and older but they are usually empty and there is a heavy emphasis on ""and older"" there are a lot of older guys that prowl around the clubs looking for younger girls to hit on."
College Junior,2,The greek life is there but not really a big part of campus. They live off campus because they got kicked off for ruining their houses
College Junior,2,The weather during the winter sucks! It is usually in the negative degrees and this school refuses to close even if it puts students' safety at risk.
College Junior,2,Financial aid doesn't work with students on getting them any aid. They look at the FAFSA and thats all
College Junior,2,Public safety is really only there to give people stupid tickets
College Junior,2,"It is cold most of the time. The roads are never fully plowed, which makes it a hassle to drive anywhere if you don't have 4-wheel drive on your vehicle"
College Sophomore,2,Its not a party school.
College Junior,2,"If you live on campus they have a bus at certain times Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Otherwise that is the only transportation available to students."
College Senior,2,"The cost of living on campus is extremely expensive. There are different fees that have to be rendered upon entering into campus housing. On top of all the other expenses that come along with being a college graduate, housing cost a pretty penny for individuals that need room and board. On a more positive note the dorms look very nice from the outside. The landscape really compliments campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,We only have one dining hall because it is a tiny campus. The food gets old quick and can be pretty gross usually. They do however have a sandwich line which is pretty good and have pizza everyday. We also have two other places to get food on campus. One is a grill but the food is pretty gross and then a coffee place that has sandwiches and bagels.
College Freshman,2,"Considering the location of the school, the nightlife in general isn't very active. Granted, there's one club and a couple of bars but that isn't very unique to the Soo. There are parties at the Frat and Sorority houses, but they often tend to be exclusive and just a bunch of people standing around talking- and doing nothing else."
College Sophomore,2,I received some financial aid but scholarships are scarce depending on what your major is or where you attended high school. There are a bunch of scholarships for those who attended high school in the Upper Penninsula
College Senior,2,"People often make fun of the Greeks. I personally have not had any interactions with anyone, so I certainly am not one to judge, but they definitely have negative connotations associated with them that I don't care for."
College Senior,2,"There is plenty of housing; however, the landlords are not the best and can be very cheap with fixing things up. The prices are pretty good though for being on a college budget."
College Sophomore,2,Small Secluded All White School – Lake State is small and very secluded so there is not much diversity.
College Sophomore,2,"It's not an issue of price that is of concern, it is where you are allowed to park. Different grade levels are given parking spaces and I just don't think it should be like that. The parking lots aren't of very good quality either. Parking is a nightmare on some days and good on others. I just think something should be changed."
College Freshman,2,"The permits are not too expensive. Public safety tickets for parking in the wrong lot and parking outside of lines. It's annoying but the tickets aren't expensive. You don't really need a car on campus you just have to make friends with someone who has one. On the weekends there is a bus that goes into town and can take you anywhere you want. Some lots never have spots like O Lot. If you are a freshmen guy have fun ""walking"" to H Lot."
College Freshman,2,Greek Students...What Greek Students? Im not familiar with greek life so i really dont know. Obviously it doesn't dominate the school because i dont know too much about it. I would assume our school as a few greek frats and sororities along with houses for them but i'm not really into that kind of stuff so i never asked around about them
College Junior,2,EFC Estimate – I got far less financial aid this year as compared to last year. They increased my estimated family contribution to a nearly tripled amount. This is a very big inconvenience for me because my family is in no position to help out more than last year or even at all. I pay for all of my tuition as it is because they are just in too much of a hard time to help me out. I work as hard and as many hours as I can to support myself.
College Freshman,2,"Drugs are not a huge influence on campus, with the exception of typically the male freshman dorms. Its not uncommon for police to be checking out those dorms and finding marijuana and alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"The Savoy can be fun. It is just a typically club that you'd see in any town. College kids normally will go there on the weekends after a hockey game. Our transportation in minimal during the nights, so everyone has to find a ride. There isn't as much to do up here, but it just makes me study more."
College Junior,2,I find it puzzling that there are parking lots on the other side of campus... for the commuters.... so you have to walk across four lanes to get to your class. im surprised no one has been killed or hit by a car. Other than that major problem everything else is good.
Sophomore,1,I’m am currently a sophomore in mechanical engineering.  The professors are extremely helpful and honestly care about student success. The campus life is fun and active.
Freshman,1,"I don’t like much about this place. There isn’t much to do in the city, study environment in the dorms is terrible, the food is bad for you and makes me feel shitty, the sidewalks are terrible."
College Freshman,1,"Below zero most days from November to March. Snow flys from September through April, if not longer."
College Junior,1,It's hard for me to get financial aid because of my dad's salary. It's hard for him to pay for it because he is a single parent with more than one child in college. 
College Senior,1,There are not many attractions here in the city. The city is a very small town and many local business are close together so there is never a real far commute to get where you are trying to go.
College Freshman,1,"There is close to no one that is different from Caucasians. We have some differences in sexual orientation, but very few. It seems like most everything else is typically the same. I wish there was more diversity here so when I start working with other people in the ""real-world"" I will be more used to it."
College Sophomore,1,"I love how much room and places there are to park, however I think we should be able to park as close to our classes as we want. I think that senior's and freshman should be treated the same. Senior's shouldnt get better parking just because it is there last year. I feel it should be fair. Teacher parking should be assigned but student parking should not."

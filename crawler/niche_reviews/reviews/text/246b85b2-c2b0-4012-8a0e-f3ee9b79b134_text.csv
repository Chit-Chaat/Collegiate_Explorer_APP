Senior,5,"Schreiner is the perfect university for students looking to be involved, there are countless student organizations to be apart of and events to go to.

The faculty and staff at Schreiner truly care about the individual success of each student and make Schreiner feel like home."
Senior,5,"Schreiner has been fortunate enough to offer in person courses this Fall.

In addition to academics, Schreiner has offered countless virtual programs and experiences for students to take part in."
Senior,5,"I am a current senior at Schreiner University. At first, I was not a fan of Schreiner because I had unrealistic expectations for what a University should look like without me having to do any work. Once I realized that I would need to reach out and join student organizations, find work, etc I fell in love. SU has so many resources available on campus from Learning Support Services to Meaningful Work and internship programs. It is a great community and a beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,So far everyone is very nice and respectful. They have fun events every week and you can actually win stuff.  The professors are very welcoming and the campus is just beautiful.
Freshman,5,Online classes have been simple and easy if you do your work on time. Professors are very helpful if you don't understand a lesson and will get back to you as fast as possible.
Freshman,5,"My first semester at Schreiner was a dream come true! Everyone there is extremely nice faculty and students included. I really enjoyed the small classroom setting because I could ask questions and really be a part of discussions. The second semester was a little crazy because of the virus but the school handled everything with class and made the transition to online classes smooth. Overall I really enjoyed my first year at Schreiner, go Mountaineers!"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Schreiner University and before online classes had began, I thought it was going to be really difficult as a student who had never taken online classes. I was not familiar with that kind of learning, and my professors had little knowledge of teaching an online class. Everyone was sort of struggling trying to figure out their new regular routine but once we had it figured out, it wasn’t as hard as I expected. My professors made it easy to get help and they were always open to have a 1 on 1 conversation with a student if they were struggling. The kindness and dedication the teachers at Schreiner University have, has helped me pass  all of my classes this semester through these hard rough times for everyone."
Freshman,5,"I think it’s a great school because it’s smaller than regular universities. Because it’s a small school , you get so much help and opportunities to better your grades or GPA which really helps a student. The community is very nice and welcoming and it’s a great environment for a college student to further their education."
Freshman,5,I love all the professors so much. They all care and will take the time to help everyone in their office hours or even in general. The small campus feel is nice for the most part and it just feels so comfortable.
Niche User,5,"Campus was extremely beautiful, very traditional, and just what I was looking for to make me feel at home."
Freshman,5,I love Schreiner I only wish it was slightly cheaper to attend. The campus is small and amazing. the country side really makes the campus a real beauty.
Freshman,5,"Schreiner is an amazing place, especially for a people wanting to experience new things. I will be attending this college I’m the fall, but I did have a campus visit and a talk with many people who to there, everyone loves it. I’ll be competing in track and field events for Schreiner University so I’m exited to see how that turns out."
Sophomore,5,I love the campus of schreiner and everyone is very welcoming. Although the school is a little pricey I love it there and the teachers make sure you get the help you need if ever you do
Sophomore,5,"I liked Schreiner university because of the class size, it was small enough that you got that 1 on 1 with professors. The amount of opportunities to get out there and meet new people by attending conferences is beyond amazing, I went to two conferences and learned a lot about how my degree can do different things and I'll never be tired of it. The school also gives you many opportunities to join a club or organization around campus and there's always various of activities going on around campus every week."
Sophomore,5,"I have only attended for one year so far, but theres no other school I would rather be. I am given a million resources that I use almost everyday. The professors are amazing and the one-on-one time is very helpful."
Alum,5,"Loved my time here - made a connection with staff who went above and beyond to help me out of multiple issues. 

Great faculty and a caring place. It’s a small school and they live up to their promise. It’s not easy but it’s worth it!!"
Freshman,5,I like the teacher/student ratio is small. Everything on the camup is reachable by walking.  Mentor/advisor is assigned to the dorms.  I have two mentors assigned to help with studies.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I have had an excellent experience with Schreiner. Being a commuter I was worried I was not going to feel apart of the school, however after joining various activities I am. I am currently on Career Advisory Board and the competitive cheerleading team. When I was a freshman, they had no spirit team and I was a little disappointed, however, since then they have now started a program."
Junior,5,"Schreiner is a small, Liberal Arts College with a student population of appoximately 1300.   This size encourages an engaging relationship between faculty and students and encourages students to explore alternative academic courses outside their degree plan.  
The size of the school is a benefit in many  respects, but the opportunity to take a variety of courses is limited due to the faculty size."
Senior,5,"I have grown a lot in my time at Schreiner University. I have been provided opportunity after opportunity to become a better me. I have been able to be a leader in many organizations, and give back to my school's community. I have had the pleasure of working on campus, and the staff you work with are phenomenal. The professors are outstanding and really do care for the students. No school is perfect so of course there are areas that can be worked on, but the school has done tremendous amount in the past 2 years to get the school well equipped for its students. At times it seems like there may not be anything to do, but there is always something happening on campus, and Fredericksburg is 30 minutes away and San Antonio is 45 minutes away. I always tell people ""You get out what you put in"". This statement is so true on our campus, and I am excited to say I will be graduating from such as wonderful school."
Freshman,5,"Schreiner is an amazing campus. It is both, beautiful and safe. Everywhere you go, you see people you know. It is such a tight community and the professors really do care about you and your grades. If you are looking for a true home away from home, Schreiner University is the way to go!"
Alum,5,Schreiner University is great small and peaceful college located in the beautiful hill country. It is a great social environment to be in. A lot of activities students can get involved in.   The small classes make it easier to get one on one instruction from professors. It is however a bit costly but they work wit you best they can. Overall the education is great and i would highly recommend looking into Schreiner University
Sophomore,5,"I like that Schreiner University is really dedicated to their students. For example there are student tutoring sessions, professors make their office hours welcoming to any student that might have questions or concerns. It is really a welcoming place."
Junior,5,"I've been at Schreiner for almost 2 full years now and I've made the most of my college experience. Since the classes are so small, it is easy to get the one on one help from professors many need during this stressful and confusing time in our lives. There are so many ways to get involved and make your mark on campus. Schreiner University has amazing faculty and staff that are here for us and are dedicated to making our 4 years, as quick and easy as possible. Schreiner truly is my home away from home."
Freshman,5,Schreiner University is an amazing college that presents students with a multitude of opportunities to grow and succeed. Small class sizes allow for one on one communication with professors and tutoring opportunities. This campus has allowed me to grow as a person and I couldn't have chosen a better place to spend my four years.
Niche User,5,I liked that the campus was small and their classroom sizes were 14:1. I like that teachers are more involved in their student's education.
Niche User,5,"Automatically walking onto campus, the presence of the student body was impeccable. I always felt welcomed and began understanding the college perspective better. Through this, I feel that with the campus being small, the overall adjustment will be easy for those looking for the smaller campus."
Freshman,5,Schreiner is a friendly campus all around (students and staff) and provides many opportunities for students to be involved and prepare for the future.
Freshman,5,"Absolutely beautiful campus, lovely staff. One of the few colleges I've seen that genuinely cares for its students. They really want you to succeed here."
Niche User,5,It's a small school.  I really like how the people and everyone is. very accommodating school I like it
Sophomore,5,Schreiner University has an impress faculty support system. The classes are engaging and professors make sure to engage students with the use of technology and current events. Schreiner has a diverse community which aids in the education of different cultures around campus. Schreiner also offers many opportunities around campus to offer students the best tools as they enter the work force.
College Sophomore,5,Schreiner staff is always willing to help anyone out!
College Sophomore,5,Security is always patrolling the campus by foot and vehicle at all times.
College Sophomore,5,Schreiner has helped me with every step in becoming a successful student.
College Senior,5,Ive had a much better experience at this school compared to the last because it's smaller and the people that staff it genuinely care about each student's success.
College Freshman,5,Everyone makes sure we are striving and getting the most out of our degree plan
College Freshman,5,"The career center is the place to go when searching for internships and other work. All you have to do is ask, and someone will be there, helping you with resumes, on finding internships, etc. They work with you, and all you have to do is ask."
College Freshman,5,"The courses and professors are excellent. The professors actually make an effort to work with their students, and are willing to meet with students privately to help them understand anything they may not understand."
College Freshman,5,"I greatly enjoy attending Schreiner University. Due to its smaller size and smaller student body, you become more then just a number to professors. You are someone with a name, who attends their class, who does their work, and who converses with the professor with getting dismissed. The programs here are amazing, and the faculty works very hard on making sure students are getting what they need in order to be successful."
College Junior,5,"If you are not looking for a huge school where you are just a number than Schreiner University could be for you. I love the small classes and how easy it is to approach and meet with your teachers. Everyone is on a first name basis and everybody knows everybody like high school, but more mature. Recreational sports are big on campus as well as getting out and enjoying the beautiful hill country that is Kerrville."
College Sophomore,5,i get to meet so many people because it's a smaller school and i'm pretty involved.
Recent Alumnus,5,The financial aid people are awesome and help with whatever they can. They have provided me with more financial aid when I thought I couldn't come up with all the money.
College Freshman,5,They are determine to help me. Great people!!!
College Junior,5,This is a great university that is family friendly for graduate students returning to school.
College Junior,5,"There are a lot of apartments close to campus, but most students live off campus unless they are commuters or seniors."
College Junior,5,The unique thing that sets Schreiner University apart from other schools is that it is a family oriented atmosphere. Every knows each other and even if you have never spoke to someone on campus in your life you know their face. We all know when someone new shows up to campus.
College Junior,5,"The most attended event we have is Bingo. This is held every month on a friday and there is usually people busting into that building to play bingo. We have chances to win gift cars to Wal Mart, I HOP, subway, whataburger, starbucks, ect. There is also chances to win toasters, TVs, household items, ect."
College Junior,5,The scenery is the most beautiful in the Texas Hill Country. This town is home to the most beautiful views in Texas. We are about 45 minutes from San Antonio so if you don't feel enough attractions you can go there and have the city life for a night.
College Junior,5,I have lots of favorite food places off campus. We just go a new Thai food restaurant. It's very very good.
College Junior,5,"A lot of people, like me, study outside so thats pretty nice. Schreiner offers peer tutoring where anyone enrolled in the school can receive free tutoring from a paid student that is educated in that subject."
College Junior,5,"I'm a communication major. Since this major is so broad and general the faculty offers a wide range of classes from interpersonal communication to public relations. The classwork is not easy, but the teachers are available to help you know how to study for tests. Upon your senior year you are required to get an internship that will help you get into job world and be a more worthy candidate with your experience from college."
College Junior,5,Living on campus has created some of the best times of my life. I have met so many people. Most of the people at Schreiner are laid back and very friendly because it's such a small atmosphere. I had trouble with a roommate one semester and the residential assistants did everything they could to fix my problem.
College Junior,5,"Schreiner is a very small university compared to other universities in Texas. It is very family oriented and it is a good place to go if you like knowing a lot of people. The amazing thing about Schreiner is that the professors provide one on one education and they really do care about your education, as long as you do. Schreiner also offers workstudy jobs in almost all of departments on campus such as admissions office, wellness center, or the library. These jobs are unique because they allow to study and get paid at the same time just for showing up for work. The last thing I would say about Schreiner is that it is a small campus and everything is easy to get to. Security is very good and everyone on campus feels very safe. Both women and men jog around campus at 2 a.m. and do not feel uncomfortable. I couldn't imagine receiving my undergraduate education from any other college. I'm so thankful for Schreiner University."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The classes were so interesting and fun, and I loved being in the Choir. We traveled to Germany and Ireland!"
Recent Alumnus,5,The professors in the Psychology department are some of the best. They expect a lot from you but the work load is less than the sciences.
Recent Alumnus,5,The professors are awesome and they care about you. They know your name and you aren't a number. There are also great study abroad opportunities.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved my program and if I had to do it all over again, I would and I would pick the exact same University"
College Junior,5,It's not like this school is completely sports-minded.
College Junior,5,It has its ups and downs but other than that it's perfect.
College Junior,5,They have a wide variety of majors. The classes would  be the same ones that are prerequisites to most graduate schools.
Sophomore,4,I would like to see more funding go towards the students rather than go towards a new hang out spot on campus.
Sophomore,4,Teaching online is difficult and this is the first time many of the teachers had to teach online so I cannot give a fair review to this section.
Senior,4,"From my experience with COVID-19 and summer classes, the online system is pretty great. We use Canvas and Microsoft online for all of our classes. Most, if not all, of the professors, know what they are doing and only a few who were thrown into it because of COVID-19 struggled."
Junior,4,"My experience at Schreiner has been challenging in both good and bad ways. I can say I've met some of my life long friends, and have also learned to grow even more independently. I am a transfer student so I assumed it would be hard to adapt into a four year university, I was very wrong. The school has made it super easy to function in both sports and academics. I play for the university soccer team and also go to many of the events the school holds. Schreiner is not a big school which I personally like, it is a welcoming community as well as the town it is in. It is very challenging academically but so worth it when you are super close to graduating. The resources the school holds are so much more than any other schools I've heard of."
Freshman,4,I personally don’t enjoy online classes of any kind but because of the virus I was forced to transition to all online. My teachers were quick to take up the challenge and maintained a challenging learning experience. The classes were clear and well organized.
Freshman,4,I am a student athlete and Schreiner has been a great process. I love that the school is small so that there is a higher chance of relationships being built. I love the traditions that they have and the campus and town is very pretty.
Alum,4,"Professors are so so so dedicated to the students! I believe that, though in the middle of Texas, there is great diversity in the education."
Junior,4,"The administration here are all very nice, teachers all care about their students and their progress in their classes, the students all help each other get through classes. It is a very caring community."
Freshman,4,"Schreiner is a great university with a lot of great professors and fun options to enjoy while you are there. I like the location, it's a small town with a good amount of outdoor activities to keep yourself occupied."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus! My tour guide was amazing and I really love the small school setting. Everything was extremely nice and I could see that being my future home.
Niche User,4,I went there for a program and the place was very beautiful. It seemed to hold a lot of tradition and history. The classrooms were slightly cramped and technology was limited however.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Schreiner University so much. The school provides a like home environment with self driven students to become apart of the community. They offer so many opportunity for students to be involved around campus. From their sports, to many student activity events and their intermediate sports, Scheiner University really stands out from any other private school. If anything I could change, I wish the school would become a D-II division sports school."
Junior,4,"I like a lot about Schreiner hoe it’s a small school and easy to be able to reach your professors when you need to. If it was a bigger town that would be better but it’s a safe school with very nice people and great professors. I’ve been able to learn a lot here and hopefully it will help me to reach my goals that I have for my future, I love playing soccer her to but overall schreiner Is a great school and I really enjoy it"
Sophomore,4,What I liked about Schreiner University is the outdoor landscape of the area. It’s a small school which is great for people who want to connect with their professors on a one on one basis. The people are very nice when meeting you for the first time. What I like to see change is the cost of attendance because that could be offsetting for people who cannot afford it.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are allows there to help and have a genuine interest in the progress and success of the students. The food is fantastic, we even have our own Starbucks on campus. The college is very involved in the community and our campus is always getting new resources, buildings and materials. The only bad thing i have to say is how slow the resources centers such as the Accounting services office are to do anything. It is almost impossible to talk to anyone because they always seem to be closed on at lunch, and when you do get stuff to them it can take over a month to get any type of confirmation or reply back, which is killer on deadlines."
Freshman,4,"I like Schreiner University for various amount of reasons. The atmosphere is very polite and helpful, everywhere you go you will always be treated with respect and have someone always being polite. Also another reason why I like Schreiner is how small the class size is, you are able to have that one on one with your professor and learn materials better."
Freshman,4,"Schreiner University is a great school to attend too if you are interested in a small school and prefer a one on one feel to the teacher. I am very happy with my decision to attend to Schreiner. The people here are very kind and the environment is very positive. Also there is little to no drama, making Schreiner a very calm school. Overall, Schreiner University is a great school."
Graduate Student,4,I like that Schreiner University is a small campus that provides various opportunities for growth and a student that wants to be involved has that chance to do so. The professors really do care about the welfare of the students and the campus does provide the right opportunities for success. Even though that the campus is expensive the finance department did help me discover various ways for me to earn money to pay for school. The campus is surrounded by the beautiful hill country with lots of deer and very good river spots to have fun at.
Sophomore,4,"Schreiner University is a small school, but they are very invested in their students. They make sure you have the resources you need to succeed. There are so many opportunities for study abroad, internships, and jobs that they are more than happy to help you achieve. And they're very good at helping you afford them. While it may be a private Presbyterian school, they are very openminded and have a niche for people of many different religious (and nonreligious) backgrounds, with little emphasis being placed on religion as a whole. Schreiner is very focused on making sure everyone's voice is heard, and they have a very healthy culture of diversity for such a small school. It's a very personal experience, and one I'm glad to be a part of."
Freshman,4,I like the diversity and the friendly environment at Schriener. but I think there should be more activities added on campus.
Freshman,4,"My experience so far has been very welcoming. There are lots of resources here on campus, so you're never alone- from help with your homework to finding a job after college. One thing I wish would change is the miscommunication a lot of teachers seem to practice."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the home environment and that everyone accepts you like family. However the food program needs to be changed all together it seems as they always serve the same foods.
Freshman,4,This university was very welcoming during orientation. The students are nice and friendly and the staff says hello when you pass by them. The students are prideful of their school. The environment and the atmosphere are easy going and easy to get used to. The town has enough to offer and there are things for students to do.
Niche User,4,the campus is beautiful and clean! really recommend this university to someone looking for a nice close knit community!
Sophomore,4,"The school is amazing, housing is great and people here want you to be here. They help you so much with financial aid but the school is still really expensive. The athletic games are really fun to go to because kids get really into the games. Academically they hold you to a high standard and what you get reflects your effort."
Niche User,4,"When I went to the university it was very nice and open, as was Kerrville. The academics and classes were also amazing. If they needed to change anything itd be the tuition fees"
Junior,4,"I love how close knit the community is. I went to a 5A high school and you just get lost in the crowd. Here, you're really some one and the professors know you by name and over the 4 years you're there you really get to know everyone. It's easy to get involved on campus to stay busy. There's not much to do on campus, or in Kerrville. It's pretty quiet and tame, so it's easy to stay focused on what really matters. I would recommend anyone come here, provided they have the funds to attend. Because it is VERY expensive. "
College Sophomore,4,You'll have a diverse group of friends here
College Sophomore,4,No one ever pressures you to do anything.
College Sophomore,4,You are never seen as a number or a paycheck.
College Freshman,4,"Great housing, just a bit expensive."
College Freshman,4,Great atmosphere. Professors are approachable and class sizes are small.
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletic side of Schreiner is pretty great.
College Freshman,4,"Security is always patrolling on campus, which gives the campus a more secure environment, however, near the apartments there is less security and more issues have arose there. However, crime seems to be very low, and I personally feel very safe on campus, except when near the apartments at night."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the housing is excellent, however I feel like the RAs do not always enforce the rules enough. Other then that and obnoxious upstairs neighbors, the dorm is very spacious and nice, with air conditioning and heating, and a very spacious bathroom and bedroom."
College Freshman,4,"From what I've seen so far of Greek life, those who participate in it have been nothing but kind and helpful to me. Of course, many have encouraged me to join a sorority, but also do not treat me or any others who are non-Greek any differently then they treat members in their sororities and fraternities."
College Junior,4,Schreiner has security that patrols the campus on a daily basis and has emergency telephones spread across the campus. I have never felt in danger and never even had to worry about anything going wrong on campus.
College Junior,4,"Being a smaller school we are not as recognized as some of the bigger universities. However, that being said Schreiner is growing and becoming more well known in the job world. The teachers also help a lot when you are looking for an internship or a job."
College Junior,4,"In the Business Department where I take a majority of classes, the courses are interesting and many of the teachers are very intriguing and friendly. All in all, the teaching staff is very highly thought of and most of the courses are useful if not interesting."
College Junior,4,"The athletic programs at Schreiner are not always the best ranked wise, but are still very important to the school and student population. It gives the school spirit and something to root for, we all have rivals and sports team often times attend other sports. Being such a small school, sports brings the community even closer together."
College Freshman,4,The Dorms are small but has a great community atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,"All of the faculty and staff are really polite and helpful and are more than happy to sit with you one-on-one to help you out. Schreiner offers great resources and plans to help you achieve what it is you're looking to accomplish. Before classes started, Freshman had to go through Mountaineer Bootcamp which was loads of fun and helped us create friends outside of the classroom and helping us to expand our comfort zones. The only complaint I would have as an introvert would be that everybody is recommending that you get involved in something, but that's not really a bad thing, now is it?"
College Sophomore,4,"I never knew that I would get to know the President of my University on such a personal basis. Within my first semester of college I saw him walking around campus more than ten times and sat with him in the cafeteria at least three or four times. Even during the freshman move in day, when everyone was so nervous, he was right there wearing a t-shirt and dress pants helping all of us get settled in and relieve some of the move in jitters. It's really amazing to be able to attend a University where the staff knows you by your name and not just a familiar face. Everyone is so friendly and makes my education matter."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small school with small classes, lots to do, much to learn."
Recent Alumnus,4,The buildings are very close to campus and the buildings in which you attend class and the freshman housing is a great thing that it is only freshman because it allows them to get to know other freshman.
College Freshman,4,I loved being able to be so close to all myfriends.
College Junior,4,"I was contacted for information I needed and once Schreiner received my information, I ws awarded my finanical packet. It was a very stress free experience"
College Sophomore,4,"Easiest way to manage the fixed food plan is to not pay to eat more than three times in one day. OR instead of eating in the diner eat at the other campus food options such as the cafe because there is another fixed coast for that dining area. The dining hall is friendly, has music, and great quick service. Menus are consistently changing so there isn't anything that gets boring. The value of the food is best during the week day, try to avoid the cafeteria on the weekend and eat at the cafe instead."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing process is easily and plenty of staff and students will assist if asked. The dorms are clean and friendly with great security. A key to the building is needed to enter and everyone knows each other in the building. The best option are that there is available student support and study partners. Every Tuesday we have dorm related activities such as painting door stops, making air fresheners, and playing ping pong or having a movie night. The worst has to be that the dorms can get very noisy but if you ask the resident assistant to quiet people then the noise ceases."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of businesses see a Schreiner Degree and take the time to look at the resume.  The Schreiner degree is definitely worth it, and lots of local businesses offer internships exclusively for Schreiner students."
College Freshman,4,"Many of the professors are profoundly interested in their students. They try to answer any questions as best as they can, can help with finding the answer when they don't know or aren't sure."
College Freshman,4,"Many policies are annoying, but they contribute to the safety of the school and are thorough for the benefit of all. Although they might seem over the edge, most students are not against them."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of support for the athletic teams, and email updates keep the campus up to date on games and players.  Although there are few who are fanatics of the team, they still have a positive aura thanks to strict coaches and role model citizen athletes."
College Sophomore,4,"While one's experience may vary depending on their chosen field of study, I have found Schreiner University to be quite good for Psychology and Pre-Law."
College Sophomore,4,"Schreiner University's faculty are always very kind and understanding. When a rule is violated, they have the common sense to determine whether or not any harm was done, and respond accordingly."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is very safe. The small size means everything is very close and people are always about. When something does happen, the university responds well and they are very transparent with their response."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience with the Schreiner University financial aid department has been great. They are very helpful, and got me most of the money I needed. The school is a little expensive so I've had to adjust a few things here and there with my financial aid, but overall it has gone smoothly."
College Freshman,4,Great involvement with the community
College Junior,4,The guys are mostly very friendly and nice. There a couple jerks in there. Most of the girls on campus are easy going and not many hard partiers. Not many people are stuck up at Schreiner.
College Junior,4,I think the diversity in a college can be a good thing or a bad thing. It's good because it helps a student decide who they want to be and who they don't want to be. This includes being a christian or being homosexual. I think it's important to have a foundation in your believes before you go to college so you don't divert from who you truly are. That statement leads me to why diversity in a college can be a bad thing. You may divert from the true person that you are when there is much diversity in the atmosphere.
Senior,2,"Schreiner lacks communication throughout the departments. They make unsuccessful change and are afraid to expand. This small town college allows you to make personal connections, however, these connections can become clique-ish and political. There is a lot of gossip at the school. Small class sizes can be a plus, however, this does not allow flexibility on attendance and hinders flexibility in class scheduling making it difficult to work and go to school. The school is good for personal networking and growing professionally within the community. Student involvement events are also few and far between and the campus is not very commuter friendly."
Niche User,2,Wanting the overall college feel while getting your education...this isn't the place. Very small school. You can get one on one time more depending on professors. I personally didn't enjoy my time there...felt worse than high school and definitely wasn't a challenging place that prepares you all aspects.
College Freshman,2,"After a month or two, most people run out of things to do in town off campus, so many travel to San Antonio or beyond to see new things.  However, by balancing on campus activities with off campus adventures, that helps with post-poning the itch"
College Freshman,2,"The teams don't perform as well as most schools, therefore not many student attend to show support."
College Senior,2,"As a Graphic Design major, things start off easy. Then, things get piled up and become extremely stressful and hectic. From internships, to the senior show each individual Graphic Design major has to plan, find a way to fund, and strenuously prepare for. I have asked several seniors, both friends and classmates, about this mandatory senior show. I have heard nothing but complaints about how difficult, stressful, strenuous, excessive, and annoying it is. The thesis paper that is 10-12 pages long, which I personally think is a Paper, not a thesis paper. The professors assembled to be the judges are extremely harsh in judging what the students want to create and display for this show. I don't remember when art was so structured. Maybe because its a test to see how structured each student is for the marketing/business world. I'm not certain and I certainly am NOT looking forward to my senior show due to the fact that there seems to be NO room for learning and its all crunch and no play. Art is work AND play. Or I'm just rambling to no one about nothing anybody cares about. This world is too structured and now the Art is getting chains put on it left and right...imprisonment in so many forms in so many ways.
Advisors are very helpful. There are a few advisors for every major so students can switch around if they clash too much."
College Sophomore,2,The local police department does sometimes get involved. It's pretty easy to get busted in our campus because it is so small. But also depending on who your RA is sometimes you can get away with a lot.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do in Kerrville itself but San Antonio is close enough to make it seem like there is. The school itself has a great atmosphere with lots of friendly people. The neighborhoods feel safe and it's easy to get to everything in town.
College Sophomore,2,"Not much to do in Kerrville unless you know people.  The school try's to have stuff to do, but not really interested in what they offer."
College Freshman,2,The diversity on campus is very little . There is a lot of white people a few Mexicans and fewer African Americans. There is not much at all. This is definitely and area where schreiner can improve.
College Freshman,2,"I feel that the on-campus life is held back by the fact of our dorms and rules. They are not incredibly terrible or unbearable but they are not ""home"" for many of the students who don't have a choice but to live on campus. Tuition is already high and the cost of living on campus just tacks right on to the total."
College Freshman,2,"Network Reliability and Speed – The speed and reliability of the internet at Schreiner University is very weak with major problems occuring weakly.  The network will sometimes crash for a hour or two and the speed is very slow.  Luckily the internet crashes usually occur in the middle of the day or on weekends, so they typically don't harm study time."
Alum,1,"The communication is terrible at the school. It is not commuter friendly at all. The class sizes are small, but if they are too small, they cancel the course, whether you need to graduate or not. I attended 4 different colleges my last semester so that I could graduate as scheduled. My professor missed half of his classes. I would not recommend this school to my worst enemy. I came here because it was a christian school, but it is far from it."
College Junior,1,"Schreiner University's policy regarding off-campus housing requires that students live on campus for at least 3 of the years they are in school. While I understand they are trying to maintain a sense of community, the real motivation is to collect as much as they can in terms of room and board expenses. Many students already suffer under burdensome debts and I would think the university would be more understanding of that and allow younger students to live off campus."
College Sophomore,1,The school is very strick on underage drinking and parties its almost impossible not toget caught and sent to j-board. Not a party school at all.
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation at Schreiner is perhaps the greatest downside to the school. There is none to speak of. The only transportation on campus is the shuttle used for the sports teams, and nothing else. There is no way to get to town unless you have a car. Walking and biking around campus is the only way to get to class if you don't have a car, but without sidewalks located around the roads by the dorm buildings, this is made fairly troublesome, especially considering how recklessly many of the students tend to drive."
College Freshman,1,"The policy is sooo strict, that you really don't feel like you are in college.
Even if you go off campus, and have a drink, you will get in trouble if you are caught coming back to campus.  Everything you do is a big deal!"
College Senior,1,"Super Harsh – Resident assistants and campus security come down hard on the students for noise complaints, and when there's alcohol involved it's even worse... especially if there are minors present."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life at Schreiner is like no other Greek life at any other school. They do not have fun, nor do they entice more students to join. Schreiner only offers 2 Sorrorities and 2 Fraternities and will not allow any new chapters to be formed. If you are a Greek at Schreiner, you will be made fun of because you probably woul not be a Greek at any other school."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Diverse – Schriner is comprised primarily of conservative white people. There are some hispanic minorities but very few black student. Most of the black students are student athletes. It appears as though the school primarily appeals to students from extremely small South Texas towns with similar views. The school is extremely small and the groups are clearly defined as they were in high school. The athletes are always with their team mates, homosexuals only hang out with each other and it appears as though for the most part, the races stay together. Schriener is not diverse at all."
College Junior,1,They hand out tickets like candy. Horrible parking officer procedures as well.

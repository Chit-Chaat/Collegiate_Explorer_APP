Niche User,5,I went to an overnight trip t Bryn Athyn College.It was a great experiences out of all the colleges that I toured this was the only one where I felt welcomed.They didnt make me feel uncomfortable in anyway.
Freshman,5,"Bryn Athyn is a great college to attend. It's a small campus but you feel welcomed there. With a small campus you get to interact with your professor more, and it would help with academics."
Freshman,5,I love my college. I recommend it to everyone. I am glad I decided to come here. I feel like the overall environment is great.
College Senior,5,"The History/Human Society department is populated largely by talented and dedicated professors. Students are also given the opportunity to anonymously review classes after every term, and the reviews are taken very seriously. On occasion professors have been fired because of them."
College Senior,5,"Nothing ever happens here. However in the event something does, the police and fire stations are across the street, and since nothing ever actually happens, they come very quickly."
College Senior,5,"I love Bryn Athyn; the people are great, the professors are knowledgeable, the dorms are spacious, and the campus is beautiful."
College Freshman,5,"As a member of the volleyball team, I love the atmosphere the school has for sports! Everyone comes out and supports each other's sports teams. Hockey is the biggest sport we have on campus...no one misses a game in our outdoor rink!"
College Junior,5,"No rules, no problems. Money is definitely a con, not only would you have to pay for rent, but you'd have to pay for food as well."
College Junior,5,"Students are encouraged to participate in sports, or to come out and support the teams. Mostly all of the professors come out to support the teams and always ask you about how it's going."
College Freshman,5,"Great Life Lessons – Not the best school to go to for academic reasons, however, I have learned a lot about life in general and am able to use my education here as a basis for transferring to another school."
Alum,4,"Small school, easy to get to know many people. Small class sizes allow for more personal connection with teachers and growing athletic opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"I like the close knit community aspect of the school. The classes as pretty small allowing for more one on one time with the professors. The professors are willing to help and do whatever they can to help you understand. However, the size of the school affects the amount of classes that are offered. There are some classes that i will have to take at a community college in order to be able to achieve my career goal. Some classes are only offered every other year, making it difficult to make sure you take all of the required classes. I like the fact that we do trimesters because it allows us to take more classes over the course of the year."
Junior,4,I like the small student to teacher ratio which allows students to develop relationships with their professors.  I also like that student size which gives students the opportunity to get to know each-other.
Freshman,4,I like the campus. Students and faculty are really nice. The professors want to see you succeed and help you in the best way possible
College Student,4,Bryn Athyn is a very small school with a lot of helpful advisers. I had little trouble transferring from my High school in Ohio to the campus life. Everyone seemed to be a little unique and different in their ow way but so am I. i am eagerly looking forward to the next years to come.
College Senior,4,"Its pretty spacious, even for Freshman, and we get the room fully furnished already. Also the dorms are relatively new, and new Freshman dorms are being built Summer 2016."
College Freshman,4,I find my workload both stimulating and manageable.
College Senior,4,The school is smaller than most and does have a religious spin that can be restricting for those that are not ready to change and adjust to their environment. That being said I have had the ability to experience academic activities that most schools could not offer in the way of internships and teachers. Everyone truly cares about you as a person here and is willing to take the time not only to know you but help you. As an athlete it has been great to be a part of a school trying to build something from scratch. In my time here I have seen drastic changes both academically and athletically that have made me very proud to call this school my own.
College Junior,4,"I really feel as if I made a great choice in my college decision.. My school is not as big as your average university but quite frankly I love the size of it. The student to teacher ratio allows us to have many one on one opprotunities with our professors which leads to achieving better results in school work and communication skills. I am grateful to be able to experience college athletics at its finest with my great coaching staff and a great group of girls to play with. I honestly wouldn't have it any other way. The staff are very open to talk to,  not just about school work but they have open arms even with our personal problems. Bryan Athyn is a home away from home and my experience falls nothing short of a great one. The students are just as open as the staff. It's just a happy place everyday and I enjoy being apart of the learning and growing community."
College Freshman,4,We met with the college and they took the time help my parents
College Junior,4,"Rules are rules: no boys, strict curfews. Cleanliness falls on your roommates as well as yourself. Stairs will be your worst nightmare when trying to do laundry. The perks: living on your own, cooking for yourself, social life is awesome, new friends."
College Junior,4,"Bryn Athyn College '15

The off-campus dining is pretty good. The town has a pizzeria, Chinese food restaurant, Dunkin Donuts, Olive Garden, McDonald's, and Dairy Queen. Also the next town over has a café that provides live music from local musicians."
College Junior,4,"Bryn Athyn College '15
The safety at the college is second to none. Security is always riding around campus and they are available 24 hours day. The college is in a small town and students are comfortable walking around at any time. As far as the night time is concerned, it gets extremely dark. There is not too much light around the neighborhood. Also, the college is a dry campus, therefore, students do not have to be concerned about that."
College Junior,4,"Bryn Athyn is an extremley safe place and a lot of the pepole are genuinley nice, I have very little worries here and its a very peaceful community."
College Sophomore,4,"Very few majors offered, classes are offered once a year or every other year so that you can't make up a class if it won't fit into your credit limit, and it puts you behind."
College Senior,4,"One of the most popular study areas is History. Since the Glencarin Museum is across the street, it gives a lot of the History Majors an opportunity to intern at the museum and is easy access. The teachers of the department are also well qualified and take the History Club to nearby locations."
College Senior,4,"Professors Are Very Helpful. The Head of the Department you want to major in becomes your counselor once you declare your major. As you can imagine, this is extremely helpful. They help you pick the out the perfect classes, notify you of internships that you may be interested in, and are always available to offer assistance and guidance."
College Freshman,4,Need More Light – this is a very safe school but i would feel better if their where more lights because it get real dark out here
College Sophomore,2,"The school, against its better judgement has been expanding. It has recently acquired two basketball teams that brought in 'diversity'. The school has a handful of international students. For the most part the college attendees are the Bryn Athynites. There are large wealthy conservative caucasian families and people that have known each other their entire lives. Everyone is of the New Church. There is no such thing as being openly gay or lesbian on this campus."
College Sophomore,2,"BAC is scenic, that is the ONLY thing that it has going for itself. The area is very safe. But there is nothing but scenery, no activities, no attractions, no shopping or recreation. The locals are amazing, they are uncomfortably pleasant towards the students."
College Junior,2,"The location of the school pretty good. In the winter, it snows heavier than in the valley. Due the location of the school, the cold, icy weather does not effect classes that much. For instance, the dormitories are close in proximity of where classes are held and most of the professor are from the area. If anything, a class or two would be starting a little late because of the high volume of traffic, due to bad weather, on an account of professor."
College Sophomore,2,"The ones that are offered, are smell local internships. Things like working at the local high school or theater, nothing to intense."
College Senior,2,"Hard to Find – Off- Campus Housing that is nearby is very hard to find. There are some apartments but they are very costly. Luckily, it doesn't cost that much to live on-campus."
College Junior,1,We don't have Greeks at my campus.
College Sophomore,1,"We are D3 where it matters. Our school is small so almost no support. We have a great hockey team. 

All other sports are noteworthy."
College Sophomore,1,"THERE IS NO NIGHT LIFE! If you want fun, you need a car to get as far away from BAC as possible. BAC does not know what parties sound, taste or look like. There is no greek life whatsoever and the administration wouldn't allow it. There are two bars near by they are either dead and/or filled with the faculty from the college. There is no such thing as underage nightlife especially because of the whole curfew thing. And there is one bus that is of no help that stops running at 11pm. On a brighter note...Its a wonderful place to learn."

Niche User,5,"GREAT school. You get to choose your own field of study-- which I am ecstatic about. Each term, you get to choose three classes that you are interested in! Each terms lasts 10 weeks. Also, the community is absolutely beautiful. The nature and view will take your breath away! Everything here is all about saving the Earth. No trash can on campus. Solar-powered energy everywhere. Plus you get three home-made meals a day made from our very own farm!"
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at College of the Atlantic. The school attracts very passionate students that are continuously inspired and challenged by a wonderful assortment of professors. Independently motivated students thrive here, but introverted personalities do not always succeed in the college's many discussion-based courses, and the college could offer more support in those situations."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"College of the Atlantic is a revolutionary school with a new approach to education. There's a greater focus on what moves you and how you can integrate your interests. It's Interdisciplinary in Interconnectedness, providing students with a chance to interpret the world around them as they please. Humans, and their developments on the landscape and on the creatures of biology, have become an unstoppable force. This force could use an ecological perspective to acknowledge the Interconnectedness of all happenings and humanly choices."
College Junior,5,We live on Mount Desert Island and our backyard is Acadia National Park
College Junior,5,All you have to do is tell buildings and grounds you have a car and they give you a sticker. Everyone is allowed to have a car on campus and commuters have plenty of spaces to park. There are no fees or tickets or costs for having a car on campus. Most people get along fine with just bicycles.
College Junior,5,"Our professors work with you with a teacher to student ratio of 1:11 you can spend so much time working one on one. They are all very accessible too, either through office hours or via email. "
College Junior,5,1 Major. Human Ecology. It includes all of the classes with no general education requirements and it is designed completely by you and your future goals. 
College Junior,5,"There are 5 computer labs on campus and there is always an open computer even during the busiest of school times. There are also very up to date technology all over campus. Our network reliability is wonderful and our IT staff is so nice and will help you with problems very quickly. There is also a network available in every building and dorm on campus, but also all over campus so outside on the lawn and on the pier. The speed is awesome and I was always able to stream movies without too much buffering. Printing is free on campus, so you do not want to bring a printer. "
College Junior,5,"Like I said above, we all have the same major but choose our own focus areas and topics that we want to study. The workload is three classes per trimester, but it is just as heavy as a 5 or 6 class semester. It is packed into 3 ten-week terms and it moves fast, but only having three courses offers you more time to spend on each class and really get a deeper, broader learning experience every class. You can choose any internship that works for you and we have a wonderful list of internships students have done in the past. We also have one dedicated faculty member who will help you find the perfect internship for you. "
College Junior,5,"There is only one major. There is no competition of getting into specific areas because you get to choose each and every single one of your classes and your focus area can be one of a kind. There may never have been a student to take the exact same path that you chose and that's awesome! When applying we love to see who you are and get a great sense of how you will fit in here. If you can let us know why you want to be here and give us an interesting story or some personal work to get to know you. We also do not require ACT/SAT test scores, so if your worried that is why you won't get in, choose not to share them."
College Junior,5,"You get to live in a beautiful new England home as a freshman. Our new dorms are all sustainable and run off of a boiler system and boast composting toilets. The other homes are older, but beautiful and each carry their own unique feel. The social atmosphere is so nice because everyone is so close to each other and can interact at all the activities, but still find time to be to themselves if they need it. "
College Junior,5,"We have two of our very own farms where we grow fresh organic vegetables and just starting growing livestock. We are now able to have all of that in our meal plans. We are ranked among the top 10 for best vegan and vegetarian schools and we offer great quality, home-cooked meals that everyone can enjoy. "
College Junior,5,This is exactly where I an supposed to be. I am a transfer student and I wish I could have found this when I first looked at schools so that I could spend another year here. 
College Junior,5,We don't have a greek life. Now everyone can meet and make friends within all sorts of areas and types of people and there is a much greater sense of community. 
College Junior,5,"super delicious, lots of vegetables from our school farm. They cater to all dietary needs and preferences, with vegan, veggie and omnivore options at every meal. We also have a cafe with some of the best smoothies (meal card works at the cafe as well)"
College Junior,5,"The seasons are beautiful.  In the fall and spring we have a national park to explore by bike or foot and in the winter (if you enjoy the winter) you can snow shoe, sled, cross country ski, skate on frozen lakes (or just fall on your face, but still fun).  When it is cold, dorms and housing are within close walking distance to classes/dining hall/library."
College Junior,5,There is no Greek life.  This leaves space for people to form communities of friends who support one another in a healthy way.  There is no pressure to join into a frat or sorority in order to feel wanted or just to fit-in.
College Junior,5,College of the Atlantic was rated most vegan friendly college. The food is versatile and mostly organic. The vegetables are mostly delivered from the school-owned farm.
College Junior,5,17% at College of the Atlantic are international students. Most of them have graduated from one of the United World Colleges.
Sophomore,4,This is an excellent institution for driven students who are seeking to forge there own path. Communication and self advocacy is very important to do well and utilize all the resources at your disposal.
Sophomore,4,"There is a huge group of International students from all over the world that makes this place special. In this regard the school is the most diverse place I have every been and I am from California. Is it domestically diverse? yes, but it sometimes doesn't feel like since the overall population is small."
Senior,4,I love this school.  I am proud to be a student at a school that seeks to break the norm and challenge their students.  Independence in seeking knowledge is a huge aspect of this school as well as in class discussions.. both of which may come as a shock to new students.
Senior,4,"Wonderful location, accessible professors, fascinating classes! This school might be tiny, but it is extraordinary. Professors take time to build working relationships with students and foster individual passion and learning. The unique curriculum lends itself to those who love learning and are interested in constantly challenging themselves to grow both intellectually and emotionally."
Sophomore,4,"if you want the quintessential ""college experience"", then COA is not for you. It is a very unique, strange, and wonderful place."
College Junior,4,"The professors are great. There are a variety of unique courses, and I feel like I have many options. The overall experience would be better if it wasn't forcing me into debt and putting a large strain on my own, and my mother's finances."
College Junior,4,"There is one major: Human Ecology. You can do whatever you want with it-- meaning, you control your prospects. The major and the school is becoming more and more recognized and understood."
College Sophomore,4,"COA is a fantastic school. That being said, it's not for everyone and it might not be for you. If you're looking to major in Chemical Engineering, go to grad school, etc., it's not for you. If you want a rigid education focused on one subject, COA is not right for you. COA is interdisciplinary. If you've looked into the college at all, you've undoubtedly heard this. If you're really interested in biology but also journalism, or math but also art, or climate politics and theatre, this is for you. You shape your own education by picking classes that make sense for your specific route.

Above all, I have to say the professors is what makes the school shine. They're not there for the pay. They're there for the students. All students have an advisor with whom they regularly meet, an advisor who will provide advice, help, and bend over backwards to make sure the student has the opportunities they desire. And of course, they're knowledgeable in their subjects. Classes rarely have more than 20 students each and professors are as a result super attentive to students. Lots of one-on-one time.

We're a weird school. We're so far left that we can sometimes be intolerant. We're super small, we have a very abnormal (yet wonderful) culture, but it's all worth it if you want an interdisciplinary education with a focus on community. Financial Aid is really quite good, especially considering the size and cost. If you're unsure, at least pay the campus a visit.

In a world where more and more colleges appear to be becoming businesses focused on profit, COA is a clear exception. Students, faculty and staff are the ones that make policies. The school cares deeply about its students. If you want a clear-cut, specific-major education, a state school will suit you just fine (and be much more affordable.) If you're looking something more alternative, COA might be a good option for you—check out its website and message some students—we're happy to talk."
College Junior,4,The night bus runs every day from 6pm to 12am and stops at all the local spots. It takes students home and to the grocery store. During the winter term it runs every morning 8am to 11am picking up students to bring them to class. 
College Junior,4,"There a ton of places to eat. You can bet there is seafood served up everywhere and there is a local vegan/vegetarian restaurant. There is Chinese, Mexican, American, seafood, Thai, Japanese, and Mediterranean. "
College Junior,4,"We have a pretty diverse range of students, with 17% of our students from international countries. "
College Junior,4,"never crowded, computers always available.  Printer and scanner available as well. Both mac and PC friendly. The only problem I have is that I always forget my login name and password to get onto the lab computers."
College Junior,4,"College of the Atlantic is fairly unique in having only a single major. However, the very nature of this major is  vast and interdisciplinary.This allows students to essentially build their own major, pursuing and combining their interest. This single major incorporates biology, art, psychology, history, music, earth sciences, ecology, theater, photography, gender studies, humanities, environmental policy and nearly any other possible field. This allows students to not only follow their interests but also approach challenges from multiple angles. There is a strong environmental aspect to this major and the vast majority of students combine their passions with this philosophy."
College Junior,4,"I have participated in a research opportunity on Great Duck Island, typically used by students as an internship, with College of the Atlantic. This opportunity to assist in seabird research and conduct my own was a challenging, stimulating and valuable experience. The guidance and help received challenged me to discover ways to overcome any difficulties, yet encouraged critical and creative thinking. It was a fantastic chance to participate in research and a great introduction to performing my own research."
College Senior,4,Public transport in the US is s***. Bar Harbor is too small to require COA to provide
College Sophomore,4,"During the tourist season there's a large variety of different restaurants that range in cost, and even during the off-season there are cheap places near campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,College of the Atlantic is a drug-free campus. Campus housing is divided into substance/substance-free. Substance housing refers to students being allowed to store alcohol in their rooms (if older than 21). There is no pressure to partake in any activities.
College Senior,4,"After taking a class in design, you have completely access to the graphics lab. You can use the lab 24/7. There are Macs with huge screens and all of them have the Adobe Creative Suite and FinalCut. There are also huge printers for printing posters up to 44 inches wide."
College Senior,4,"At COA, you get to design your own curriculum. Everyone majors in Human Ecology but you are in charge of deciding what classes you want to take. Additionally, your internship and senior project allow you to focus on a particular area and give you work and life experience to prepare you for the next step after COA."
College Senior,4,"Students have the option to live in a larger dorm or in a small house. People get to know each other really well and there is a great on-campus community. Every Sunday night Community Dinners happen in houses on-campus for residents to cook together, talk over issues and for RA's and residents to get to know each other."
College Junior,4,"COA has one major, which is Human Ecology.  You can combine all of your interests or focus on something specific.  You don't have to worry about changing your major as your interests evolve. 
The only downside is that it is hard to explain to people what Human Ecology is."
College Junior,4,"Classes are small and the professors are amazing.  There aren't too many required classes, so there is plenty of room for exploring your interests.  Because COA is a small school, not all classes are offered every year, and sometimes the options feel limited.  But there is always the option of doing an independent study in a subject of your choosing."
College Freshman,4,We have a night bus that comes to the school and can drop you off at various places in town. They give you their number through email so you can contact them.
College Freshman,4,I have a really great financial aid package and I received a lot of help and support in the process.
College Freshman,4,"The food at COA is amazing. Our cafeteria, Take-A-Break (or TAB for short), serves really delicious, wholesome food. A lot of our produce comes from the local farms that students manage. TAB also takes good care of people with special dietary needs including vegetarians, vegans and gluten-free. Alternatively, you can go to Sea Urchin cafe for smoothies and sandwiches for lunch. The full meal plan is a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth it, at least for your first year."
College Freshman,4,The college is situated between the Atlantic Ocean and Acadia National Park. There's lots to do in any weather!
College Sophomore,4,Very Helpful – The financial aid office is always easy to get in contact with. They have guided my family through many confusing steps in the financial aid process.
College Senior,4,"Cold in the Winter – As expected, it's pretty cold in the winter and it occasionally snows quite a bit, but I think that the bad weather creates a closer sense of community. Sometimes classes are cancelled but since you don't need to drive far, it doesn't really inhibit daily activities (walking on the paths in big drifts in the freezing wind is quite an experience, though). Fall and Spring are really beautiful although it gets cold quickly towards the end of September. Once May comes everyone is outside all the time and things start turning green. It's Maine, it's going to be cold."
College Senior,4,"Quite Safe – It feels safe here. Although since this community functions through trust, it works 95% of the time as most people will pick up earrings and lost cellphones to return them. Laptops will be lying around for hours and people won't worry. 

Seafox is a dorm which is a tourist attraction, so there are outsiders coming in during the tourist season. So we had to keep doors locked then so stuff wouldn't get stolen. Otherwise I would say most people trust each other here. 

But since people trust this place too much, it sucks when someone takes advantage of our trusting community."
College Senior,4,"Most classes are small, but they are starting to increase in number. There's also less and less space around campus to fit more class time into the schedule. So evening classes are more common now than in my first year. 

That being said, I've had a few amazing classes with a few professors. Dave Feldman's classes are the best in that he has a very clear syllabus, lots of in class time for questions and practice problems. Also he usually picks great TAs to help out after class. He also devotes a few hours for Homework Help sessions either in TAB or Deering. He will hover around as people do the homework and will make himself available when you're ready to ask questions.

I always felt that he put in way more time than any other professor I've had here. It's important here, since we have 10 short weeks to learn everything we can."
College Sophomore,4,"There are students, faculty, and staff of all cultural, economic, religious backgrounds and sexual orientations. There is nearly no diversity in political beliefs, but the community is very accepting of the conservative minority."
College Sophomore,4,"I was very confused by the whole process, but COA's financial aid office helped me through every detail. They got to know me and my mom on a first name basis and helped us immensely. I received a very good amount of financial aid, and I wouldn't have been able to do it without the personal help from the office."
College Senior,4,"Acadia National Park – Acadia National Park has a huge presence here on Mount Desert Island, and the trails, flora and fauna are amazing. Field classes will get you out and about in the park and exploring this beautiful island, and there is much to discover! The farms, harbors, coastline, and offshore islands are incredibly amazing. Tourists and cruise-liners in the summer can be frustrating, but most of the school year it's just the locals."
Recent Alumnus,4,"A True Melting Pot – COA is extremely diverse. Not only is there an extremely large international group, there is also a large LGBT community. This is saying something, considering that COA is such a small school. I have friends from all over the world and a spectrum of different backgrounds and lifestyles."
College Freshman,4,"Interdisciplinary - Human Ecology – Professors teach here because they love it, the pay is nothing special, but the opportunities and freedoms are.  Small class sizes, very limited structure and a generally flexible campus allow for a totally customized and self-generated academic experience."
College Freshman,4,"A Unique Learning Environment – COA is a very unique place, not always as ""alternative"" and interdisciplinary as I would wish, but none-the-less a really unique learning experience.  I can't sum it up in this little box, go see for yourself!"
College Freshman,4,"A Trusting Community – COA has a very lax security, and for good reason because risk of safety and theft are very limited.  We do have two night watchmen who are great, we do have a couple of part-time nurses who are also wonderful.  We have a community bike program that is based very heavily on trust and very few people lock their doors, cars, bikes, etc."
College Sophomore,4,A Welcoming Community – COA and Bar Harbor are incredibly welcoming. There are people from a variety of social backgrounds and the locals are eager to get involved with campus activities.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Lots of snow in the winter, but the days are always sunny and gorgeous"
Recent Alumnus,4,Since Bar Harbor is a tourist town that goes dead during the winter there is cheap and very good food available year-round. Great restaurants with organic and healthy (and tasty!) food.
College Junior,2,Athletics are not institutionalized here. There are community sports games.
College Senior,2,It's pretty hard to find off campus housing.
College Senior,2,"Bar Harbor is a tourist town, which means you can't afford to eat here."
College Senior,2,"Feeling Stuck. Public buses are for the tourist season. When the season ends, they stop running. It becomes more difficult to get off the island without a car, or a friend without a car. Biking/walking will get you into town and some nearby locations. 

In winter there is  a day bus which picks up students from the street and it works if you have a cell phone (I don't). 

It was quite difficult to get off the island sometimes as there's a lack of local transportation for most of the year. Nearest bus station to Portland/Boston is from Bangor. Bangor's about an hour away."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It Happens – COA has a pretty prevalent drug and alcohol scene. You can often go down to the dock and find people drinking or smoking, and you're guaranteed to find someone smoking in the bike shed. It's often overlooked by the administrations/authorities, until it becomes out of control or an issue."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lacking Where It Counts – COA just built a new student life building, but it's useless except for eating at the cafe or doing homework. There aren't any real activity spots. There is no gym -- you have to walk or drive to the nearest Y. The science labs are extremely outdated, and the library is extremely small, though the people there are willing to get you whatever you need through ILL. COA's one saving grace is the writing center -- an awesome resource for people who need helping at any point in the writing process."
College Junior,2,"What a Dumb Question – If cracking open a pabst blue ribbon in your buddy's dorm room, hot-boxing your mom's hand-me-down car, or attending the occasional low-key get together, then sure, I'd say there is a night life. Don't come to Bar Harbor anticipating a raging club scene, though..."
Alum,1,Terrible. This place is awful. Never setting foot on campus again. They screwed me over. I have no desire to tell anyone that I went there.
Niche User,1,"The community is cold and it genuinely seems like everyone has the same mindset. There are little to no engaging activities/clubs on campus, and drugs and alcohol are everywhere (while this happens at all colleges, it happens to an extreme at COA). However, the most important aspect of any college is the academics; this is why you are going to college in the first place. At COA, you are only allowed to take three classes per semester (you usually have to take at least five to be considered full time elsewhere). The classes are rather dry and not very rigorous or informative. It seems as if mediocrity is encouraged as opposed to encouraging and fostering brilliance. When you try to transfer out (as many do), you'll find that barely any of your credits will transfer over or count at other schools. If you graduate from COA, a ""human ecology"" degree will give you great difficulty when you're trying to get a job - and you will be unprepared due to the lack of information given to you."
College Senior,1,there are no athletics depts
College Senior,1,"The internship/career service department is run by one woman steeped in the value of bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake. Most graduates who want to pursue a higher degree in a science field find they need to augment their COA education with more classes elsewhere. Whatever an admissions officer tells you, trying to attend medical or veterinary school, or a STEM field graduate program after COA is not what the program is designed for. Whether it's in your first year of course work in grad school or you take a year off, you will need to take Chemistry and Physics somewhere else."
College Junior,1,We do not have any sports teams. We do have a running club. 
College Freshman,1,"The food at this school is great if you  are a vegan. I cannot eat soy or large amounts of sugar, so eating here is detrimental to my health. There are very few simple meat options. When they do serve meat it is highly seasoned. Also, I have no idea what the seasoning are or what the food is cooked in as it isn't clearly labeled. There are very few options as it is a tiny school. I.E. there is a choice between vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and sometimes a meat option."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Expect Some Serious Loans – COA has only one person in charge of the whole financial aid process. That being said, you pretty much have to suck up to him or hope your parents are super kind. You often find ""just because"" charges of a couple thousand dollars on your bill, and they're extremely hard to work with to fix it."
